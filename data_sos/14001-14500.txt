   sustainable soil and water management
SO MOUNTAIN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB Many types of problems caused by land degradation can be documented worldwide. The main natural resources affected are soils, water, natural vegetation, and wildlife; but cultivated plants are exposed to even greater damage, which poses a threat to food security as well. Soil degradation is one of the most crucial processes of land degradation and environmental change. Over a quarter of the world's agricultural land has been damaged by long-term soil degradation, corresponding to one-tenth of the earth's land surface. As is well known, mountain areas are especially vulnerable to land degradation (Figure 1). Because mountains are also water towers, providing water not only for highland areas but also for the surrounding lowlands, land degradation in the mountains has serious impacts on the global supply of freshwater and on growing water-related conflicts.
   At the same time, there have been many achievements in sustainable land use and in avoiding and combating degradation (Figure 2). Every day land users and soil and water conservation (SWC) specialists evaluate experience and generate know-how related to land management, improvement of soil fertility, and protection of soil resources. Most of this valuable knowledge, however, is not well documented or easily accessible, and comparison of different types of experience is difficult. The World Overview of Conservation Approaches and Technologies (WOCAT) has the mission of providing tools that allow SWC specialists to share their valuable knowledge in soil and water management, assist them in their search for appropriate SWC technologies and approaches, and support them in making decisions in the field and at the planning level.

TI Economic and social revival of a degraded region in Serbia - The result
   of a cooperative venture
SO MOUNTAIN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB Approximately 70% of Serb a consists of rolling, hilly and mountainous regions that are prone to erosion. Other natural factors, such as an unstable geological basis, intense rainfall, and poor vegetation cover also contribute to this predisposition to erosion. But the principal factor in accelerated erosion is human activity. The period up to the mid1950s was characterized by great agrarian pressures and the resulting accelerated erosion. This was followed by rural depopulation and changes in the structure of agricultural production. As younger household members migrated, arable fields were left uncultivated, were invaded by weeds, and were then converted into pastures. Out-migration thus led to reduced pressure on the land, which contributed to diminishing erosion.
   But this cannot be called development. The revival of degraded regions should be based on people remaining in the area and being able to have decent livelihoods. Sustainable land use can make this possible, as illustrated by the example of the cooperative venture involving the Porecje Company and local farmers in the Porecje region. This venture involves cooperation between farmers and the company, reducing erosion by establishing terraces on steep slopes, improving soil characteristics, and promoting profitable fruit production. Land resources and environmental values are thus preserved without jeopardizing the profitability necessary to keep people in the region.

DT Article
DE community forestry; capital formation; Nepal; sustainable development;
   cluster analysis
AB This article investigates the role of capital formation in contributing to the sustainability of community forestry in Nepal, using a case study approach based on 23 forest user groups (FUGs). FUGs were classified in 3 categories on the basis of cluster analysis: (1) successful, (2) moderately successful, and (3) unsuccessful clusters. The results show that the elements of capital accumulation In a successful FUG were manageable mature forest, high prices for forest products, a system of charging for all forest products, and sales of surplus forest products outside the FUG. The results also suggest that the benefits of funds, community development, and forest improvement changed people's vision and behavior, as well as their attitude toward and understanding of community forestry. This change in attitude has increased interest in and awareness of community forestry and has stimulated thinking about the sustainability of community forestry. Local initiative of this sort makes community forests more secure, protected, and wisely managed for sustainable development.

TI Population dynamics of the porbeagle in the northwest Atlantic Ocean
SO NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
ID DEMOGRAPHIC-ANALYSIS; SHARKS; MANAGEMENT; FISH
AB A virgin population of porbeagles Lamna nasus in the northwest Atlantic Ocean supported annual catches of up to 9,000 metric tons (mt) in the early 1960s before the fishery collapsed in 1967. Low and apparently sustainable catches of about 350 nit in the 1970s and 1980s allowed the stock to partially rebuild before it new fishery arose in the early 1990s, The response of the population to this renewed fishing pressure has been unclear until now. However, a new population dynamics analysis suggests that Population abundance has once again declined. On the basis of more than 140.000 length measurements, an extensive catch rate index, a confirmed growth model, and a catch-at-age matrix, it appears that at least 90% of the sexually mature population has been lost as fishing mortality has increased. Independent measures of fishing mortality (F) based on Petersen analysis of tag-recaptures. Paloheimo Zs, and a population model ill suggest that fishing mortality was about 0.20 in 2000. Biological reference points based oil life table analysis indicate that fishing at F-0.1 = 0.18 will result ill population collapse, that F = 0.08 corresponds to zero population growth, and that fishing mortality at maximum sustainable yield is about 0.04. Porbeagles have a low pup production rate and mature Considerably after the age at which they first appear in the fishery. In light of the very low numbers of Mature females now found in the population, it is unlikely that even the strict quota management now in Place Will allow the population to rebuild quickly. However, the shark fishing industry has actively Supported scientific research and conservation practices in recent years, suggesting that long-term sustain-ability may still be possible.

TI F-35% revisited ten years later
SO NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
ID THRESHOLDS; MANAGEMENT; PACIFIC
AB This paper reviews the original derivation of the F-35% (later F-40%) harvest strategy, which consists of fishing at a rate that reduces spawning biomass per recruit to 35% (or 40%) of the unfished value, and investigates its applicability to long-lived stocks with low resiliency, such as some of the Pacific Coast rockfishes Sebastes spp. The life history parameters are unimportant (at least in deterministic calculations), but the possibility of extremely low levels of resiliency-well below the bounds of the original analysis-does render the strategy unworkable in the sense that there is no harvest rate that will obtain a large fraction of the maximum sustainable yield (MSY) across the entire range of possibilities. At low but still workable levels of resiliency, the F-40% strategy results in undesirably low levels of biomass and recruitment by present-day standards. That can be cured by adopting a higher target for spawning biomass per recruit, though at some cost in yield. A purely biomass-based strategy and a modified F-MSY strategy are discussed as alternatives for cases where adequate historical data are available.

TI Use of known-biomass production models to determine productivity of West
   Coast groundfish stocks
SO NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
ID SURPLUS-PRODUCTION; FISHING MORTALITY; RATES
AB Known-biomass production models use a biomass time series produced by a stock assessment and thereby avoid the imprecision associated with estimating a catchability coefficient. Fluctuations or trends in known biomass are fully as informative as catch (which is used in conventional production models) in estimating stock productivity. Known-biomass production models provide a useful supplement to stock-recruitment models and can serve as a cross-check on the sensibility of stock-recruitment model results. Application of known-biomass production models (ASPIC) to eight stocks of West Coast groundfish shows that current abundances (B) are moderately to seriously below those associated with the maximum sustainable yield (MW B is less than B-msY in six of eight cases and less than one-half of B-msY in four of those cases). Recent exploitation rates are lower than those in earlier years and in most cases are now near their appropriate levels, including the rates for stocks that are rebuilding. Harvest policies during the 1990s, which specified fishing mortality rates corresponding to spawning potential ratios of 35% and 40% (i.e., F-35% and F-40%), were too aggressive for most stocks of West Coast groundfish.

TI Advice on West Coast rockfish harvest rates from Bayesian meta-analysis
   of stock-recruit relationships
SO NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
ID LIFE-HISTORY; MANAGEMENT; VARIABILITY; SIMULATION; MODEL; FISH
AB Over the past two decades, populations of rockfish Sebastes spp. off the U.S. West Coast have declined sharply, leading to heightened concern about the sustainability of current harvest policies for these populations. In this paper, I develop a hierarchical Bayesian model to jointly estimate the stock-recruit relationships of rockfish stocks in the northeastern Pacific Ocean. Stock-recruit curves for individual stocks are linked using a prior distribution for the "steepness" parameter of the Beverton-Holt stock-recruit curve, defined as the expected recruitment at 20% of unfished biomass relative to unfished recruitment. The choice of a spawning biomass per recruit (SPR) harvest rate is considered a problem in decision theory, in which different options are evaluated in the presence of uncertainty in the stock-recruit relationship. Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling is used to obtain the marginal distributions of variables of interest to management. such as the yield at a given SPR rate. A wide range of expected yield curves were obtained for different rockfish stocks. The stocks of Pacific ocean perch S. alutus in the Gulf of Alaska and the Aleutian Islands are apparently the most resilient. with maximum sustainable yield (MSY) harvest rates greater than F-30% (the fishing mortality rate that reduces SPR to 30% of its unfished value) for all model configurations. In contrast, the MSY harvest rate for the West Coast stock of Pacific ocean perch was lower than F-70%. The SPR rates at MSY for other stocks were clustered between F-40% and F-60% and depended on both the stock-recruit model (Beverton-Holt or Ricker) and the model for recruitment variability (lognormal or gamma). Meta-analysis results should be interpreted cautiously due to autocorrelation in the model residuals for several stocks and the potential confounding effect of decadal variation in ecosystem productivity. An F-40%, harvest rate, the current default harvest rate for rockfish, exceeded the estimated F-MSY, rate for all West Coast rockfish stocks with the exception of black rockfish S. melanops. A harvest rate of, F-50%, is suggested as a risk-neutral F-MSY proxy for rockfish. A more risk-averse alternative would be to apply an SPR harvest rate in the F-55%-F-60% range.

SO NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT

ID FISH STOCKS; RECRUITMENT
AB The estimated stock size and recruitment data from assessment models provide a way to evaluate the history of a fishery relative to the expected response given a target fishing mortality rate. For example, if recruitment estimates are below the fishing mortality replacement line, then further reductions in spawning biomass can be expected. However, recruitment variability. serial correlation, and variable historical harvest rates can create misleading perceptions of sustainable harvest rates when they are derived from these simple replacement-line curves. Careful analysis of the stock-recruitment relationship given the available data is required in order to evaluate stock productivity in age-structured modeling. In this study, simulation-estimation procedures were developed to evaluate stock productivity estimates given the level of information and historical fishing mortality currently reported for the Pacific ocean perch Sebastes alutus stock off the coast of Washington, Oregon, and California. Two scenarios were designed with significantly different optimum yield calculations, one with moderate productivity and one with relatively low productivity. Within each productivity scenario, two types of simulations were performed, one with recruitment values identical to the original estimates (the observation-error-only case) and one with recruitment varying about the stock-recruitment curve (the observation-and-process-error case). For each of the two scenarios and two cases, 100 simulated stock assessment data sets were generated. Each was then analyzed using the stock assessment model used in 1998. The results suggest that if the actual stock-recruitnient productivity of this stock is low, the assessment model estimates will have a slight positive bias (estimated productivity will be higher than actual productivity). Conversely, if the actual stock-recruitment productivity is moderate, estimates are likely to have a negative bias given the observed sequence of recruitments and fishing mortality history. Including time series effects (simple autocorrelation) is shown to be a reasonable step toward remedying this problem.

TI The effects of unaccounted discards and misspecified natural mortality
   on harvest policies based on estimates of spawners per recruit
SO NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
ID MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES; FISHERIES; YIELD; MODEL; FISH
AB The amount of exploitation in a fishery is typically controlled by regulatory harvest policies, of which the best for maximizing total yield is F(MSY), the fishing rate that provides the maximum sustainable yield. However, estimation of F(MSY) can be difficult for many fisheries, and for this reason proxies such as the spawning-biomass-per-recruit rate (often denoted F(%)) have been adopted for some fisheries. Around 1992, the Pacific Fishery Management Council adopted an F(35%) harvest policy for U.S. West Coast groundfish. Recently, this policy has been questioned, along with the overall productivity of West Coast groundfish. Estimates of appropriate harvest rates and productivity are computed from stock assessment models, which often rely on poorly estimated values for natural mortality and at-sea discard levels. The effects of unaccounted discards and misspecified natural mortality on estimates of appropriate harvest rates were investigated using a basic catch-age model. A deterministic, generalized groundfish population was simulated using an average fishing mortality time series computed for 11 major West Coast groundfish species. The model results indicated that unaccounted, non-size-selective discards had no effect on subsequent harvest rate estimates, while unaccounted, size-selective discards of fish ranging up to 50% by weight resulted in a 30-40%, higher F(%) in some cases. The largest changes in harvest policy resulted from lower spawner-recruit steepness parameters, younger ages of selection, and positively biased natural mortality values.

AB Surplus-production calculations can be made in my stock assessment model that includes catch data and that estimates biomass. Maximum sustainable yield (MSY) reference points can also be estimated if there are sufficient data. The "external" method estimates production model parameters after the assessment model is fitted. External Calculations are simple and useful, we recommend that they be done routinely. The "internal" method fits a more complicated assessment model and a surplus- production model simultaneously, It includes the external and "all-measurement-error" modeling methods (e.g.. ASPIC) as, special cases. External MSY estimates for Atlantic surfclam Spisula solidissinia off northern New Jersey, cowcod Sebastes levis in the Southern California bight, and yellowtail flounder Pleuronectes ferrrugineus on Georges Bank and internal MSY estimates for northern Atlantic surfclam were similar to conventional estimates. Surplus-production calculations and both internal and external modeling approaches are useful for summarizing assessment results in terms of surplus production. which is important to managers, and in identifying plausible modeling scenarios. Internal Suplus-production Calculations [nay be most useful when recruitment is highly variable or when there is substantial variability in growth. Unlike some surplus-production modeling techniques. the external and internal approaches use all of the available data (e.g., age and size composition data) to estimate stock status and MSY reference points. They avoid the problems that arise in relating fishing mortality and biomass, estimates from one model to reference point calculations from a second. The internal and external methods are examples of Fournier and Warburton's composite approach. which attempts to balance the complimentary strengths and weaknesses of simple and complex models.

TI Occupational health teaching for pre registration nursing students
SO NURSE EDUCATION TODAY
LA English
DT Article
AB The amount of time spent teaching occupational health and the methods used to teach this subject in the pre registration nursing programmes in the UK was surveyed. Questionnaires were sent to the Deans of all 66 Schools of Nursing identified from the UCAS list in 2000. Forty six responded. Five returns were rejected because they did not meet the study criteria, giving a final response rate of 67%. The 41 schools were providing 33 Nursing Diploma and 31 Nursing Degree courses. The results indicate that occupational health is taught on the majority of Nursing Diploma (88%) and Degree (80%) courses. The main method of teaching is by lectures, with a smaller number of courses offering the opportunity for seminars and project work. However, the subjects covered under this heading frequently relate to the occupational health and safety issues that nurses need to know about in order to protect their own health and safety. It is rare that the broader concept of how a patient or client's health can be affected by their work or how their health may affect their ability to work, remain in employment or, for populations, its impact on sustainable development at the community level, are addressed. It is recommended that all nurses should receive some training in the broader concepts of occupational health at the pre registration level so that they can develop an awareness of the relationship between work and health, at both the individual and community level. This survey parallels a similar exercise carried out with medical students that identified a worrying decline in the teaching of occupational health at the undergraduate level.

ID DECOMPOSITION
AB Organic matter (OM) management is key to sustainable fertility and productivity of tropical soil systems. Short-term evaluation of the potentials of foliage of neem and locust bean in soil fertility improvement, as measured by the productivity of maize, was carried out on a savanna Alfisol from 1995 to 1997. The trees are indigenous to the savanna, and common in farms and homesteads in the region. The objective was to determine the effects of these easily renewable and cheap OM sources on maize response to applied inorganic fertilizer and soil chemical properties. Treatments consisted of three sources of organic matter: no-OM, neem and locust bean, and three rates of inorganic fertilizer, applied at 0, 1/4 and 1/2 of the recommended rate of 120-27-50 NPK for maize, which in addition served as check. Results obtained over the three seasons were consistent, and revealed that neem was superior to locust bean by a factor of 2 and also to no-OM treatments, but were all inferior to the recommended fertilizer rate (with a maximum yield of 3.75 t/ha). Isolated relative effects for neem and locust bean only in the third year were 138% and 86% respectively, and declined progressively with increasing levels of applied inorganic fertilizer. This trend was consistent for the three years, during which soil productivity (relativity index) clearly appreciated. Results also revealed that P and organic C accumulation was greater with locust bean, but neem decomposed faster and depressed pH less, a clear indication that indices of soil productivity may not always be tied to OM or absolute values of soil properties alone in savanna soil systems. The study also revealed that the effects of the tree foliages, the inorganic fertilizer rates and the interactions were significant at various levels of probability for grain, stover, plant height, available P, OM and pH. There was the possibility of better crop performance with combinations of OM and inorganic fertilizer levels for the soils. Integrated fertility management systems using 3 tons of neem foliage and 1/2 recommended inorganic fertilizer rate produced a good maize crop, and offers an economically viable option for the resource poor maize farmers of the Nigerian savanna.

ID STABILITY; PLASMAS
AB The stability of electrostatic drift waves in a closed field line configuration in collisionality regimes ranging from collisional to collisionless is compared. The maximum sustainable pressure gradient is found to be dependent on the ratio of the temperature and density gradients (eta=d ln T/d ln n). The eigenmodes are seen to be flute-like. The stability boundary was found to be similar when both ions and electrons are collisional, when they are collisionless, and for collisional electrons and collisionless ions. The largest stable pressure gradients are obtained for etagreater than or equal to2/3. As the collisionality is reduced one observes some reduction of the region of stability.

AB Soil fertility amendments, including composted cotton-gin trash, swine manure, a rye-vetch green manure, or synthetic fertilizers, were applied to subplots and tillage on bare soil; or tillage followed by surface mulch with wheat straw were applied to main plots to determine the effect on the incidence of southern blight caused by Sclerotium rolfsii, yield of processing tomato, and soil microbial communities. The amendment-tillage interaction was significant in 1997 and disease incidence was 67% in tilled bare soil receiving synthetic fertilizers; whereas disease incidence was 3, 12, and 16% in surface-mulched plots amended with a composted cotton-gin trash, swine manure, or a rye-vetch green manure. The amendment effect was significant in 1998, and disease incidence was 61% in plots receiving synthetic fertilizer and was 23, 44, and 53% in plots receiving cotton-gin trash, swine manure, or rye-vetch green manure, respectively. In 1997, yields were highest in tilled surface-mulched plots amended with synthetic fertilizers, cotton-gin trash, or swine manure, respectively. In 1998, yields were low in all plots and there were no significant differences in yield due to treatment. Propagule densities of antagonistic soil fungi in the genus Trichoderma were highest in soils amended with composted cotton-gin trash or swine manure in both years. Propagule densities of fluorescent pseudomonads in soil were higher in plots amended with organic amendments than with synthetic fertilizers in both years. Propagules densities of enteric bacteria were elevated in soils amended with raw swine manure biosolids in both years. Our research indicates that some organic amendments, such as cotton-gin trash, reduced the incidence of southern blight in processing tomato and also enhanced populations of beneficial soil microbes.

AB Aluminum (Al) is a major factor that limits plant growth in acid soils. It causes a cessation of root growth and changes in root morphology suggesting a role of the root cytoskeleton as a target of Al-toxicity. Here we report a rapid effect of Al on the microtubular cytoskeleton of the suspension tobacco cell lines BY-2 and VBI-0. Viability studies showed that the cells were more sensitive to Al during exponential phase as compared to stationary cells. During the first hours of exposure, Al induced the formation of additional bundles of cortical microtubules (cMTs), whereas the thickness of the individual bundles decreased. Prolonged exposure resulted in disorientation of cMTs. These changes of cMTs preceded the decrease of cell viability by several hours and were accompanied by an increase in the levels of a-tubulin (in its tyrosinated form) and elements of the tubulin-folding chaperone CCT. These findings suggest that the microtubular cytoskeleton is one of the early targets of Al toxicity.

TI A method using Sustainability indicators to compare conventional and

SO POULTRY SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
DE sustainable development; sustainability indicator; egg production
   system; comparison; method
AB The objective of this paper was to describe a method that enables a comparison of egg production systems for their contribution to sustainable development of egg production, using data from the Netherlands for demonstration purposes. One conventional system, the battery cage system, and two animal-friendly systems, the deep-litter and the aviary systems, illustrate this method. The method is based on a three-phase framework that identifies relevant issues regarding sustainable development (Phase 1), translates issues into sustainability indicators (Phase 2), and assesses the contribution of sustainability indicators to sustainable development (Phase 3). Phases I and 2 are based on analysis of literature and consultation with experts. Phase 3 is based on graphical and numerical comparisons. A graphical comparison presents the relative deviation between actual and target values for each sustainability indicator. A numerical comparison combines the relative deviation for each sustainability indicator into an overall contribution of an egg production system to sustainable development. Sustainability indicators selected include economic performance, ammonia emission, energy use, hen welfare, farmer welfare, and egg quality. Based on equal importance of these indicators, the battery cage system shows the least negative contribution to sustainable development. The aviary system is considered a better animal-friendly alternative for a battery cage system when compared with a deep-litter system. The aviary system especially needs to improve economic performance and farmer welfare. The conclusion can only be tentative, however, because methodological aspects such as selection and weighting of sustainability indicators will need careful attention and further research.

TI Challenges to the notion of publics in public relations: implications of
   the risk society for the discipline
SO PUBLIC RELATIONS REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
ID COMMUNICATION; MANAGEMENT; SENSE
AB The notion risk society offers a conceptual framework for understanding the emergence of new communicatively powerful publics. Focusing on the role of the public for the firm, this paper argues that the emergence of the powerful consumer and the critical public is not coincidental but a symptom of the emergence of the risk society. In looking at the consequences of the risk society at the individual, the institutional, and social political levels, the paper argues that new forms of political discourse are emerging which change the "ground rules" of the interaction between the firm and its publics. Linking the growing interest in identity with risk communication, the paper sheds light on the nature of the arenas in which these public operate and the consequences for business. It is argued that the emerging sub-political arena of direct action and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) has the capability of catapulting public relations into a central role in organisational sustainability.

AB It is controversial whether international trade enhances or degrades the global environment. In this model,enviromental quality, as measured by biodiversity, is damaged by the consequences of trade, which include the commercialization of natural habitat, pollution and bioinvasion. However, there are also benefits of trade. When both countries internalize the external costs of production and trade, measures of environmental quality may be higher or lower as a consequence of trade, but there is always, unambiguously, less trade the more environmentally damaging it is.

AB Until recently, the small proportion of older people in the Irish population and low, labour-market participation rates among women provided the underpinnings of the informal care model in Ireland. However, changes in family structures, women's labour market participation and population ageing are making this model less sustainable. A detailed analysis of policy changes and initiatives in the area of care provision shows that while the challenges facing the system are new, most of the solutions provided continue to rely on the model of home-based care.

SO SOCIETY & NATURAL RESOURCES
LA English
DT Article
DE biodiversity; institution; participation; stakeholder
ID NATURAL-RESOURCE MANAGEMENT; COMMUNITY
AB Research in common property, participatory resource management, and community development points to the central importance of organizational arrangements in conservation and development interventions. The dilemma facing contemporary conservation practitioners is how best to assist and facilitate such arrangements in support of participatory resource management and sustainable livelihoods, given the range of organizations, societal processes, and structures in which interventions might engage. This article presents some key findings from a study of stakeholder groups at 4 project sites, with information from a further 16 sites, in the Biodiversity Conservation Network: (1) Longstanding organizations had an established community niche, but could become bogged down in bureaucratic procedures; (2) poor communication between organizations was common and could undermine resource management; and (3) charismatic individuals and local elite interests could dominate groups, diminishing their representativeness. Based on these findings, the article argues that conservation professionals need to build their capacity as facilitators and negotiators, paying greater attention to how stakeholder groups form and function, their links to wider arenas, and the aims and positions of groups and individuals.

TI Impacts of shortleaf pine-hardwood forest management on soils in the
   Ouachita Highlands: A review

   floor; nutrients
ID WHOLE-TREE; SITE PREPARATION; HARVEST; CALCIUM; LOSSES
AB Shortleaf pine (Pinus echinata Mill.) is the most ecologically and economically important tree species in the Ouachita Highlands of the southcentral United States. This species can occur in relatively pure stands but most frequently exists in mixed stands with various hardwood species. Because of the diversity of land ownership, public concerns about forest management, and increased intensity of forest practices, the Ouachita Highlands have been a focal point for numerous research projects over the past 20 yr that have studied how forest management affects soils. We summarized information in four fundamental areas: (1) compaction, (2) soil loss, (3) organic matter, and (4) nutrients to better evaluate if and to what degree management practices such as harvesting and prescribed fire modify the productivity, and sustainability of soils in this region. The review indicated that soils with less than 15% rock content or sandy loam textures were susceptible to compaction when harvested during wet weather conditions. Although partial harvesting techniques, such as single-tree or group selection, tended to reduce overall soil disturbance in a stand, it increased soil compaction on primary skid trails by concentrating traffic on fewer skid trails. Compaction on skid trails frequently elevated bulk density to levels that could reduce regeneration success or seedling growth. Using current harvesting systems, soil losses and displacement to streams after harvesting appeared to have little or no effect on long-term soil productivity. Harvesting and prescribed fires significantly, altered nutrient and organic matter contents of the forest floor and mineral soil. However, recovery of these nutrient or organic pools often occurred rapidly after these cultural practices occurred. Little information was available for determining how repeated silvicultural practices over multiple rotations would affect long-term soil productivity in the Ouachita Highlands.

CT 6th Annual International Sustainable Development Conference

CL LEEDS, ENGLAND
AB In this paper, it is argued that the view of the economic sphere as a closed system can-not appropriately deal with the issue of sustainable development. Evolutionary economics is then presented as a fruitful alternative to apprehend the interactions between the economic, the human and the natural spheres. This emerging field offers both a firm theoretical basis (based upon recent developments in physics, biology, dynamic systems theory and the sciences of complexity) and practical, pragmatic answers to the implementation of a sustainable path of development. This is further illustrated with the presentation of the evolutionary logic of a multi-level common regime. Such a regime could be an institutional counterpart of social and environmental dynamics.

TI Nordic consumers and the challenge for sustainable housing
SO SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB In the Nordic countries, housing is one of society's greatest users of resources. Making housing more sustainable will call for changes in buildings, management routines and residents' habits, each having its possibilities as well as a built in resistance against change. Households might play a key role in this change, directly as consumers, but also indirectly and jointly as pressure groups towards real estate owners, managers and local society. Making housing more sustainable can be seen as society's 'sustainability challenge' to the housing consumers. In this paper, the extent of this challenge is discussed for the households of the Nordic countries, for different types of ownership and building etc. Its realization is seen in a ten-year perspective and in relation to the acquisition, maintenance, operation and use of the dwellings. Preliminary results indicate that a move to a new dwelling will give the household an opportunity to influence many aspects of its environmental impacts, but that moving will have little direct effect on the environmental performance of the built environment as a whole. Furthermore, that the activities of daily living have a potential for improvement without the inertia of reconstructing the building stock. In the end, however, co-operation between households and other stakeholders of the building sector is often a prerequisite for change. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.

TI Social and ecological destruction in the first class: A plausible social
   development scenario
SO SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB In a previous issue of Sustainable Development (Kaivo-oja, 1999) some alternative scenarios of social development were presented. The following scenarios were discussed: (i) the deep ecology scenario, (ii) the strong sustainable development scenario, (iii) the weak sustainable development scenario, (iv) the boomsday scenario, (v) the doomsday scenario and (vi) the World Bank 'policy tunnel' scenario. In this article a plausible, seventh social development scenario is presented: 'social and ecological destruction in the first class'. The basic idea of this scenario is presented in this paper. The author argues that this scenario should also be taken into consideration in the strategic discussion of potential sustainable development paths.

AB Background: A reduction in expiratory muscle (ExM) endurance in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) may have clinically relevant implications. This study was carried out to evaluate ExM endurance in patients with COPD.
   Methods: Twenty three patients with COPD (FEV, 35 (14)% predicted) and 14 matched controls were studied. ExM endurance was assessed using a method based on the use of an expiratory threshold valve which includes two steps. In step I the load is progressively increased (50 9 every 2 minutes) until task failure is reached, and the pressure generated against the highest tolerated load is defined as the maximal expiratory sustainable pressure (Pthmax). In step 2 subjects breathe against a submaximal constant load (80% of Pthmax) and the time elapsed until task failure is termed the expiratory endurance time (Tth(80)). In addition, the strength of peripheral muscles (handgrip, HGS) and respiratory muscles (maximal inspiratory and expiratory pressures, PImax and PEmax, respectively) was evaluated.
   Results: Patients with COPD had lower ExM strength and endurance than controls: PEmax 64 (19)% predicted v 84 (14)% predicted (mean difference 20%; 95% confidence intervals (0) 14 to 39); Pthmax 52 (27) v 151 (46) cm H2O (mean difference 99, 95% Cl 74 to 123); and Tth(80) 9.4 (6.3) v 14.2 (7.4) min (mean difference 4.8, 95% Cl 1.0 to 10.4; p<0.01 for all). Interestingly, ExM endurance directly correlated with both the severity of airways obstruction (Pthmax with FEV, r=0.794, p<0.01) and the reduction in strength observed in different muscle groups (Pthmax with HG, Pimax or PEmax, r=0.550, p < 0.05; r=0.583, p < 0.001; and r=0.584, p<0.001, respectively).
   Conclusions: ExM endurance is decreased in patients with COPD. This impairment is proportional to the severity of the disease and is associated with lower strength in different muscle groups. This suggests that systemic effects are implicated in the impairment observed in ExM function.

AB Sustainability has been a useful concept but one that has proven difficult to operationalize. The limits of acceptable change (LAC) planning system was used as a basis for research to exemplify a model that may be useful in applying the sustainability concept in regional tourism planning. A county on the coast of Texas, USA was used to examine regional attitudes toward tourism development and the perceived change that tourism might create. Respondent attitudes from three communities were compared. Results indicated that communities differed in the way they felt about tourism. These differences provided some justification for tourism development zones (TDZs) that can help separate development and activity types related to tourism. Communities also differed in perceived change that might occur due to tourism suggesting that different conditions and indicators might be needed depending on the TDZ of concern. Implications for application of the LAC planning system are discussed. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

DE sustainability; sustainable tourism; community tourism; policy
   formation; power sharing; stakeholder theory
AB This paper argues that in addressing the issues of 'sustainability' concepts akin to those of social tourism need to be applied, albeit in a wider context of stakeholder theory. Additionally theories of 'sustained value creation' may be borrowed from the management literature in that 'sustainability' is insufficient as an objective-rather managers within tourism should be looking to add value for environments, communities, entrepreneurs and tourists within the ethical objectives outlined by the World Tourism Organisation's New Global Ethics for World Tourism charter adopted in 1999. However, while all might agree with the intentions of such charters, the pragmatic issues of management that are raised are complex, and in turn raise serious issues of patterns of power and how such power to implement policies is to be both determined and practised. The article ends with a series of issues that need to be considered if there is to be a 'new tourism'. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB During the last two decades tourism in Turkey has become a mass industry concentrated in the western and southern coastal areas. As these areas were part of the more developed regions of the country, tourism in its current structure contributes to the strengthening of interregional disparities in Turkey. In addition, in the centres of mass tourism socio-economical unsustainable demand and supply structures evolved. Simultanously, the domestic tourism market has increased, and it can offer a socio-economic alternative to the further expansion of international mass tourism. Thus, the so far little developed South-East and East Anatolia, with an abundance of historical sights and natural highlights, can offer new destinations for domestic travellers while contributing to a sustainable development of these regions. As a precondition a national domestic tourism policy, stable prices and a strong promotion of the new destinations are essential. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The provision of traveler information services in the form of route planning and guidance (RPG) often involves three parties: service providers, users, and the traffic management agency. Each of these parties has distinctive objectives that are often in conflict with each other. This study developed a mixed-equilibrium model to consider the implementation of RPG services. We modeled the market penetration of RPG services in an elastic manner and developed a methodology to study the tradeoff among these conflicting objectives. The goal is to seek solutions that can sustain. This model can also be used to investigate the sensitivity of government policies on these services. Numerical results of a small network are provided to illustrate the behavior of this model. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Increased environmental concerns and the emphasis on material and energy recovery are gradually changing the orientation of MSW management and planning. In this context, the application of optimisation techniques have been introduced to design the least cost solid waste management systems, considering the variety of management processes. This study presents a model that was developed and applied to serve as a solid waste decision support system for MSW management taking into account both socio-economic and environmental considerations. The model accounts for solid waste generation rates, composition, collection, treatment, disposal as well as potential environmental impacts of various MSW management techniques. The model follows a linear programming formulation with the framework of dynamic optimisation. The model can serve as a tool to evaluate various MSW management alternatives and obtain the optimal combination of technologies fur the handling, treatment and disposal of MSW in an economic and environmentally sustainable way. The sensitivity of various waste management policies will be also addressed. The work is presented in a series of two papers: (I) model formulation, and (II) model application and sensitivity analysis.

AB Leachate from domestic landfills is a significant environmental hazard. In the urban environment, irrigation of recreational turf and parkland with nitrogen-rich landfill leachate provides both low-cost treatment that minimises pollution of surrounding waters and a valuable water resource. Of particular interest is the capacity of the turf-soil system to ameliorate the ammonium-rich leachate. To address this issue, a two-year field trial was completed at the Newington Landfill irrigating with saline, ammonium-rich leachate. The field trial suggested that in situ bioremediation is sustainable provided that management strategies such as dilution of leachate to reduce solution electrical conductivity to 3.6 dS m(-1) are adopted. Furthermore, pollution due to leaching of nitrogen can be minimised by managing the soil to enhance in situ denitrification of applied nitrogen. The management regimes adopted during the Newington field trial enabled nitrogen application rates in excess of 1400 kg NH4+ ha(-1) yr(-1). However, the capacity of the system to ameliorate the leachate appears limited by soil salinity and sodicity rather than the control of nitrogen leaching by denitrification, suggesting that rates of up to 3500 kg NH4+ ha(-1) yr(-1) may be viable if the salinity hazard can be effectively managed.

AB Ethnoecological studies have demonstrated the impacts that even relatively small-scale human foraging has on targeted species of shellfish and the structure of biological communities in intertidal zones. There is compelling archaeological evidence that people in various parts of the world often had a deflating effect on shellfish populations. Shellfish and other marine resources have sometimes been perceived as lowly ranked foods and coastal archaeological sites have often been interpreted as temporary (possibly seasonal) sites for the exploitation of these 'inferior' food resources. This model has been challenged by studies of mid-Holocene Mesolithic hunter-gatherer sites in Atlantic Europe, which have shown that marine foods were the main component of the total diet and that human foraging can deplete shellfish resources. Although subsistence systems based on coastal resources might have been both viable and acceptable in dietary terms, regular mobility would have been necessary for them to be sustainable. On longer time scales, such coastal mobility might result in population dispersal. Sites associated with early anatomically modern humans show the antiquity of coastal adaptations, including the consumption of shellfish, and the dispersal of early modern human out of Africa into south-east Asia and 'Greater Australia' could have been through coastal environments. This coastal dispersal could have been driven, at least in part, by the impact of early human foragers on intertidal food resources. Resource depletion in coastal zones was probably among the first significant, but small-scale, 'ecological impacts' of human beings.

AB A system of wooded pasture can be described by seven biological state variables (trees, shrubs, underwood grasslands, fallows, eutrophic meadows, oligrotrophic lawns and cattle) linked by a network of dynamic interactions, which are controlled by altitude and human activities. PATUMOD is a spatially implicit compartment model designed to simulate vegetation dynamics in such silvopastoral ecosystems at community level and according to an equilibrium paradigm. Computer simulations show that the state variables generally end up on a steady-state (one-point attractor), independent on their initial values but strongly dependent on cattle load. At a given altitude, to each value of the stock density is corresponding a stable equilibrium characterised by a given relative cover of each vegetation component. If the initial values are very far of the attractor, a long succession of intermediate stages is required before leading to the steady-state. A remarkable exception to this rule can occur at low altitude, with a repellor between switching trajectories towards two attractors, corresponding to a threshold between scarcely and densely wooded pastures. PATUMOD can be applied to simulate different management scenarios, which include changing global stock density and cutting trees or shrubs. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We present results of accurate ab initio Floquet calculations of lower-order harmonic generation by argon at the KrF laser fundamental frequency which exhibit large enhancement of the third, fifth and seventh harmonics at intensities corresponding to field-atom resonances. The resonant effects occur at relatively low laser intensities. These are the first reported results for a complex atom taking full account of electron correlation and give a quantitative description of the resonant enhancement. We infer that similar enhancements will occur for other multi-electron atomic systems. The single-atom response calculations demonstrate the importance of resonant enhancement of harmonic generation in multi-electron atoms and suggest a possible low-cost method of sustainable harmonic generation.

AB This paper examines the nutrient chemistry and biological quality indices [Mean Trophic Rank (MTR) and Trophic Diatom Index (TDI)] for rivers within the upper Thames basin. The predominant sources of nitrogen within the rivers monitored were diffuse and agricultural in nature. However, phosphorus showed both diffuse and point source signals. MTR surveys undertaken both upstream and downstream of major STWs indicate that these rivers are 'at risk' of eutrophication or 'badly damaged'. MTR surveys also indicate increased trophic status downstream of STWs, whereas TDI does not indicate such a consistent pattern. Phosphorus treatment at selected major sewage treatment works in the upper Thames basin resulted in significant reductions in in-stream P concentrations and reductions in fluxes by a half to two thirds. However, the effects of P-reduction on in-stream ecology (measured as MTR and TDI) were more difficult to ascribe, owing to: (1) the high variability in river flow rates experienced since P-reduction was introduced; (2) lag effects related to P stores in river bed sediments; and (3) diffuse and smaller point source inputs upstream. The results of this study indicate that control of upstream sources of phosphorus may prove critical in improving the biological quality status of UK lowland rivers, including ecological responses to P-source controls on the major sewage treatment works downstream. Upstream sources include both diffuse (agricultural) sources and small point source inputs which, at present, are not classified as 'qualifying discharges' under the Urban Wastewater Treatment Directive (UWWTD) and are thus not subject to phosphorus control measures. These results are of relevance for integrated, sustainable management and protection of European freshwater resources, particularly in terms of new ecological targets for water quality management under the new Water Framework Directive.

AB It is important to promote efficient use of water through better management of water resources, for social and economical sustainability in and and semi-arid areas, under the conditions of severe water shortage. Based on the developments in deficit irrigation research, a recurrence control model for regional optimal allocation of irrigation water resources, aiming at overall maximum efficiency, is presented, with decomposition-harmonization principles of large systems. The model consists of three levels (layers). The first level involves dynamic programming (DP) for optimization of crop irrigation scheduling. The second level deals with optimal allocation of water resources among various crops. The last level concerns optimal allocation of water resources among different sub-regions. As a test, this model was applied to the combined optimal allocation of multiple water resources (surface, ground and in-take from the Weihe river) of Yangling, a semi-arid region on the Loess Plateau, China. Exemplary computation showed that not only are the results rational, but the method can also effectively overcome possible "dimensional obstacles" in dynamic programming of multiple dimensions. Furthermore, each sub-model is relatively independent by using various optimization methods. The model represents a new approach for improving irrigation efficiency, implementing water-saving irrigation, and solving the problem of water shortage in the region studied. The model can be extended in and and semi-arid areas for better water management. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Surface runoff and soil erosion are major threats to sustainable agriculture and mapping regional erosion risk is increasingly needed by national and international environment agencies. Because erosion results from the interaction of several parameters which vary in space and time, no simple model can take into account all relevant factors, particularly in cultivated areas where human influences are predominant. The aim of this work is to develop a methodology based on present knowledge and available data for the evaluation of erosion risk at national scale. The various erosion factors have been graded for different geographical situations and erosion mechanisms have been expressed with the help of expert decision. The various erosion types observed in France had been previously classified. Soil crustability is considered as a key factor in runoff and erosion risk on cultivated soils. A geographical database has been created for French territory, and a model of erosion risk has been developed within a Geographical Information System (GIS). The model uses expert rules to combine data on land use (CORINE Land Cover database), soil crustability and soil erodibility (determined by pedotransfer rules from the French soil database), relief (Digital Elevation Model from the National Geographic Institute) and meteorological data from Meteo-France at the scale of 250 x 250 m pixels. Results are spatially aggregated using various administrative or environmental units. The main areas affected by erosion risk are the north, west and east of the Paris basin with intensive agriculture on crusting soils, the Rhone valley and southwest of France where vineyard or spring crops cover large areas. Other areas like Britany, the south of the Massif Central or the Mediterranean area are moderately affected. Areas with a permanent cover of woodland or grassland show a low erosion risk.

TI Professionalism and justice: Ethical management guidelines for leaders
   of academic medical centers
SO ACADEMIC MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
AB Academic health centers (AHCs) exist for the sake of pursuit of excellence in their missions of patient care, teaching, and research. Survival should be a means to these goals and not an end unto itself. Because of the fiscal crisis in health care, leaders of AHCs face the possible diminution or even extinction of their centers. When preventing such a fate becomes the governing concern of these leaders, power concentrates in their hands and can be used to force cooperation among competing faculty members and groups for the sake of mutual survival. The ethical concepts of professionalism and justice can be used to create a vital, practical, alternative vision for the leadership of AHCs, in which their missions once again become central to their organizational culture. Creating a morally sustainable organizational culture of professionalism and justice should rely not on forced cooperation, but on voluntary cooperation of all stakeholders in the pursuit of a common goa-professional excellence in patient care, teaching, and research-with survival understood to be a means to this goat. To achieve this alternative vision, the authors propose five management guidelines. For example, all faculty should be made accountable not only for maximizing the good of the organization's professionalism but also for fostering financial viability.

ID FRACTIONATION; SEDIMENTS; SOIL
AB To make the constructed wetlands more acceptable for sewage treatment, these systems need to guarantee hi-fi purification rates for both organic substances as well as plant nutrients (N, P). However, in most constructed wetlands, the P elimination rate remains relatively low.
   By comparing the purification rates for P (and P fractions in soil after fractionated extraction) among different systems, it was determined that the addition of iron filings to the filter material is more effective in ensuring a sustainable high removal capacity than the use of Ca-rich soils. Long-term studies on a horizontal flow wetland (HFW) show that an iron-rich soil filter with Phragmites australis removes 97% of P from sewage even after nine years at pH values of between 4.6 and 4.9. About 60% of the P is bound to Fe (or Al) in a predominately amorphous form. In a vertical flow wetland (VFW), the P removal rate remains much lower (27%) at pH values of between 5.8 and 6.4. About 30% of the P is bound to iron, 30% to Ca and 20% as refractory P. Altogether, HFWs seem to be more effective in P elimination than VFWs because of the longer flowing distance and treatment time,
   Removal of plants from the soil filter leads to a significant decrease of 50% in the P elimination rate. This result indirectly shows the role of plants in microbiological P transformation processes and in the direct elimination of P by binding it to humic substances.

AB Voluntary simplicity, frugality, downshifting, sustainable lifestyle, are related topics invading bookshelves, the World Wide Web, special journal editions, conferences and class syllabi. Although growing in popularity, voluntary simplicity lifestyles are not well understood by consumer researchers. Why are these lifestyles becoming popular in a consumer culture? Why are some consumers choosing to consume less? Do these individuals consume less or just different types of products?" What types of discourses are used to learn about and justify this lifestyle? In an effort to better understand these consumers, this article uses new social movement and identity theories from cultural studies to analyze the forces influencing individuals to choose a post-materialist lifestyle.

AB The words "sustainability" and "sustainable development" are virtually omnipresent now. But how do we actually achieve the goals of sustainability, and what actions can we take? Green Chemistry and Engineering technologies are providing innovative solutions for today and tomorrow in many areas of product and process research and application. These technologies are helping to address some of the world's most pressing environmental issues, which include global climate change, sustainable energy production, food production and the associated agricultural practices, depletion of non-renewable resources, and the dissipation of toxic and hazardous materials in the environment. We describe the essential nature of Green Chemistry and Engineering in meeting these challenges and describe the specific examples and case studies that are presented in this book.

   TECHNOLOGY
AB Lignocellulosic biomass provides a low-cost, uniquely sustainable resource for large-scale production of organic fuels and chemicals that can have low environmental impact while providing important economic and strategic advantages. Conversion costs must be competitive for these benefits to be realized, and biological processing routes can take advantage of emerging tools in modern biotechnology to dramatically improve economics. For example, significant advances have been made in biological conversion of lignocellulosic biomass into ethanol, and the private sector is working to apply the technology commercially. Raising the substantial capital needed is challenging for first-of-a-kind commodity projects, but understanding the fundamental principles governing bioprocessing steps will accelerate the rate of application. In addition, improved knowledge of cellulose and hemicellulose hydrolysis grounded in fundamental principles will facilitate improvements that are vital to the cost reductions needed to achieve competitiveness in an open market and to develop a range of sustainable biocommodity products. Premature attempts to force technological applications without building technical and economic foundations will be inefficient in resource allocation and will often fail.

AB Recent advances in genetic engineering, composite science, and natural fiber development offer significant opportunities for new, improved materials from renewable resources that can biodegrade or be recycled, thus enhancing global sustainability. A wide range of high-performance, low-cost materials can be made using plant oils, natural fibers, and lignin. By selecting the fatty acid distribution function of plant oils via computer simulation and the molecular connectivity, we can control chemical functionalization and molecular architecture to produce linear, branched, or cross-linked polymers. These materials can be used as pressure-sensitive adhesives, elastomers, rubbers, and composite resins. This chapter describes the chemical pathways that were used to modify plant oils and allow them to react with each other and various co-monomers to form materials with useful properties.

TI Crop-animal systems in Asia: importance of livestock and
   characterisation of agro-ecological zones
SO AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article
DE Asia; livestock; mixed farming; agro-ecological zones
AB Crop-animal systems, in which livestock play a multi-purpose role, are the backbone of Asian agriculture. In the future, increased productivity from livestock will be necessary in these systems to meet the increased demand for animal products, to alleviate poverty and to improve the livelihoods of resource-poor farmers. Agriculture in the region is characterised by diverse and complex production systems, which reflect the wide range of physical environments. In Southeast Asia, the main agro-ecological zones are characterised by humid/subhumid climates, whilst those in South Asia are arid/semi-arid. Irrigated agriculture is well developed in high potential areas but, with the exception of Pakistan, the countries still depend heavily on rain-fed production systems. Most soils are of low fertility and some, such as the vertisols, present management problems. The natural vegetation consists of forests and native grasslands, with the latter more common in South Asia. Land degradation is a major concern and threatens the sustainability of the farming systems. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

DE Asia; livestock; mixed farming; crop-animal interactions
AB The integration of crop and animal production is well developed in the farming systems of Asia, particularly those in small-scale agriculture. There is marked complementarity in resource use in these systems, with inputs from one sector being supplied to others. Specific examples of the main crop-animal interactions are given for different countries, and reference is made to the results of a number of case studies. These have demonstrated the important contribution that animals make to increased production, income generation, and the improved sustainability of annual and perennial cropping systems.

DE Asia; mixed farming; livestock; nutrient recycling; case studies
ID INDIGENOUS KNOWLEDGE; TREE FODDER
AB Livestock management, as a means of determining the extent and value of nutrient flows in agricultural landscapes, is already well understood and exploited by small-scale farmers in Asia. This paper highlights the biological interfaces in smallholder agricultural systems where animals exert the greatest influence upon nutrient cycles, and suggests that these should form the focus of scientific effort to elucidate the key elements of the biological processes at work. Two case studies of intensive mixed farming systems are presented from the uplands of Java, Indonesia and the Mid-Hills of Nepal. These examples show how management practices have developed over centuries to enhance the contribution that livestock make to motivating and moderating nutrient flows on very small and continuously cultivated land holdings. The paper concludes by emphasising that there is an urgent need to understand the biological mechanisms that enable livestock to contribute to the sustainability of intensive smallholder agriculture.

DE Asia; integrated agriculture-aquaculture (IAA); nutrient recycling;
   enterprise diversification; sustainable livelihoods
ID INDIA
AB The status of integrated agriculture-aquaculture (IAA) in Asia is reviewed, with an emphasis on rural small-scale systems. Existing IAA systems within mixed farming systems are characterised and the economic and ecological role of aquaculture described. The importance of nutrient recycling of otherwise unused waste materials as an important element and a benefit of integration is emphasised. Approaches for new entrants to explore and plan integration on their farms are presented. In comparison to other enterprises, the pond offers relatively greater potential for integration on farms and for flows of nutrients to and from the new enterprise. Opportunities for integration are classified based on nutrient source and system. The role of IAA systems in rural livelihoods and the considerations for IAA under the specific conditions of nutrient-deficient smallholder farms are outlined. The present state of experience in dissemination, uptake and system evolution of IAA farms is reviewed as well as the achieved impacts in Asia, both on the poor and on commercial developments, based on examples from Bangladesh, China, India and Thailand. It is concluded that considerable potential exists for further aquaculture integration in Asia, with notable improvements in the livelihoods of rural small-scale farmers.

TI Sustainability of organic meat production under Swedish conditions
SO AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT

DT Article
DE environment; meat; organic farming; sustainable livestock; Sweden
AB World meat consumption has increased considerably during recent decades at the same time as questions about the sustainability of livestock systems. The aim of the paper is to investigate whether organic meat production can be more sustainable than conventional meat production. Organic meat production is supposed to use ecological resources, such as natural grasslands and by-products with low alternative value together with fodder that is grown without artificial fertilisers and pesticides. The organic animals are given the possibility of more natural behaviour, for example, they stay outdoors all year in nature and use simple buildings. For organic meat production to expand in a sustainable way, consumers must perceive it as at least as good as conventional production regarding environmental quality and price. Therefore, possible future organic and conventional meat production are compared regarding production costs, land requirements, soil conservation, nature conservation, energy needs, and chemical requirements as well as the discharge of nitrogen and greenhouse gases.
   The results suggest that organic production can be more sustainable than conventional production for beef and lamb, but not for pork. Organic beef and lamb production has advantages compared with conventional pig production regarding soil conservation, nature conservation and independence of chemicals. However, the production costs and discharge of nitrogen and greenhouse gases per kilo of meat are larger than in conventional pork production. Organic production also needs more land, which limits its sustainability if land for food production and energy crops is scarce. When food is scarce, organic meat production should aim to use land and by-products that cannot be used in any other way for food production. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In the Brazilian Amazon mass deforestation has resulted from a sequence of road building, extractive logging, and pasture development during the past three decades. Ranchers have consolidated small agricultural holdings, pushing farmers to move to forest frontiers or urban fringes, prompting further deforestation and social instability. In response to this conversion of Amazonian forests, the authors sought to identify both economically viable and more sustainable development alternatives within the Brazilian state of Para. There, local farmers of Japanese descent have developed a variety of agroforestry systems in which 10 to 20 hectare (ha) fields yield incomes comparable to 400 to 1,200 ha pastures. In addition, such crop fields generate substantially more rural employment per ha than do pastures. Ongoing forest conversion to pasture is clearly not a product of sound economic decision making. Improved land zoning and public policies could favor agroforestry over further pasture expansion, stabilizing rural populations while helping to conserve the Amazon's remaining forests.

DE commercialisation; fruit yield; indigenous fruit tree; marula; tree size
AB Sclerocarya birrea (A. Rich.) Hochst. subsp. caffra (Sond.) Kokwaro. is a common species throughout the semi-arid, deciduous savannas of much of sub-Saharan Africa. It is a favoured species and is frequently maintained in homestead plots and arable fields in an agroforestry situation. Although the abundance and popularity of this species has led to several initiatives to commercialise a number of marula products, the sustainability of the resource base with respect to fruit production has not been considered. This paper reports on a field experiment that monitored growth rates and fruit production of a sample of adult trees from several wild populations. Mean fruit production was 36.8 kg per tree in the first year, and negligible in the second. This was considerably less than previous estimates, which were based largely on small samples or anecdotal reports. The maximum recorded yield was 416.6 kg per tree. Fruit production was positively related to the size of the tree. Growth rates of adult trees were slow. There was a strong positive relationship between mean annual diameter increment and stem diameter. The slow growth rates and low fruit yields indicate that more attention is required regarding the sustainability of the resource and its ability to provide sufficient fruit for the growing subsistence and commercial demand at both local and national scales.

AB Knowledge of the status and dynamics of soil N is essential to improving the production and management of silvopastoral system in the tropics. Soil N status and dynamics were analyzed as key factors affecting productivity and sustainability of a cut-and-carry silvopastoral system. The total soil N and N mineralization as affected by soil moisture and temperature were studied in a Gliricidia sepium (Jacq.) Walp - Dichanthium aristatum (Poir) C.E. Hubbard grassland association and in an adjacent open grassland located in a subhumid tropical region. The plot was installed in 1989 and the pruning residues and cut grass were removed from the site. No N fertilizer was applied. Total soil N increased at an average rate of 180 kg N ha(-1) in the 0-0.2 m soil layer of the silvopastoral plot. Only a third of this value could be explained by the litter, nodule and root turnover. Nitrogen mineralization in both soils varied as a function of temperature but it was not affected by soil moisture. Even if mean soil temperature was 1 degreesC to 2 degreesC greater in the open grassland, the estimated daily rate of in-situ N mineralization was 20% greater in the silvopastoral system. Our results indicated that greater N mineralization in the silvopastoral system was due to greater soil biological activity associated with higher soil organic matter rather than due to more favorable soil temperature and water conditions.

AB Soil quality concepts are commonly used to evaluate sustainable land management in agroecosystems. The objectives of this review were to trace the importance of soil organic matter (SOM) in Canadian sustainable land management studies and illustrate the role of SOM and aggregation in sustaining soil functions. Canadian studies on soil quality were initiated in the early 1980s and showed that loss of SOM and soil aggregate stability were standard features of nonsustainable land use. Subsequent studies have evaluated SOM quality using the following logical sequence: soil purpose and function, processes, properties and indicators, and methodology. Limiting steps in this soil quality framework are the questions of critical limits and standardization for soil properties. At present, critical limits for SOM are selected using a commonly accepted reference value or based on empirically derived relations between SOM and a specific soil process or function (e.g., soil fertility, productivity, or erodibility). Organic matter fractions (e.g., macro-organic matter, light fraction, microbial biomass, and mineralizable C) describe the quality of SOM. These fractions have biological significance for several soil functions and processes and are sensitive indicators of changes in total SOM. Total SOM influences soil compactibility, friability, and soil water-holding capacity while aggregated SOM has major implications for the functioning of soil in regulating air and water infiltration, conserving nutrients, and influencing soil permeability and erodibility. Overall, organic matter inputs, the dynamics of the sand-sized macro-organic matter, and the soil aggregation process are important factors in maintaining and regulating organic matter functioning in soil.

AB To protect forest boils against the effects of air pollution input specific Measures are necessary. The effectiveness and compatibility of measures for soil protection in forest ecosystems, especially those of forest timing, have been investigated in 4 experimental series in Rheinland-Pfalz on an interdisciplinary level for more than 10 years.
   The results of our research showed that liming can effectively reduce acidifying trends in forest boils. By supporting the decomposition activities, mineral soil humus forms and varied soil vegetation associations will develop. In this way, the essential function of forest soils as nitrogen storage will be supported. This is very important with regard to the nitrogen-dominated air pollution. On the other hand forest ecosystems, which are handicapped by considerable nitrogen pollution or decomposition of nitrogen stocks, can develop into a nitrogen source after liming, Three-layer-silicates in parts of soil influenced by the effects of liming will be stabilized by the increasing base saturation of the interlayers, Using dolomite for timing. magnesium will enter the bioelement cycle of forest ecosystems. systems. Heavy metalls in the humus layer will be immobilized in organic complexes after liming. The concentration of aluminium in the seepage water can increase in some forest sites if calcium or magnesium cations are taken up by the sorption complexes of the soil. Interspecific rivalries between some soil fauna groups cause the abundance of one group to increase and the abundance of another group to decrease.
   Feigned contradictory results of studies are the consequence of diverse sites, stands and stress conditions. Soil protection measures, are necessary to protect all sites, but they Must be in accordance with the results of the forest ecosystem research, investigations of forest soil conditions, studies of sensitivities and forest site surveying. Only in this way it will be assured, that the diversity of forest sites will not be levelled out, but protected by the levelling effects of external influences.

AB Legal and legal-philosophical limitations in research The framework of legal regulations for biomedical research is characterised by the conflicts which a look into the constitution typically reveals for all complex questions. Weighty constitutional aspects support scientific advances, but numerous aspects also call for prohibition or limitation. After wise deliberations the concrete legislative answer must reach a suitable compromise between the two poles ("practical concordance"). In a concordant, sustainable social order, the ethical conditions for the continuation of biomedical development may not differ too much from the legal guidelines. Otherwise, acceptance of the regulations must be questioned. If "animal protection" should be entered into the constitution as a state aim, restrictions of experimental research on animals could be the consequence. However, the simple legislator would still have to fixate the (new) aspects to be considered in a binding form. In the end, this does not necessarily need to lead to more regulations than are already set out in the animal protection law.

AB In this article, natural resource management is conceptualized as a social dilemma, a conflict between the short-term self-interest of users and the tong-tern collective interest of the user community. A self-interest versus community perspective is offered to explain individuals' decision making in resource dilemmas. The self-interest model assumes that users seek to maximize their personal benefits regardless of the collective implications. To foster sustainable use, it is necessary to restrict people's access to the resource either through controlling the resource centrally (centralization) or by creating a system of individual access (individualization). The alternative community model suggests that communities can foster self-restraint among users provided that they feel attached to their community. These two perspectives and their implications for natural resource management are systematically compared using findings from research on water conservation.

AB This study assesses consumer perceptions of sustainably produced foods and evaluates whether a supermarket point-of-purchase intervention could increase shoppers' awareness of a campaign designed to promote purchases of sustainably produced foods. The in-store intervention involved the promotion of sustainably produced apples labeled with the Midwest Food Alliance's (MWFA) seal of approval. Minnesota consumers were surveyed at two eastern metropolitan area intervention stores and one eastern metropolitan area comparison store. The in-store campaign lasted 8 weeks and involved individually labeled apples, point-of-purchase materials, and weekly food demonstrations. Prior to campaign initiation, baseline surveys were administered to consumers in two test stores and one comparison store. Follow-up surveys were mailed to these same consumers upon conclusion of the campaign intervention. Independent samples t-tests comparing change from baseline to post intervention indicated that a statistically higher percentage of consumers in the test-market group had heard of the Midwest Food Alliance campaign. Further more, a statistically higher percentage of the test-market shoppers reported seeing signs and labels promoting the MWFA, indicating that the promotion had some impact. Baseline data gathered from all consumers indicated that foods produced with sustainable practices were important to consumers; however, food characteristics of freshness, taste, safety and healthfulness were most important. The majority, of consumers reported that they would be willing to pay 10-30% more for selected sustainably produced foods. Research results indicated that an 8-week in-store intervention was effective at increasing consumer awareness of the MWFA. However, a more powerful intervention (including a longer promotion period with more labeled foods) may be needed to induce shoppers to increase their purchases of sustainably produced,foods promoted by the MWFA.

TI Assessing students' preparedness towards sustainability in US and

SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ALTERNATIVE AGRICULTURE

DT Article
DE assessment; curriculum; evaluation instrument; sustainable agriculture
AB This work focused on the evaluation of undergraduate curricula in agriculture for a selected group of institutions from Louisiana and Texas in the US, and France and Italy. The primary research objective was pursued through the measurement of knowledge acquisition in sustainable agriculture principles of undergraduate students as they were approaching the completion of their curriculum. Quantitative data were collected through the administration of a test to eight samples (n = 20) of senior students from each university participating in the study. An analysis of frequencies for every test question indicated the strengths but also the weaknesses that still exist in the agricultural curricula when students' academic achievement was measured. Every institution acknowledged the emerging sustainable agriculture paradigm in brochures, catalogs and web sites. There is a need for ameliorating agricultural curricula as the long-term productivity of farms is threatened by market policies uncontrollable by single producers and by the manipulation of resources that frequently accelerate environmental degradation. Therefore, we show opportunities for the strengthening of study programs to incorporate sustainable agriculture principles in undergraduate curricula.

AB Seven strategies for pruning and adjusting the crop level of Concord vines were evaluated over a six-year period in a commercial vineyard in southwest Michigan to determine their long-term influence on vine productivity, vine structure, and fruit quality. Manual balance pruning retained 44 nodes per kilogram of cane prunings. Commercial manual pruning resulted in 25% more live nodes per vine and a 19% larger yield than manual balance pruning. Commercial manual pruning resulted in more clusters per meter of canopy but less yield per node, smaller clusters, and lower Brix than vines managed with manual balance pruning. Nevertheless, commercial manual pruning did produce acceptable fruit soluble solids in five out of six years of the experiment. Three severities of mechanical pruning resulted in yields that were comparable to commercial manual pruning at approximately 13 t/ha. As the severity of mechanical pruning treatments decreased, the number of live nodes and clusters per meter of canopy increased while yield per node and average cluster weight decreased. Moreover, the range of annual yields and fruit soluble solids for these treatments became greater as pruning severity decreased. Crop adjustment, applied in combination with mechanical pruning by spraying ammonium nitrate solutions on a portion of the vine at bloom, resulted in lower yields and higher fruit soluble solids than mechanical pruning alone. Fruit soluble solids from treatments involving crop control were greater than the commercially acceptable minimum standard of 15 Brix in five out of six years. Distribution analysis revealed that approximately 90% of the live nodes and clusters for all treatments were situated within the top 60 cm of the trellis. Moderate or minimal mechanical pruning, whether used alone or in combination with chemical crop adjustment, did not provide consistently comparable fruit quality to manual pruning. Severe mechanical pruning produced yields and fruit soluble solids that were similar to commercial manual pruning. The comparable response of these two treatments was due to the compensating factors of a 45% reduction in node fruitfulness and a 75% increase in the number of live nodes for severe hedging when compared to commercial manual pruning. Severe mechanical pruning, when used in combination with cane positioning, manual follow-up pruning after hedging, and shoot positioning, was an acceptable, sustainable practice for managing Concord vines.

AB Background: Although the relationship between diet and disease is well established, sustainable dietary changes that would affect risk for disease have been difficult to achieve. Whereas individual factors are traditional explanations for the inability of some people to change dietary habits, little research has investigated how the physical availability of healthy foods affects individuals' diets. This study examines the distribution of food stores and food service places by neighborhood wealth and racial segregation.
   Methods: Names and addresses of places to buy food in Mississippi, North Carolina, Maryland, and Minnesota were obtained from respective departments of health and agriculture. Addresses were geocoded to census tracts. Median house values were used to estimate neighborhood wealth, while the proportion of black residents was used to measure neighborhood racial segregation.
   Results: Compared to the poorest neighborhoods, large numbers of supermarkets and gas stations with convenience stores are located in wealthier neighborhoods. There are 3 times fewer places to consume alcoholic beverages in the wealthiest compared to the poorest neighborhoods (prevalence ratio [PR]=0.3, 95% confidence interval [CI]=0.1-0.6). Regarding neighborhood segregation, there are 4 times more supermarkets located in white neighborhoods compared to black neighborhoods (PR=4.3, 95% CI=1-5-12.5).
   Conclusions: Without access to supermarkets, which offer a wide variety of foods at lower prices, poor and minority communities may not have equal access to the variety of healthy food choices available to nonminority and wealthy communities.

AB We develop a new approach to modeling grazing systems that links foraging characteristics (intake and digestive constraints) with resource dynamics via the probability of encounter with different grass heights. Three complementary models are presented: the generation of a grass height structure through selective grazing; investigating the conditions for consumer coexistence; and, using a simplified resource structure, the consequences for consumer abundance. The main finding is that coexistence between grazers differing in body size is possible if a single-resource type becomes differentiated in its height structure. Large grazers can facilitate food availability for smaller species but with the latter being competitively dominant. The relative preference given to different resource partitions is important in determining the nature of population interactions. Large-body and small-body grazer populations can interact through competitive, parasitic, commensalist, or amensalist relationships, depending on the way they partition the resource as well as their relative populations and the dynamics of resource renewal. The models provide new concepts of multispecies carrying capacity (stock equilibrium) in grazed systems with implications for conservation and management. We conclude that consumer species are not substitutable; therefore, the use of rangeland management concepts such as "livestock units" may be inappropriate.

AB This essay is about the role of ecologists in policy-determining and, decision-making processes in the society in which research results may play, and are expected to play, a constructive role. The incentive for writing this essay came from my,involvement, over the past several years, in the research-and conservation-planning of boreal forest biodiversity in Finland. Forest biodiversity is a much,debated issue in Finland, where forest industry represents an important sector of the economy and has become so advanced technologically and in terms of the infrastructure that:the ever-diminishing work force can manage the entire area of 20 million ha of forests - practically down to single big trees. Biodiversity has become a fundamental concern in boreal forestry, because this is an industry that is based on the use of just a few species, but in a manner that will influence thousands of non-target species living in the same area. Arguably, current boreal forestry as practiced in e.g. Finland is sustainable from the perspective of the dynamics of the target tree species, but-not from the perspective of the forest communities as a whole.

AB The three missions of Syslematics Agenda 2000 (SA2000)-to inventory Earth's species, to understand their relationships, and to use the latter to create predictive information systems-define an agenda of research for systmatic biology. The recognition that systematic knowledge underpins biological knowledge in general, and applied biology in particular, has resulted in an amazing growth in systematics over the past decade. Increasingly, systematics is being used to solve societal problems. This paper describes seven great questions within systematics and discusses their relevance for, and contribution to, conserving and sustainably using biodiversity. These questions fall into four broad categories: Questions about diversity: What is a species? and How many species are there? Questions about phylogeny: What is the Tree of Life? and What has been the history of character transformation? Questions about biogeography: Where are Earth's species distributed? and How have species distributions changed over time? and Questions about phyloinformatics: How is phylogenetic history predictive?.

AB This paper explores the manifold relations among the spatial organization of tourism, the quality of tourism products in heritage cities, and the dynamics of the regional economies. The concept of "vicious circle" describes the self-feeding linkage between the emerging class of excursionist tourists in the later stages of a destination lifecycle, and the decline in a city's attractiveness. Reference is made to the case of Venice. According to this scheme, effective policies for sustainable tourism should attack the critical points where the vicious circle feeds, such as the quality and accessibility of cultural resources.

AB An air of crisis pervaded tourism during the 90s after the growth decade of the 80s in Lancaster County, the United States. During these two decades, the tourism landscape als underwent significant transformation. This study, based on a mail survey of tourism businesses, focus groups, and other collected data, describes and interprets recent tourism trends. The relevance of Butler's proposed later stages in his destination lifecycle model is examined. The study concludes that Lancaster County is characterized by the coexistence of growth, stagnation, decline, and rejuvenation and that this combination is better termed a stage of maturity. Nevertheless, the potential for significant decline exists in the future if there is no effective strategic planning to promote sustainable tourism.

TI Implementing community-directed treatment with ivermectin for the
   control of onchocerciasis in Uganda (1997-2000): an evaluation
SO ANNALS OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND PARASITOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID TREATMENT PROGRAMS; SUSTAINMENT; SYSTEM
AB Over the period 1997-2000, an evaluation was made, in 10 districts of Uganda, of the onchocerciasis-control programme based on community-directed treatment with ivermectin (CDTI). This programme is supported by the Ministry of Health, the African Progamme for Onchocerciasis Control (APOC) and The Carter Center Global 2000 River Blindness Programme. The data analysed came from: (1) monthly and annual reports; (2) annual interviews, in randomly-selected communities in selected districts, with heads of household, community leaders and ivermectin distributors; (3) participatory evaluation meetings (PEM); (4) participant observation studies; and (5) key informants.
   The percentage of treated communities in the 10 study districts achieving satisfactory treatment coverage [i.e. greater than or equal to 90% of the annual treatment objective (ATO)] rose from 46.0 in 1997 to 86.8 in 2000. This improvement was largely attributable to the adoption of collective CDTI decision-making by community members, avoidance of paying monetary incentives to the ivermectin distributors, and the satisfaction with the programme of those who had been treated. Coverage improved as the numbers of community members who were involved in choosing the method of distribution and in selecting their own community-directed health workers (CDHW) increased. Health education was also critical in improving individual members' involvement in decision-making, and in mobilizing other community members to take part in CDTI. Involvement of kinship groups, as well as educated community members as supervisors of CDHW, also helped to increase coverage, In a regression model, satisfaction with the programme was revealed as a significant predictor of the achievement of the target coverage (P< 0.001). Cost per person, as an indicator for sustainability, varied with the size of the population under treatment, from at least U.S.$0.40 when the district ATO was < 15,000 people, to U.S.$0.26 with an ATO of 15,000-40,000 and less than U.S.$0.10 when the district ATO exceeded 40,000 people. These results cast doubt on the validity of the current APOC indicator for sustainability, of a cost of no more than U.S.$0.20/person for all CDTI projects, whatever the size of the population to be treated. Although some women were involved in decision-making, their current involvement as supervisors or CDHW was minimal.
   Most of the present data were obtained through monitoring and operational-research activities that have been carried out, in an integrated fashion, within the Ugandan CDTI programme since its launch. It is recommended that assessment, monitoring and evaluation be widely used within all CDTI efforts. Operational research should remain focused and appropriate and directly involve the personnel who are executing the programme.

AB Interest in biological control of plant pathogens has been stimulated in recent years by trends in agriculture towards greater sustainability and public concern about the use of hazardous pesticides. There is now unequivocal evidence that antibiotics play a key role in the suppression of various soilborne plant pathogens by antagonistic microorganisms. The significance of antibiotics in biocontrol, and more generally in microbial interactions, often has been questioned because of the indirect nature of the supporting evidence and the perceived constraints to antibiotic production in rhizosphere environments. Reporter gene systems and bio-analytical techniques have clearly demonstrated that antibiotics are produced in the spermosphere and rhizosphere of a variety of host plants. Several abiotic factors such as oxygen, temperature, specific carbon and nitrogen sources, and microelements have been identified to influence antibiotic production by bacteria biocontrol agents. Among the biotic factors that may play a determinative role in antibiotic production are the plant host, the pathogen, the indigenous microflora, and the cell density of the producing strain. This review presents recent advances in our understanding of antibiotic production by bacterial biocontrol agents and their role in microbial interactions.

AB Suppressive soils are characterized by a very low level of disease development even though a virulent pathogen and susceptible host are present. Biotic and abiotic elements of the soil environment contribute to suppressiveness, however most defined systems have identified biological elements as primary factors in disease suppression. Many soils possess similarities with regard to microorganisms involved in disease suppression, while other attributes are unique to specific pathogen-suppressive soil systems. The organisms operative in pathogen suppression do so via diverse mechanisms including competition for nutrients, antibiosis and induction of host resistance. Nonpathogenic Fusarium spp. and fluorescent Pseudomonas spp. play a critical role in naturally occurring soils that are suppressive to Fusarium wilt. Suppression of take-all of wheat, caused by Gaeumannomyces graminis var. tritici, is induced in soil after continuous wheat monoculture and is attributed, in part, to selection of fluorescent pseudomonads with capacity to produce the antibiotic 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol. Cultivation of orchard soils with specific wheat varieties induces suppressiveness to Rhizoctonia root rot of apple caused by Rhizoctonia solani AG 5. Wheat cultivars that stimulate disease suppression enhance populations of specific fluorescent pseudomonad genotypes with antagonistic activity toward this pathogen. Methods that transform resident microbial communities in a manner which induces natural soil suppressiveness have potential as components of environmentally sustainable systems for management of soilborne plant pathogens.

AB Mercaptans, particularly ethylene glycol bisthioglycolate (EGB), were found to be extremely efficient photo-reversion inhibitors of TMP and peroxide bleached TMP (BTMP) handsheets. The inhibition was only sustainable if the mercaptans remained in the handsheet. Irradiated TMP handsheets were restored to their original state following treatment with EGB, suggesting that the observed reversion inhibition resulted from a removal of yellow species as they were formed rather than a true inhibition of their formation. Similar tests on BTMP handsheets revealed that EGB was unable to completely restore irradiated samples to their original state, so mechanisms involving the removal of Coloured species as they form as well as inhibition of their formation occur simultaneously.

AB In the upper agricultural belt of the tropical Andes, above 3000 m of altitude, long fallow agriculture is commonly used to produce potatoes and cereals. This agricultural system alternates short intervals of production (2-4 years) with long fallow periods (generally 5-10 years or more). In order to analyse soil changes related to the rapid fertility loss during the production interval and soil fertility restoration during the fallow period, the soils of two adjacent but contrasting plots were compared. One plot had passed through 15 years of fallow (restored) and the other had been cultivated with potatoes for three consecutive years after a 12 years fallow period (depleted). The soils were analysed for fresh C- and N-microbial biomass, inorganic N and physical-chemical properties. Then, the soils were incubated under controlled laboratory conditions for 81 days, with and without the addition of C-14 labelled wheat straw. During the incubation, periodic measurement of C- and C-14-CO2 release, C- and C-14-microbial biomass, N-microbial biomass and inorganic N were performed. The most pronounced difference between the fresh soils was in the microbial biomass, which was almost double the amount in the restored soil with respect to the depleted soil. During the incubation, the total amounts of soil native C and N mineralised were significantly higher in the restored soil. Also the mineralisation of the added C-14-labelled straw was faster in the restored than in depleted soil. These results suggest that the fallow period leads to an increase in the labile C and N pools and microbial biomass, which represent more carbon and nitrogen availability for microorganisms and plants and could be related to fertility restoration. A very high stability of the organic matter in these mountain soils was also revealed and its implications for agricultural sustainability are discussed. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB The workshop, "Aquaculture and its role in Integrated Coastal Zone Management" held in Ostende, Belgium in April 2001, aimed to provide information to help develop recommendations for wise management of aquaculture in coastal and marine environments. This paper focuses on the two main objectives of the workshop, 1) to aid the development of stronger interdisciplinary communication between the natural and social sciences and to improve the utility of available scientific information and knowledge; and 2) to promote new perspectives on the sustainable use of coastal areas and natural resources. The paper also summarizes the debates following each of the three workshop thematic sessions: aquaculture and ICZM; socio-economic and political dimensions; developing sustainable production systems; and identifies the key recommendations that may be applied to the formulation of policy on integrated aquaculture management in coastal and marine environments.

SO AQUACULTURE INTERNATIONAL

DT Article
DE aquaculture; Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM); management;
   participatory fora; policy; sustainable development and uncertainty
AB The hypothesis that forms the basis of debate for this paper is that in order for the European aquaculture industry to achieve its growth potential in terms of consumer and public acceptance then it must establish participatory fora that adopt open and transparent discussions on the current and future issues surrounding sustainable development. Fundamental to this goal is effective communication of easy-to-digest information. Also, interested parties should be given the option to be involved in the development of recommendations.
   This paper recommends among others the following measures:
   Full adoption of the Integrated Coastal Zone Management Strategy, based on a multidisciplinary framework and extended peer-reviews;
   More openness and debate, including the broadening of perspectives, regarding the issues of sustainability and food safety;
   The wider use of various participatory mechanisms on different levels, e. g. through national consensus conferences.

AB Aquaculture has been the world's fastest growing source of food, with fin fish and shellfish production expanding by an average compound rate of growth of 10.9%. This is a rate of growth faster than that of terrestrial meat production. The paper describes policies that can promote aquaculture. The focus is on commercial (for profit) aquaculture, but subsistence aquaculture is indirectly included on the assumption that the two systems are complementary, rather than mutually exclusive.

AB 1. The rich zooplankton, fish and squid resources on the Patagonian Shelf sustain substantial populations of largely resident seabirds and marine mammals, These habitats are also visited seasonally by similar species from elsewhere but few data exist on their status and origin. Recent studies, using satellite-tracking to determine foraging ranges and feeding areas of seabirds and am marine mammals breeding at South Georgia, have shown that several species make substantial use of the waters of the Patagonian Shelf.
   2. Wandering albatrosses use shelf-edge areas year-round with direct observations of both sexes of almost all age classes, including, breeding, pre-breeding and non-breeding individuals. White-chinned petrels and female Northern and Southern giant petrels mainly visit during incubation and post-breeding, particularly to the Falklands Current (White-chinned petrels) and to upwelling areas around the southern shelf-break from the Burdwood Bank in the cast to Staten Island and Diego Ramirez in the west (giant petrels). Northern giant petrel males during incubation and Antarctic fur seals in winter reach inner shelf habitats in the northern sector. In contrast, South Georgia populations of black-browed and grey-headed albatrosses do not appear to use the Patagonian Shelf at any stage of their breeding cycle.
   3. Although the use of the Patagonian Shelf by visiting species is now best documented for South Georgia species, recent observational data confirm that seabirds from Diego Ramirez, Tristan da Cunha and Gough visit the southern and northern sectors, during both breeding and non-breeding seasons respectively. Several Antarctic species (notably Antarctic fulmar and cape petrel) winter in the region as do at least two albatross species from New Zealand; other species (especially Wilson's storm petrels) use it as a staging ground on migration, as do several species of baleen whales and possibly other cetacean species.
   4. Three of the seabird species which breed on the Patagonian Shelf are Globally Threatened; seven of the visiting species (and four baleen whale species) also have this status. The Patagonian Shelf is, therefore, not only of global importance for the diversity and abundance of its resident top predators but is just as critical for the survival of many visiting species, some of which are even more endangered.
   5. Combining data from satellite-tracking with conventional mapping from direct observations offers the prospect of defining the foraging ranges (and the main feeding areas within these) of a range of key top predator species. Such data should be used, in conjunction with similar information of the distributions of fish, squid and zooplankton resources and of fishing effort, to identify critical marine habitats whose precautionary, multiple-use sustainable management will be vital to protect the interests of both commercial fishers and top predators.

ID PENGUINS
AB 1. The Falkland Islands Government is proud of the successful development of its commercial fishery and sees no reason why it should not continue to be managed in a responsible and sustainable way. However, it recognizes that the fishery is vulnerable to over-fishing, changes in the migration patterns of the principal commercial species and the health of world markets.
   2. To widen its economic base, the Falkland Islands Government is seeking to promote farm diversification and eco-tourism, to further develop its commercial fishery, and to encourage offshore oil exploration and development in areas under its jurisdiction.
   3. It recognizes the value and importance of its wildlife populations and habitats but sees no reason why economic development and environmental protection should be mutually exclusive, provided that suitable measures are adopted to control development and protect the environment, a precautionary approach is applied, all potential risks to the environment are carefully assessed and remedial measures taken to avoid or minimize any adverse impacts. Extensive new legislation has already been enacted, baseline survey work undertaken and further environmental research commissioned.
   4. The Government accepts that additional wildlife habitats and populations need to be afforded environmental protection through designation as National Nature Reserves (NNR) and Marine Nature Reserves (MNR) and thereafter managed effectively. It recognizes that much more environmental research needs to be carried out and, to that end, is willing to seek expert guidance on the future direction of that research, to co-operate with other governments or organisations in the carrying out of that research and to contribute financially to further environmental research in and around the Falkland Islands.

AB This paper presents an overview of water resources issues in the context of world population growth, climate change, and variability, and provides examples of how these issues affect local and regional water policy concerns. Also discussed. is the associated research of the international scientific community in regard to physically-based modeling of the hydrological cycle, with special focus on the Global Energy and Water cycle EXperiment (GEWEX) Programme. The critical role of precipitation measurements for climate model accuracy is emphasized, with a review of several satellite methods and strategies for improving precipitation measurements. Finally, the impact of semiarid regions on global hydrologic issues is underscored with a review of research conducted by SAHRA, the National Science Foundation Science and Technology Center dedicated to Sustainability of semi-Arid Hydrology and Riparian Areas.

AB Earth Systems Science has made significant strides over the last decade in developing consistent, high quality, spatially-contiguous, and in many cases real-time bioegoephysical data sets. Many of these data sources depict key elements of the land-based water cycle. To date, this information has been poorly integrated into global water assessment and vulnerability studies. This paper presents a review of newly-emerging Earth Systems Science products together with a strategy for entraining these into global water assessments. The text highlights several conceptual, technical, and institutional obstacles that require attention before a successful integration can be realized. A major challenge rests in developing a common conceptual framework and nomenclature to bridge gaps between the physical sciences and current generation of water resource assessments, which have traditionally relied heavily on descriptive case studies and a socioeconomic approach. Another goal of this paper is to better articulate the scope of human control of the terrestrial water cycle - beyond climate change alone and to quantify its impact on sustainable water supplies. Opportunities for integration across disciplines are identified, and specific recommendations are formulated. An argument is made for the unique role that geographically-referenced continental and global-scale analysis can play in future assessments of freshwater resources and water-related vulnerability.

AB National scale assessments of global water scarcity predict that by 2050 as much as 66% of the world's future population will experience some water stress and that water requirements for food production will be a major issue. However, practical planning and management of water resources requires models with greater spatial and temporal resolution. Such models give improved (higher) estimates of the number of people at risk and how these might change as the population grows. Further improvements to these models require local/basin scale water resource data and, ultimately, the integration of relevant social, economic, institutional and legal information. An example of how progress might be made with this complex task of integration is given in the paper.
   Although the above models are important for the identification and management of water resources issues, the crux of the food production issue lies in improving the efficiency with which food is produced from existing water and land resources. Water use efficiency I can be increased in irrigated and rainfed systems using both physical and non-physical means. Substantial improvements are possible by maximizing transpiration and/or increasing the yield per unit of water transpired. The former is most practicable in systems with low water use efficiency and can be achieved mainly via managerial and/or institutional improvements, while the latter is more appropriate in systems with higher water use efficiency, via introducing agronomic and/or other technical improvements. There is also scope for improving water use efficiency and food production by considering larger catchment scales, where water can be recycled within irrigation schemes or moved between different rainfed parts of the landscape. This holistic approach to catchment water management allows the upstream/downstream impacts of improvements in agricultural water use efficiency to be taken into account and further emphasises the need for integration of both physical information and socio-economic factors if truly sustainable solutions are to be achieved. Future global change research, in both the physical and social sciences, has a major role to play in addressing this real and immediate challenge.

ID UNCERTAINTY
AB Current regimes in resource management are often unsustainable as judged by ecological, economic and social criteria. Many technological resource management regimes are inflexible and not built to adapt to changes in environmental, economic or social circumstances. This inflexibility poses problems in a world characterized by fast change. The water sector is currently undergoing major processes of transformation at local, regional and global scales. Today's situation is challenged by uncertainties, e.g., in water demand (diminishing in industrialized countries, rising in developing countries), by worsening water quality, by pressure for cost-efficient solutions, and by fast changing socio-economic boundary conditions. One expects additional uncertainties, due to climate change, such as a shift in the pattern of extreme events. Hence, new strategies and institutional arrangements are required to cope with risk and change in general. When one considers processes of transformation and change, the human dimension is of particular importance. Institutions and rule systems may cause resistance to change but can also enable and facilitate necessary transformation processes. This paper explores conceptual approaches in social learning and adaptive management. It introduces agent-based modelling, and the link between analytical modelling and participatory approaches as promising new developments to explore and foster changes towards sustainability and the required transformations in technological regimes and institutional settings.

AB Food fortification has played a significant role in the current nutritional health and well-being of populations in industrialized countries for over 70 years. A relative lack of a concentrated food processing chain, less developed commercial markets, and relatively low consumer awareness and demand have hindered the same application of the intervention in the transitional, and even more, in the least developed countries until quite recently. The present paper reviews fortification of foods with micronutrients in advantaged (industrialized), transitional (developing) and least developed countries briefly, including reference to bio-fortification, examining some of the public health issues involved. There are different needs and challenges in getting this technology accepted and making it sustainable. Primary constraints in reaching poor target populations are adequate availability, accessibility, and quality assurance/quality control. The paper then examines some issues of risk and benefit and the communication of these, and finally looks towards the future and draws some conclusions. Despite these issues there has been an enormous increase in fortification programmes over the last couple of decades in developing countries. Along with dietary diversification, supplementation and related public health and private sector interventions, this has resulted in considerable progress in reducing the prevalence of vitamin A and iodine deficiencies, but much less so with iron, even as zinc and folic acid deficiencies have emerged as significant public health problems. Food fortification based on sound principles and supported by clear policies and regulations will play an increasingly large role in the progress towards the prevention and control of micronutrient malnutrition. Success and sustainability require clear communication of the small risks involved and the substantial benefits, particularly to populations with significant levels of micronutrient malnutrition, as a complementary approach with other public health measures, in reducing the prevalence of deficiencies and their health consequences.

AB The potential for new functional foods and substantial modification of traditional foods presents unprecedented opportunities and new challenges to the public health community. The technical advances that enable these possibilities presumably present an efficient, cost-effective, and sustainable means of improving human health and preventing nutrition-related diseases. Directed manipulation of the food supply, however, presents risks that also must be considered and monitored carefully to avoid known adverse consequences associated with elevated nutrient intakes. Additionally, more research is necessary to understand the subtle effects and long-term consequences that result from elevated individual nutrient intakes on human health and disease risk through changes in gene expression and genome stability. Growing awareness that genetic variation influences both nutrient requirements and upper levels of safe intake require that the risks and benefits associated with manipulation of the food supply be considered at the individual and population levels. In the present report current approaches and limitations to the precise manipulation of the food supply are considered in light of recent efforts to prevent neural tube defects by increasing the population's dietary folic acid intake.

AB Carbohydrates, from food, have a high degree of acceptability in the human diet as safe and are usually associated with other important nutrients, notably protein and various micronutrients (vitamins and minerals), but also biologically advantageous phytochemicals, although there is a wide spectrum of nutrient (or food component) densities between grains, root and other vegetables and fruits. As the human diet has evolved, less nutritious forms of edible carbohydrate have been in evidence, because of refining and co-presentation with fat (e.g. a sugary pastry). These are nutritional safety issues in their own right. But, as newer food formulations develop, greater attention can be paid to the chemical (which simple sugars, oligosaccharides or polysaccharides), physical (the food structure retained or conferred) or functional properties (glycaemic, digestible, fermentable) of the carbohydrate, along with the presence or absence of companion compounds (macro-, micro- and phyto-nutrients). These developments present opportunities and limitations in altering physiology and health outcomes and create new risk-benefit relationships. More now needs to be understood by food and nutrition policy makers, manufacturers and health-care professionals about the future of such foods, how they will influence food choice, what the regulatory arrangements will be, and how their use will be monitored for safety, sustainability and health.

AB Australia's food and health patterns are inextricably and increasingly linked with Asia. Indigenous Australians arrived in the continent via Asia and have linguistic connections with people who settled in south India; there was interaction and food trade between both South-East Asia and China and northern indigenous Australians over thousands of years. After European settlement in 1788, there have been several and increasing (apart from the period of the infamous White Australian Policy following the Colonial period and Independence, with Federation, in 1901) waves of Asian migration, notably during the gold rush (Chinese), the building of the overland Telegraph (Afghans), the Colombo Plan and Asian student education in Australia from the 1950s onwards (South-Eeast Asians), and with refugees (Vietnamese and mainland Chinese), and business (late twentieth century) and progressive family reunion. Each wave has injected additional food cultural elements and caused a measure of health change for migrants and host citizens. Of principal advantage to Australia has been the progressive diversification of the food supply and associated health protection. This has increased food security and sustainability. The process of Australian eating patterns becoming Asianized is evident through market garden development (and the introduction of new foods), fresh food markets and groceries, restaurants and the development of household cooking skills (often taught by student boarders). Most of the diversification has been with grain (rice), legumes (soy), greens, root vegetables, and various 'exotic fruits'. Food acculturation with migration is generally bi-directional. Thus, for Asians in Australia, there has been a decrease in energy expenditure (and a lower plane of energy throughput), an increase in food energy density (through increased fat and sugary drink intakes), and a decrease in certain health protective foods (lentils, soy, greens) and beverages (tea). This sets the stage for 'eco-diseases'. In a population probably genetically programmed (but modifiably) in utero to abdominal obesity, diabetes (type 11 and gestational) and cardiovascular disease, these conditions may be rapidly acquired on migration, along with certain cancers (breast, colo-rectal and prostate). Thus, whilst Asian migration to Australia has provided health opportunities for host citizens, there have been threats to migrant citizens in regard to nutrition-related health.

AB Digital libraries are at a point in their progression where many have been well established. Furthermore, groups in the field have begun to develop best practices in areas such as digitization and metadata architecture. However, other areas have been less discussed, namely the organizational and management issues that digital libraries must address. These issues include staffing, collaboration among departments or institutions, budgeting, and the strategies that digital libraries use to ensure long-term sustainability for projects. Panelists in this session will discuss the strategies that they have used to meet the organizational and management needs of their digital library projects.

AB The Internet has been called the technology of the century because it is expected to reduce the development gap between developing countries and developed ones. This article examines the validity of that assertion. The researcher examines Internet use at two levels. The first level is the macrolevel of issues of Internet connectivity in developing countries and the second level is the microlevel of the usability of the World Wide Web (WWW) for information management in a developing country, Botswana. The two research methodologies of content analysis and case study were used for this study. The findings of this study are that entrepreneurs found a Website easy to use, but while there is a need for macropolicy to create national and global environments for using the Internet sustainable connection should not be universal, but should rather be based on the information management needs of a target population. Inherent infrastructural and socio-technical challenges should then be tackled as part of the effort to create a sustainable Internet usage.

AB Insect and mite damage accounts for a significant level (30-70%) of total crop production losses. Conservation and use of plant genetic resources are required to endow crops with pest resistance, as well as to enhance crop yields and nutritional qualities. Advancements in molecular genetic technologies have the potential to facilitate the introgression of insect resistance genes from conserved and unadapted germplasm into cultivated crops. Long-term food security and the sustainability of agricultural productivity worldwide can be enhanced with the conservation and use of global plant genetic resources.

AB Only 0.1% of the world's plant species are grown as crops, and even within these crop species, only a small proportion of the total genetic variability is used in commercial varieties. Here, I address 6 inter-related questions about why it might be desirable to exploit novel germplasm in breeding programs: to exploit plant diversity, to meet continuing breeding objectives in major crops, to develop new crops, to meet new needs from existing crops, to ensure all the world's people benefit from breeding programs, and to ensure the sustainability of crop production. Both species which are rarely cultivated, and genes from accessions and species related to existing crops, can be exploited to meet the need for improvement of agricultural production. Molecular and statistical methods have the potential to speed introduction of novel germplasm-allowing quantitative assessment of diversity, characterisation of desirable genes, tracking of chromosomes, genes, or gene combinations through breeding programs, selection of rare recombination events, and direct gene transfer through transformation. But the challenges of maintaining desirable characters in varieties incorporating novel germplasm, overcoming genetic stability problems, and ensuring safety are considerable.

AB Dryland farming systems are evolving due to sustainability issues and market pressures that impact on growers; levels of atmospheric CO(2) and temperatures, both of which can dramatically impact on crop growth, are increasing at unprecedented levels; subsoil constraints and water stress remain. In this paper I assess the emerging and current environmental challenges to farmers and identify challenges and opportunities for plant breeders. Questions are raised which require debate. For example, crops will soon be growing at atmospheric CO(2) levels more than triple those in which they evolved. Should plant breeders be responding to the anticipated effects of elevated CO(2) and temperature? In other instances, issues are discussed which require immediate research by the plant breeding community. Examples of the latter are breeding crops that maximise water and nutrient use, either by increasing the rooting zone and/or improving the ability to grow roots into inhospitable subsoils; also, breeding crops specifically to overcome constraints imposed by farming systems. Immediate attention to these issues is required to sustain our landscape and agricultural systems as well as enhancing our ability to grow crops for an internationally competitive market place.

AB The Shepparton Irrigation Region Land and Water Salinity Management Plan promotes groundwater pumping and re-use for irrigation where groundwater quality and availability allow dilution with channel water ('conjunctive water use') to levels that produce minimal production losses from annual and perennial pastures used widely for dairying. In addition, municipal and industrial waste waters are used on a smaller scale for irrigating pastures (and crops).
   An upper level of irrigation water salinity (expressed as an electrical conductivity of 0.8 dS/m) is currently recommended in the plan. This recommendation is based on empirical data from experiments on unstocked, perennial pasture collected over 2 decades on red-brown earths in the region.
   While the strategy has, so far, achieved acceptable control of soil salinity levels, while generally maintaining pasture yields, a concern that 'conjunctive water use' may not be sustainable in the long term arises from the sodicity of the groundwater and waste waters. The continual addition of sodium to clay soils, initially low in both sodium and electrolytes (upper 0.5 m depth), risks the soils becoming sodified, with attendant soil physical problems should salts be leached to below threshold electrolyte concentrations, as in winter for example.
   We show that clay soils supporting pastures in the Shepparton Irrigation Region sodify with time under 'conjunctive water use'. We review evidence for adverse effects of such sodification on soil physical properties affecting plant productivity and hydrologic processes important in the long-term sustainability of the strategy. On-farm management implications of the strategy are discussed and important issues for research are identified.

AB Groundwater recharge below ponded rice fields is a significant contributor to rising groundwater levels and the threat of soil and water salinisation. Reduced groundwater recharge is essential for sustainable rice based, irrigated farming systems in southern Australia. Currently a soil is deemed as suitable for rice production if 1 soil profile per 4 ha contains 2 m or more of continuous medium or heavy clay textured material. However, this study showed clay content to be a poor predictor of groundwater recharge. Electromagnetic induction surveys of rice fields can show variation in soil physico-chemical properties across rice fields. This allows the delineation of distinctly different areas of a field based on EM readings and allows accurate targeting of soil sampling and measurements. This study used soil chemical and physical properties and groundwater recharge data to assess the adequacy of the current rice soil suitability classification method. A 3-stage classification scheme of rice land suitability is proposed including EM31 soil mapping and measurement of soil sodicity as key components. The proposed scheme is as follows: (i) include the soil as suitable if the EM31v measurement is equal to or greater than 150 mS/m; (ii) if EM31v <150, include the soil if the ESP of the top 60 cm of the soil is greater than 6, or the ESP of the depth interval between 60 and 150 cm is greater than 12; (iii) all other soils are excluded from ricegrowing. The proposed scheme's ability to correctly identify low permeability soil in rice fields as suitable for rice growing was confirmed by the recharge values measured in these fields.

AB An experiment was established in 1993 on a sodic Vertosol (Vertisol, Typic Haplustert) at Merah North, north-western New South Wales, to evaluate the sustainability of selected irrigated cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.)-rotation crop sequences. Crop sequences were selected following discussions with local cotton growers. The indices used to evaluate sustainability included soil quality, microbiology, yield and profitability. This paper presents data on soil properties [soil organic C, structure as air-filled porosity of oven-dried soil, exchangeable Ca, Mg, K and Na, pH, electrical conductivity (EC1:5) and EC1:5/exchangeable Na in the 0-0.6 m depth], lint yield and profitability (as gross margins/ha and gross margins/ML of irrigation water). The 6 cropping systems sown after minimum tillage were: continuous cotton (R1), long-fallow cotton (R2), cotton-green manured faba bean (Vicia faba L.) (R3), cotton-dolichos (Lablab purpureus L.)-green manured faba bean in the first year followed by cotton-wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) (R4), cotton-dolichos (R5), cotton-fertilised dolichos (with P and K removed by cotton replaced as fertiliser) (R6).
   In 1996, air-filled porosity of oven-dried soil was highest with R4 at the surface but lowest with R1 in the 0.15-0.30 m depth. In subsequent years, air-filled porosity of oven-dried soil was higher with R2 and R4 in the deeper depths, although differences between cropping sequences were small. Air-filled porosity of oven-dried soil increased between 1996 and 1998 in all treatments, and was probably caused by the change from intensive to minimum tillage in 1993, irrigation with moderately saline water and application of gypsum resulting in an increase in EC1:5/exchangeable Na. In general, differences in soil properties such as soil organic C, exchangeable Ca, Mg, K and Na, pH, electrical conductivity (EC1:5) and EC1:5/exchangeable Na between cropping sequences were far less than those which occurred with time. The key changes were decreases in pH, exchangeable sodium percentage, exchangeable cations and organic C between 1994 and 1996, and increases in air-filled porosity of oven-dried soil, EC1:5 and EC1:5/exchangeable Na between 1996 and 1998. A decrease in air-filled porosity of oven-dried soil occurred between 1998 and 1999 as a consequence of preparing land and sowing cotton under very wet conditions. R1 had the highest cumulative gross margin/ha and R3 had the lowest. R2 had the highest cumulative gross margin/ML of irrigation water and R3 again the lowest. Among crop sequences, R2 and R4 gave the best returns with respect to both land and water resources.

TI Transient salinity and subsoil constraints to dryland farming in
   Australian sodic soils: an overview
SO AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL AGRICULTURE

CT International Conference on Sodicity Issues in Agricultural Industries -
   Current Research and Future Directions
CY FEB 28-MAR 01, 2000
CL VICTORIA, AUSTRALIA
AB More than 60% of the 20 million ha of cropping soils in Australia are sodic and farming practices on these soils are mainly performed under dryland conditions. More than 80% of sodic soils in Australia have dense clay subsoils with high sodicity and alkaline pH (>8.5). The actual yield of grains in sodic soils is often less than half of the potential yield expected on the basis of climate, because of subsoil limitations such as salinity, sodicity, alkalinity, nutrient deficiencies and toxicities due to boron, carbonate and aluminate. Sodic subsoils also have very low organic matter and biological activity.
   Poor water transmission properties of sodic subsoils, low rainfall in dryland areas, transpiration by vegetation and high evaporation during summer have caused accumulation of salts in the root zone layers. This transient salinity, not influenced by groundwater, is extensive in many sodic soil landscapes in Australia where the watertable is deep. 'Dryland salinity' is currently given wide attention in the public debate and in government policies, but only focusing on salinity induced by shallow watertables. While 16% of the dryland cropping area is likely to be affected by watertable-induced salinity, 67% of the area has a potential for transient salinity not associated with groundwater and other subsoil constraints and costing the Australian farming economy in the vicinity of A$1330 million per year. A different strategy for different types of dryland salinity is essential for the sustainable management and improved productivity of dryland farming.
   This paper discusses the sodic subsoil constraints, different types of salinity in the dryland regions, the issues related to the management of sodic subsoils and the future priorities needed in addressing these problems. It also emphasises that transient salinity in the root zone of dryland agricultural soils is an important issue with potential for worse problems than watertable-induced seepage salinity.

AB The beef feedlot industry in Australia produces a large amount of solid organic by-product each year that is currently applied to agricultural land as a fertiliser supplement. Manure is known to be a valuable source of organic matter and some plant nutrients, especially nitrogen and phosphorus. In addition, manure contains excessive quantities of cations such as sodium (Na) and potassium (K), which may result in long-term sustainability problems for the soil, particularly when large amounts are applied over short time periods. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of composted beef feedlot manure when applied to agricultural soils.
   Two sites were selected, one a brown Dermosol and the other a red Kurosol, both in north-eastern Victoria near the Rutherglen Research Institute. Both sites received rates of manure up to 109 t/ha in 1996. In 1997 soil samples were collected and compared with untreated control soils. The Dermosol site was sown to an oat and clover mixture in 1996 and 1997 and the red Kurosol was sown to lupin in 1996 and wheat in 1997. The application of composted bovine manure resulted in a 1% increase in soil organic carbon, an increase in soil pH by 1.5 units, increased levels of magnesium, calcium, nitrogen and K in the surface 10 cm soil layer at both sites and an increase in extractable phosphorus levels in the subsoil. There was no detectable increase in surface Na, although there was a small but significant decrease in Na in the 40-80 cm soil layer. It is suggested that soluble organic compounds, migrating down through the soil profile are able to complex with Na and effectively remove some of this cation from the exchange sites of the clay surfaces. In addition, the high porosity of these soils coupled with the high degree of Na mobility ensures that most of this cation is transported deeper into the soil profile. The beneficial effects of applying composted manure are promising as a means of reducing sodicity although these results will require further validation. In addition, the long-term effects of saturating subsurface soil with Na are also a cause for concern and need to be further investigated.

AB Continuous cereal production in the summer-dominant rainfall region of north-eastern Australia has depleted native soil nitrogen fertility to a level where corrective strategies are required to sustain wheat grain yields and high protein levels for domestic and export markets. Annual medic pastures, along with other strategies, were evaluated from 1986 to 1998 on a Vertisol at Warra, southern Queensland, for their benefit to subsequent grain yield and protein content of wheat.
   Annual medic production and nitrogen yields were closely correlated with the growing season rainfall (March-September). Each 100 mm of growing season rainfall resulted in 1.39 t/ha of dry matter and 40 kg/ha of N yield.
   There were significant increases in soil mineralisable nitrogen following annual medic leys compared with continuous wheat in most years, but increases in total soil nitrogen were only observed in 1990, 1991 and 1992. However, pre-plant nitrate-nitrogen following an annual medic ley was always higher than that of continuous wheat without nitrogen fertiliser. This resulted in significant increases in wheat yield (6 of 9 seasons) and grain protein (in all seasons) compared with continuous wheat. The overall responses in yield and protein were similar to those of 50 kg/ha of fertiliser nitrogen applied to continuous wheat crops. A nitrogen harvest budget for the annual medic-wheat rotation over 11 years showed that it contributed 131 kg N/ha more than continuous wheat. Thus, using the seasonal conditions experienced from 1987 to 1998 as a reasonable representation of the rainfall range in the region, sustainable productivity can be maintained where annual medics are grown in short rotations with wheat.

TI Risk mapping of soil acidification under Stylosanthes in northern

DT Article
DE pH; buffer capacity; pedotransfer function
ID PASTURES; SYSTEMS
AB The inclusion of Stylosanthes into pastures and cropping systems has proved to be a low cost method of improving product quality in Asia, Africa, South America, and northern Australia. However, there is recent evidence that accelerated soil acidification has occurred under these production systems, questioning their long-term sustainability. In an effort to assist producers and extension officers in identifying soils that are predisposed to accelerated acidification, an acidity risk map of the Dalrymple Shire in Queensland, Australia, was developed using information from a recently completed land resource survey. Validation of a previously derived pedotransfer function that predicts pH buffering capacity was undertaken using an independent set of soil samples collected from the Shire. Excellent agreement between measured and predicted pH buffering capacity was obtained. The pedotransfer function was used to estimate the pH buffering capacity of 44 soil associations in the Shire. These values were used to predict the number of years that it would take for soils to acidify from their current pH to 5.0 assuming a constant net acid addition rate of 2.1 kmol H+/ha. year. Approximately 62% of the total area of the Shire is predisposed to accelerated acidification and would take between 10-20 years to acidify to pH 5.0. In contrast, a relatively minor proportion of the total area of the Shire (17%) had significant internal buffering capacity. However, the degree of uncertainty associated with these estimations on certain soil associations may be too high to be of relevance. In order to overcome this limitation a field test designed to assess the risk of accelerated acidification on a paddock basis is proposed and outlined in the paper.

TI Groundwater level reductions under lucerne depend on the landform and

AB By 1994, an estimated 1.8 million hectares of cleared land in Western Australia was affected by secondary dryland salinity to some extent. The area affected is likely to double in the next 20 years. The cause of this salinity is excessive recharge under traditional agriculture, leading to rising groundwater levels. To effectively reduce land and water salinity a deep-rooted perennial is needed to mimic the temporal and spatial distribution of leaf area that existed prior to clearing. Previous studies have shown lucerne lowers groundwater levels in areas with favourable conditions.
   We present data showing that lucerne lowered groundwater levels in 4 different landforms and under unfavourable conditions. All sites had very saline groundwater, high sodium chloride chemistry and high groundwater levels. This paper shows that the effectiveness of lucerne in salinity control measures depends on the attributes of the groundwater flow system.

AB Ecosystem management such as plant residue retention and prescribed burning can significantly affect soil organic matter (SOM) composition and, thereby, the closely associated carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycling processes, which underpin terrestrial ecosystem productivity and sustainability. Humic acid (HA) is an important SOM component and its chemical composition has attracted much attention. Here we report the first application of N-14 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to soil HA study, revealing the surprising existence of nitrate-N and ammonia-N in the HAs. This newly discovered HA nitrate-N, though in a relatively low concentrations, is closely related to soil N availability and responsive to plant residue management regimes in contrasting forest ecosystems. The HA nitrate-N may be a useful and sensitive biochemical indicator of SOM quality in response to different ecosystem management regimes.

AB Planting poplars is an effective technology for controlling hill soil erosion in New Zealand pastureland. However, the effects of widely spaced poplars on soil properties are not documented. Soil was sampled from 3 soil depths (0-75, 75-150, and 150-300 mm) in poplar pasture (PP) and adjacent open pasture (OP) systems. Four sites were examined, 3 unreplicated sites with mature poplars (>29 years, 37-40 stems/ha) and a replicated experiment with immature poplars (5 years, 50-100 stems/ha). Pastures at all sites were dominated by low fertility species and were grazed by sheep and cattle. Pasture species were used in a glasshouse experiment to assess the production potential of the topsoil media (0-20 mm) from the PP and OP soils, and the OP topsoil amended with 5% poplar leaf litter.
   Soil pH was higher (0.5-1.2 units) in the PP than the OP at all depths, as were exchangeable cations. After 2 months incubation, OP topsoil amended with 5% leaf litter had higher soil pH than the PP or the OP topsoil. Organic C, total N, P or S, and plant-available P or S were similar in the PP and OP soils, or lower in the PP soil. Soil hydraulic characteristics, macroporosity, water aggregate stability, and bulk density were also similar in the PP and OP areas. The differences in the earthworm numbers and mass between the PP and OP areas were inconsistent. Pasture grown in the PP topsoil produced more over 11 months than treatments containing OP topsoil.
   In addition to increasing the stability and, hence, sustainability of hill soils at risk from erosion, poplar trees enhanced several other key attributes of the soil. The study suggested that poplars have a restoration role by accelerating soil development following the loss of topsoil from an erosion event.

AB Structure and transformation processes of soil organic matter (SOM) are extremely complex, but advancing our knowledge on SOM cycling is a prerequisite for a sustainable soil management. To get a better insight to this issue, we determined the vertical distribution of lignin, carbohydrates, and amino sugars in bulk soils and NaOH-extracts using wet chemical techniques. These results were compared with those obtained by solution C-13 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy after alkaline extraction. Soil samples were taken under a primary forest, a secondary forest, a 20-year-old Pinus kesiya (Royle ex Gordon) reforestation established following 15 years of cultivation, and a cabbage cultivation site in northern Thailand. Significantly lower contents of organic C and N at the cabbage cultivation and reforestation sites indicated that the replacement of forests by arable land at the reforestation and cabbage cultivation sites about 30 years ago resulted in enhanced breakdown of SOM. This means that after 20 years of Pinus growth, reforestation did not lead to a significant build-up of organic matter in the mineral soil. With increasing soil depth the sites showed comparable decreases in soil organic matter, exhibiting a typical pattern of decomposition expressed by a higher degree of side chain oxidation, increasing carboxyl functionality, and a decrease of lignin-derived phenols and aromatic compounds. Microbial contribution to SOM was determined using the carbohydrate and amino sugar biomarker approach. The amino sugars were predominantly of fungal origin in the organic layer. In the mineral soil, bacterial amino sugars dominated and the relative contribution of amino sugars to SOM increased with depth. Comparison of results from wet chemical analyses and of liquid-state C-13 NMR signatures requires that alkaline-extractable organic matter is representative for bulk soil organic matter. This seemed to apply to lignin-derived phenols and amino sugars but not to neutral sugars and uronic acids. Significant correlations were found for lignin-derived phenols with phenolic C (R = 0.74, P < 0.01) for the bulk forest site samples and amino sugars with O-alkyl C (R = 0.93, P < 0.001) for the mineral soil horizons, whereas the carbohydrate contents did not show any clear correlation. Therefore, we concluded that most of the phenolic C signal intensity might be attributed to lignin, and the enrichment of O-alkyl C with depth may be a result of bacterial resynthesis with a significant contribution of amino sugars.

AB Attributes of 21 Vertosols in 2 different regions of Tasmania were assessed using field and laboratory techniques to determine differences associated with 3 local forms of agricultural management ( long-term pasture, rain-fed cropping, and irrigated cropping). Vertosols in the northern Midlands had better physical properties ( lesser bulk density and penetration resistance, and greater porosities and water holding capacities), poorer nutrient status ( lower pH, exchangeable bases, and extractable P), and better biological properties ( greater organic carbon (OC), carbon fractions F1 and F3, and more worms) than south-eastern Vertosols. When adjusted for clay content, cropped sites had less soil OC than pasture sites at 0-75 mm depth. Readily oxidisable ( fraction F1) carbon in the surface 75 mm was 3.6 mg/g and 6.9 mg/g under long-term pasture compared with 2.5 mg/g and 3.9 mg/g in irrigated cropped paddocks on south-eastern and Midlands sites, respectively. Soil organic carbon values were positively correlated with physical and chemical soil properties. Long-term pasture paddocks showed stronger structural development and had smaller aggregates than cropped paddocks, which had more larger clods. Vane shear strength and penetration resistance were less in rainfed cropped paddocks compared with long-term pasture but this effect was not apparent on irrigated cropped paddocks. Farmers considered that a majority of their soil attributes were healthy under all management histories but strategies for maintaining organic matter levels and minimising clod formation by tillage are essential for long-term sustainable use of these Vertosols.

AB In the Melaleuca forest of southern Vietnam, local people practice a traditional technique using rafters to harvest honey and beeswax from the giant native honey bee, A-pis dorsata. Our study was carried out at the state forestry farm of Song Trem, Ca Mau province. Data were collected from interviews with beekeepers and forest holders, as well as local officials. The results show that rafter beekeeping is important in the preservation and sustainable exploitation of the Melaleuca forests, and we suggest some solutions to conflicts that have arisen between the beekeepers and the new forest holders.

ID THUNEN
AB The conference of Rio de Janeiro in 1992 stipulated sustainable development as one of the key objectives agreed at the international level. This paper evaluates important economic contributions Of JOHANN HEINRICH VON THUNEN to the sustainability concept.
   The basis of the discussion are so-called management rules of sustainability, which have been developed by a Commission of Inquiry (Enquete-Kommission) of the German Federal Parliament. In the following parts of the paper, THUNENS location theory, his sophisticated theory of marginal productivity and his theory of capital accumulation are presented in its importance for the sustainability concept. Open questions and limitations of THUNENS theory of capital accumulation are discussed.
   The main topic of the paper focuses on a discussion of THUNENs formula to determine the optimal rotation period of forests. This contribution may be seen as a forerunner of modem ressource theoretical approaches. It is shown that THUNEN found the optimal harvesting period in the case of freely available land. His solution in the case of scarce land is not quite right because of an incorrect assessment of the wood capital stock.
   Nonetheless we have to appreciate that JOHANN HEINRICH VON THUNEN made important contributions to the concept of sustainability without explicitly using this modem term.

AB One of the most important criteria of sustainable agriculture is the maintenance of soil fertility. The favourable ecological features of Hungary will be needed for agricultural production in the future as well. Due to inadequate nutrient supply, the country's nutrient balance has shifted in the past decade. This negative balance endangers soil fertility. Corn and wheat yields as well as the available nutrient content of the soil have shown a clear decrease. The objectives of farming and environmental protection can be achieved together through nutrient management adapted to the specific features and environmental sensitivity of the production site.

AB The production of biogas is based on the natural process of the decomposition of organic material under anaerobic conditions. This process of methan fermentation is suitable especially for the utilisation of animal excrements and plant residues. The local sources of organic material allow the creation of a closed regional material circulation which is a prerequisite for decentralized energy concepts.

AB Samphire Hoe is a newly-created land platform comprising the sub-seabed material excavated during the construction of the Channel tunnel. It represents a unique resource where the arrival and establishment of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) within a sown plant community on a low nutrient substrate can be monitored. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi invasion was monitored in a number of ways: by assessing the degree of root colonisation within the roots of plants on the site, by using a successive trap culture technique to determine AMF species richness, and by using sterile substrate bins to determine the extent of wind-borne and rain-dispersed immigration of AMF propagules into the site. Levels of colonisation of indigenous plants by AMF were high in May-June (the pre-flowering phase of growth for many plants) reflecting the important role of the mycorrhizal symbiosis in dry, low nutrient soils. Twelve species of AMF were identified, representing a relatively high diversity for a recently deposited subsoil. An on-site experiment indicated that inoculum of AMF could enter the site within 8 months and that wind dispersal and/or rain were possible vectors. A field experiment compared the outplanting performance of commercially-produced Elymus pycnanthus seedlings (in a commercial compost with added nutrients) with seedlings produced in a low nutrient substrate and inoculated with AMF isolated from the site (a mixture of 5 species of Glomus) or left uninoculated. After 14 months in the field seedlings, inoculated with the indigenous AMF, had the same tiller production as commercially-produced plants, despite slower initial growth. In contrast, non-mycorrhizal controls grew very poorly with a greater frequency of plant mortality compared with the other treatments. Elymus seedlings inoculated with the indigenous AMF ultimately produced approximately seven times the mean number of seed spikes per surviving plant as commercially-produced seedlings and five times greater weight of seed spike. A phyto-microbial approach to the revegetation of nutrient-poor soils is proposed to stimulate plant successional processes as a economically-viable sustainable input for landscaping anthropogenic sites.

AB Differences between organic and conventional management were investigated for 14 paired topsoil sites (28 fields) from around the south and east of England, the majority being in arable management. Parameters used were soil organic matter content, total nitrogen content and available phosphorus, potassium and magnesium, pH, topsoil depth and shear strength. The aim was to assess differences in management and to draw inferences for sustainable soil management practices. Organically managed topsoils were found to be characterized by deeper plough horizons and higher percentage organic matter, total nitrogen and available P. They had lower shear strengths and were substantially lower in available K than their conventional counterparts. No significant differences in available Mg or pH were found between management classes. It is concluded that soil organic matter content, total N, available P and K, topsoil depth and shear strength were effective 'sustainability indicators'.

TI Effects of ecological agriculture on soil properties and arthropod
   diversity in rice-based cropping systems in floodplain areas in

SO BIOLOGICAL AGRICULTURE & HORTICULTURE
LA English
DT Article
AB Rice farming is practised on 75% of the arable area in Bangladesh and is crucial to the ability of the country to feed its growing population and to enhance the livelihoods of resource-poor farmers. Currently, there are concerns about the sustainability of intensive production systems that are based on inorganic fertilizers and pesticides. This paper describes recent field research conducted by PROSHIKA, a non-government organization promoting ecological farming, and its collaborative partners at two locations in Bangladesh. Ecological farming is compared with conventional rice farming systems with regard to the effects on soil properties and arthropod communities. In 1997, soils were analysed for macro and micronutrients, organic matter content and physical properties. At each location, soil bulk densities were significantly lower (p < 0.05) in fields under ecological farming than in those under conventional management. Fields under ecological farming had higher levels of exchangeable calcium than conventional fields and at one location, Koitta, the cation exchange capacity was also greater. At Koitta, soil organic matter fractions were greater in ecological than in conventional fields. Arthropod densities were low at both locations in the 1999 boro season. Ecological fields at Koitta supported more arthropods than the conventional fields, whereas at Gabtoli the arthropod load in ecological and conventional fields was similar. The relative abundance of plant-feeding insects and natural enemies was similar in ecological and conventional sites at each location. There was no consistent significant difference between the mean grain yields in the conventional fields and in the ecological fields. Taking into account the environmental and health benefits of ecological farming, there is considerable potential to maximize the use of organic material and to reduce unnecessary pesticide usage in rice production in Bangladesh.

AB Two field experiments were established on nutrient poor, sandy soils in Klosterheden National Forest and in Mangehoje Forest Plantation in western Denmark to quantify the effect on site productivity of whole-tree harvesting in early thinnings of Norway spruce, The growth response following biomass removal was investigated for four treatments: (1) no thinning (NT), (2) whole-tree harvesting in which the felled trees were removed immediately after thinning (WTHgreen), (3) whole-tree harvesting in which the felled trees were left to dry in the stand during the following growing season so that some of the nutrient rich parts of the tree such as needles and twigs are returned to the forest floor (WTHdry), and (4) harvesting of stems and coarse branches with needles and twigs being threshed from the branches and left in the stand (SCB).
   The results indicated that WTHgreen might lead to a short-term reduction in stand volume increment of the remaining stand. Comparing the mean annual increment during the first four growing seasons after treatment, using the initial standing volume as a covariate, WTHgreen caused a significant growth reduction of 10-18% at Klosterheden and 5-17% at Mangehoje, compared to the SCB- and WTHdry-treatments. The effect of WTHgreen was attributed to an increased removal of essential nutrients such as N, P and K. The growth response following whole-tree harvesting was confined to the first four growing seasons and the effect of different treatments was not significant when data for all ten growing seasons were analysed.

AB The content of macro-nutrients in stems of hybrid aspen (N, P, K, Ca, Mg, S) was analysed, and nutrient removal at concurrent thinning operations was calculated. Five stands on fertile soils in southern Sweden were used in the study, and stand age spanned from 4 to 15 yr. The average nutrient concentration of the stems decreased with increasing age (1.52 kg N m(-3) at age 4 yr to 0.71 kg N m(-3) at age 15 yr). However, differences in nutrient concentration between trees of varying size within a stand were never observed for N, P. and K, and were only occasionally seen for Ca, Mg, and S. As expected, nutrient concentration always increased with stem height, except for Ca where this pattern was only seen in two of the stands. This means that a biofuel assortment of tops and branches will have higher concentrations of nutrients than merchantable wood, and thereby put the focus even more on growth sustainability and reapplication of nitrogen and ash. Since the share of merchantable wood increases with stem size, the absolute removal of biomass and nutrients in logging residues will decrease with age. In this study, a total of 23-93 kg N ha(-1) was removed in the thinnings. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Australia is highly dependent on cheap fossil fuels for energy generation and under the Kyoto Protocol was one of only three industrialised nations to be granted an increased greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions target. To help meet an effective GHG reduction of at least 20% below expected growth rates for GHG so that there is an increase of only 8% above 1990 levels by 2010, Australia has implemented a mandatory target for electricity retailers to obtain an additional 9.5 TWh yr of electricity from renewable sources by 2010. Forest biomass could be a significant and effective renewable energy source. There is a potentially large supply of low-cost residual woody biomass from sawlog-driven harvesting, thinnings, and wood processing. There are also abundant land clearing residues available, but these sources are not sustainable.
   Various technologies for the conversion of woody biomass to fuels for heat and power generation are outlined: combustion, gasification, carbonisation, densified fuels manufacture, and biochemical conversion. Examples are given of current development and implementation of these technologies in Australia.
   The establishment of new plantation forests can create carbon sinks that are potentially tradeable. Electricity utilities and large power consumers are being encouraged to invest in reforestation and afforestation to offset their carbon emissions. A plan to treble the commercial plantation forest estate by 2020 that is currently being implemented, would offset up to 6% of Australia's GHG emissions during the first Kyoto commitment period (2008-12).

AB Following the Chernobyl accident. changed land use such that the products of the land are radiologically acceptable and assure an economic return is a potentially sustainable remediation option. In this study, Short rotation coppice (SRC) for energy production is evaluated as an alternative land use in contaminated areas. If the radiological and technical feasibility criteria are met, the economic viability of the SRC wood production and conversion of the biofuel to energy is a prerequisite for promotion of this alternative landuse.
   Data were collected for Belarus conditions and the economics of SRC production and conversion side were modelled using the Renewable Energy Crop Analysis Programme (RECAP).
   The profitability of SRC production largely depends on crop yield, harvesting method and price of the delivered biofuel, labour and machinery cost playing a minor role. The required internal rate of return (IRR) of 5% at the production side is only obtained with high biofuel prices (40 EUR t(-1)) and a biomass yield of at least 6 t ha(-1). For appropriate soil conditions., potential SRC yields are high ( 10-12 t ha(-1) yr(-1)). However, in Belarus, most soils are sandy for which yield estimates are too low (5 t ha (-1)) to make production profitable. Cut and chip harvesting is more profitable than stick harvesting.
   On the conversion side, heat and power plant investment schemes are only profitable when industrial energy prices are considered. Systems are not viable at lower domestic rates with IRR being always smaller than the 10% required for industry in Belarus. Large-scale heat conversion systems are the most profitable and revenue may be considerable with the IRR between 16% and 59%. Electricity routes are usually unprofitable. Waste disposal costs are only a small fraction of the total costs and revenue. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Conservation of biodiversity will necessitate choices among areas, taxa, and land-use parterns. Lack of data on distribution and pattern in biodiversity makes these difficult decisions even more problematic for those charged with the conservation and sustainable use of the diversity of life. Quantitative methods have promise in helping with this task in that they allow people to make their values explicit, and they also allow representation and comparison of many different types of data.
   In this article I examine patterns of species richness and range-size rarity, or endemism, in the Neotropics with a data set from the genus Solanum (Solanaccae). Distribution data for 180 species of forest-dwelling solanums were analyzed. Patterns of species richness, range-size rarity (endemism), and several area-selection methods were examined. Montane areas are relatively rich both in all species and in endemic species, with maximal peaks in the Andes. The peak of species richness coincides with the domain (i.e., continental) midpoint (9degrees30' S latitude), suggesting that the pattern observed may be partly due to the geometry of species ranges. The Solanum results are compared with those obtained for other taxonomic groups in the Neotropics, and problems with quantitative data sets in conservation are discussed. Collecting deficit, parochial taxonomy.. and habitat destruction, both historical and current, are all factors that will affect the utility of such analyses. It is clear that if conservation is to work on the ground, we need to know more about what occurs in the montane Neotropics and that continued work at a basic taxonomic level is essential to our ultimate ability to conserve biological diversity.

AB This article investigates the conditions which make it costly for governments to renege on institutional commitments governing monetary policy. Focusing on one such type of commitment - monetary integration - we develop and test a hypothesis which suggests that the presence of parallel international agreements plays an important role in raising the costs of exit for states which might otherwise withdraw from a monetary union. While existing political economy work on credible commitments in the area of monetary policy has had a heavy focus on countries in the European Union, we broaden the inquiry, using quantitative and qualitative evidence from the numerous African countries which have participated in monetary unions over the last forty years. Our results provide strong support for the parallel agreements hypothesis.

ID ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT METHODS; TRENDS
AB A new method for stochastic embodied greenhouse gas emissions modelling of construction materials is proposed. The method progressively integrates process analysis data into a prior probability distribution of embodied greenhouse gas emissions for a given material drawn from a disaggregated expansion of the UK Environmental Accounts. Current analyses of embodied CO2eq emissions, whether performed at the economic sector or individual building system boundary level, are deterministic. Such deterministic models do not allow for the easy analysis of potential CO2eq emissions reductions obtainable through preferential selection of low embodied CO2eq material suppliers within material supply chains. Such analyses are important for assessing the extent to which emissions reductions can be achieved through economic mechanisms which drive preferential selection of low embodied carbon materials back through the supply chain - such as carbon taxes. It is argued that the need for estimating both the uncertainty, and the variability, in embodied CO2eq data is best addressed through the development of a fully stochastic modelling framework, and that such frameworks are methodologically more appropriate for Kyoto Protocol compliance policy formulation.

AB How to finance and provide health care for the more than 1.3 billion rural poor and informal sector Workers in low- and middle-income countries is one of the greatest challenges facing the international development community. This article presents the main findings from an extensive survey of the literature of community financing arrangements, and selected experiences from the Asia and Africa regions. Most community financing schemes have evolved in the context of severe economic constraints, political instability, and lack of good governance. Micro-level household! data analysis indicates that community financing improves access by rural and informal sector workers to needed health care and provides them with some: financial protection against the cost of illness. Macro-level cross-country analysis gives empirical support to the hypothesis that risk-sharing in health financing matters in terms of its impact on both the level and distribution of health, financial fairness and responsiveness indicators..
   The background research done for this article points to five key policies available to governments to improve the effectiveness and sustainability of existing community financing schemes. This includes: (a) increased and well-targeted subsidies to pay for the premiums of low-income populations; (b) insurance to protect against expenditure fluctuations and re-insurance to enlarge the effective size of small risk pools; (c) effective prevention and case management techniques to limit expenditure fluctuations; (d) technical support to strengthen the management capacity of local schemes; and (e) establishment and strengthening of links with the formal financing and provider networks.

AB Since late 1998 the coverage of the DOTS strategy in India has been expanded rapidly. In both 2000 and 2001 the country probably accounted for more than half the global increase in the number of patients treated under DOTS and by early 2002 more than a million patients were being treated in this way in India. As a result, nearly 200 000 lives were saved. The lessons learnt relate to the importance of the following elements of the programme: (1) getting the science right and ensuring technical excellence, (2) building commitment and ensuring the provision of funds and flexibility in their utilization; (3) maintaining focus and priorities; (4) systematically appraising each area before starting service delivery; (5) ensuring an uninterrupted drug supply; (6) strengthening the established infrastructure and providing support for staff; (7) supporting the infrastructure required in urban areas;, (8) ensuring full-time independent technical support and supervision, particularly during the initial phases of implementation; (9) monitoring intensively and giving timely feedback; and (10) continuous supervision.
   Tuberculosis (TB) control still faces major challenges in India. To reach its potential, the control programme needs to: continue to expand so as to cover the remaining half of the country, much of which has a weaker health infrastructure than the areas already covered; increase its reach in the areas already covered so that a greater proportion of patients is treated; ensure sustainability; improve the patient-friendliness of services; confront TB associated with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. It is expected that HIV will increase the. umber of TB cases by at least 10% and by a considerably higher percentage if HIV becomes much more widespread.
   India's experience shows that DOTS can achieve high case-detection and cure rates even, with imperfect technology and often with an inadequate public health infrastructure. However, this can only happen if the delivery programme is appropriately designed and effectively managed.

AB This paper describes (i) how a national health information System was designed, tested and implemented in Papua New Guinea, (ii) how the system was integrated with other management information systems, and (iii) how information has been used to support decision-making. (concludes that central coordination of systems design is essential to make sure that information systems are aligned with government priorities and can deliver the information required by managers. While there is often scope for improving the performance of existing information systems, too much emphasis can be placed on revising data collection procedures and creating the perfect information system. Data analysis, even from imperfect systems, can stimulate greater interest in information, which can improve the quality and completeness of reporting and encourage a more methodical approach to planning and monitoring services. Our experience suggests that senior decision-makers and political leaders can play an important role in creating a culture of information use. By demanding health information, using it to formulate policy, and disseminating it through the channels open to them, they can exert greater influence in negotiations with donors and other government departments, encourage a more rational approach to decision-making that will improve the operation of health services, and stimulate greater use of information at lower levels of the health system. The ability of information systems to deliver these benefits is critical to their sustainability.

AB In 1996, Glaxo Wellcome offered to donate up to a million treatment courses annually of Malarone, a new antimalarial, with a view to reducing the global burden of malaria. The Malarone Donation Programme (MDP) was established the following year. Eight pilot sites were selected in Kenya and Uganda to develop and evaluate an effective, locally sustainable donation strategy that ensured controlled and appropriate use of Malarone. The pilot programme targeted individuals who had acute uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria that had not responded to first-line treatments with chloroquine or sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine. Of the 161 079 patients clinically diagnosed at the pilot sites as having malaria, 1101 (0.68%) met all the conditions for participation and received directly observed treatment with Malarone. MDP had a positive effect at the pilot sites by improving the diagnosis and management of malaria. However, the provision of Malarone as a second-line drug at the district hospital level was not an efficient and effective use of resources. The number of deaths among children and adults ineligible for MDP at the pilot sites suggested that high priority should be given to meeting the challenges of malaria treatment at the community level.

AB Prevention is a core value of any health system. Nonetheless, many health problems will continue to occur despite preventive services. A significant burden of diseases in developing countries is caused by time-sensitive illnesses and injuries, such as severe infections, hypoxia caused by respiratory infections, dehydration caused by diarrhoea, intentional and unintentional injuries, postpartum bleeding, and acute myocardial infarction. The provision of timely treatment during life-threatening emergencies is not a priority for many health systems in developing countries. This paper reviews evidence indicating the need to develop and/or strengthen emergency medical care systems in these countries. An argument is made for the role of emergency medical care in improving the health of populations and meetings expectations for access to emergency care. We consider emergency medical care in the community, during transportation, and at first-contact and regional referral facilities. Obstacles to developing effective emergency medical care include a lack of structural models, inappropriate training foci, concerns about coat, and sustainability in the face of a high demand for services. A basic but effective level of emergency medical care, responds to perceived and actual community needs and improves the health of populations.

ID MICROFINANCE; GROWTH
AB Although success stories of microcredit schemes from Asia have generated a lot of enthusiasm among development practitioners about the prospects of rural poverty alleviation, informed opinion is still sharply divided on the efficacy of this instrument in Africa. Using evidencefrom FINCA-Malawi, this paper empirically questions the replicability of Grameen-type banks in Africa. While the credit scheme was financially sustainable and FINCA clients had higher savings, working capital and business expenditure, these did not translate into higher household consumption. Clients' risk aversion in investment and uncharacteristically high turnover rates seem to explain the low program impact on the household economy.

ID CARBON SEQUESTRATION
AB We evaluated the soil chemistry, plant species composition, and forest growth rate on a site where a site amelioration project had been realized 30 years earlier. The initial goal of the project was the improvement of a site that had been degraded by litter raking. We wanted to know which amelioration method produced a sustainable result and how different treatments might be rated by today's standards. Treatments included fertilization, underplanting with N-fixing plants, and a combination of both. The amelioration was combined with stand conversion by means of natural regeneration and spruce underplanting. In all treatments, a spruce-dominated stand replaced the secondary pine stand. The biomass of the formerly recalcitrant forest floor (143 Mg.ha(-1)) was reduced by 30 to 50% in treated plots, thereby reducing the total soil pool of C, N, and exchangeable cations. The mineral soil of treated plots was enriched with N, Ca, and Mg. An increase in pH was restricted to the forest floor. The C pool of treated soils was much smaller than that of the control plots. However, the loss from the soil was at least partly offset by increased growth rates of the aboveground tree biomass. In treated plots, the stem volume was more than twice that of control plots (38.3 m(3)). Soil chemical data and the composition of the ground vegetation suggest that even the control plots have changed compared with pre-treatment conditions. Comparison of different blocks of the experiment suggests that the exclusion of roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) by fencing was the most significant treatment required for successful stand conversion. Prior to fencing, deer browsing inhibited the establishment of a new stand.

AB Today most german rivers are flow regulated by dams. They form a barrier for migrating fish species like salmon and are one cause for sustainable disturbances of the ecosystem even to extinction of several fish species. Our question is how to distribute financial resources to improve fish passage systems to obtain a maximal effect. We present a concept to model up- and downstream fish migration with an individual based approach. It allows us to test different strategies of resource distribution. We give an example modelling a part of the river Moselle in Germany and discuss further extensions.

AB Understanding of urban growth process is highly crucial in making development plan and sustainable growth management policy. As the process involves multi-actors, multi-behavior and various policies, it is endowed with IF unpredictable spatial and temporal complexities, it requires the occurrence of new simulation approach, which is process-oriented and has stronger capacities of interpretation. In this paper, A cellular automata-based model is designed for understanding the temporal process of urban growth by incorporating dynamic weighting concept and project-based approach. We argue that this methodology is able to interpret and visualize the dynamic process more temporally and transparently.

By contrast, this is a description of a practical solution implemented in 2001 at our chemical manufacturing :site in Switzerland. In summary it can be said that sustainable development leads to a reduction in costs and a reduction in paperwork leaves more time for business. We therefore needed to set up just one simple management system for our tasks of preparing animal feed, food additives, pharmaceuticals and antibiotic products. We have found a way to create an integrated management system which takes account of the different regulations and responsibilities which exist in a large company like Roche, and of different legislations, ISO systems and GMP requirements.

AB Information- and communication technologies as they are available by Internet can be used for the management of products life cycle. In the future it will be possible to link all technical products to the Internet and to supervise their life with economic and environmental aspects. Behind of the development of Internet there are theories like the agent theory and standards like XML, which allow the realization and efficient usage of flexible open networks to optimize each products technical usage. Assembly and disassembly are main processes in the life cycle, which finalize products and ensure their utilization. Taking into account the development of modular intelligent products there are new sustainable strategies for manufacturers. They need platforms to manage products and to add value in the after sales processes. This paper includes a definition of an overall platform for life Cycle management based on Internet and agent theories. It focuses on aspects of assembly and LCM of high quality capital goods like assembly systems.

AB In the last two decades, the problems related to the preservation of the environment and the resources of the planet have been dramatically highlighted by different phenomena (thinning of ozone layer, greenhouse effect, decreasing of forests, air pollution, increasing difficulties in the industrial and domestic waste management, etc.). In order to face this situation, the governments have begun to apply rules to control some aspects of the industrial production and energy. Consequently, the environment has become an interesting issue also for the researchers.
   A key-point in these new techniques, grouped under the name of "sustainable development", is the disassembly and recycling of the end-of-life goods, necessary to minimize the environmental impact of discarded materials and energy consumption.
   In this keynote paper the state of the art of the software tools developed to help the designer and the dismantler in the optimization of the disassembly-for-recycling of discarded goods is discussed. The architecture of a complete and general computer aided disassembly planning system is described and a number of system developed both in the academic institutes and in the industry are shown together a review and classification of the different adopted solutions.

AB Recycling of crop residues is essential to integrated and sustainable agricultural management system. Thus, it is of crucial importance to study the decomposition of these residues particularly in the humid-tropics. A litterbag experiment was carried out on an acid soil of the humid tropics of Malaysia. Haulm from groundnut and stover from were placed inside nylon 2 mm mesh bags (20 cm X 20 cm) and placed on the soil surface in the field with a groundnut-maize rotation system. A total of 21 bags for maize and an equal number for groundnut residues were placed in a field plot. Three bags of each residue type were retrieved at 1. 3, 5, 7, 9, 11 and 13 weeks of decomposition. The decomposed tissue was analyzed for remaining dry matter weight (DMW), nitrogen (N), carbon (C), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), calcium (Ca), and magnesium (Mg) contents. Dry matter disappearance rate constant (0.158% week(-1)) from groundnut haulm was significantly (P = 0.01) faster than that from maize stover (0.099% week(-1)). A 50% loss of residue N was found after 2 weeks for maize residues and only 1.5 weeks for groundnut residues. Generally, nutrient loss from both residues was in the order of K greater than or equal to P = N = Mg greater than or equal to Ca. The results indicated that sowing time of subsequent crop after residue application is crucial to synchronize nutrient release with plant uptake.

AB Few experiments in the coastal plain region of the southeastern United States have reported the effect of long-term tillage and tillage intensity on chemical soil quality indicators. The purpose of this study was to determine the 17-year influence of four tillage systems on chemical soil quality indicators in a Benndale fine sandy loam (coarse-loamy, siliceous, semiactive, thermic, Typic Paleudults) and a Lucedale very fine sandy loam (fine-loamy, siliceous, subactive, thermic, Rhodic Paleudults) in the coastal plain region of Alabama. Tillage systems were no-tillage, disk, moldboard plow, and chisel plow under varied double-cropping in a randomized complete block design with four replications. Soil pH, sum of extractable bases, soil organic carbon (SOC), and soil nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), potassium (K), zinc (Zn), manganese (Mn), copper (Cu), and iron (Fe) were determined on soil samples collected at depths of 0-2.5, 2.5-7.5, 7.5-15.0, 15.0-22.5, and 22.5-30 cm. Soil carbon (C) accumulation occurred primarily in the top 2.5 cm, varied by soil type, and was inversely proportional to tillage intensity. The coarse textured Benndale soil averaged 27.6, 13.1, 12.7, and 10.4 g C kg(-1) soil with no-tillage, disk, chisel, and moldboard plow management, respectively, in the top 2.5 cm. The finer textured Lucedale soil averaged 16.7, 10.0, 9.8, and 6.9 g C kg(-1) soil, for the same treatments and depth, respectively. Surface applications of lime maintained soil pH at an acceptable level within the plow layer on both soil types and all tillage systems. Extractable P was higher with no-tillage than moldboard plowing to the 22.5 cm depth on the Lucedale soil. On the Benndale soil, P tended to accumulate at the 15 to 22.5 cm depth with tillage systems other than moldboard plowing, and no-tillage had the most extractable P at these depths. Soil C and pH combined proved effective as continuous pedotransfer functions, predicting 73% and 86% of the variation in sum of extractable bases for the Benndale and Lucedale soils, respectively. As determined from chemical indicators of soil quality, adoption of conservation tillage with doublecropping is a sustainable practice for these soils.

AB Soil testing determines nutrient, lime, gypsum or S, leaching requirements for crops, and potential elemental toxicity to crops and/or their consumers. The majority of farmers do not use soil testing or use higher or lower than economic optimum nutrient rates. Shortcomings of the current soil testing methodology are inability to predict yields, large soil test spacial and temporal variability, inability to reflect dynamics of field parameters that affect nutrient availability, lack of accurate tests for nutrient mineralization, and lack of accurate nutrient response functions. In situ chlorophyll and quick sap tests; or remote sensing with variable rate technology (VRT) can overcome some of soil testing problems. Nutrient uptake efficiencies are low due to the lack of well-funded research efforts on breeding crops with better root systems and nutrient uptake efficiencies. Skogley's diffusion-dependent resin test, with a long equilibrium time, should be used as a standard to evaluate other soil tests, instead of the current resin test which requires shaking the soil and resin. The AB-DTPA test of Soltanpour and Schwab better reflected the effect of texture on P availability than Olsen NaHCO3 or Mehlich 3 tests due to its narrower solution to soil ratio. We give new field calibration P levels for AB-DTPA. Mulvaney's test for soil organic N availability index shows promise and should be evaluated. We will discuss the available best nutrient management strategies and our projection of future needs. Future nutrient management systems should be developed by regional cooperation between environmental soil scientists, geneticists, and economists.

AB The physical and chemical properties of sandy tin tailings are unsuitable for agricultural purpose without proper fertilizer and crop management practices. Malaysia has a vast area (200,000 ha) of abandoned, barren sandy tailings. An attempt was made to convert these lands into a sustainable production by planting of pineapple using fertilization and irrigation techniques. Therefore, the objective of the study was to determine the optimum rate of fertilizer for the growth and the production of high quality pineapple, cv. Josapine, for fresh consumption. The fertilizers used were prepared from mixture of urea, triple superphosphate, muriate of potash, gypsum, kieserite, and copper sulfate, and the respective rates (in oxide form) of fertilizers in kg ha(-1) were (i) Plot 1L: 872, 24,400,108, 24, and 2, (ii) Plot 2L: 750, 48, 266, 84, 36, and 3, and (iii) Plot 3L: 600, 72, 798, 108, 24, and 3.2. For each plot, a similar quantity of Fe, B, Mn, Zn, and Mo was added. There were 32 plants in each sub-unit (for the three classes of ground suckers used-A, B, and Q in each treatment. The plant parameters, soil and plant analyses were determined during this period. There were significant (p less than or equal to 0.01) differences in the plant height, number of leaf and "D"-Ieaf area for each sub-unit with time. The fruits in sub-unit "A" showed significant (p less than or equal to 0.05) increases of fruit diameter and length and total acidity. The optimum rate of fertilizer used for growth and production of pineapple, cv. Josapine, on sandy tin tailings was for plot 1L.

AB In view of the high cost of chemical fertilizers, use of natural fertilizer sources for increasing crop production on a sustainable basis has become imperative. A pot experiment was conducted in silty clay loam, mixed, hyperthermic typic calciustepts, and Tarnab soil series to study the effect of different levels of humic acid (HA) derived from lignitic coal on the growth of maize (Zea mays L. Kissan). HA was sprayed on soil at the rate of 0, 50, 100, 150, 200, 250, and 300 mg kg(-1) soil along with uniform dose of nitrogen-phosphorus-potassium (NPK) (120-90-60 kg ha(-1)). The addition of 50 and 100 mg kg(-1) HA caused significant (P < 0.05) increase of 20 and 23% in shoot and 39 and 32% in root dry weight of maize plants as compared to control. The increasing levels of HA above 50 and 100 mg kg(-1) produced no significant effect on maize yield. Soil organic matter content was improved slightly (7 to 14%) and pH values were decreased by 0.2 to 0.3 unit. by the HA treatments. Addition of HA increased soil N concentration and plant N accumulation significantly (P < 0.05) over control with no significant differences within the treatments of different levels of HA applied. Soil P concentration improved significantly (P < 0.05) by the addition of 200 mg kg(-1) HA whereas plant P accumulation was not significantly affected by the application of different levels of HA. Micronutrients [zinc (Zn), iron (Fe), manganese (Mn), and copper (Cu)] concentrations of soil and their accumulations by maize plants increased nonsignificantly over control by the application of HA. Laboratory incubation experiment conducted to study the effect of HA on soil biological and physicochemical properties showed that the addition of 0.5 and 1.0 kg ha(-1) HA promoted CO2 evolution, increased bacterial population by 355% to 476%, fungi 610 to 716%, and cation exchange capacity of the soil by 13.8 to 28.9%. Results suggest that increases in growth of maize due to HA addition may be associated with the improved biochemical environment of the soil.

AB The thesis of this paper is that the "rational fool" syndrome can be applied to mainstream public sector agricultural research that is conducted in a way that is rational in the short term, but acts against its own long-term viability. Historically, a main concern of such research has been to maximize high levels of food production together with low prices to consumers. As a result, mainstream agricultural science has ignored negative impacts or externalities, which has contributed to a crisis of credibility with the general public and politically sensitive decision makers. A long-term strategic research agenda for the public sector is being defined that is new and relevant to present efforts to integrate natural resource management and sustainable agricultural production. Such an agenda must be understood as a way of managing natural resources for the production of food and environmental services essential to human well-being. If agricultural systems are viewed and managed as parts of whole ecosystems, the key properties of complex systems that need to be taken into account will force researchers to consider long-term effects and environmental externalities. Research products will then be increasingly strategic in nature, and the research process will be "democratized" as it involves and gains the support of a broad set of stakeholders. Private sector research cannot be expected to meet this need because strategic studies of resource management are required that cannot be made exclusive or proprietary and are, in other words, public goods. Several innovative research initiatives are under way that signal opportunities for change. This paper first elaborates on this argument and then illustrates key elements of the integrated natural resource management approach, with examples of approaches that show promise as alternatives to mainstream agricultural science. Although numerous and diverse, integrated approaches manifest several properties that can be defined as the keystones of a new paradigm.

AB Human adaptation remains an insufficiently studied part of the subject of climate change. This paper examines the questions of adaptation and change in terms of social-ecological resilience using lessons from a place-specific case study. The Inuvialuit people of the small community of Sachs Harbour in Canada's western Arctic have been tracking climate change throughout the 1990s. We analyze the adaptive capacity of this community to deal with climate change. Short-term responses to changes in land-based activities, which are identified as coping mechanisms, are one component of this adaptive capacity. The second component is related to cultural and ecological adaptations of the Inuvialuit for life in a highly variable and uncertain environment; these represent long-term adaptive strategies. These two types of strategies are, in fact, on a continuum in space and time. This study suggests new ways in which theory and practice can be combined by showing how societies may adapt to climate change at multiple scales. Switching species and adjusting the "where, when, and how" of hunting are examples of shorter-term responses. On the other hand, adaptations such as flexibility in seasonal hunting patterns, traditional knowledge that allows the community to diversity hunting activities, networks for sharing food and other resources, and intercommunity trade are longer-term, culturally ingrained mechanisms. Individuals, households, and the community as a whole also provide feedback on their responses to change. Newly developing co-management institutions create additional linkages for feedback across different levels, enhancing the capacity for learning and self-organization of the local inhabitants and making it possible for them to transmit community concerns to regional, national, and international levels.

AB Performance assessment in holistic approaches such as integrated natural resource management has to deal with a complex set of interacting and self-organizing natural and human systems and agents, all pursuing their own "interests" while also contributing to the development of the total system. Performance indicators must therefore reflect the viability of essential component systems as well as their contributions to the viability and performance of other component systems and the total system under study. A systems-based derivation of a comprehensive set of performance indicators first requires the identification of essential component systems, their mutual (often hierarchical or reciprocal) relationships, and their contributions to the performance of other component systems and the total system. The second step consists of identifying the indicators that represent the viability states of the component systems and the contributions of these component systems to the performance of the total system. The search for performance indicators is guided by the realization that essential interests (orientations or orientors) of systems and actors are shaped by both their characteristic functions and the fundamental and general properties of their system environments (e.g., normal environmental state, scarcity of resources, variety, variability, change, other coexisting systems). To be viable, a system must devote an essential minimum amount of attention to satisfying the "basic orientors" that respond to the properties of its environment. This fact can be used to define comprehensive and system-specific sets of performance indicators that reflect all important concerns. Often, qualitative indicators and the study of qualitative systems are sufficient for reliable performance assessments. However, this approach can also be formalized for quantitative computer-assisted assessment. Examples are presented of indicator sets for the sustainable development of regions, including the computer-based, time-dependent assessment of system performance using time-series data. Because of its systems-theoretical foundation, this approach avoids the problems of incompleteness and double-counting common in ad hoc methods of indicator selection.

AB Assessing the impact of integrated natural resource management (INRM) research poses a challenge to scientists. The complexity of 111;1 interventions requires a more holistic approach to impact assessment, beyond the plot and farm levels and beyond traditional analysis of economic returns. Impact assessment for INRM combines the traditional "what" and "where" factors of economic and environmental priorities with newer "who" and "how" aspects of social actors and institutions. This paper presents an analytical framework and methodology for assessing the impact of INRM. A key feature of the proposed methodology is that it starts with a detailed planning process that develops a well-defined, shared, and holistic strategy to achieve development impact. This methodology, which is known as the "paths of development impact" methodology, includes the mapping of research outputs, intermediate outcomes, and development impacts. A central challenge is to find a balance between the use of generalizable measures that facilitate cross-site comparison and slower participatory process methods that empower local stakeholders. Sufficient funding for impact assessment and distinct stakeholder interests are also challenges. Two hillside sites in Central America and one forest margin site in Peru serve as case studies.

AB Integrated natural resource management (INRM) and its many closely related approaches are generally considered to be more effective than single-disciplinary approaches for managing the complex resource issues currently facing many countries. INRM approaches aim to integrate several disciplines and involve different stakeholders operating in their own subsystems across different spatial and temporal scales. These approaches focus on identifying management strategies for sustaining natural resource stocks and flows of goods and services as well as their underlying ecological processes. Changes in the behavior of consumers and producers and in the allocation of resources among uses, users, time, and space will be necessary to achieve sustainable development. To accomplish this, changes in focus, attitudes, and approaches to research and management will also be necessary. This paper argues that the key focus of INRM should not be the natural resource itself, but rather the interactions of humans with each other and with their natural environment, and the decisions they make about using and managing resources. Such decision-making processes aim to identify and implement action-oriented strategies and to apply economic and noneconomic instruments that motivate behavioral changes, allowing for different responses to various economic imperatives. This process should be guided by constructivist philosophy and supported by rigorous cross-disciplinary research and active stakeholder participation. It must be compatible with dialectic decision making to reflect the different views and objectives of the stakeholders, the presence of incomplete information, and, at times, the fact that researchers have only a poor understanding of the dynamics of subsystems and their interactions. There must also be iterative, regular monitoring and fine-tuning of the management strategies chosen. We prefer to call the entire process an adaptive decision-making process (ADMP). Here we propose a four-phase ADMP illustrated by projects in Fiji and Thailand, both of which are supported by the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research. The role of research, researchers, and other stakeholders in the ADMP is also discussed.

AB This paper focuses on rites of passage as a model for wilderness programs. It draws on my experience in the field, particularly with Native youth in a community-based program called "Rediscovery." The Rediscovery program is discussed, along with concepts of traditional indigenous knowledge and education. Foundational concepts of rites of passage are described in terms of their relevance to youth, outdoor education, and the Rediscovery program in particular. Using Rediscovery as a model, rites of passage are put forward as an educational process for youth from various cultural backgrounds. In this context, the purpose of education is to cultivate self-knowledge and to foster core personal development: the making of whole human beings. The paper closes with a reflection on my work with traditional indigenous people and the significance of rites of passage for education, cultural transformation, and the transition to ecological sustainability.

AB Losses of forest cover, biodiversity, agricultural productivity, and ecosystem services in the Himalayan mountain region are interlinked problems and threats to the sustainable livelihoods of 115 x 106 mountain people as well as the inhabitants of the adjoining Indo-gangetic plains. Until the 1970s, environmental conservation, food security, and rural economic development were treated as independent sectors. The poor outcomes of sector-oriented approaches catalyzed efforts to address environmental and socioeconomic problems concurrently. The identification of "key" natural resource management interventions is an important dimension of integrated management. Projects to rehabilitate the degraded lands that cover 40% of the Indian Himalaya could be key interventions provided that they address both socioeconomic and environmental concerns across spatial and temporal scales. However, projects of this type, e.g., investments in conifer plantations on degraded forest lands, have failed because their designs did not take into account the needs of local residents. This study illustrates a case of land rehabilitation in a small isolated village close to the alpine zone. Vital elements of this project strategy included identifying local perceptions and knowledge and involving the local people in the selection and implementation of the interventions needed to restore the land. Communities were found to be more concerned with the immediate economic benefits from bamboo and medicinal species than the long-term benefits of tree planting. The villagers eventually reached a consensus to plant broadleaved multipurpose trees in association with bamboo and medicinal species. Despite assurances that all the economic benefits from rehabilitation would go to the community, the people would not agree to voluntary labor, although they did absorb significant costs by providing social fencing, farmyard manure, and propagules from community forests. Households shared costs and benefits according to traditional norms. The economic benefits to the local people exceeded the rehabilitation cost over the 7-yr life of the project. There were significant on-site environmental benefits in terms of improvements in soil fertility, biodiversity, protective cover, and carbon sequestration, and off-site benefits from more productive use of labor, reduced pressure on protected areas, and the introduction of rare and threatened medicinal species onto private farmland.

AB Natural resource management research has to evolve from a focus on plans, maps, and regulations to an acknowledgment of the complex, sometimes chaotic, reality in the field, with a large number of actors making their own decisions. As outside actors, we can only try to facilitate and support a process of negotiation among the stakeholders. Such negotiation involves understanding the perspectives of all stakeholders, analyzing complementarities in views, identifying where differences may be settled by "science," where science and social action can bring innovative alternatives for reconciliation, and where compromises will be necessary to move ahead. We distinguish between natural resource management problems at village level, within country, or transboundary, and those that relate local stakeholder decisions to global issues such as biodiversity conservation. Tree-based systems at plot or landscape level can minimize conflicts between private and public interests in local environmental services, but spatial segregation of functions is an imperative for the core of global biodiversity values. The complex agroforests developed by farmers as alternatives to food-crop-based agriculture integrate local and global environmental functions, but intensification and specialization may diminish these non-local values. For local biodiversity functions, a medium-intensity "integrate" option such as agroforests may be superior in terms of resilience and risk management, Major options exist for increasing carbon stocks by expanding tree-based production systems on grasslands and in degraded watersheds through a coherent approach to the market, policy, and institutional bottlenecks to application of existing rehabilitation technologies. Agroforestry mosaics may be an acceptable replacement of forests in upper watersheds, provided they evolve into multistrata systems with a protective litter layer. Challenges to INRM research remain: how should the opportunities for adaptive response among diverse interest groups, at a number of hierarchical levels, be included in the assessment of impacts on the livelihoods of rural people?

DT Article
AB This article proposes a relationship between the current condition fo British culture and those conditions out of which the Theatre for Development movement in Africa has grown. It sees int he artefacts of 'mainstream' theatre a loss of the element of participation which once made European dramatic traditions vibrant and interactive. Theatre for Development may provide the means of reinvigorating that theatre with purpose and social relevance. There is a brief analysis of the role of colonisation in the destruction of indigenous culture, worth and identity. Theatre for Development has tried to play a part in transforming the poor and marginalised from the objects into the subjects of history through the reintegration of communities, using the objects into the subjects of history through the reintegration of communities, using non-literary, indigenous forms such as oral testimony. Theatre for Development in Africa has evolved out of the phase of message bearing from the centre into techniques for community self-representation. The process of conscientisation is seen as crucial to effective, sustainable community development. The recent political history of Britain has produced a society where many of those on the margins could benefit from exposure to Theatre for Development practices. The M.A. course in Community Drama for Development run by King Alfred's College, Winchester and the University of Southampton is attempting to make the connections between work in different parts of the globe and between development and theatre. Theatre for Development can be an important tool in the struggle to improve the quality of life for all communities that have suffered from the oppressive hegemonies of those who have claimed to speak for them.

AB A fishery-independent survey of the spanner crab, Ranina ranina fishing grounds off the coast of New South Wales, Australia was completed in 1988-89 and repeated in 1997-98. This survey provided an empirical assessment of this stock and allowed the development of a population model. The results showed the marked sexual dimorphism of this species with males generally attaining larger sizes than females and a sex ratio that was slightly biased towards females. Seventy-one to 73% of the population was found to be under the legal minimum size, male crabs comprised most of the portion of the population that was targeted by fishers and 96% of females were protected by the size limit. Comparing catch rates from the two surveys revealed large variabilities in abundances across several of the spatial and temporal scales investigated. Catches of crabs (especially females) decreased during the spawning period each year (October to December). In one location (Tallows Beach) these decreases did not occur, suggesting that this site was the focus of a spawning migration. A significant 6% decrease in the relative abundances of all crabs over the 11 year period of the study and a 55% decline in the numbers of large male crabs (> 108 mm CL) provided some cause for concern.
   The stock was represented with a biomass dynamic model conditioned on catch and fitted to the results of the fishery-independent surveys and/or commercial catch per unit effort using non-linear optimization. The history of catches showed an increasing rate of exploitation and a decreasing index of abundance (i.e., a "one-way trip") and therefore we were unable to estimate the exploitable biomass of this stock. However, by assuming a series of growth rate scenarios of the exploitable stock, we estimated patterns of relative exploitation and stock productivity. Confidence intervals for the parameter estimates were determined using bootstrap methods. Recommending a Total Allowable Commercial Catch (TACC) for this fishery from this study is difficult because estimates of the extent to which the stock has been fished down depend upon the dataset used for the analysis and the assumed growth rate of the stock. Quantifying a TACC also requires assumptions about the objectives for the stock and the certainty of achieving that objective. The NSW spanner crab fishery must continue to operate with uncertainty about its sustainable harvest rate. Fishery-independent surveys and flexibility in the TACC will be the most effective strategies to ensure that no adverse biological, economic or social outcomes occur in this fishery.

AB A new research and development project is being prepared at Ghent University together with the academic partners Eindhoven University of Technology and Institute of Plasma Physics Prague (IPP, Prague) and the private partners Applied Plasma Technologies (APT, Belgium) and Montair-Andersen (Netherlands). There will be close collaboration with the Institute of Problems of Electrophysics of the Russian Academy of Sciences, St. Petersburg (IPE St. Petersburg). The driving force behind the project is to give priority to environmental quality at affordable cost. Thus, the investigation of ways to increase the efficiency of the plasma based treatment processes is very important. The paper presents the concept of a fully plasma based system for treatment of a wide range of possible feedstocks. A first group is waste from agricultural, industrial and consumer activities; a second group are fossil fuels considered to be of insufficient quality to be acceptable for conventional combustion processes.
   The concept concerns thermal plasma gasification and vitrification, i.e. a dual simultaneous disintegration and fusion process. The feedstock is treated by plasma torches in a reactor chamber, whereby organic components are converted into a synthetic gas of high caloric value, and inorganic components are converted into a non-leachable vitrified lava. The quality of the syngas will be controlled by non-thermal plasmas, using new generation of gas cleaning pulsed corona plasma technologies. Two complementary pulsed corona plasma systems will be used: a high-temperature pulse corona plasma cyclone offering a unique solution for the combined removal of gaseous and particulate pollutants, and a semi-wet pulsed plasma scrubber offering the possibility to remove a range of pollutants simultaneously in contrast with conventional gas cleaning techniques. The efficiency of these gas cleaning processes strongly depends on the pulse power characteristics. Therefore, the further development and upgrading of pulse source technology is a key activity of the project.
   Optimization of the treatment of feedstocks, L e. optimization of the quality of the synthetic gas according to criteria determined by the end use, will be investigated. These criteria can be: the maximum energy content of the syngas for electricity/heat production (thermal conversion), or the production or recovery of a valuable by-product from the syngas such as methanol, respectively,hydrogen for fuel cells (chemical conversion). The major steps in the project are: the realization of an efficient system for clean and efficient plasma based waste treatment using thermal and non-thermal plasmas and the testing of the combined system for various feedstocks. The economy of the system is a crucial parameter.

AB This study provides a satellite-based estimate of potential primary production in the four Eastern Boundary Currents (EBCs), i.e. the California, Humboldt, Canary, and Benguela currents, from the first 24 months of the Sea-Viewing Wide Field of View Sensor, SeaWiFS. Within each EBC, production was estimated for the area of high chlorophyll concentration (> 1 mg m(-1)) or active area, which is likely to determine the production that can be utilized by higher trophic levels. Primary production decreased with latitude within each EBC while the extent of the active area was related to the magnitude of offshore transport. The most productive EBC was the Benguela Current (0.37 Gt C yr(-1)), followed by the Canary (0.33 Gt C yr(-1)), Humboldt (0.20 Gt C yr(-1)), and California (0.04 Gt C yr(-1)) Currents. Interannual differences between 1997, 1998, and 1999 were largest for 1997 (measured by the Ocean Color Temperature Scanner, OCTS), which may be due primarily to the different sensor and algorithm. The Humboldt Current was more productive, and the Canary much less, during 1997 than in the two following years. The El Nino of 1997-1998 led to smaller annual production in 1998 in the Pacific EBCs. The upper bound of sustainable fish yield was estimated assuming a food chain of 2.6 links and an average trophic efficiency of 10%. The resulting values are 4-150 times larger than the observed fish catch from 1990 through 1997. Actual catch data in the Benguela Current were 20 times smaller than in the Humboldt Current. The most likely explanations for the differences in potential and observed fish catch are related to differing trophic structure and spatial accessibility in different EBCs. If the estimated yield is an upper bound that will be decreased to 10% or 20% by environmental accessibility, the small pelagic fishery in all four EBCs is likely to be food-limited.

AB A nation's wealth is both an object of conquest to covetous aggressors and a resource to its owners for self defense. To maintain autonomy every country must mount a defense which either makes its capture ( 1) more expensive than any aggressor can afford, or ( 2) more expensive than it is worth to aggressors. Whether this condition can be satisfied for all countries simultaneously depends as shown in this paper on relative efficacy of military offense versus defense, the aggregate of wealth among nations and its distribution, and the benefits a conqueror may obtain from conquest, including the duration of these benefits. The paper shows how these factors fit together to determine the sustainability and stability of the international distribution of property as embodied in the configuration of sovereign states.

TI Reinventing federalism: Gouverance of decentralized institutional
   experiments in Latin America
SO DESARROLLO ECONOMICO-REVISTA DE CIENCIAS SOCIALES
LA Spanish
DT Article
ID CHINA
AB This essay analyzes the intersection between local institutional and economic development, while showing how national governments and multilateral agencies can better assist decentralized development, The first part examines the advances made by public-private "partnerships" at municipal and provincial levels across Latin America. Such partnerships have risen in the face of failures by approaches focused mainly on bureaucratic and free market solutions as well as purely centralized and decentralized solutions. I find that partnerships aid development when national or provincial authorities delegate new powers to local actors in order to form new public-private coalitions and when monitoring is based on deliberative or participatory forms of governance. The second part of the essay then turns to a recent institutional experiment in Argentina, in which national government actors, with the aid of the the multilaterals, attempted to help provinces rebuild their institutional capacities by combining learning and monitoring, Again, such an innovation works when the governance is based on delegation and disciplined deliberation. This analysis suggests alternative paths out of the current crisis in Argentina, but notes that sustainable paths of institutional reform demand a rennovation of federalism and the role of the multilaterals.

TI Empowering pyromaniacs in Madagascar: Ideology and legitimacy in
   community-based natural resource management
SO DEVELOPMENT AND CHANGE
LA English
DT Article
ID CONSERVATION; FORESTRY; PROPERTY; DECENTRALIZATION; ACCOUNTABILITY;
   INSTITUTIONS; MEXICO; RIGHTS; LAND
AB Development practitioners frequently rely, on community-based natural resource management (CBNRM) as an approach to encourage equitable and sustainable environmental resource use. Based on an analysis of the case of grassland and woodland burning in highland Madagascar, this article argues that the success of CBNRM depends upon the real empowerment of local resource users and attention to legitimacy in local institutions. Two key factors - obstructive environmental ideologies ('received wisdoms') and the complex political and social arena of 'community' governance - challenge empowerment and legitimacy and can transform outcomes. In Madagascar persistent hesitancy among leaders over the legitimate role of fire has sidetracked a new CBNRM policy called GELOSE away from one of its original purposes - community fire management - towards other applications, such as community management of forest exploitation. In addition, complications with local governance frustrate implementation efforts. As a result, a century-long political stalemate over fire continues.

ID INFORMATION
AB After a decade of research and development, digital libraries are becoming operational systems and services. This paper summarizes some of the challenges required for that transition. Digital libraries as systems are converging with digital libraries as institutions; particularly as we consider the service aspects. They are enabling technologies for applications such as classroom instruction, information retrieval, and electronic commerce. Because usability depends heavily upon context, research on uses and users of digital libraries needs to be conducted in a wide array of environments. Interoperability and scaling continue to be major issues, but the problems are better understood. While technical work on interoperability and scaling continues, institutional collaboration is an emerging focus. Concerns for an information infrastructure to support digital libraries is moving toward the concept of "cyberinfrastructure," now that distributed networks are widely deployed and access is becoming ubiquitous. Appropriate evaluation methods and metrics are requirements for sustainable digital libraries that have received little attention until recently. We need to know what works and in what contexts. Evaluation has many aspects and can address a variety of goals, such as usability, maintainability, interoperability, scalability, and economic viability. Lastly, two areas that have received considerable discussion elsewhere are noted-digital preservation and the role of information institutions such as libraries and archives.

AB This paper studies current models on sustainable economic growth with resource constraints and explores to what extent resource constraints can be overcome by substitution and technological change. We also study the problem of intergenerational equity and the different criteria that have been suggested in the literature. The central part of this paper is the presentation of stylized facts on exhaustible resources and an estimation of a basic model with resource constraints for US time series data. The estimated years left until depletion and the empirical trends of the ratios of capital stock and consumption to resources seem to indicate that there might be a threat to sustainable growth in the future. In our estimation, we obtain parameter values, which help to interpret the extent to which growth with exhaustible resources is sustainable.

AB Latin America (LA) is suffering the environmental consequences of worldwide increased productivity and agricultural expansion as well as strong economic restrictions. To survive, LA landowners must turn to higher income products and/or increase productivity. Alternatives are few. But while intensification relies on unaffordable and nonsustainable subsidies, diversification is solely dependent on improved management of available resources. Diversified, multiple-species production systems (MSPS) add wildlife use to traditional production systems, promoting economic and ecological stability. We present examples of MSPS in Latin America. Although results are technically encouraging, their future sustainability is threatened by: i) local subvaluation of wildlife and ii) restricted international markets.

AB The wild population of rusa deer (Cervus timorensis russa) in New Caledonia (South Pacific) is nearly as large as the cattle population. The cattle tick is widespread and occurs all year round. Opinions are divided on the role of deer in the biological cycle of the tick: i) Do they maintain a sustainable tick population that is secondarily available for cattle? ii) Do they decrease the infestation of the environment by collecting larvae on the pasture, but preventing their development to the engorged female stage? or iii) Do they contribute to both situations? An experiment was conducted in three groups of pastures, each seeded with 450 000 larvae/ha and allowed to be grazed only by cattle, only by deer, and by a mixed herd of deer and cattle (deer representing 30% of the biomass), at approximately the same stocking rate (470-510 kg/ha). After 15 months of exposure, the tick burden per weight unit of host was 42 ticks/kg for the steers-only herd and 0.01/kg for the deer-only herd. The steers in the "mixed group" harbored 7 times fewer ticks (6.2/kg) than the cattle-only group, and the deer in the "mixed group," 130 times more (1.3/kg) than the deer-only group. Five emergency acaricide treatments had to be applied in the cattle-only group, but none in the other groups. The long-term sustainability of a viable tick population on deer as well as the potential benefit resulting from the association of deer and susceptible cattle in the tick control of cattle are highlighted.

AB The paper begins by defining different kinds of virtual enterprises and the kinds of support needed to make them sustainable. The paper identifies three requirements must be satisfied. These are technology that supports interaction across distance, a favorable organizational culture and the desire to share knowledge. All must be present to result in sustainable virtual organizations. Thus participants in such organizations must be willing to share knowledge, be encouraged to do so by their work environment and have suitable services provided by technologies for this purpose. The paper concludes with some examples of research questions that need to be addressed.

AB Given current population trends and projections in sub-Saharan Africa, it is anticipated that substantial intensification of agricultural cropland is certain within the next decades. In the absence of adoption of improved technologies poor rural populations in this region will continue to degrade and mine the natural resources to ensure their survival. All these actions will have far-reaching implications for environmental quality and human health. However, only through the integration of environment and development concerns with greater attention to these link can we achieve the goal of fulfilling the basic needs, improved living standards for all, better protected and managed eco-systems and a safer, more prosperous future. The paper reviews case studies and provides examples of the integration, analysis, and visualization of information from remotely sensed, biophysical and socioeconomic information to assess the present situation hindering agricultural development in sub-Saharan Africa. These studies show the interactions between socio-economic and environmental factors that can help governments and policy-makers assess the scope of the problems, examine alternatives and decide on a course of action. Sound decisions depend on accurate information, yet most African countries face severe competing demands for the financial and human commitments necessary to staff an information system equal to its policy-making requirements. The role of international data centers is reviewed in terms of their abilities to develop and maintain information systems that bring together available accumulated knowledge and data. This permits comparative studies, which make it possible to develop a better understanding of the relationships among demographic dynamics, technology, cultural behavioral norms, and land resources and hence better decision making for sustainable development.

ID COMPETITIVENESS
AB Public and private demands for sustainable development put pressure on firms to develop strategies that include environmental concerns. Environmental effects from products often appear as externalities, outside the legal boundary of the producing company. These companies often possess the best competence to optimise the total life cycle environmental performance of its products. They are, however, neither obliged nor stimulated enough by policy incentives to do so from a sustainable development perspective. The policy instruments used today are mostly of a control-and-demand type, i.e. they do not create sufficient incentives to go further than hedging over set requirements. Environmental concerns and tightened environmental policy parameters have mostly been associated with the notion of additional costs and thus a restriction on economic performance. However, since the mid 1990s, several papers have called for corporate win-win situations as well as instruments giving up-stream incentives for change, but not enough abatement of environmental impacts has emerged in reality. Perhaps this is due to the lack of proper connection between economic theory on the one hand, and incentive advocating articles and instruments on the other. We propose a concept for trading of product life cycle (PLC) emission rights, based on property rights and transaction cost theories considering the problem with asymmetric information over the value chain. The initial financial impacts from such PLC instruments are shown to be significant for the system provider. since emissions and resource use-become production costs. This provides economic incentives to take an increased responsibility for information flow as well as initiatives for product innovations. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB There has been much improvement in calculation of the ecological footprint (EF) since 1996, when Wackernagel and Rees initially suggested it as a sustainable development index to evaluate human dependence on ecosystems in terms of land and water areas. However, despite the improvements the EF remains a static index, revealing only the current reality, so that it is criticized for its lack of use in policy formulation. This criticism is more concerned with the energy footprint because it dominates the estimated EF in many case studies, and its size would change almost simultaneously when alternative energy policies are implemented. One main reason for this deficiency is that the original calculation method does not explicitly take into account the linkages among the final consumption of goods and services, final energy consumption, and primary energy requirements. However, these linkages may contribute to scenarios and simulation of policy instruments for reducing energy footprints. This paper proposes a calculation framework to include the concerned linkages in order to: (1) estimate energy footprints according to the primary energies embodied in the goods and services consumed by a defined human population, and (2) develop scenarios and simulation of policy instruments for reducing energy footprints. This framework is then applied to Taiwan to illustrate how it works and what needs to be improved in future studies. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A natural resource accounting approach was applied in this study to evaluate the performance and sustainability of mining practices and strategies in South Africa (SA). The study showed that except for a brief period during the 1980s, rent capture was very low and almost all the resource rent from minerals dissipated to private companies, Recently, however. user costs have appeared to have been reasonably recovered by taxes and institutional royalties and the capital component of the rent (user cost) has fully been reinvested by mining companies. While adequate reinvestment of recovered user costs in alternative forms of capital might imply sustainable management, this can only hold under the assumptions of perfect substitution between human-made and natural capital of the weak sustainability (WS) paradigm. However., even if one adopts WS, the present analysis could not provide adequate evidence in support of the prudence of mining activities in the country. This is due to a lack of adequate information on the proportions of royalties and taxes reinvested collected by the government and private landowners. Moreover, the fact that this study does not account for the environmental impacts of mining is another important limitation on the ability of the present analysis to conclude that mineral resources have been prudently exploited in SA.

ID MODEL; FISH
AB The increasing demand for shark fins in Asia, and the publicity resulting from firming and discarding live sharks, has generated concern regarding the sustainability of the world's shark populations. These concerns can be attributed to the shark's life history, which is characterized by a pattern of slow growth, late maturity, few offspring, and long life, making populations vulnerable to overexploitation. Once overexploited, shark stocks will be slow to recover due to these constraints. Despite an increase in consumption and trade of shark fins and other shark products, and the vulnerability of shark populations once overexploited. little effort has been expended to understand the biology and economics of sharks and shark fisheries until recently. This study adds to the understanding of linkages between shark product markets, specifically shark fins, and the biology of shark populations by explicitly incorporating multi-attribute market information into bioeconomic modeling. Results from conjoint analysis of the Hong Kong dried, processed end-user markets is incorporated into a blacktip shark (Carcharhinus limbatus) cohort model to estimate the optimal harvest size and age that maximize economic value. Results show that optimal harvest sizes and ages for all mortality and discount factor scenarios are greater than the maturation sizes and ages for both mate and female blacktip. Policy implications for this study are also discussed. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB River diversions within the Mississippi Delta deliver river water and associated sediments and nutrients to interior marshes that were previously isolated from river inputs by elevated levees. When isolated from river inputs. the marshes subside and deteriorate to open water, resulting in ecological and economic losses, River diversions are an ecological engineering method to reverse this trend by restoring controlled flows of river water through modified levees. This study compares the cost of constructing and operating the diversions with potential benefits to determine whether the diversions yield a net public benefit. The Caernarvon and Davis Pond river diversions were evaluated using emergy analysis to provide a common basis to quantify and compare economic and ecological costs and benefits. The analysis quantified high concentrations of natural resources inherent to deltas and demonstrated benefits produced by investing economic resources in river diversions to capture and utilize renewable resources. The diversions resulted in large net emergy yield ratios (33.2 and 9.36) that varied depending on the rate of marsh gain produced by the diversions. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Astrocaryum chambira Burret is a palm that provides edible fruits and fibers for making handicrafts. This study focused on the fiber products (hammocks and bags) made by the Bora in the Peruvian Amazonia. Making chambira handicrafts consists of several different phases. Handicrafts are marketed to tourists, river traders, or shopkeepers in the city of Iquitos. Villagers travel actively to sell their products because of the remote location of the village from the market. The prices received by producers were extremely low when considering the amount of work, but the prices were low also in other steps (middleman, tourist). Still, chambira works provide an important source of income for villagers. The greater abundance of A. chambira in secondary forest compared with the primary forest indicates that it has potential for agroforestry. Agroforestry systems can provide a sustainable way to use land in the rainforest areas in NE Peru, and in this system nontimber forest products may have an important role.

AB Because biodiversity is debated primarily from western perspectives, the significance of threatened taxa has not been properly assessed in the cultural and ecological contexts of their use. Instead, conservable species tend to be identified by outsiders who are culturally and politically detached,from the threatened environments. However, over the last decade or so a growing number of studies document why and how indigenous knowledge and people can become part of development and sustainable conservation. Presented here is a Nigerian example that illustrates how,formal conservation efforts are handicapped by their failure to take into account local environmental knowledge. I argue that the potential erosion of biodiversity in Hausaland has been checked by the varied management of cultivated and other lands, and by the use of plants in overlapping contexts- as medicines, foods, and the like.

AB This paper investigates the sustainability of Swedish fiscal policy performed during the period 1963-2000. The main emphasis is on assessing the effects of changes in fiscal policy, such as changes in taxes or public spending. On the basis of Johansen's VAR and the augmented Granger causality tests, the results show that taxes and spending are causally related in the long-run and the homogeneity condition is supported empirically. The effect of EMU criteria convergence on fiscal policy is also investigated empirically. The 'Pantula principle' is applied to determine the form of deterministic trend component. Special attention is given to the lag-choosing process. The policy implication of our findings is that Sweden is not in violation of its intertemporal budget constraint.

TI Monetary policy and stabilization of the US economy
SO EKONOMICKY CASOPIS

DT Article
AB The boom of the USA economy in the nineties outmatched all the booths in the past fifty years as well as the expectations of many economists. Important indicators such as unemployment rate. inflation rate. capitalisation of financial markets and fiscal management helped to prolong the expansion of the economic cycle. GDP growth rate tend productivity growth rate eras on average higher than any other comparable economic system. At the same time the whole decade was dominated by the efficient functioning of the monetary policy of the central bank Fed.
   Conditions in the nineties differed substantially from those in the seventies and eighties. In the nineties one managed in the US to change the tendency in the economic cycle and market subjects became more confident that any increase of inflation and interest rates is only a temporary one and that the long-terns trend in monetary policy follows price stability.
   First-rate target of the Fed's monetary strategy was to maximise long-term economic growth along with the preservation of the stable purchasing power of the currency.(25), Along with Fiscal consolidation, which already inspired confidence, monetary policy was able to act more efficiently in favour of sustainable growth and prolonged expansion.
   Balancing and stabilising of the development of currency's purchasing power and inflation started to be successful since the times when its currency policy monetary approach prevailed and when one ascribed to the currency the irreplaceable role in its function in individual pleases of economic cycles. Later successes achieved in the field of local currency's strong exchange rate and long-term economy growth had big support in the change of Fed's policy of the year 1979 and its further gradual enforcement(26) into the mode of economic cycle function.
   When in the second half of the year 2000 the output began gradually to slow down its growth rate, Fed let the official interest rate unchanged (6.5 per cent) and thus signalled its potential decrease. Fed was led towards the consecutive relaxation of conditions in the market by the fears of the deterioration the expansion results (relaxation of the investment and consumption demand) and possible recession deepening. Central bank thus opened the struggle for the confidence in its abilities.
   The character of economic slow-down and recession depend also oil how intensive the unbalances generated in economy manifest themselves during boom expansion. The causes responsible for the recession situation of economic growth slow-down are numerous and cannot be all included here. Ever-new impulses affecting the behaviour of enterprises, households and the government subscribe; themselves oil the unbalances already generated, and it is questionable to what extent the economy will be able to develop itself further alongside with this negative impact. In the USA the following three sorts of unbalances most markedly occur: a) net savings of private sector are negative: b) households and firms generate big debts: c) current account payment balance deficit grows enormously.
   High financial deficit of the private sector arose as a result of the investment increase and dramatically decreased growth rate in personal savings. Should the net savings return to their historic average,(27) the result would be a relatively big decrease of aggregate demand after the decrease of consumer expenses and investments of firms. This case can be provoked by medium-term expectations of negative development of the product, employment and decreasing incomes that will reflect in share rates.
   The growth of capital markets played an important role in consumer demand. We demonstrated by means of regression analysis that for higher real expenses of the households lower disposable income was enough, in other words, in the years 1984 - 1990 the elasticity of real personal expenses towards the changes in disposable income was stronger, whereas in the years 1991 - 1997 this elasticity was weakened by the possibility of higher indebtedness. Disposable income no longer played in consumer decision of the households such nil important role as in the past and the demand could increase at the expense of the higher drawing of the financial market tools.
   The development of financial markets accompanied by the enforcement of monetary rules in economic policy was indirectly related with the growth of deficit in the current account payments. The trade deficit is in its essence the flow and will last as long as one could finance it either by the sale of foreign assets owned by the Americans or by the sales of domestic American assets to foreigners or by loans from abroad. Trade deficit thus brings about financial risk in the form of high uncertainty rate generated by exogenous influences (for instance uncertain foreign demand).
   Mentioned unbalances. which were generated during the boom of the nineties. are connected with the development of capital markets and with the high growth of American economy, The indebtedness of the private sector and the current account payment. balance deficit result from the favourable development of the boom, which however. they inevitably subvert in the long-term horizon. Negative net savings are important mainly from the short-terns point of view. Negative net savings arc important also from the point of view of the boom slow-down's impact oil the consumption of the private sector. The important part in the process of increasing unbalances is played by the macro-economic strategy, particularly the functioning of monetary and fiscal policy trying to moderate the influence of the slower growth of economy and weaker aggregate demand.
   American economy is since the second half of the year 2000 in the phase where the supply and demand try to Find anew balance after the end of the period of long-term not sustainable fast growth. Although in this phase the economy demonstrated signs typical for the recession of economy - excessive capacities, decreasing investments, worker discharging, decreasing profits - this slow-down lacks dynamics, gravity of consequences and duration of the real recession,
   Monetary policy responded to this development relatively quickly and markedly decreased interest rates, thus confirming the fears of economy's recession. These fears prevail and the expectations to continue a relaxed monetary policy of the central bank are confirmed. The prospects for further monetary reaction are based oil weak inflation pressures. However, some signs of their possible increase exist. At stake are above all relatively saturated labour market and the risk of weakening of the USD exchange rate.
   Economic cycle is ill the advanced phase and favourable inflation conditions that allowed the Fed to decrease interest rates may not prevail ill the future. Thus it will depend oil how one succeeds to maintain investment activity, where the fluctuation in later phases directly influences the consumption sector. We cannot expect that consumers will maintain their expenses oil such a high level (concerning their indebtedness), as has been the situation up till now. We can say that if before September 2001 one sensed a certain unwillingness to engage fiscal programmes into the support of aggregate demand, one now considers such a tool of economic policy as indispensable. This will thus mean even stronger short-term support for (lie weakened growth. It is also unquestionable that ill macro-economic policy, the economic and policy mix will be changed when the hither-to preferred monetary policy would be accompanied to a greater extent also by the support for fiscal budget.
   Current expenses of the government for the first quarter of 2002 total 28.8 tier cent or GDP and one should my that higher government expenditure is implemented at the expense of private investments. Question remains, how will greater public expenses influence logs-term interest rates. Long-term balance of the American economy will be influenced, however, by the decline of fiscal balance, where the deficit for the first quarter of 2002 totals 64.4 billion USD, The combination or slower growing economy. higher expenses and tax decreases changes the estimates or projected fiscal excesses. Higher government expenses will strengthen the role of the government in the economy and thus a new power distribution between private and public sectors will take place.

DT Article
AB Adequate institutional structure is a precondition for EU membership. As the reference date for accession is 2004, all relevant acquis should be implemented until the end of this year and so is expected adequate strengthening of capacities. In the accession process framework are specified another priorities (e.g. harmonization of legal system), measures for implementation and conditions for providing support. However, adaptation depends also on transparency of decision-making, law enforcement and elimination of corruption. Reform of public administration, made through decentralization, is based on operation of state administration and regional self-government and on changing competencies with the aim to reduce expenditures and improve services. Respected in this process are principles of subsidiarity and competitive environment.
   In general, there has been a strengthening of the system of governmental management bodies like, e.g., Custom directorate of the Slovak republic. In the case of public finance the gradual reductions of subsidies is the basic principle to be followed in the next future and market functioning should be improved via financial control over enterprises. Economic policy priorities have shifted from liberalization and privatization towards structural changes in corporate law. The amendment should increase transparency of ownership and business relations and, therefore, lead to a better corporate governance. Mentioned briefly are survey results on increasing ownership concentration of the biggest shareholders. Among central issues is also formation of competitive environment. Following acts on state assistance and on protection of economic competition, expected is approval of legal regulations allowing to provide group exceptions from prohibition of agreements limiting competition for certain agreements.
   Despite the fact that, as mentioned above, the state enforces liberal model of the economy based on transparency of business environment it also aims to develop some industries or branches to make Slovak industrial structure more similar to that of EU countries. Such changes should lead towards higher intra-industry trade, a feature typical for developed economics. Accepted concept of state science and technology policy, supporting participation in EU framework programs, faces problem with inadequate funding.
   In corporate law an amended bankruptcy act has enforced position of creditors which should speed-up corporate restructuring and recovery. Being aware of the positive role of foreign investment, the state promotes their inflows using certain policy measures like tax holiday etc. As a potential positive by-product of ending privatization is considered the possibility that completion of privatization could eliminate chances for corruption in state administration.
   Some changes have indirect impact on corporate costs or production. Poorly performing healthcare sector increases illness rates of workforce and problems in education sector negatively affects qualification of labor force. It is necessary, according to policymakers, to reform social system by changing the system of pension and social insurance and social aid. Reform of healthcare should guarantee transition towards predominantly ambulant form of care and decentralization of the whole system. Elementary healthcare insurance should be extended by supplementary insurance and optional commercial insurance schemes.
   In environmental protection the main principles are those related to sustainable development. National environmental action program SR II has originated and the realization of this policy is conditioned by introduction of environmental taxes, management and audit. Projected are also monitoring and information systems. Key role in the process of EU programs and implemented should be the administrative structure at NUTS 11 level. Improvement of technical preparation of projects financed from EU structural funds is needed.
   In the area of free movement of goods it is necessary implement operational directives related to technical requirements for products. Act oil public procurement has already been implemented to a substantial degree acquis but real use has remained a problem. Legal changes should be followed by building of administrative capacities. One example is the need for coordination of the control of adjustment process in the area of Slovak technical norms in non-harmonized area.
   As general requirement, it is necessary to implement numerous laws in individual chapters in the whole EU directives agenda. Labor Code and laws oil state and public services, in the chapter of social policy and employment, were implemented recently but the remaining problem is flexibility, of labor market. Approval of the law oil network industries regulation, creation of regulatory office and removal of price distortions had prepared conditions for successful restructuring of energy industry. Passed was the law on emergency petrol reserves and petrol products and amended was the law oil state tangible reserves. Enforced will be the capacity of the Off ice for regulation of network industries due to the preparation of secondary legislature in this area. In a preliminary concluded chapter Protection of consumer and health remaining directives should be implemented, c. g., marking of consumer products with price tags.. and legislature regulating market supervision. Passed was also a custom act. full harmonized should be the scheme of General systcru of preferences (until 2004) and passcd should be all act on Export-import Bank of the SR. In preparatory stage is a new information society strategy.
   Progress in transposition of accession chapters is the subject of EC evaluations. Report on Preparedness (2001) positively evaluates number of measures already made. It states that progress has been reached in the areas of structure and functioning of administration, justice, legislature of internal market, corporate law and competition. Progress has to be made in agriculture sector and in enforcing of administrative capacities (e. g., management and control of EC funds). Improvement has been expected especially in the area of corporate law, competition, social policy and employment. Comparison of candidate countries made on the basis,of convergence indicator DCEI (DGZ Deka Bank) shows that the Slovak republic still lacks behind other candidate partners. However, in the area of institutional convergence is its evaluation better than is the total country rating. Evaluations have informative purpose only but for accession decisions one should look also oil non-economic (political and strategic) dimensions.

TI Impact of Slovakia accession to the European Union on agrofood industry
   and food prices
SO EKONOMICKY CASOPIS
LA Slovak
DT Article
AB The paper is presenting preliminary outcomes of two particular segments of policy analysis work, which has been performed since a couple of years in the RIAFE (Research Institute of Agricultural and Food Economics) on the assessment of sectoral. impacts of the oncoming EU accession of Slovakia: One is the price impact of accession related to farm-gate prices of the main agricultural commodities and to the food consumer prices, the second one refers to the possibly changes in the farm sector's income after the implementation of Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). The authors have used a modelling approach. The modelling procedure is described in chapter 1 of the body.
   For the current deviations in terms of prices and farm incomes between Slovakia and the EU-15 the existing policy gap between both entities is partly responsible (when neglecting the divergence in the overall economic performance). The level of producer support is in Slovakia approximately three times lower than in EU-15 - when related to production - and about five times lower, when related to agricultural area.
   The Slovak support system relies predominantly on budgetary transfers. The share of market price support (MPS) has been very low during all years of transition. In 2001, MPS was less than zero. In the EU-15 the dominant support is the market pride support, which is paid by consumers and as such less visible to the public. In 2001, fiscal transfers to agriculture and food amounted to 12.3 bill. SKK (USD 261 million) and made up for 4.9 per cent of state budget expenditure. The same year, in terms of OECD methodology, the support of the farm sector was in its entirety born by budget allocations.
   The relatively high market price support in the. EU contributes to the current price gap, which would disappear after Slovakia joining the Union.
   During the recent period, prices of the Central Market Organization (CMO) crop commodities have been outstripping those in the Slovakia by approximately by 40 per cent. A similar difference may be observed in case of livestock products, with strong product-by-product deviations; e. g. the price gap has been not tine for pork, but it was very significant for beef.
   For crops the average price increment as an effect of accession may be expressed by index 119 and for livestock products by index 125.
   Price differences on producer level are than reflected on the consumer level. According to our data (Table 7) consumer prices of some selected comparable food items have been in Germany by 50 to 100 per cent above the prices in Slovakia.
   The sudden change of the price level after the adoption of CAP in Slovakia is one among the public concern related to accession.
   As our price projection is showing (Table 9) only very few food items may be expected to avoid price increments. The price increase would be very different commodity-by-commodity. Consumer demand elasticities would become an important factor of this process. The capacity of consumers to accept price adjustments is than responsible for the fact, that in our projection, even after accession Slovak food prices still remain under the price level of Germany, which has been used for comparison.
   The overall nominal food price index in 2005 (first year after accession date) would account for 123 over the last year before accession (2003). Nevertheless, the share of population's expenditure on food we do not expect to soar dramatically, due to the growth of other low income elasticity costs, c. g. those for housing. We also expect, that the growth in prices mill be compensated by an income. rise within few years.
   The sectoral income effect of EU accession has already been broadly assessed by various international studies [5; 191]. As the European Commission [10] projected, in 2007 the income gain of Slovak agriculture would represent a 50 per cent increment of gross value added above the baseline in case of implementation of CAP without direct payments. This increase would be about 150 per cent above the baseline in the case of the full CAP with direct payments implementation after accession. in our view, all previous projections overestimate the income effects of the output price change, not taking into account changes, which would obviously occur on the side of production costs.
   We have examined the sectoral income effects of implementation of CAP by means of a simplified Economic Account of Agricultural (EAA) model. The simulation of implementation of the EC proposal (reduced direct payments) showed an income increase against the year 2000, but an income contraction against the most recent pre-accession year. In this model, only a re-duced scale of EAAGF - Guarantee payments has been calculated (direct payments and LFA payments) and the national supplementary payments. All other EAAGF allocations from both sections (e. g. environmental payments etc.) were omitted.
   This projection (Table 12) allows concluding that the, implementation of CAP with reduced direct payments, if the intermediate consumption and fixed capital consumption maintain the projected level, does not necessarily lead to a higher sectoral income. The income value attained under the CAP with reduced direct payments scenario is an outcome of the simulation, in which the intermediate and fixed capital consumption volumes have been derived from their current actual values at corresponding output levels further to the Farm Accountancy Data Network (FADN) data taken from one representative EU-15 country (Germany).
   The second reason for reduced income values under the CAP scenario is the change in production subsidies. This is because in the model, for the period before accession, all production subsidies provided by national policies have been calculated (irrespective of whether they comply with the definition of CAP direct payments, or not). But the CAP scenario comprises only strictly this type of payments. Consequently, even with national complementary payments, in the model the sector enjoys less product-oriented subsidies after accession.
   This points to the importance of rural development and structural policy tools for the further economic sustainability of the sector after accession. This may be truth not only for Slovakia, but also for other candidate countries.

AB Energy efficiency upgrading of housing can promote wider sustainable development aims and objectives because it produces environmental, social and wider macro-economic benefits in addition to lower fuel bills to the householder. This paper uses a cost-benefit analysis framework to assess the potential scale of some of these benefits from the comprehensive upgrading of heating and hot water energy efficiency in the English housing stock. The analysis is not restricted to simply analysing fuel expenditure, energy and CO2 emissions savings but also includes an evaluation of the potential employment gains a comprehensive upgrading programme would produce, together with health gains arising from fewer cases of cold and damp related illnesses. This paper outlines the steps involved in this appraisal and sets out the underlying assumptions at its root. Results of the analysis suggest that, depending on the time-horizon of the analysis, the net social benefit of an upgrading programme will exceed costs for discount rates up 14%.

These models provide a good starting point for analyzing certain issues in the modern industries of developing countries. like improvement of operations. impact of technology mix, and effects of certain aspects of privatization. However, their capability for enabling a comprehensive, policy analysis for developing countries is limited. This is because they lack in their representation of characteristics that are specific to developing economies. Policy priorities of equity and sustainability, existence of a large traditional sector, transition of population from traditional to modern markets, on-going major changes in the regulatory and competitive structure of energy industries, existence of multiple social and economic barriers to capital flow and technological diffusion, likelihood of huge investments in energy supply over next few decades, long-term uncertainties in domestic policy regime, and importance of decentralized energy planning are examples of characteristics that are specific to most developing economies. Such features need to be explicitly addressed in energy policy models in order to enable a meaningful policy analysis for developing countries. Additionally, results from a variety of models need to be considered by policy makers of developing countries in order to assess robustness of their decisions. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB This paper deals with policies to meet increasing energy demand for electricity from domestic energy sources in Turkey. A major dilemma now faced by Turkey is how to invest in new electric power capacity while at the same time adhering to foreign debt ceilings under lending rules set by the IMF. Turkey has a total gross hydropower potential of 433 GW, but only 125 GW of the total hydroelectric potential of Turkey can be economically used. By the commissioning of new hydropower plants, which are under construction, 36% of the economically usable potential of the country would be tapped. Sustainable development requires a balance between nature and mankind; through this balance, it programs for the life and development of both present and future generations without depleting natural resources. It is a concept that has social, ecological, economic, spatial, and cultural dimensions. In this meaning, as touched earlier, the Southeastern Anatolia Project (Turkish initials "GAP") had originally started as a land and water resources development effort and was later transformed into a multisectoral and integrated development project by the GAP Administration.

AB Mass consumerism has brought about increasing consumption of non-renewable natural resources and manufactured goods, and is creating a waste disposal problem of unprecedented magnitude in the process. In the long run, sustainable manufacturing is only attainable given environmentally responsible product design. There tire many tools for the analysis of the impact of manufactured products on the environment, but they, do not other a level of detail sufficient to identify enviromnentally offensive components in the Product. This paper discusses a computer-based design evaluation tool, ECoDE, developed for assessing the environmental impact of components in a product. ECoDE makes use of the Analytical Hierarchy Process to compare each criterion, and rank them in an ascending order of relative significance. The types of materials used, their costs, manufacturing processes, reliability, and ease of access for disassembly are some of the key assessment criteria being considered. Finally, a multi-attribute (or criteria) rating technique is used to compute the scores against each of the criteria for both components and the overall product. The larger the score, the less severe the impact of the component or product on the environment. A discussion is then made on an evaluation test case conducted by ECoDE. Preliminary tests have found that ECoDE is able to calculate the least environmentally friendly component and highlight its likely causes.

DT Article
AB The City-Identity-Sustainability (CIS) Research Network aims to investigate the relationship between several conditions and processes that shape social identity-such as the quality of the urban area, residents' satisfaction, community identification, and sense of cohesion-and the relationship between these factors, taken as a whole, and sustainability. The objective of the project was to determine whether the presence of these factors favors sustainability and, likewise, whether the absence of some of the factors impedes sustainability. The CIS Network carried out its research in seven sites in Latin America and Europe, using the same questionnaire in each setting and complementing it with local qualitative research. The results showed a reasonable fit to the structural models of the hypothesized relationships. In light of the results, the research network suggests social and environmental intervention strategies to promote sustainability. This article focuses on the theoretical construction of the models.

TI Place identification, social cohesion, and environmental sustainability
SO ENVIRONMENT AND BEHAVIOR
LA English
DT Article
ID IDENTITY; TRUST
AB In the study reported in this article the roles of social cohesion, residential satisfaction, and place identification are examined for their effect on place-related social identity and its consequential impact on attitudes to environmental sustainability. Two neighborhoods in Guildford, Surrey, England were selected on the basis of their social histories, housing types, and socioeconomic composition. Ninety residents in each neighborhood were sampled. Research methods included cognitive mapping and a questionnaire survey. A structural equation model was used to analyze the covariances between the different factors. The results show clear differences between the two neighborhoods in terms of residential satisfaction, with only some differences in terms of identification and social cohesion and sustainability. Conclusions are drawn that suggest an important relationship between identity and sustainability behavior that is suggestive for future research.

TI Urban social identity and sustainability - Barcelona's Olympic Village
SO ENVIRONMENT AND BEHAVIOR
LA English
DT Article
ID PLACE-IDENTITY; SELF
AB One of the most recent Fields of investigation in environmental psychology focuses on the relationship between human behavior and management of environmental resources, aspects related to what is known today as sustainable human development. For the authors, this kind of behavior is linked to the relation that people establish with particular environments, specifically, the processes of socio-environmental identity that condition the people-environment relationship. The authors present the results of a study conducted in the Olympic Village of Barcelona. The urban social identity of residents was analyzed, focusing on three main factors: identification-satisfaction, image of the neighborhood, and perceived social homogeneity. These three factors were analyzed in relation to a series of items in the initial questionnaire referring to proenvironmental behavior, representation of particular natural resources, and environmental attitudes. The authors expected the answers to these questions would differ significantly according to the degree of identification of residents with their neighborhood.

TI Identity, quality of life, and sustainability in an urban suburb of
   Barcelona - Adjustment to the City-Identity-Sustainability network
   structural model
SO ENVIRONMENT AND BEHAVIOR
LA English
DT Article
AB This article presents a summary of a descriptive analysis of a town in the suburban area of Barcelona and the adjustment of the data compiled to the City-Identity-Sustainability (CIS) structural models. The analysis was conducted in a reduced sample of a wider study and aimed to identify and analyze potential social effects of the plans for the town's urban growth. In addition to the CIS questionnaire, ethnographic, qualitative, and quantitative studies were also carried out to collect complementary information; these are not reported here. The results show high levels of satisfaction and perceived quality of life that are independent of the objective life conditions. The adjustment to the CIS structural models shows that identity correlates with propensity to sustainability. The results are related to the emergence of a positive social identity that fits the social cohesion model in poor and standard areas, whereas the well-structured urban areas present a good fit with the identification model.

TI Sustainable development and identity in two Venezuelan communities
SO ENVIRONMENT AND BEHAVIOR
LA English
DT Article
AB Environmental problems that our planet currently faces are causing concern. In response, a number of development models have been proposed, seeking to ensure the continuity of life and the availability of the resources needed for survival. Among these models is that of sustainable development. The authors' participation in the City-Identity-Sustainability Project contributed some ideas about this model's implementation in the Venezuelan context. The study was conducted in two urban communities. The results suggest that the community space in both communities is a basic core of social interaction in the inhabitants' lives, generating informal networks that provide a foundation for the development and cohesion of an urban social identity. Results also suggest that there is a lack of information regarding the conservation of natural resources. The authors conclude that it is necessary to formulate awareness-raising strategies regarding the environment in the community context as a favorable place for the model's viability.

TI Identity and sustainability in two neighborhoods of Guadalajara, Mexico
SO ENVIRONMENT AND BEHAVIOR
LA English
DT Article
AB As part of the international project City-Identity-Sustainability, a study was carried out in two popular neighborhoods in the city of Guadalajara. One of the neighborhoods, Analco, was traditional and well consolidated; the other, Los Colorines, was new and in the process of consolidation. An adapted survey was applied to evaluate identity, sustainability, and demographic data. Results suggest that the relationship between greater or lesser consolidation and practices of sustainability is mediated mainly by factors of identity and collective satisfaction with the place.

TI Appropriation and interpersonal relationships - From dwelling to city
   through the neighborhood
SO ENVIRONMENT AND BEHAVIOR
LA English
DT Article
ID IDENTITY
AB Based on the results of three field research studies in Paris, this article outlines the way in which the individual constructs a cognitive and behavioral relationship with the environment at three different levels: housing, the residential neighborhood, and the city as a whole. Identity and environmental identification generating social cohesion and satisfaction is, according to the City-Identity-Sustainability model, an important condition for ecological behavior to occur. The appropriation or nonappropriation of a particular environmental context is analyzed in light of the differentiation of the relation to the dwelling, the immediate neighborhood, and the city and described in terms of modalities of interpersonal relationships, affective investment, satisfaction, and self-expression through residential history and place identity. The characteristics of modern urban life (mobility, transitional situations, and the denaturalization of the urban context) contribute to alter the individual's relations to dwelling as well as to the immediate and enlarged urban context.

DT Article
AB This article presents the results of a comparative analysis of three models: the identification model (IM), the cohesion model (CM), and the general model (GM) proposed by the City-Identity-Sustainability (CIS) Network. These models have been designed for the description of sustainability and all try to explain its relationship with identity and urban development using structural equations. The analyzed items were selected from a longer questionnaire as part of the general CIS Network study. Ten samples from different origins were obtained, with a total of 1,421 participants. To test the models to the concept of sustainability, the parameters are presented in a comparative way. The indicators show a moderate fit. The IM presents a better fit in samples with high levels of urban development, whereas the CM shows a better fit in samples with less developed areas. The best general fit is in the GM model for all the samples.

AB The most significant results of the different studies carried out in the City-Identity-Sustainability research network and published in this special issue are discussed and evaluated. A general structural model was proposed to analyze the existence of a relationship between social identity and propensity to sustainability in the urban life context, in various settings of Latin America and Europe. Propensity to sustainability was valued and the adjustment to two theoretical models (identification and cohesion) was observed in each setting through the structural equation system. Results confirm that there is a relationship between the degree of social identity and propensity to sustainability. Place identity and social cohesion are variables that influence this relationship in a differential way and vary in accordance to the physical quality of the space and the social status of the setting. Thus, the study provides some management guidelines to advance toward sustainability.

TI Ecosocialisation and environmental planning: a Polanyian approach
SO ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING A-ECONOMY AND SPACE
LA English
DT Article
AB Karl Polanyi provided a theoretically astute guide to the political economy of the developed world in the 20th century. He left us with important concepts that can inform thought and action in the 21st century. Most importantly his work brings together a critical understanding of society, nature, and economy and can therefore provide conceptual keys to placing that elusive concept 'ecologically sustainable development' in the broad flow of social change. In this paper I sketch a Polanyian approach to environmental planning, foregrounding the concept of 'ecosocialisation. I move from a discussion of our present situation through an analysis of ecological modernisation and eco-Marxist theory, retrieving some insights and revealing some lacunae. A Polanyian analysis of questions of social change is then outlined. Its implications for environmental planning are explored.

ID FUZZY-SETS; CLASSIFICATION; SUITABILITY
AB The dynamic nature of land qualities both in space and in time suggests that, whatever the stages of the development of an area, it is always crucial to assess land qualities in terms of their potential and suitability for specific kinds of land use on a sustainable basis. In this paper we demonstrate an integrated method of biophysical land-suitability assessment, which combines two basic land-evaluation principles: allowing trade-offs among evaluation criteria, and a limiting condition approach. Decision criteria consist mainly of biophysical parameters, based on internal and external groups of land properties. Internal variables include various physical and chemical characteristics of soils, whereas external variables are those of topographic attributes. A fuzzy set methodology was employed to calculate values of a membership function, MF (0 less than or equal to MF less than or equal to 1.0), of each land variable. These fuzzy membership values were then combined to produce land-suitability indices, LSIs (0 less than or equal to LSIs less than or equal to 1.0), which can be used to assess the potential of land for a nominated land-use type. The analysis procedure implements a convex combination, which permits trade-offs between criteria of the same group, and a multiplicative function, which takes no account of compensation between groups (internal and external variables). A limiting condition approach is also incorporated in this system to resolve shortcomings found when using a convex combination technique alone. The results show that LSIs are consistent with categorical classes generated from applying the well-established method based on the Food and Agriculture Organisation framework for land evaluation. However, the LSIs, as derived from a cell-by-cell operation, produce more detailed subdivisions of land in terms of their potential for a given purpose. The main advantages of using this model include: (1) it minimises subjectivity in the evaluation procedure; (2) it takes into account the combined effects of the factors considered, while preserving information on biophysical constraints for a given purpose; and (3) it is amenable to further computer-based applications, especially for use in geographical information systems.

AB Sustainable construction has developed in the past few decades in the Netherlands to a mature subject of policy, research, and innovation. In the technological field the opportunities for sustainable construction seem to be unlimited. In practice, in the Netherlands, measures to give concrete form to sustainable construction are only scantily applied. The suspicion arises that it is not technical factors but institutional factors that underlie the fact that as yet sustainable construction has failed to force a definitive breakthrough. The authors review to what extent institutions that influence the decisionmaking of players in the building sector regarding whether or not to apply sustainable construction have hindered improvement in sustainable construction.

AB Hydrogeochemical investigations, which are significant for the assessment of water quality, have been carried out to study the sources of dissolved ions in groundwaters of some rural areas of Guntur district, Andhra Pradesh, India. Groundwaters in the area are mostly brackish. High contents of SiO2, and Na+ and Cl- ions in groundwater, in comparison with those of seawater, suggests a meteoric origin of groundwater. The high concentration of SiO2 and various geochemical signatures reflect the weathering of minerals. However, the Na++K+ vs Cl- ratio suggests weathering, has occurred only to some extent. The chemistry of groundwater favours the formation of clay minerals (montmorillonite, illite and chlorite), because of evapotranspiration. The positive saturation index of CaCO3 and the high signatures of Ma(2+):Ca2+ and Na+:Ca2+ reveals the occurrence of evaporation. The evaporation enhances the concentration of ions (which occurred originally in the water) in the soils during summer. The very high SO42- and Cl- contents in some groundwaters and the occurrence of kankar (CaCO3) in the area suggest a long history of evaporation. Greater ionic concentration in the groundwaters of post-monsoon compared with pre-monsoon indicates the increasing addition of leachates into the groundwater from the soils in the monsoon and anthropogenic activities, which leads to a deteriorating quality of groundwater. According to the Gibbs' diagrams, rock weathering, to some extent, and evaporation are the dominant phenomena responsible for the higher ionic concentrations found in groundwater. Measures that benefit sustainable management of groundwater quality are suggested in this study.

AB This paper presents a case study from Jumla District, Nepal, investigating local management systems and ecological sustainability of commercial collection of a medicinal plant, spikenard (Nardostachys grandiflora DC, Valerianaceae), growing in alpine meadows. Interviews were undertaken with local collectors, traders, and district forest office staff, and the dynamics of people-plant interactions are analyzed using the Oakerson model. In all, 110 sample plots 1 rn square were laid out in three areas with differing collection and grazing pressures for recording of floristic composition and abundance of spikenard root biomass. Comparisons show significantly more root biomass in uncollected than collected areas with local management and the interpretation of differences in abundance is discussed. The combination of qualitative and quantitative investigations can provide a framework for the study of people-plant interactions, and this study can serve as first step in a compilation of cases to create a more detailed picture of local management systems of Nepali non-timber forest products in general and commercially collected medicinal and aromatic plants in particular.

AB The Traffic Emission Modelling and Mapping Suite (TEMMS) is a program designed to provide detailed estimates of vehicle emissions on urban road networks, and so act as a precursor to urban air quality modelling. TEMMS is a module of the "Quantifiable City", a more extensive model designed to address questions relevant to urban sustainability. Within the Quantifiable City model, TEMMS interfaces with SATURN, a traffic assignment model, and the Airviro or ADMS-Urban pollutant dispersion models, to calculate spatially defined pollutant concentrations for given traffic, meteorological and stationary source emission inputs. TEMMS also contains an integral model, ROADFAC, which calculates emissions of gases and particulates from vehicles using SATURN traffic or vehicle count data. TEMMS integrates these models via a database exchanger, the MapInfo geographic information system, and a custom-built Windows-based graphical user interface, allowing modelling and mapping of link-based vehicle flow and emissions, and grid-based air quality. TEMMS applications include emission and air quality mapping, evaluation of associated transport policies and scenarios, and preparation of inputs to other (e.g., epidemiological) models. Within this context, TEMMS has generated considerable interest from potential end-users in Local Authorities and air quality management support services. Validation of the integrated model is discussed, and an example application of TEMMS to a large UK city presented. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In recent years, significant attention and emphasis has been given to cleaner and,greener technologies in processes and product manufacturing. This is recognized as a key element in pollution prevention (P2) and development of sustainable strategies. Life cycle assessment (LCA) is a systematic approach that enables implementation of cleaner and greener product and process concepts in industry. In recent times substantial progress has been made in the use of LCA for product evaluation and selection. However, its use in cleaner and greener process design and decision-making has not been explored to a great extent.
   Process design and decision-making are challenging activities that involve trade-off of conflicting objectives, namely costs, technical feasibility and environmental impacts. These conflicting objectives can be analysed at the early design and decision-making stage by considering the full life cycle of a process or a product. A cleaner and greener process is the one that is cost optimal, technically feasible, and environmentally benign. To obtain these results LCA requires various tools and techniques in a systematic methodology. This paper proposes a holistic and integrated methodology GreenPro-I for process/product design by combining the traditional LCA approach with multi-criteria decision-making methods. This methodology is simple and applicable at the early design stage and is more robust against uncertainty in the data. Application of the methodology has been demonstrated in the paper through a urea production case study. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB At three study sites, representing Mediterranean, semi-arid and mildly-arid climatic conditions, the effect of shrubs on the spatial patterns of soil moisture was studied. At each site soil moisture was measured, on hillslopes, at the vicinity of 8 shrubs. For each shrub the measurements have been taken at 3 microenvironments, i.e. under the shrub (US), at the margins of shrub (MS) and between shrubs (BS). At the microenvironments US and MS the measurements were taken at 3 directions: upslope, downslope and sideslope of the shrubs. At all sampling points soil samples were taken from 3 depths: 0-2, 2-5 and 5-10 cm. In addition, rock fragments cover percentage near the shrubs was determined. A soil moisture pattern was found, around each shrub, which is composed of a radial gradient and a downslope gradient. The radial gradient is expressed by soil moisture decreasing from the US microenvironment, in all directions, through the MS towards the BS microenvironment. The US microenvironment has a `spatial advantage' of higher soil moisture content due to (1) relatively higher infiltration rate, (2) capture overland flow from the BS area upslope that shrub and (3) low evaporation rate because of the shading effect. The downslope gradient is expressed by decreasing soil moisture from the upslope direction of each shrub (MS and US microenvironments) towards the downslope direction of that shrub (MS and US microenvironments, respectively). This gradient is controlled by the relatively high content of rock fragments near the shrubs at their upslope direction. Such rock fragments spatial distribution is attributed to (1) the detachment and transport of rock fragments by sheep and goats trampling and (2) the effect of shrub on the continuity of overland flow and sediment transport. The effect of rock fragments is similar to that of shrubs regarding increasing infiltration and decreasing evaporation rate. The relatively high soil moisture at the upslope direction of each shrub enhances annuals growth producing a positive feedback loop: soil moisture - annuals growth - trampling. This sequence maintains the typical rock fragments spatial organization and contributes to the sustainability of the grazing system. At all the study sites at the US microenvironment there is a trend of decreasing soil moisture with increasing soil depth. At microenvironments MS and BS soil moisture increases with soil depth. The results are of great relevance for rehabilitation strategies as they suggest that in order to combat desertification in degraded semi-arid and mildly-arid areas, where the main land use is grazing, both shrubs and rock fragment should be kept at their present spatial distribution.

SO ENVIRONMENTAL POLITICS

DT Article
AB State regulation of natural resource harvesting generates distributional conflicts. Political costs connected with distribution can be reduced by diversion of conflict behaviour or by reduction of the scarcity defined by the regulation. The state and industry organisations thus face a dilemma as to the distribution of decision-making power. The Norwegian and the Canadian east coast cod fisheries have had radically different experiences in terms of marine resource scarcity. These have generated different institutional solutions to this problem. The Canadian groundfish crisis has triggered reforms which have de-politicised decision-making procedures concerning conservation at the price of heated vertical conflicts of distribution. In Norway, a high level of industry involvement has remained, and responsibilities for resource conservation and distribution have not been separated. The level of vertical conflict is thus kept low, but it can be argued that this strategy may be ecologically risky.

AB The approach used to track the flow of carbon sequestered in the forest through harvest, processing into products, and final disposition of products is described. The methodology is broadly flexible and applicable to forest-based carbon balance assessments. A carbon balance is computed across all forestland ownerships for the production facility of interest. The balance considers forest uptake, harvest, combustion of fuels, emissions from process steps and losses from product use, disposition and recycling. The method also allows for sensitivity and marginal assessments of a variety of real and hypothetical situations using variable assumptions. Example results for a vertically integrated pulp and paper mill are presented. Results suggest that integrated forest products facilities drawing their raw material from sustainably managed forests can achieve a net positive carbon balance over the product cycle. The amount of net carbon sequestration attributable to such facilities depends upon a number of factors. The most critical of these include net forest growth, the method for allocating the growth in forest carbon among all of those harvesting from the drain area of a given facility, and the use and disposal patterns for the paper or wood products manufactured.

AB Forests provide significant commodity and noncommodity values to the citizens of the United States. An important and substantial role in ensuring the continued health, productivity, and sustainability of these resources is a reliable and credible inventory and monitoring program. The Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) program of the US Forest Service has been monitoring and reporting on status, condition, and trends in the nation's forests for over 70 years and the Forest Health Monitoring (FHM) program for the last 11 years. Recent legislation included in the 1998 Farm Bill, along with efforts to integrate inventory and monitoring networks to deliver Criteria and Indicators of Sustainable Forests, are redefining the role and operation of the recently integrated FIA and FHM programs. This paper provides a brief history and a look at new directions for the enhanced FIA Program. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

ID RISK ASSESSMENT
AB Decision-makers require useful tools, such as indicators, to help them make environmentally sound decisions leading to effective management of hazardous wastes. Four hazardous waste indicators are being tested for such a purpose by several countries within the Sustainable Development Indicator Programme of the United Nations Commission for Sustainable Development. However, these indicators only address the 'downstream' end-of-pipe industrial situation.
   More creative thinking is clearly needed to develop a wider range of indicators that not only reflects all aspects of industrial production that generates hazardous waste but considers socio-economic implications of the waste as well. Sets of useful and innovative indicators are proposed that could be applied to the emerging paradigm shift away from conventional end-of-pipe management actions and towards preventive strategies that are being increasingly adopted by industry often in association with local and national governments. A methodological and conceptual framework for the development of a core-set of hazardous waste indicators has been developed. Some of the indicator sets outlined quantify preventive waste management strategies (including indicators for cleaner production, hazardous waste reduction/minimization and life cycle analysis), whilst other sets address proactive strategies (including changes in production and consumption patterns, eco-efficiency, eco-intensity and resource productivity). Indicators for quantifying transport of hazardous wastes are also described.
   It was concluded that a number of the indicators proposed could now be usefully implemented as management tools using existing industrial and economic data. As cleaner production technologies and waste minimization approaches are more widely deployed, and industry integrates environmental concerns at all levels of decision-making, it is expected that the necessary data for construction of the remaining indicators will soon become available.

ID EXERGY ANALYSIS
AB Life cycle analysis is one of the tools in the assessment of the sustainability of technological options. It takes into account all effects on the ecosystem and the population which may endanger the possibilities of current and future generations. However, the main bottleneck in current LCA methodologies is the balancing of different effects, being all quantified on different scales. In this work, a methodology is proposed, which allows one to quantify different effects of the production, consumption and disposal of goods, and services on a single scale. The basis of the methodology is the second law of thermodynamics. All production, consumption and disposal processes affecting the ecosystem and the population, are quantified in terms of loss of exergy. The exergy content of a material is the maximum amount of energy which can be transformed into work at given environmental conditions. Next to the elaboration of the methodology, the new approach is illustrated by examples of the production of synthetic organic polymers, inorganic building insulation materials and different waste gas treatment options.

AB In this paper, we present applied methanol recycling technology utilising chromatographic applications, which has been designed for an academic-size institution. The procedure is combined out of proper recovery technique and the biodegradation method intended for postprocessing residues. Additionally, analytical methods controlling the quality of the process are described in detail in order to enable full transfer of the proposed methodology to the analogous institution. The recovered solvent is of relatively high purity (>99.92%), containing traces of water and volatile compounds. The spectral purity is sufficient to employ recycled methanol in HPLC applications where low wavelength detection is necessary. Biodegradation of distillation first-cuts and still bottoms is implemented using isolated strains of Methylobacterium organophilum. During the biodegradation process, a series of carotenoids are biosynthesized, which are of a high commercial value. The proposed application, therefore, offers not only a sustainable, waste-free solution in handling methanol waste, but can also serve as a potential source of value.

AB Runoff from tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill) production with polyethylene mulch has been implicated in the failure of commercial shellfish farms in the Mid-Atlantic Region of the United States. Copper, applied in the form of copper hydroxide, is the most widely used fungicide-bactericide for control of tomato diseases, and recently has been detected in the Chesapeake Bay (USA) watershed. Elevated levels of copper have been shown to have adverse effects on shellfish, finfish, and other aquatic organisms. This research evaluates the off-site movement of copper with the dissolved phase and the particulate phase of runoff from controlled field plots containing tomato plants grown in either polyethylene mulch or a vegetative mulch, hairy vetch (Vicia villosa Roth.). Overall, runoff collected from polyethylene mulch plots contained significantly (p less than or equal to 0.05) greater loads of dissolved- and particulate-phase copper than runoff from hairy vetch mulch plots, However. the loss of copper associated with the particulate phase was significantly greater (p less than or equal to 0.05) than that associated with the dissolved phase of runoff from both mulch treatments, with the particulate phase accounting for more than 80% of the copper load,,, The reported toxicity of copper to aquatic organisms and the greater runoff volume, soil loss, and off-site loading of copper measured in runoff from the polyethylene mulch that this management practice is less sustainable and may have a more harmful impact on aquatic ecosystems.

ID MANSONI; HAEMATOBIUM
AB A cross-sectional epidemiological survey was made on intestinal schistosomiasis due to Schistosoma mansoni in Wondo Genet, southern Ethiopia, in 1999 to generate preintervention parasitological and malacological baseline data to be used as a reference in evaluation of community-based pilot control trial to be launched using wild-growing Endod A total of 3000 stool specimens were collected from schoolchildren enrolled in 14 schools and microscopically examined using Kato method. The overall prevalence and intensity of schistosomiasis mansoni was 34.6% and 184 eggs per gram of stool (EPG), respectively. Children excreting Schistosoma mansoni eggs were found in all of the 14 schools surveyed with a prevalence of infection ranging from 1.9% in Abaye School to 80.6% in Shesha Kekele School. The overall prevalence of S. mansoni infection among males and females was 38.4% and 27.3%, respectively (P = 0.0001, 95% C.I = 7.5% - 14.7%) where as the intensity of infection was 186 EPG and 181 EPG, respectively (P = 0.8045, 95% C.I = 1.17% - 1.23%). Malacological surveys of 27 water contact sites revealed the occurrence of Biomphalaria pfeifferi in 8 sites out of which 3 harbored infected snails shedding schistosome cercariae. The necessity for initiating community-based sustainable control programme is discussed.

AB Genetic diversity among 20 wheat genotypes/cultivars from diverse locations of Pakistan was studied using random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis. A total of 445 DNA fragments were amplified with 50 random decamer primers 64.38% of which were polymorphic. Genetic similarity matrix based on Nei & Li's (1979) index detected coefficients ranging from 75.60% to 92.74%. These coefficients were used to construct a dendrogram using unweighted pair group of arithmetic means (UPGMA). The wheat genotypes were clustered into one major group (A) and two small groups (B and C). The most distant genotype in the dendrogram was PARC-1 that was 75.60% to 84.94% genetically similar with the other genotypes and clustered with PARC-3 which formed a group distantly related with the other clusters. Moreover, most of the wheat genotypes developed from the same breeding centre clustered in one group. It has been clearly shown that most of the cultivars except PARC-1 possessed narrow genetic background. The information would be helpful for future genome mapping programs as well as for the application of intellectual breeder rights in the country. The study will also work as indicator for wheat breeders to evolve varieties with diverse genetic background to achieve sustainability in wheat production in the country.

ID DIVERSITY
AB Durable disease resistance and sustainable agriculture are two important concepts that have not been defined well enough for many people to determine with certainty whether a particular entity fits into either category. While there is not agreement on either definition, there is little disagreement that each concept is a desirable objective. Ironically, both concepts can be reduced to `over a long period of time'. While most people would not argue with the indefinite characterization of either concept, disagreement quickly arises when consideration begins of how to achieve either. Most disease resistance that is rendered ineffective is race specific. The pathogen population is shifted genetically to defeat the resistance gene. When resistance is only partial, the population shifts are less likely to occur. Equally so, the more complex the genetics of the resistance, the more difficult it is for the pathogen to evolve to a form that can overcome the resistance. Throughout history, there are countless examples of major losses of crops when previous effective resistance has been rendered ineffective, causing severe hardship and even devastating famines, e.g., Irish potato famine. Fortunately, there are also examples of resistance that has given protection over an extended time, one is rust in maize. Ultimately, adding genetic complexity to many host plant resistances is likely to extend their effectiveness (greater durability). Similarly, adding biodiversity to the landscape for both plants and animals is likely to increase the resiliency of the ecosystem involved. In both cases, the derived food system will be more secure.

To correctly perform multicast, we present the natural list to sort the destination nodes. It can be proved to be deadlock-free for both one-port and multi-port systems. Furthermore, it creates only one worm for each multicast. Between each pair of nodes in a multicast path with distance k, on the average, there are at least (k+1)!/2(k) adaptive shortest paths, which is superior to previous works. We also propose a heuristic algorithm to reduce the path length. The simulation result shows that its sustainable throughput is much better than related works. In addition, unicast and broadcast can be treated as degenerated cases and use the same routing algorithm. Therefore, it offers a comprehensive routing solution for communication on hypercubes.

TI The International Building Exhibition (IBA) Emscher Park, Germany: A
   model for sustainable restructuring?
SO EUROPEAN PLANNING STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
AB The International Building Exhibition (IBA), Emscher Park was a 10 year programme of the Land Northrhine-Westfalia, Germany, between 1989 and 1999. It was designed to initiate restructuring in the part of the Ruhr region, the Emscher, which has been suffering the most from economic, environmental and social decline for many decades. One of the Exhibition's principle features was that restructuring should take an holistic view rather than simply trying to attract inward investment and jobs. As a result the programme was based around a huge 80 km long landscape park. This report aims to introduce and critically assess the IBA, in relation to the principles of sustainability with some thoughts for the future. It begins by outlining what sustainability means for the Ruhr and Emscher regions, moving on to describe the unique nature of the Exhibition. It then considers whether or not the initiative adheres to sustainability principles and discusses the successes and failures. The report ends with a brief look at what can be learned from the exhibition, both within the region and outside.

AB Parasite life-history theory predicts the potential for prudent host resource use by monoclonal infections. Deterministic models show that prudence will be favoured if an infection suffers density-dependent limits to population growth on or in a host individual. This implies that the release of transmission stages throughout the infection cycle should maximize the reproductive output (and hence fitness) of a monoclonal parasite infection. This hypothesis was tested by experimentally imposing a maximum sustainable yield harvesting strategy on monoclonal aphid colonies grown in the laboratory. Harvesting increased colony longevity, but its effect on total dispersal and colony fitness (a measure that accounted for the timing of dispersal) was subtle. Harvesting increased dispersal and fitness due to adult unwinged dispersers, at the expense of nymphal dispersers. This effect is predicted to increase clonal fitness, since adult unwinged dispersers will have more chance of surviving dispersal costs and represent a unit of colony investment similar to the more specialized winged disperser morph. Despite this, unmanipulated aphid colonies showed a bang-bang dispersal strategy, suggesting that factors promoting late dispersal outweigh the influence of density-dependent colony growth on dispersal strategies in natural aphid populations. Candidate selection pressures include genotypic diversity within aphid colonies and interactions with natural enemies.

TI Profitability of cassava-maize production under different fallow systems
   and land-use intensities in the derived savanna of southwest Nigeria
SO EXPERIMENTAL AGRICULTURE
LA English
DT Article
ID COVER CROPS; ALFISOL; GROWTH; YIELD
AB Population pressure has diminished the role of the traditional bush fallow system in restoring the fertility of depleted soils following several years of cultivation in the derived savanna of Southwest Nigeria. The search for alternative fallow systems led to the development of alley cropping using Leucaena leucocephala and cover cropping using Pueraria phaseoloides. These soil-conserving systems also embody the principles of sustainability by ensuring stable crop yields in spite of an increase in land-use intensity. Simulating smallholder farm conditions and based on a split-plot experiment with the three fallow systems as the main plots and four different land-use intensities (LUI) as the subplots, simple direct observation and record keeping were used to collect data on labour use in all farm operations including fuelwood cutting and stacking in alley cropping systems with fallow phases. Data collection covered a period of four years (1993-96), corresponding to one out of the three phases (or complete cycles) of the trial. Partial budget analysis was used to estimate profitability of cassava (Manihot utilissima)-maize (Zea mays) under each LUI Results based on crop production indicate that each of the cassava-maize enterprises was profitable but the level of profit varied from 10 819 to 50 289 Naira ha(-1). Production under cover cropping has a net benefit advantage of 4-25% (over that under bush fallow) and 25-60% (over alley cropping). Profitability increased as the LUI decreased, depicting the overall importance of fallow periods on soil fertility restoration. Results based on crop production plus fuelwood operations indicate that production with cover cropping has a net benefit advantage over that of both bush fallow and alley cropping under both zero-fallow and one-year fallow LUIs. However, results from two- and three-year fallows indicate that fuelwood yield generated sufficient revenue to put alley cropping at a net benefit advantage of 29-42% over bush fallow and 26-37% over cover cropping. From these results, cover cropping is recommended, especially to farmers in areas where, although land shortage is a problem, fuelwood and the other sources of domestic energy are still cheap and easily accessible. However, in areas with abundant land and where farmers can still wait for fallow periods of at least two years, alley cropping is recommended since, in addition to soil fertility improvement, substantial revenue is obtained. However, considerations of yield variability, labour scarcity, as well as risk-aversion behaviour among farmers may alter their technology choice.

DE electromagnetics; hydrogeology; groundwater; modelling; salinity
AB The Western Australia (WA) and Northern Territory (NT) Governments proposed an area adjacent to the Ord River Irrigation Area for irrigation development. The Natural Resource Agencies of the two Governments determined that development would only be authorised once the existing water resource conditions were known, and when the proponent had shown that irrigation could be managed to preserve natural streamflows and operate sustainably. To enable the hydrogeological conditions to be determined and modelled, an airborne electromagnetic survey was commissioned. Each of the hydrogeological environments was evaluated to determine the effects of irrigation and land-use changes on groundwater levels, groundwater quality, and on flows in seasonal watercourses.
   The results of two generations of groundwater modelling were integrated in the environmental management plan for the irrigation project, with requirements for continuous monitoring and interactive groundwater modelling to be specified throughout the life of the irrigation project. This is an innovative application of geophysics, where the full life cycle of irrigation could be planned and water use managed, based on environments identified in an airborne survey.

AB This paper addresses feminist materialism as political practice through a case study of IWW-Earth First! Local 1, the late Judi Bari's organization of a radical ecology/timber workers' union in the ancient redwood forests of Northern California. Rejecting the Earth First! mythology of timber workers as 'enemies' of nature, Bari sought to unite workers and environmentalists in pursuit of sustainable forestry practices against the devastating approaches favoured by multinational logging corporations. In so doing, she brought a working-class feminist perspective to the radical ecology of Earth First! Bari's work provided a significant instance of community organizing in opposition to the masculinist, exclusionary practices and misanthropic posturing of Earth First!'s self-proclaimed 'eco-warriors' and 'rednecks for nature'. What is perhaps most interesting about the development of Local 1 is the articulation of feminist, environmentalist and labour discourses through a series of political actions.

Many of the eminent writers and activists at the forefront of the movement are Indian women, a fact that may come as a surprise to some, but is part and parcel of the movement's basis in sustainable development and resistance to patriarchal hegemony.

DE bio-social; ethics; sustainability; postmodernity
AB The body has come back in late postmodernity and with a vengeance in social practices and discourses as well as in science and bio-technology, in contemporary evolutionary theory and under the impact of information technologies. The body is a bundle of contradictions: it is a zoological entity; a genetic data-bank, while it also remains a bio-social entity, that is to say, a slab of codified, personalised memories. It is part animal, part machine but the dualistic opposition of the two, which our culture has adopted since the 18th century as the dominant model, is inadequate today. Contemporary science and technology in fact have reached right into the most intimate layers of the living organism and the structures of the self, dissolving boundaries that had been established by centuries of humanistic thinking.

TI Tax burden and the allocation of investment in international framework

SO FINANCE A UVER
LA Czech
DT Article
AB The closely interconnected economies of the European Union and associated countries have to be responsive to changes in each other's tax policy. A mathematical model based on Haufler & Wooton (1999) assumes a monopolistic firm that considers a fixed capital investment in one of two asymmetric countries as regards size, labor costs and corporate tax rate. We assume that the trade between the two countries involves some transaction costs.
   The model calculates a sustainable corporate tax rate, and it also shows that the smaller country is able to attract the firm's investment at the expense of its own tax revenues. We have ranked Central European countries based on the results of the model. The model contributes to the discussion of the theory of tax competition, since it shows the importance of non-tax factors for international competitiveness of a country.

TI Canada's recreational fisheries: The invisible collapse?
SO FISHERIES

   DEPENSATION; RECOVERY; CLIMATE; SEA
AB Fishing for recreation is a popular activity in many parts of the world and this activity has led to the development of a sector of substantial social and economic value worldwide. The maintenance of this sector depends on the ability of aquatic ecosystems to provide fishery harvest. We are currently witnessing the collapse of many commercial marine fisheries due to over-exploitation. Recreational fisheries are typically viewed as different from commercial fisheries in that they are self-sustaining and not controlled by the social and economic forces of the open market that have driven many commercial fisheries to collapse. Here we reject the view that recreational and commercial fisheries are inherently different and demonstrate several mechanisms that can lead to the collapse of recreational fisheries. Data from four high profile Canadian recreational fisheries show dramatic declines over the last several decades yet these declines have gone largely unnoticed by fishery scientists, managers, and the public. Empirical evidence demonstrates that the predatory behavior of anglers reduces angling quality to levels proportional to distance from population centers. In addition, the behavior of many fish species and the anglers who pursue them, the common management responses to depleted populations, and the ecological responses of disrupted food webs all lead to potential instability in this predator-prey interaction. To prevent widespread collapse of recreational fisheries, fishery scientists and managers must recognize the impact of these processes of collapse and incorporate them into strategies and models of sustainable harvest.

ID MINKE WHALES; MODEL
AB Recently, ecosystem management has become popular for forestry, agriculture and fisheries management. Carrying capacity and maximum sustainable yield for a particular species definitely depend on population sizes of other species in the same ecosystem. Natural stock fluctuations of sardine, anchovy and chub mackerel are well known examples of large, natural fluctuations. There is a negative correlation among their fluctuations. In accordance with the cyclic advantage hypothesis for replacement of pelagic fish species (Matsuda et al., 1992), we can predict the next dominant species, despite an uncertainty in the year of the next replacement. We recommend that commercial fisheries should switch their target to the next dominant species before the stock of the present dominant species collapses. Whilst total allowable catch (TAC) of the present dominant species can be as large as we can consume, TAC after the species collapses should be much smaller than the present catch level.

DE Chrysichthys; Lake Volta; growth; mortality
AB Estimation of population parameters of two commercially important claroteids (Chtysichthys auratus and C. nigrodigitatus) in lake Volta were obtained from length composition data compiled in 1995 and 1996. The von Bertalanffy growth constants for C. auratus were computed as L-infinity = 31.0 cm, SL, K = 0.60 yr(-1) and to = -0.12 yr with derived growth performance index (phi' = 2.76). Corresponding estimation for C. nigrodigitatus were L-infinity = 44.5 cm, K = 0.65 yr(-1), t(0) = -0.22 yr and phi' = 3.12. The two species live for about 5 years and attain at least 50% of the asymptotic length at the first age class. The growth patterns determined by the growth performance index (phi') were higher for C. nigrodigitatus than for C auratus of similar sizes. Total mortality rate, Z, for the fish ranging 6.0-30.0 cm SL was estimated as 2.63 yr(-1) and the natural mortality rate, M, estimated as 1.30 yr(-1) with average fishing mortality, F, calculated as 1.33 yr(-1). From the mortality estimation the exploitation ratio (E = F/Z) for C. auratus was 0.51. Mortality rate estimates for C nigrodigitatus were Z = 3.77 yr(-1), M = 1.24 yr(-1) and F = 2.53 yr(-1) and exploitation ratio, E, calculated as 0.67 which is indicative of over-fishing. The management implications of the results to the fishery are discussed and suggestions made for sustainable exploitation of the stocks. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Asia is the largest continent in the world. Asians comprise 60% of the world's current population of 6.1 billion. Since ancient times, most Asians have relied on fish and other aquatic foods as a major source of animal protein. At the end of the 1990s, a full two-thirds of the world annual food fish production, 93 million metric tons, were consumed in Asia. The vast aquatic resources in the region coupled with aquaculture history which spans for millennia have predisposed the Asians to be predominantly seafood consumers. In 1999, aquaculture and capture fisheries production in the region constituted 91% and 49% by weight, respectively, of the total world production. The top ten aquaculture producers and five of the top ten capture fisheries producers were from Asia.
   The substantial increase in aquaculture production may principally be attributed to the significant advances in fisheries science over the past century. The biology of many aquatic organisms has been understood more extensively and, accordingly, led to the development of modern aquaculture technologies. On the other hand, the nature of capture fisheries resources has also become better comprehended. For instance, the idea that the seas and oceans are inexhaustible has been shown untenable. At the present, however, Asian fisheries are at considerable danger mainly due to environmental degradation and overexploitation. The recognition of the fragility of both aquaculture and capture fisheries resources, and the efforts to ensure their sustainability, may perhaps be the best outcomes so far from the advances made in the field of fisheries science not only in Asia but throughout the world. Under this current scenario, making use of the advances in fisheries science is even more crucial.
   Most recent advances in fisheries sciences are broad in scope and multi-disciplinary in nature, taking advantage of the rapid developments in physical sciences, molecular biology and information technology. Furthermore, socio-cultural and economic concerns are being given due attention. There is, therefore, sufficient knowledge that can be applied to ensure that Asia continues to utilize its capture fisheries and aquaculture resources. To achieve these objectives, a brief layout of the comprehensive set of strategies is presented to include continuous innovations in aquaculture technology, implementation of relevant management techniques and regulations, and strengthening of regional and international cooperation. It is critical at this time to implement these strategies based on the current knowledge or it will be too late. From the trends in capture fisheries and aquaculture in the past century, it has become apparent that the fundamental roles and contributions of fisheries science are vital for the well-being of future generations in the 21(st) century and further.

AB Effective utilization of large potential productivity of the ocean's renewable biological resources is important for pursuing sustainable development of marine environment. The biological productivity and fisheries harvest of the ocean is dependent on net primary production, which could be limited by availability of macronutrients or, in some open-ocean region, micronutrients such as iron. Understanding the regulatory mechanisms of the primary production in global marine ecosystems is essential to assess the feasibility of increasing the ocean harvest. Experimental approach such as the in situ iron enrichment experiment seems to be a strong tool to test the hypothesis on relationship between primary production and fish production. Using the ocean as a laboratory we can accumulate the knowledge of the ocean's global metabolism, which helps to ensure harmonious coexistence between nature and human beings.

AB The present study investigates the status of swordtip squid (Loligo edulis) stocks in the southwest sea of Japan and the East China Sea, which are multi-gear and multi-national fishing grounds. Commercial landings of six fisheries for the period 1980-99 and eight research trawl-survey data sets from 1986 from 1999 were used to estimate minimum biomass in each fishing ground. The relationships between stock and recruitment and between catch and fishing effort were estimated using regression analysis. The maximum sustainable yield (MSY) and the corresponding fishing effort for given interspecies relationships are then obtained. Predicted fishing effort rates were estimated from a relative gross profitability for each fishery for the past 5 years and were proposed as an alternative standard to assign the fishing effort to each fishery. Estimates of fishing effort at MSY were above the current fishing effort in the southwest sea of Japan and the East China Sea. However restraint for the increase rate in fishing effort is required in the East China Sea to prevent stock collapse. The present results also suggest that fishing effort for the Chinese offshore trawl fishery should firstly be reduced, if the fishing effort has to be adjusted in the East China Sea.

AB Coral reefs and associated systems support highly diverse assemblages of fishes that demonstrate remarkable variation in patterns of geographic distribution, ecology, behavior and life history. Unfortunately, our understanding of these patterns is relatively limited. Meanwhile, many species for which little information exists are under direct or indirect threat from destructive fishing, over-fishing, and habitat loss associated with fish harvests and from the effects of coral bleaching. The necessity to obtain good data is in conflict with the urgency to define species-specific levels of sustainability, if any, and to develop and implement effective conservation and management plans. Phylogenetic methods may be utilized to analyze life history traits, and well as patterns of ecology and behavior. These methods have been applied in intra- and intergeneric comparisons or in comparisons between different families of fishes. The results have predictive value for related species for which little or no data exist. This point is illustrated in comparisons within two families of reef fishes, the groupers (Serranidae: Epinephelinae), which are harvested for food, and the hawkfishes (Cirrhitidae), which are harvested largely for the aquarium trade.

Examples of problems of conservation include bycatch in a tuna driftnet fishery, inshore habitat degradation, and depletion of humpback whales in the Philippines; possible disappearance of dolphins and porpoises From the Mekong Delta in Vietnam; and depletion of riverine dolphins and large bycatch in a shark fishery in Indonesia. Major causative factors include over-fishing, human overpopulation, development, vulnerability of marine mammals, and evolution of bycatch into directed dolphin fisheries. Needs are for inventory (stock identification and abundance estimation), bycatch monitoring, reduction of takes to sustainable levels, and regional international cooperation.

AB Bycatch and discard are emerging problems in New England region of the United States. A series of meetings with representatives of the fishing industry were held in 10 of the major fishing ports in this region in 2001. The scope of these meetings was to learn about local concerns and incorporate fishermen's unique experience into fisheries science, in order to help reduce bycatch and discard in marine coastal key fisheries. During the meetings thirty species of fish were identified as having substantial bycatch problems. Concerns were then prioritized and technical counter measures were discussed among participants to maintain their fisheries in a sustainable fashion. This type of information gathering, which brings fishermen and scientists together as equal partners, is seen as a workable development of conservation harvesting technology.

AB There are signs of oligotrophication and decrease of fishery production in some estuaries in Japan. Major causes could be a hasty removal of nutrients from sewage and impoundments of rivers. In Japan, phosphorus removal from sewage was successful in alleviating eutrophic conditions of the coastal waters and resulted in decrease of red tide occurrence. However, it seems not only to have decreased the primary production but also to have changed the phytoplankton species composition by the imbalance of N:P ratio in the discharging water. Darns trap nutrients on the bottom of the reservoir as a result of phytoplankton blooms, and thereby decrease nutrient level in the discharging water. Although clean transparent water is generally desirable, moderate nutrient loading is necessary to support sustainable fisheries production. It could be achieved by artificially controlling the amount and the timing of the nutrient discharge from darns and sewage treatment plants. It could be efficient to take the reservoir water out from the lower outlet of the dam, and might be needed to add nutrients in some occasions to support sustainable fishery production.

AB Evaluation of carrying capacity of coastal waters is reviewed for sustainable exploitation of biological production from coastal aquaculture. Accurate estimation of phytoplankton primary production and understanding of oxygen dynamics are of prime importance for scaling the carrying capacity. Preliminary results on the carrying capacity of Otsuchi Bay, a ria in Sanriku coast on the northeastern coast of Japan are summarized. Bio-optical sensors for natural and active fluorescence prove to be useful approaches for rapid and accurate quantification of primary production. This was exemplified by field application of both the natural fluorescence technique and the pulse amplitude modulation of fluorescence to monitor primary production in aquaculture ground. Growth of the cultured kelp called wakame, Undaria pinnatifida was compared with that of phytoplankton as competitors for nutrients during spring. As another important factor determining the carrying capacity, oxygen supply of subsurface layers is considered. During summer time, oxygen consumption of bottom sediment under shellfish rafts was high enough to exhaust dissolved oxygen within three to five days. However, no anoxic water was formed. Wind-driven circulation and inflow of subsurface coastal waters induced by the internal tide supplied enough dissolved oxygen to prevent the formation of anoxic layer.

AB Mangrove area in Thailand reduced by half from 370 thousand in 1961 to 170 thousand ha in 1993. The survey was conducted at Nakhong Si Thammarat in the southern Thailand to evaluate the mangrove reforestation project and to develop an evaluation system for the environmental projects executed by NGO. Project Design Matrix (PDM) was used for analysis. It was found out that, in order to plant mangrove seeds efficiently, availability of the land owned by shrimp aquaculturists was crucial. Wise management of newly planted mangrove is the key issue for the sustainable local resource management. The question 'Whose mangrove?' and its implication to the management of mangrove remained unclear.

AB It is an urgent need to establish ecosystem-based approaches to the evaluation of coastal habitat values for habitat conservation/restoration and sustainable utilization of coastal fishery resources. In this paper, recent research activities related to the above-mentioned task are reviewed and re-organized in light of major functions of the coastal ecosystem. It is proposed that habitat values should be evaluated in two directions: ecosystem stability depending on the species diversity and smoothness of material circulation, the latter of which dimly links with material removal/recycle. In addition, reproductive capacity as a nursery for fishery resources should be included in the evaluation. For further development of the ecosystem-based approach, it is of great importance to accumulate long-term records of biological and ecological changes in the coastal water. In such context, newly emerged concept on the health examination of marine coastal environment is also discussed.

AB Mapping of seagrass and seaweed beds is very important for management and conservation of sound littoral ecosystems and sustainable fisheries in the coastal waters. The methods to map spatial distribution of seagrass and seaweed beds are reviewed. They are classified into two categories. One is a direct method by visual observation and the other is an indirect method using a remote sensing apparatus. Indirect methods are divided into optical or hydro-acoustic methods. Indirect methods require sea truth by direct methods. Optical methods are image analysis of aerial photography or satellite imagery. They are effective for mapping broad areas but limited to shallow waters due to light attenuation in waters. Hydro-acoustic methods such as an echosounder and a side scan sonar have no limitation of turbidity The echosounder is practical to map vertically density and height distributions of seagrass and seaweed beds. The side scan sonar is appropriate for mapping broad horizontal distributions. Coupling of several indirect mapping methods is more useful than using only one method.

AB Recently it is stressed that sustainable development is indispensable for fisheries. It requires rational use of the sea, especially in the coastal area. Since there are a lot of aquaculture facilities in coastal waters, it is necessary to localize and count them for management of coastal fisheries. Thus we developed an easy method to map and count them using IKONOS satellite image with high resolution. Processing IKONOS imagery of Yamada Bay, one of rias-type bays in Sanriku Coast, aquaculture facilities for scallops and oysters were analyzed. Two types of aquaculture facilities, wood-raft type and buoy-and-rope type, were identified and examined. The method developed in this study can be applied to not only rias-type bays but also other coastal waters.

AB Despite economic crisis in Thailand, environmental degradation trends have not reversed Several governmental sectors monitoring the status of natural resources are attempting to utilize organisms such as green mussel, red algae, Artemia and bacteria for waste water (shrimp farm effluent, in particular) biological treatment. Educational sectors are carrying out the researches on utilization of mangrove forests and vetiver grasses for domestic waste treatment. Moreover, studies on potential and application technique of benthic polychaetes, common seaweed, and other organisms for sustainable development of coastal shrimp culture are focused. On the whole, lack of integration of knowledge, cooperation among involving authorities and participation in environmental protection by the public were evident as major problems on effective application. Further progress on bioremediation technology in Thailand should deserve more response on the development of coastal culture and waste treatment technology.

AB Various genetic options for improving aquacultural strains are summarized and evaluated from the viewpoint of an individual aquacultural enterprise. Large scale national breeding programs, marker selection and bioengineering give transient economic benefits to "early adopters", but, in the long term, will benefit mainly enterprises (farmers) who hold exclusive franchises or own part of the technology. Profits from increased productivity accrue primarily to technology developers, secondarily to the consuming public, and only marginally to farmers. On the other hand, proprietary improvement of a farmer's own broodstock gives a sustainable competitive advantage to individuals who can defend their ownership rights. Several low-investment (but not necessarily low-technology) procedures for developing strains on individual farms are described and illustrated by a hypothetical cash-flow model that gives a startling increase in the farm net profit (doubling after 5 years). Aquaculture would incorporate the technical benefits of modern genetics more rapidly, therefore, if scientists were to develop additional small-scale, low- and/or high-tech procedures that would enable farmers to capture the economic benefits.

AB The use of probiotics in bioremediation or biological control is now accepted in the field of aquaculture. Bioremediation is the practice of using supplemental bacteria for treating wastewater. In order to achieve and maintain good water quality within the system and improve the quality of discharge water.
   In Thailand, Japan, Malaysia, Indonesia and other Asian countries, bioremediation is used in shrimp and other high value fish farms to improve water quality and to control the growth of pathogenic bacteria. A study on the use of probiotics as biocontrol in shrimp ponds was conducted in the Philippines. Results showed increased shrimp survival and production due to reduced growth of pathogenic microorganisms, particularly the luminous bacteria. Only minimal water exchange was required due to improved water quality inside the ponds.

AB The Mekong Delta of Vietnam is a region rich in aquatic resources with high potential for aquacultural development. Aquaculture in the Mekong Delta is often practiced in combination with other agricultural activities such as animal husbandry and rice cultivation, and is an important factor in improving living standards among impoverished farmers. In addition, the conversion of unproductive rice land to the alternative farming of marine shrimp-rice production is expanding rapidly and helping to raise income levels of farmers engaging in rice production. Other examples of aquaculture systems are also discussed.

AB Fish production in closed recirculating systems, which makes reduced discharge of organic and inorganic wastes possible, is considered to be one of the promising approaches for sustainable development of aquaculture. We have been conducting research on the closed production of Japanese flounder Paralichthys olivaceus since 1986 and developed a pilot scale culture system of 10 m(3) in total water volume. The system consists of a fish tank of 4 m in diameter, settling tank, drum screen filter, submerged biological filter, heating-cooling unit, oxygen generator and supplier, blower, and UV-sterilizer. In the feeding experiment, 1015 fish of 2 g initial body weight were introduced to the fish tank and fed commercial pellet diet twice daily to satiation. Fish grew to 456 g after 259 days with good survival rate (85%) and feed efficiency (97%). Culture density at the end was 31 kg/m(2); the bottom area of the fish tank and total culture water used was 25 m(3). Dissolved oxygen ranged from 90 to 130% of saturation through the rearing period. Ammonia and nitrite were maintained at less than 4 mg-N/L and no apparent adverse effects on the feeding and growth were observed.

AB Widespread commercial harvesting of wild edible mushrooms from the forests of the Pacific Northwest United States (PNW-US) began 10-15 years ago. A large proportion of suitable forest habitat in this region is managed by the Forest Service (US Department of Agriculture) and Bureau of Land Management (US Department of the Interior). These lands are managed under an ecosystem management philosophy that entails multiple-use, sustainable forest product harvesting, resource monitoring, public participation in forest management issues, and holistic planning. Managing the harvest of edible mushrooms engages every aspect of (his management philosophy, We examine a variety of issues raised by mushroom harvesting and how these issues interact with forest ecosystem management choices. We discuss regulations currently being used by managers to conserve the mushroom resource while further information is gathered, unique challenges and considerations inherent to sampling fungi, and current research and monitoring activities in the Pacific Northwest. Although current scientific evidence suggests that harvesting likely will not harm the resource in the short term, no statistically-based monitoring information exists about the cumulative impacts of intensive and widespread commercial harvesting over long-time periods. We outline a three pronged approach to long-term monitoring of the resource: (1) tracking harvest quantities in areas with intense commercial harvests; (2) sampling productivity in areas with no mushroom or timber harvests; and (3) conducting research to model the relations between forest management and mushroom productivity. Public participation and a broad collaboration among public land management agencies, private forest landowners, forest managers, researchers, and research organizations will make this approach cost effective and the results widely applicable.

AB There is concern that repeated rotations of intensive loblolly pine plantation silviculture may degrade site fertility and thus not be sustainable. This study was conducted to estimate biomass, N, and P pools in two loblolly pine plantations before harvest and 10 growing seasons after plantation re-establishment. The soil, litter layer, herb layer, and planted loblolly pine trees were sampled then clear-cut harvested and a second rotation plantation established by chemical and mechanical site preparation. These same components were sampled after the tenth growing season, which is 50% of the first rotation for one plantation and 59% for the other. Second rotation soil N pools ranged from 3134 to 5148 kg ha(-1) , soil P pools ranged from 578 to 767 kg ha(-1), and these were equal to or significantly greater than those of the first rotation. Litter layer N and P pools in the second rotation were the same as or significantly less than those of the first. In one plantation the litter layer N pools were 21-35% of the first rotation and 67-82% in the other stand, The greatest change was in the herb layer with one second-rotation plantation developing an herb layer biomass 6-32 times that of the first rotation. The other plantation had up to an eight-fold increase in the second rotation herb layer biomass compared to the herb layer of the first rotation plantation. Tree biomass accumulation was not proportional to age; it was less. However, the tree N and P pools were equal to or greater than those predicted by age. In one plantation, the tree N pool was 109-223 and 71-207 kg ha(-1) in the other plantation. I propose that the best indicator of sustainability is the conservation of site nutrients, in this case, N and P. Both plantations accumulated N and P faster than predicted by age, indicating that these forest management practices not only conserved site nutrients, but also allowed accumulation. These practices are sustainable by this measure. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

DE criteria and indicators; forest inventory
AB The Santiago Declaration identified seven criteria and 67 indicators for assessing the conservation and sustainable management of temperate and boreal forests. Data collected by the Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) program of the US Department of Agriculture Forest Service can be used to directly address at least 11 biological indicators.
   The FIA program has conducted periodic inventories of forestland for several decades. These inventories provide statistical estimates of forest area, timber volume, growth, removals, and mortality Recent legislation has mandated that the Forest Service inventory the forestland of the US on an annual basis measuring the entire set of national sample plots over a 5-year period.
   This paper identifies which criteria and indicators can be addressed by FIA data; the scale at which it may be appropriate to use these data; and how recent changes will impact the Forest Service's ability to provide information needed to address these indicators. Data from the two most recent inventories of Iowa (1974 and 1990) and Minnesota (1977 and 1990) are used to show how criteria and indicators relate to trends in forest composition and extent, timber resource utilization, and the population size of native and non-native trees. These two states have distinctly different forest resources, ranging from sparse to dense, and provide a good test of the effectiveness of using forest inventory data to provide criteria and indicator information at the state level.
   Analysis of the data for the last two inventories of Iowa and Minnesota reveals that the area of timberland has increased by 34 and 8%, respectively, while growing-stock volumes have increased by 47 and 23%. Volumes of most native species increased over the period, especially for pioneer species such as Juniperus virginiana L. [Little (1979). Agricultural Handbook No. 541, USDA Forest Service, Rocky Mountain Forest and Range Experiment Station, Ft. Collins, CO] (eastern red cedar). A notable exception was the 52% decline of Omits americana L. (American elm) due to the spread of Dutch elm disease. The number of non-native species also increased. In Iowa, the estimated number of live Ulmus pumila L. (Siberian elm) trees, a non-native species, went from 0 in 1974 to 675 x 10(3) in 1990. During the 1990 inventory of Minnesota another non-native species, Ailanthus altissima (Mill.) Swingle (tree of heaven), was sampled for the first time. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB The forestry industry in the southeastern United States relies upon soils that are highly eroded and depleted of their original organic matter and nutrient content. Pro-active land management can ensure continued and possibly increased production and revenue through the management and recovery of the soil resource. With an emphasis on loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) forests, this review integrates land-use history, pine ecology, silviculture, soil ecological research and the implications for forest management into a single discussion. Promoting soil recovery involves knowledge of ecosystem history and disturbance as well as nutrient cycling mechanisms, pools, fluxes and soil forming factors. Research on the rhizosphere is an area that is needed. Recovery of regional soils may confer benefits of drought and disease resistance. The goal of sustainable forestry is compatible with soil recovery; however, the technology and practices of modern forestry deserve thorough evaluation. Emphasis on the continued production of commodities, the agricultural model, is much different from managing for the functioning of healthy forest ecosystems. Many of the practices and outcomes of intensive forest management, including short rotations, harrowing, subsoiling, and burning or removal of logging slash, seem to be at odds with the goal of soil recovery. Best management practices that foster soil recovery include less intensive stand utilization and reduced soil disturbance. Stem-only harvest and longer rotations permit a recovery of soil biodiversity and an accrual of detritus and soil organic matter. Windrowing and similar techniques have dramatic and lasting effects on soil development. No-tillage agriculture as a model for pine plantations is discussed. Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

AB The management of indigenous conifer forests in Westland, South Island, New Zealand has focussed largely on harvest of the Podocarpaceac tree rimu (Dacrydium cupressinum). Today, key management objectives are to maintain the pre-harvested state of the forest in terms of biomass, tree size ranges (especially old trees), natural spatial patterns, relative proportions of the major tree species, and forest timber quality. This approach to natural forest management is based on utilizing heavy-lift helicopters, pre-empting mortality by harvest of a proportion of single unthrifty rimu trees, and an auditable GPS-based forest record system. A transition matrix model is used to determine the expected natural mortality rate and the sustainable harvest is based on pre-empting a proportion of the mortality over a 15-year felling cycle. Trees with significant wildlife features (e.g. cavities and large epiphyte loads) are not harvested, Even natural forest management can impact ecological processes through loss of senile trees, pre-empting forest tree windfall. altering spatial patterns of forest structure and facilitating pest and weed spread. However, because of the dynamic nature of these forest environments, the impact of forestry should be insignificant over major natural disturbance events. The best way to ensure that key management objectives are realized is to adopt an adaptive management approach that involves regularly monitoring of key forest attributes and frequent recalculation of the sustainable harvest model.

TI The potential for sustainable management of semi-natural woodlands in
   southern England using uneven-aged silviculture
SO FORESTRY
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper describes an investigation into the potential use of uneven-aged silviculture in woodlands which have historically been managed using coppice with standards. The study is presented in two parts: the first examines criteria to help decide whether the structure of a woodland is suitable for uneven-aged silviculture, the second proposes two methods of implementation. Three woodlands were selected for the study and data on stand structure and natural regeneration were recorded for nine different strata within these areas.
   Three criteria were chosen to help decide which stands were suitable for uneven-aged silviculture, these related to basal area, size distribution of trees, and the amount, height and species of natural regeneration. Data from the nine woodland strata were compared with the criteria and only one satisfied all of them. The woodlands had an adequate basal area and generally a good distribution of diameters. However, the main constraints were the failure of seedlings of the desired species to develop into saplings, and a lack of information on the use of neglected coppice to produce canopy trees. It was concluded that the criteria were useful but could not be used in isolation from silvicultural judgement.
   The two methods of implementation were the reverse-J diameter distribution and the frame tree method. The reverse-J method is a traditional approach to uneven-aged silviculture in which the diameter distribution is manipulated to resemble an 'ideal' structure. To determine a suite of 'ideal' reverse-J diameter distributions, data from the strata were investigated using a negative exponential function. The second approach, the frame tree method, is a more flexible approach compared with the reverse-J method, and could be used to produce a greater variety of uneven-aged stand structures. Neither of the approaches has been validated and both pose many questions which can probably only be answered by practical implementation.

TI Silvicultural tools to develop irregular and diverse forest structures
SO FORESTRY
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper discusses the dynamic definition of irregularity; it looks at conditions of sustainability and considers under which conditions irregularity could be promoted efficiently. Irregularity is not usually innate in natural forest ecosystems, the exception being in certain developmental stages of old or over-mature stands. Because of these natural tendencies, it is necessary to differentiate between temporary stand structures and sustainable irregular systems. Therefore, any assessment of irregularity needs to take the rules of demographic regulation into account. Different kinds of irregularity are discussed, as is the reference scale for implementation. This makes it possible to distinguish between genuine irregularity within the crown layer, full (vertical) irregularity on stand level (plenter system) and horizontal irregularity (for greater reference scales), by creating irregular patches (as under the irregular shelterwood system). The paper presents the differences between broadleaved species and conifers in a full irregular plenter system with a developed vertical structure. These differences are due to the degree to which tree species can support shade, without losing the ability to recover qualitative capacity and, for older stages, to use crown space efficiently. Other factors are also important: the reaction of tree species to openings, the production of epicormic branches, topology and crown expansion. Therefore, broadleaved plenter forests need much lower equilibrium standing volumes than classical conifer plenter forests and there are also losses in volume increment and stem quality. The silvicultural results produced by the different models for differentiating stands and promoting irregularity are also discussed. It is assumed that for broadleaved species, the compromise between the necessary educative steps (shaping of the stem form within tree populations) and closure control function are better in small populations (openings) than in stands with a single tree structure. Because the ultimate aim is to create not one, but several, co-existing forms of heterogeneity, in the sense of creating varied habitats, modern silviculture should make use of all silvicultural tools. This is a significant challenge for silvicultural expertise.

AB The effects of partial cutting on species composition, stand structure and growth, tree size distribution, and tree disease and mortality were evaluated on 73 plots in 18 stands that were harvested 12-96 years ago in southeast Alaska. Partially-cut stands had diverse and highly complex stand structures similar to uncut stands. Sitka spruce was maintained in mixed hemlock-spruce stands over a wide range of cutting intensities. Analysis of the data did not detect significant changes in tree species composition, stand growth, hemlock dwarf mistletoe infection and incidence of tree wounding or mortality rates with partial cuts. Silvicultural systems using partial cutting could provide a sustainable timber resource including more valuable spruce trees, while also maintaining stand structural diversity and old-growth characteristics.

AB In a globally competitive world, innovation is an essential component of long-term success. For commodity industries in particular, global companies will dominate, with niche-market, nimble, small companies providing specialized products to select customers. Both will require technology. To survive in international markets, Canadian pulp and paper producers must develop integrated business and technology strategies to meet global competition from low-cost fibres and state-of-the-art mills. For competitive positioning, and for increased returns on investment, the mandatory progress in cost reduction must be balanced with revenue growth through new product innovations. Companies can leverage their limited resources through participation in the programs of a research institute. Paprican, as an example, provides access to broadly based technical skills in areas related to cost reduction, and environmental sustainability. At the same time, it delivers world-class, strategically driven research that enables new product design and development. For technologies related to public policy directives such as environmental performance or global warming initiatives, governments must participate as stakeholders in the solutions to their issues.

AB Extension is a multi-faceted learning discipline. It is a process that works with people and the best available science and information to achieve a desired change. While science and technology provide information and tools to support sustainable development, it is the extension of this knowledge to those who must make decisions that enables innovation and sustainable forest management. There are many attempts at improving the links between the forest science and technolog community, and the forest policy and management communities. It is time to make a long-term investment in forestry extension infrastructure to enable a science and knowledge-based innovative sector.

AB To analyse characteristic patterns of dynamic and chronic photoinhibition within a plant community, a new technique is proposed, which is based on the long- and short-term recovery time of maximum photochemical efficiency of PSII (F(v)/F(m)) after environmental stress. Chronic photoinhibition was determined as a sustainable decrease in predawn F(v)/F(m), occurring during periods of prolonged stress, whereas dynamic photoinhibition was assessed from the fully reversible diurnal decline in F(v)/F(m). Applied to a Mediterranean macchia ecosystem, this definition allowed the characterization of typical annual patterns of chronic and dynamic photoinhibition. Both types of photoinhibition were highest during summer drought. However, differences emerged among the ten dominant macchia species regarding their susceptibility to chronic photoinhibition during different seasons. Chronic and dynamic photoinhibition were dependent on leaf orientation. Semi-deciduous species avoided enhanced chronic photoinhibition through a reduction of excessive light interception by vertical foliage orientation during summer, whereas evergreen sclerophylls did not exhibit pronounced structural photoprotective mechanisms. Chronic and total photoinhibition were significantly correlated with predawn and midday water potentials, respectively, and a grouping of the macchia species into three functional groups is proposed according to this relationship.

AB In undisturbed tropical forest ecosystems, the phosphorus (P) cycle is essentially "closed" with minimal short-term losses or gains of P. The forms and dynamics of soil P, however, can be areatly affected by land use changes, which often involve changes in vegetation cover, biomass production and nutrient cycling in the ecosystem. Sequential extraction and 31 P nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy were used to investigate the influence of land use changes on the amount and structural composition of P in the sub-humid highlands of southern Ethiopia. Samples were collected from surface soils (0-10 cm) of natural forest, tea plantations and cultivated fields (25 years) at Wushwush and from Podocarpus dominated natural forest, Cupressus plantations and cultivated fields (30 years) at Munesa sites. Significantly lower (P < 0.05) amounts of total P were found following clear-cutting and Ion-term cultivation (31% and 39%), and establishment of plantations (21% and 22%) at Wushwush and Munesa, respectively. The largest depletion of sodium bicarbonate-extractable organic P (NaHCO3-P-o) (74% and 77%) and sodium hydroxide- 3 extractable P-o (NaOH-P-o) (67% and 67%) due to cultivation occurred in the sand, followed by the silt (52% and 56%, NaHCO3-P-o) and 32% and 53%, NaOH-P-o) and the clay (33% and 42%, NaHCO3-P-o and 28% and 35%, NaOH-P-o) size separates from the two sites, respectively. P-31 NMR spectroscopy revealed that orthophosphate monoesters were the major organic P compounds (27-66%) followed by orthophosphate diesters (9-27%) and teichoic acids (7-11%). Unknown organic P species accounted for 3-8% (unknown A) and 3-5% (unknown B), whereas phosphonates made up 2-3%. The proportion of diester-P decreased in the order: natural forests (24% and 27%) > plantations (15% and 13%) > cultivated fields (10% and 9%) at Wushwush and Munesa, respectively. The percentages of teichoic acid, unknown A, unknown B and phosphonates also decreased, whereas the proportions of orthophosphate monoesters increased following land use changes. Greater decline in proportions of diester-P and teichoic acids were found in the silt than in the clay size separates, which may be attributed to stabilization of microbially derived organic P structures by closer association with clay minerals and/or sesquioxides, The results of sequential extraction and P-31 NMR spectroscopy indicate that continuous cultivation with little or no P input not only decreased the amount, but also influenced the structural composition and bioavailability of P in these tropical soils. Thus measures have to be designed for replenishment and subsequent maintenance of soil P stocks, to ensure sustainable crop production in sub-humid highland agroecosystems of southern Ethiopia.

SO GEOGRAPHISCHE ZEITSCHRIFT

DT Article
AB The projection of economic and social structures onto space and territories (as surveyed space) must be seen as a complicated, technically and financially costly operation. The output of spatial abstraction includes
   the spatial orientation of other social systems,
   the co-ordination of activities within large organisations, the storage of information in a framework of space-time co-ordinates, and
   the compatibility within society.
   Compatibility among formal organisations can be supported by binding property-together with mobile structures (such as persons)-to immobile pieces of land. The acceptance of territorial borders as limitations of unusual, risky activities, the communication, the modes of co-ordination and the final institution of compatibility rules in society determine the patterns of spatial structures and their reflections as regions.
   Thus, global society is not only characterised by global information, finance, and trade flows, but also by a universal acceptance of spatial borders limiting all this. Spatial borders guarantee the compatibility of social systems with contradictory structures or contents. Spatial compatibility allows privatisation of technical,. informational and organisational advantages. Under the conditions of a growing. complexity of programming formal organisations the process of spatial planning turns from linear objective to functional planning, and then to compatibility oriented planning. Compatibility oriented planning is seen to be successful even if a problem is not solved but delayed or transferred to another region: the "anti-sustainability axiom" of modem spatial planning. This kind of planning stabilises centre-periphery differences and other forms of stratification in society. Thus, compatibility oriented planning can be regarded as a survival strategy for public planning, especially in agglomerations, but not as an alternative to spatial planning guaranteeing equal living conditions and the development of democracy in space.

DT Article
AB Sea fishing and competing demands on the use of coastal land both pose problems,for the sustainable use of the natural environment, not least, when the resolution of those problems runs the risk of creating unemplqwnent in communities with narrowlly-based economies. This article outlines these problems, drawing on some recent experience from two areas in Scotland: one that is currently facing a significant threat to its economic well being, and another that has bad a very chequered history, including much economic difficulty, but has also undergone some regeneration. It then draws conclusions about the principles that should guide economic regeneration in such regions.

DT Article
AB At a time When the national curriculum for schools in England gives geography the major responsibiliy for education for sustainable development, this article introduces teachers to the philosophical foundations and key concepts of political ecology. it suggests that these can reform and strengthen geographical education for sustainable development by changing the ways in which nature is constructed and represented in classrooms. In focuses particularly on the education of 11-14 year-olds, suggesting that more radical content, together with a more critical pedagogy, may better meet their developing needs for identity and citizenship.

AB The fauna of Mesozoic epicontinental seas that existed on the territory of the present-day Arctic margin of Eurasia, North America, and islands in the Arctic Ocean is dominated by stenohaline mollusks (ammonoids, coleoids, bivalves, gastropods, brachiopods, foraminifers, ostracodes, radiolarians, etc.). The marine biota consists of cosmopolitan taxa of the boreal Pacific and boreal Atlantic origin, Tethyan immigrants, and endemics, including hundreds of endemic species, tens of endemic genera, and six endemic families. Numerous lines of invertebrates in the Arctic basin evolved sustainably for tens of millions of years. The high taxonomic diversity of the specific marine biota and the ways of its panboreal migration could have been maintained by an oceanic basin occupying the territory of the present-day Arctic throughout the Mesozoic, as a great volume of oceanic water was necessary to provide stable salinity and temperature in the surrounding epicontinental basins through 180 Ma.
   Long and sustainable development of the specific Mesozoic marine biota was provided by the South Anyui ocean in the Triassic and Jurassic and by the Amerasian ocean in the Cretaceous. This evidence substantiates the hypothesis of the presence of oceans in the Arctic throughout the Mesozoic which was suggested proceeding from geodynamic reconstructions.

AB Management of terrestrial carbon fluxes is being proposed as a means of increasing the amount of carbon sequestered in the terrestrial biosphere. This approach is generally viewed only as an interim strategy for the coming decades while other longer-term strategies are developed and implemented-the most important being the direct reduction of carbon emissions. We are concerned that the potential for rapid, disturbance-induced losses may be much greater than is currently appreciated, especially by the decision-making community. Here we wish to: (1) highlight the complex and threshold-like nature of disturbances-such as fire and drought, as well as the erosion associated with each-that could lead to carbon losses; (2) note the global extent of ecosystems that are at risk of such disturbance-induced carbon losses; and (3) call for increased consideration of and research on the mechanisms by which large, rapid disturbance-induced losses of terrestrial carbon could occur. Our lack of ability as a scientific community to predict such ecosystem dynamics is precluding the effective consideration of these processes into strategies and policies related to carbon management and sequestration. Consequently, scientists need to do more to improve quantification of these potential losses and to integrate them into sound, sustainable policy options.

TI The sustainability of resource utilization
SO GREEN CHEMISTRY
LA English
DT Article
AB There is a need for a method with which the sustainability of technological processes can be described quantitatively, and earlier work by De Wulf et al.(1) in cooperation with our laboratory has yielded a useful method based on thermodynamic principles. New insights however have led to a revision of this earlier work, and considerable improvements have been introduced. Most progress is made in quantitatively describing the sustainability of resource utilization. Instead of classifying resources either as renewable or as non-renewable, the new method is based on the depletion rates of resources, which account for many grades of resource renewability and which include also the size of natural reserves of resources. Also, this paper reviews the quantification of other aspects of process sustainability, explains the vital role of exergy, and discusses how the overall sustainability of a process should be determined.

TI Increased catalytic productivity for nanofiltration-coupled Heck
   reactions using highly stable catalyst systems

AB The recycle of homogeneous Heck catalysts from post-reaction mixtures using solvent resistant nanofiltration (SRNF) membranes is known to increase catalytic productivity. However, the technique is sensitive to catalyst stability when applied to conventional catalysts: catalyst deactivation will cause declining reaction rates and higher reactor occupancy with an increasing number of catalyst recycles. In this study, a conventional Heck catalyst {bis(acetato)bis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(II)}, was recycled six times, before the reaction rate dropped below 20% of the original value. A cumulative turnover number (TON) of 690 in 120 h was obtained, whilst providing a product substantially lowered in organometallic impurities. Significant improvements in system performance were realised by employing, at identical Pd loading, state-of-the-art catalysts with greater chemical stability. An imidazolylidene catalyst, bis(1,3-dibenzylimidazoline-2-ylidene)diiodopalladium(II), yielded an equal TON for six recycles in 40 h with substantially less reaction rate decline. Palladium(II) acetate stabilised by the quaternary phosphonium salt (quat) tetraphenylphosphonium bromide even gave six recycles in under 30 h after careful solvent selection. In all cases, the membrane showed good selectivity against the catalyst (up to 96% Pd rejection), while allowing the reaction product to permeate completely. Through the sustainable high reaction rates, reactor occupancy can be minimised, and waste generated by downstream processing reduced. Indeed, the imidazolylidene and the quat-stabilised catalyst systems surpassed 10 catalyst recycles with TONs > 1000 within 60 and 45 h, respectively.

TI Metrics to 'green' chemistry - which are the best?
SO GREEN CHEMISTRY
LA English
DT Article
AB A considerable amount has been written about the use of metrics to drive business, government and communities towards more sustainable practices. A number of metrics have also been proposed over the past 5-10 years to make chemists aware of the need to change the methods used for chemical syntheses and chemical processes. This paper explores several metrics commonly used by chemists and compares and contrasts these metrics with a new metric known as reaction mass efficiency. The paper also uses an economic analysis of four commercial pharmaceutical processes to understand the relationship between metrics and the most important cost drivers in these processes.

SO GREEN CHEMISTRY
LA English
DT Article
AB Since the Rio Earth Summit in 1992, Sustainable Development has been increasingly accepted as a way to run businesses by balancing economic, environmental and societal responsibilities. Important aspects of environmental responsibility are the utilisation of natural resources and the disposal of wastes. These are addressed here. Manufacturing processes and integrated manufacturing chains applied in the petrochemical industry are analysed in terms of feed, energy and chemicals that are consumed. Several chemical intermediates and polymers with large consumption of energy and/or chemicals are readily identified. These may be prime candidates for process improvement efforts. Two indices are proposed for the preliminary evaluation of the recycle options of major polymers. They allow discrimination between materials that need to be reused, those that can also be depolymerised and those for which pyrolysis/gasification or incineration with energy recovery are also responsible options.

SO HOUILLE BLANCHE-REVUE INTERNATIONALE DE L EAU

DT Article
AB The share of electricity produced by hydroelectric plants has been reduced in France from almost 80% in 1960 to 15% today. Hydroelectric generation is facing two issues : ageing equipment, easily controlled at least from a technical point of view, and society's changing expectations concerning other uses of water. And those expectations induce an intense evolution of the legal situation. In addition, rising taxes undermine financial stability. But at the same time, the emerging concept of sustainable development is an opportunity for this renewable energy which has already proved its technical and economical effectiveness.
   A new future is opening for hydroelectricity : small plants possibly integrated in developments having multiple goals, and state-of-the-art power stations built to compensate for the large variability in energy demand.

AB Ensuring appropriate and ecologically responsible coastal protection measures is a complex issue. It also involves numerous institutions such as different level of local authorities. The Government is in charge of enacting appropriate regulations on coastal protection based on coastal zone management mechanisms that can ensure protection and sustainable economic opportunities given the natural resources of both the marine and terrestrial components of the coastal zone. The Government can also contribute financially to projects that qualify up to theses standards (Around 60 millions are available over the 2000-2006 period).

ID ECOSYSTEM HEALTH; STRESS
AB The health of ecology refers to ecosystem health - an extension of the concept of health to the ecosystem level. Health is reflected in the absence of distress syndrome, and by productivity, organization and resilience that characterize sustainability in the Earth's ecosystems. Transformation of ecosystems under stress from healthy to pathological conditions is often irreversible, even when the initial stress factors are removed. The ecology of health refers to the fact that human health is influenced by ecological conditions. The breakdown of ecosystems under stress are often conducive to an increase in human pathogens, recycling toxic substances, reduced yields and compromised food supplies, scarcity of potable water, and air pollution, all of which increases human health vulnerability. Addressing human health issues from an ecological perspective takes account of the social, ecological, and biophysical determinants. This opens the door to potential interventions "upstream", in order to prevent illness, in addition to treating the disease once the malady has occurred.

AB The pattern of growth increment zones, the cambial growth dynamics and the structural variation in wood formation of Swietenia macrophylla King, Carapa guianensis Aubl., and Cedrela odorata L. (Meliaceae) were investigated in order to understand the relationship of site conditions and sustainable growth in Central Amazonian plantations. Trees were available from 8-, 17-, 23-, and 57-year-old plantations, and from primary forests in Manaus (Amazonia), Santarem (Para), and Aripuana (Mato Grosso). The wood anatomical structure and the annual increments of 61 Swietenia, 94 Carapa, and 89 Cedrela trees were studied for different tree heights. The curves of annual increments were cross-dated and tested for synchronisation. The cambial growth dynamics of up to 52 trees per species were dated by means of dendrometer measurements, monthly labelling by pinmarkers, and extracted cambium samples investigated using a microscope. The intraannual course of the growth and structural variation was compared with the water supply of the soil and insect attacks (Hypsipyla grandella (Zeller) Lep.).
   In Swietenia and Carapa parenchyma and vessel bands as well as bands of resin canals were observed. Within the xylem of Cedrela, alternating bands of fibres and vessels surrounded by paratracheal parenchyma were found; bands of resin canals were only occasional. In the juvenile wood of Swietenia and Carapa no synchronization of the increment curves was possible, whereas the increment curves obtained in the juvenile wood of Cedrela showed parallel run in growth. The increment curves obtained in adult wood of Swietenia and Cedrela indicate an annual formation of increment zones, whereas the number of increment zones in the xylem of Carapa was approximately 50% higher than the tree age (years) indicating that the growth increments of Carapa also were not annual during the adult phase of growth.

TI New perspectives on forest dynamics and the myth of 'communities':
   Reconsidering co-management of tropical rainforests in Cameroon
SO IDS BULLETIN-INSTITUTE OF DEVELOPMENT STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
ID CONSERVATION
AB This article links new perspectives on forest dynamics to insights gained from studies of science/policy processes - focusing on the apparatus involved in forest management - and to social scientific discussions on the concept of 'community'. Within this apparatus, the concept of 'community' serves as a vehicle for the circulation of myths; concept and myths are both part of 'cultural policy paradigms' for forest management. New perspectives on forest dynamics imply that ecological sustainability in forest management is no longer a natural 'given': it involves choosing one dynamic equilibrium over others. This has major political consequences: co-management should start as early as the strategic planning phase. Yet who should be involved in strategic planning? This is an important issue in view of the immense commercial value of timber, and of the differences among stakeholders in interests, political and economical power, and in capacities to voice and defend their views. Based on environmental anthropological research on local tenure of forest resources in southern Cameroon, this article emphasises that 'communities' in local tenure may be rather more complex than some policy-makers continue to assume and also dynamic, not least in response to state and international attempts at forest management.

TI 'Sustainable' timber production and science/policy processes in Trinidad
SO IDS BULLETIN-INSTITUTE OF DEVELOPMENT STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
AB Trinidad has acquired an international reputation for sustainable natural forest management, based largely on its 'Periodic Block System' (PBS) in government forest reserves. This article examines the co-evolution of this system with forest administration, use and ecology, and the science/policy practices that it involves. While formal research is important to the system's legitimacy and to the national Forestry Division's culture of scientific professionalism, creativity and adaptation by local forestry field staff significantly shape actual management practices. Moreover, while the system is premised on predictability, management practices have been responding continually to ecological, socio-economic and political instabilities. Recent perspectives in forest ecology and climate history cast new light on these dynamics, but have not been explored within prevailing science/policy practices. Rather, national foresters and their international sponsors continue to represent the system as stable, sustainable and productive. The article explores. how the co-production of science and management. and the importance of this to powerful institutions serve to maintain an image of stability in the face of uncertainty, and to exclude non-equilibrial alternatives from being seriously countenanced.

AB Risks and uncertainties inherent in the Internet often deter consumers from using it as a shopping channel. Companies usually assume that advanced technologies will solve such problems. This paper argues that many of these problems require non-technical solutions: solutions that are associated with good business practice. Customer feedback may not only raise technical issues such as security and privacy, but also non-technical issues such as guaranteed delivery time and the ability to talk live to customer services representatives for help. This paper analyses four aspects of running a business - trust, quality, value, and risk - in an Internet setting and offers three solutions. While there is no complete guarantee of sustainability and profitability in any business, the careful consideration of the issues discussed will help shield the business from pitfalls, which if not detected and dealt with, can cause the closure of an otherwise healthy business.

AB This study integrates thought on entrepreneurship, innovation, and organizational learning and examines a framework of sustainable competitive advantage as it pertains to global sourcing. The study adopts a chain of customer perspective and focuses on entrepreneurship, innovativeness, and learning in an organization's long-linked chain of interrelationships within the global sourcing process. Using sourcing directors of 200 multinational corporations, entrepreneurship, innovativeness, and learning were found to function as first-order indicators of the second-order construct of sustainable competitive advantage (SCA). SCA, in turn, has a positive effect on cycle time of the global sourcing process and the organization's overall business performance. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Army ants have been studied thoroughly for more than a century. The conduction of column and swarm mass raids, featured by epigacicly active species, is believed to be a central characteristic of army ant behavior. Most army ant species, however, lead a hypogaeic life. Due to the difficulties to observe them, nothing is known about their hypogacic behavior in the field. Using palm oil baits, trail excavations, and laboratory observations, the hypogaeic foraging of Dorylus (Dichthadia) laevigatus was observed in Malaysia. D. laevigatus was found to construct stable hypogaeic trunk trail systems providing quick and easy access to all parts of its foraging area. Small column raids were conducted throughout the ground stratum and above the ground surface. These raids were caste specific, with the smallest workers predominantly following existing cracks and tunnels in the soil. In case of food location, larger workers were recruited from nearby trunk trails. Exploratory trails leading to prey had to be widened before larger workers could gain access and help to process the food. Bulky food sources such as baits or termite mounds could be exploited over several weeks to months. Besides raiding in columns, D. laevigatus came occasionally to the ground surface at night to conduct swarm raids. This combination of swarm and column raids with the use of trunk trails has never been demonstrated for a classical army ant species. The omnipresence of D. laevigatus within its foraging area stands in sharp contrast to epigaeicly active species, characterized by a very localized and temporary presence at foraging sites. D. laevigatus stayed in the same foraging area for several weeks to months. Having a broad diet and the ability to exploit bulky food sources over long periods of time, D. laevigatus seems to follow a sustainable use of the soil fauna. Summing up these particularities demonstrates a remarkable divergence of the hypogacic foraging of D. laevigatus from that of epigacicly foraging army ant species.

DE organic milk; gross composition of milk; fatty acid composition
AB Organic milk production has increased rapidly in many European countries during the last decade but the merits of organic dairy products are still disputed. Little unbiased information exists regarding any essential differences in gross composition or other parameters of technological and/or nutritional interest. In order to gather more basic information regarding organic milk, raw milk samples from 31 organic dairy farms in Sweden were collected once a month during 1 year. The samples were analyzed for gross composition, somatic cells, fatty acids, urea, iodine and selenium. As a reference, milk composition data from similar conventional farms was obtained.
   The results show small or no differences in the investigated parameters between organic milk and the milk from the conventional farms or average values regarding gross composition of Swedish raw milk. The only significant differences found were in urea content and somatic cells, both of which were lower in organic milk. In addition, levels of selenium were lower in organic milk, which is of nutritional importance since dairy products are significant dietary sources of selenium in Scandinavian diets.

AB Milk has a high nutritive value, not only For the new-born mammal and for the human consumer, but also for microbes. Raw milk kept at roam temperature will be liable to microbial spoilage. After some days, the milk will spontaneously become sour. This is generally due to the activity of lactic acid bacteria. A flora of these bacteria may develop, which can be transferred deliberately to fresh milk in order to maintain or even strengthen it. This principle is the basis for controlled acidification of milk towards products, sustainable and safe, with most often an attractive flavour. Various types of fermented milks and derived products have been developed in all parts of the world, each with its own characteristic history. Their nature depends very much on the type of milk used. on the pre-treatment of the milk, on the temperature (climate) and the conditions of fermentation and on the subsequent technological treatments. Most fermented dairy products contain lactic acid bacteria, but other bacteria, yeasts and moulds may be involved as well. In optimising the manufacturing processes, starter cultures for fermented dairy products have been developed. They are composed of selected microorganisms, propagated as multiple-strain starters consisting of a defined mixture of pure cultures or as mixed-strain starters consisting of an undefined mixture of different types of bacteria. The use of starters, on the one hand, has been tremendously positive with respect to the quality of the product, but, on the other hand, it has diminished the diversity of fermented dairy products. Since the dairy industry is keen to explore new possibilities for enhancing the diversity of its product range, there is a new interest nowadays in searching for potential starter organisms from the pool, which existed at the time of raw milk fermentation. This contribution reviews some potential opportunities and recent developments in this search. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Regional Forest Agreements between the Australian Commonwealth and State governments have fulfilled a number of key requirements for achieving ecologically sustainable development and management of Australia's forests. Examples are the establishment of a world class system of conservation reserves; a secure resource base for the timber industry with increased opportunities for industry development and investment; and the establishment of management systems and processes for ecologically sustainable forest management. Ten Agreements have been signed representing twenty-year plans for commercial forest regions in four Australian States. Science played a major role in these Agreements and contributed significantly to their success. Scientific assessments, information and advice covered a wide range of economic, social, environmental and heritage values. Scientific development and application of robust databases and analytical tools facilitated important land use and management decisions where balanced outcomes between competing forest uses and values were sought within limited time frames. We review the process for developing Regional Forest Agreements as part of Australia's approach to national and international ecologically sustainable development obligations, and the application of science and scientifically-based approaches and frameworks for determining conservation, sustainable management and industry development outcomes.

TI Towards effective environmental education in Ethiopia: problems and

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
DE environmental education; Ethiopia; developing country
ID SCIENCE
AB Whether talking to local farmers or studying academic papers there is general agreement that environmental degradation is impacting upon agricultural productivity in Ethiopia. In a country, where around 90% of the population are dependent on agriculture for subsistence requirements and a similar fraction of the country's export income is generated from the agriculture sector, environmental degradation with subsequent decline in agricultural productivity has serious repercussions on household and national economies alike. This paper argues that given the intimate relationship between environmental degradation and poverty, environmental education has an important role to play in any poverty alleviation strategy. The paper explores the history of environmental education in Ethiopia and concludes that the formal sector, which has thus far formed the main point of delivery, is not well suited to delivering a meaningful programme that can elicit progress towards more sustainable land-use practices. The authors argue that non formal and participatory programme delivered through existing local organizations can have a 'wider broadcast', a more immediate impact and are better able to absorb and utilize local knowledge.

TI Trust: The missing ingredient in assessment
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
ID ORGANIZATIONAL TRUST
AB Over a decade of mandated assessment, state-level evaluation requirements, and more recently the ABET Engineering Criteria 2000 have focused attention on the need to systematically assess student learning in engineering curricula. A primary impediment to the usefulness of systematic assessment lies in how the culture of assessment interacts with norms of organizational trust within institutions of higher education. Establishing trust is a necessary first step towards creating sustainable assessment systems. In a research institution in the southeastern United States, the use of focus group methods to explore barriers impeding assessment resulted in the identification of several factors pivotal to successful implementation. These factors were supported in the literature, and emerged strong v in subsequent structured small group discussions attended by faculty and administrators. From these results, comparative characteristics of low-trust and high-trust environments for assessment are developed and presented.

AB The key role of engineers for the transformation of society towards sustainability is a strong motivation for increasing the environmental knowledge within engineering education. Doing this by the concept of integration is presently considered more appropriate than to develop more new education programmes for environmental specialists. This paper describes the integration of environmental aspects into a mechanical engineering education programme. The Natural Step Framework has been used as a basis for this integration. It has been possible to include environmental knowledge without compromising the engineering quality of the programme.

AB This paper analyses the flexible instruments Joint Implementation (JI) and Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) with regard to achieving CO2 emission reduction targets in a sustainable way. In a first step an optimizing energy and material flow model is used to elaborate emission reduction strategies for Germany. The same methodology is then applied to Indonesia in order to determine the emission baseline for this country, which is an indispensable requirement for the evaluation of project-based flexible instruments. Then models for Germany, Russia and Indonesia are linked using a decomposition algorithm with the aim to elaborate emission reduction strategies for Germany, including JI and CDM projects. The results show substantial potential to limit emission reduction costs by multilateral cooperation. The most favourable types of cooperation project for the considered countries are CO2 sequestration and power plant projects. Finally, an approach to how to include the criterion of sustainable development is described.

AB Successful integration of Cleaner Production concepts and technologies into businesses and industries requires effective education and training of the professionals. Cleaner Production, in spite of its conceptual simplicity, implies a new way of thinking about processes and products and a more sustainable approach to problem solving. Teaching university students about Cleaner Production is particularly challenging because many concepts depend on tools and experiences that are difficult to recreate in the typical classroom. Full understanding of the methodology and concepts of a Cleaner Production assessment can be achieved only by engaging students in practical application. To overcome the difficulties of providing a high number of students with a practical application, a very simple and useful exercise, based on the activities performed in the average kitchen, has been developed. The kitchen at home has all the elements of a factory, is available to everybody and can be used to supplement the theory provided in the classroom.

AB Management of natural resources has clear implications for local, national, and supranational territorial units because of diverse and fundamental implications linked to how and where they are managed. There is a strong need to go beyond local, regional or even national administrative borders, redesigning new geographical areas and starting cross-border cooperative actions for more sustainable natural resource management. In this paper, European Union and Italian water policies are analysed, showing that, in Italy, the situation regarding institutional actors involved in water management is quite complex, particularly taking a watershed approach. Management of an important watershed in the south of Italy is taken as an example, showing how natural resources could be managed effectively through multi-regional cooperation. In this context, the work presented here introduces Multi-Criteria Decision Aid (MCDA) as a new multidisciplinary approach to structuring and analysing conflicts between stakeholders involved in the decision making process.

ID ENVIRONMENTAL ECONOMICS
AB This paper examines the nature of ecological economics, arguing that it comprises two aspects, the qualitative framework within which it operates and the quantitative techniques which it uses to measure sustainability, evaluate policies and assist decision-making. The former is distinct to ecological economics, whereas the latter is largely shared with environmental economics. Although these have co-existed for some time, it is contended that the qualitative aspect needs to be developed if ecological economics is to realize its potential. The paper first offers a Schumpeterian 'pre-analytic' vision of ecological economics. Ecological economics, it is argued, necessarily implies a fundamental change in the way problems are perceived and in how they should be addressed. Second, the paper discusses the quantitative aspect of ecological economics, arguing that the overlap with environmental economics in the techniques used is one reason why the two have frequently not been seen as sufficiently distinct. The paper concludes that a development of the qualitative, procedural aspect of ecological economics is needed if its full potential for influencing policy-making is to be realized.

AB There is a growing realization of the importance of sustainable agriculture across the globe. This awareness has become the main focus of global debate as a result of degradation of natural resources and environment. There is a growing demand for eco-friendly agricultural commodities in the international market. Here an attempt is made to examine the context and meaning of the term 'sustainable agriculture'. The sustainability of Indian agriculture in the context of globalization has been discussed with respect to activities and agreed deeds of India with World Trade Organization (WTO) and General Agreements on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). The merits and disadvantages of globalization of Indian agriculture have been indicated. This paper concludes with some policy measures for practising sustainable low input agricultural practices in India.

DE environmental policy; network analysis; sustainability; urban
   ecosystems; water resource
AB The object of this paper is to investigate the sustainability of water use in human settlements. The water system of a small municipality in northern Italy is discussed as a case study. By measuring water exchanges between different sectors of activity within the municipal borders, and considering underground and surface waters as natural components of this system, a network of flows is built and successively investigated by network analysis, a tool that is comprised in the apparatus of ecosystem ecology. By calculating the reciprocal dependence of compartments, the amount of resource that is involved in cycling, the length of exchange pathways, and the organization of flows, network analysis shows that the system does not use water in a sustainable manner and provides general criteria for improving sustainability. In this respect, options to improve sustainability are also discussed. The results of this study support the idea that the ecosystem approach can provide an interesting conceptual perspective in which sustainability issues can be framed, and that network analysis is a promising tool to handle these issues in practice.

AB Energy policy is a key issue for economic and environmental policies. Indeed, energy is an indispensable element for economic development while, on the other hand, it causes severe environmental problems. In this context, a pressure for using renewable energy resources and for energy saving has emerged and expanded in recent years. As a result, energy policy is being reoriented under the new conditions. This paper examines this reorientation and its results in Greece where the bioclimatic conditions are in favour of renewable energy resources and energy-saving projects.

TI Analysing cadastral systems in uncertain situations: a conceptual
   framework based on soft systems theory
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
AB Based on experiences in South Africa, a conceptual framework is described which makes it possible to analyse how a cadastral system interacts with other land management sub-systems in volatile, changing situations. Soft systems theory, strategic management theory and existing cadastral theory underlie this framework. The soft systems approach, when applied to the cadastral field, makes it possible to move away from the conventional simplistic, hard interventionist, sub-system-focused design exercises and instead undertake holistic analyses of complex situations, which include human behaviour and a range of non-static land management sub-systems. It is also possible to analyse technical processes from different points of view, or contexts, over time, which facilitates more robust and sustainable cadastral systems' design and management.

AB Intention, Goal, Scope, Background. BASF has developed the tool of eco-efficiency analysis to address not only strategic issues, but also issues posed by the marketplace, politics and research. It was a goal to develop a tool for decision-making processes which is useful for a lot of applications in chemistry and other industries.
   Objectives. The objectives were the development of a common tool, which is usable in a simple way by LCA-experts and understandable by a lot of people without any experience in this field. The results should be shown in such a way that complex studies are understandable in one view.
   Methods. The method belongs to the rules of ISO 14040 ff. Beyond these life cycle aspect costs, calculations are added and summarized together with the ecological results to establish an eco-efficiency portfolio.
   Results and Discussion. The results of the studies are shown in a simple way, the eco-efficiency portfolio. Therefore, ecological data are summarized in a special way as described in this paper. It could be shown that the weighting factors, which are used in our method, have a negligible impact on the results. In most cases, the input data have an important impact on the results of the study.
   Conclusions. It could be shown that the newly developed eco-efficiency analysis is a new tool, which is usable for a lot of problems in decision-making processes. It is a tool which compares different alternatives of a defined customer benefit over the whole life cycle.
   Recommendations and Outlook. This new method can be a helpful tool in different fields of the evaluation of product or process alternatives. It can be used in research and development as well as in the optimization of customer processes and products. It is an analytical tool for getting more sustainable processes and products in the future.

AB UN Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED): Earth Summit, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, 3-14 June 1992. A major achievement of UNCED was Agenda 21, a thorough and broad-ranging programme of actions demanding new ways of investing in our future to reach global sustainable development in the 21st century. Its recommendations ranged from new ways to educate, to new ways to care for natural resources, and new ways to participate in designing a sustainable economy. The overall ambition of Agenda 21 was breathtaking - its goal was nothing less than to make a safe and just world in which all life has dignity and is celebrated.
   Ten years later, the UN Summit for Sustainable Development (WSSD): Rio+10, Johannesburg, South Africa, 26 August - 4 September 2002 adjoins. This event will review the progress made in achieving a more sustainable development and will promote further steps in the implementation of Agenda 21. Chapter 30 of Agenda 21 'Strengthening the Role of Business and Industry' explicitly recognizes the important role of business in putting the objectives of sustainable development into practice. A vital community of small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) is crucial for achieving economic progress, human development, and effective environmental protection, thus sustainable in both developing and industrialized countries.
   In line with past International Business Forums, the CIDG's 7th International Business Forum addresses a set of issues of particular relevance to SMEs in sustainable development. Attention is given to the role business-to-business cooperation can play to build and strengthen capacity for sustainable development as well as to emerging principles and best practices guiding sustainability-oriented partnerships between business and government agencies or business, government agencies and civil society groups. In addition to these topics, the conference addresses a number of more specific issues. This includes environmental management systems, the emerging role of information technology, and the internet in helping SMEs in developing countries to implement effective environmental management systems and to achieve technological leap-frogging, as well as changes in the agricultural and tourism sectors, which both are vital to local economic development and effective environmental protection. The following sections of the background paper detail these topics, their relevance to achieving a more sustainable development, and the specific challenges involved for SMEs.

TI Assessment of toxicological risks for life cycle assessment and
   eco-efficiency analysis
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT
LA English

DE eco-efficiency analysis; ecological fingerprint; life cycle assessment
   (LCA); toxicity potential; toxicity scoring
AB Intention, Goal, Scope, Background. BASF has developed the tool of eco-efficiency analysis [1] to address not only environmental issues, but also issues posed by the marketplace, politics, product strategy and research. It is based on assessing environmental behaviour, environmental impact, possible effects on human health and ecosystems, and the costs of products and processes from the cradle to the grave. The goal of eco-efficiency analysis is to quantify the sustainability of products and processes.
   Objectives. Many LCAs do not conduct an assessment of the toxicity potential. But, to arrive at a comprehensive assessment of products and processes, it is specifically this criterion which constitutes an important factor with regard to the evaluation of sustainability.
   Methods. A comprehensive and easy-to-use model was developed to assess toxicity for eco-efficiency analysis. Our model uses the classifications for hazardous materials under EU law (31 R-phrases to describe different health effects). Moreover, eco-efficiency analysis requires an actual score of toxicity. This means that the following question has to be answered for every toxic effect, "How severe is a certain adverse effect compared to others? " This is a very personal judgement. We performed a survey with 40 toxicologists (industry and academia) and asked for a ranking and scoring of the toxic effects of 26 substances according to the personal opinion on how severe the toxic effects actually are considered to be. Based on the results, we developed a scoring system.
   Results and Discussion. The system summarises different health effects in six groups, each with a score between 0 and 1000; combinations of various effects and different exposure routes are also taken into account. A substance is attributed to a group by its R-phrases. The new toxicity assessment model has been used in eco-efficiency analysis and has stood the test for one year. However, the hazard has to be combined with exposure to describe the actual risk. A second model was developed to describe the exposure-using general use-categories and physico-chemical properties of the individual substances. The assessment of toxic effects has been a neglected in many LCAs.
   Conclusions. The new models allow the assessment of toxic effects in an appropriate and easy way. The significant impact of thorough toxicity assessments on the outcome of eco-efficiency analysis is demonstrated by a comparison of different assessment models.
   Recommendations and Outlook. LCA in combination with the evaluation of toxicity and risk-potentials will become more and more important in the future. This new methodology allows the calculation of toxicity potentials in a short time with a short set of input information. Those data as a part of the eco-efficiency analysis of BASF are useful to show the most important impacts over the whole life cycle. Decision-making processes with the eco-efficiency analysis will become much more useful by using this new assessment of toxicity factors.

   inventory (LCI); mental model; product system; subjectivity; valuesphere
AB If the complexity of real, socio-economic systems is acknowledged, life cycle inventory analysis (LCI) in life cycle assessment (LCA) cannot be considered as unambiguous, objective, and as an exclusively data and science based attribution of material and energy flows to a product. The paper thus suggests a set of criteria for LCI derived from different scientific disciplines, practice of product design and modelling characteristics of LCI and LCA. A product system with its respective LCI supporting the process of effective and efficient decision-making should ideally be: a) complete, operational, decomposable, non-redundant, minimal, and comparable; b) efficient, i.e., as simple, manageable, transparent, cheap, quick, but still as 'adequate' as possible under a functionalistic perspective which takes given economic constraints, material and market characteristics, and the goal and scope of the study into account; c) actor-based when reflecting the decision-makers' action space, risk-level, values, and knowledge (i.e. mental model) in view of the management rules of sustainable development; d) as site- and case-specific as possible, i.e. uses as much site-specific information as possible. This rationale stresses the significance of considering both (i) material and energy flows within the technosphere with regard to the sustainable management rules; (ii) environmental consequences of the environmental interventions on ecosphere. Further, the marginal cost of collecting and computing more and better information about environmental impacts must not exceed the marginal benefits of information for the natural environment. The ratio of environmental benefits to the economic cost of the tool must be efficient compared to other investment options. As a conclusion, in comparative LCAs, the application of equal allocation procedures does not lead to LCA-results on which products made from different materials can be compared in an adequate way. Each product and material must be modelled according to its specific material and market characteristics as well as to its particular management rules for their sustainable use. A generic LCA-methodology including preferences on methodological options is not definable.

AB The environmental impact assessment existing in the Russian Federation at the present moment cannot provide potential scenarios of consequences for the environment from examined processes, since its goal is to calculate the money equivalent of emissions to the environment. Also, it cannot help the environmental specialist to choose the most environmentally sustainable scenario or process, proceeding from the whole life cycle of the object, because it is usually performed only for the use phase of an object.
   This study also aims to show possibilities for applying LCA methodology, as accepted in the ISO standards series 14040, and as applied to Russian conditions. The main purpose was to investigate a possibility of using the existing environmental impact assessment as the inventory stage in the LCA. As the minor goal, normalisation and weighting factor data for the Russian Federation were calculated on the basis of energy consumption extrapolation.
   In this paper, the environmental impacts are associated with a sewage wastewater facility. The inventory analysis is performed with data obtained from the MosvodokanalNIIproject (Moscow Research Institute for sewage wastewater treatment facilities) and supplemented with the SimaPro 5.0 database (the Netherlands). The environmental impact categories included and discussed in this study are eutrophication, global warming, landfill, acidification, ozone layer depletion and photochemical ozone creation. This study was performed for several design alternatives or scenarios of the wastewater facility. According to the LCA performed in this study, the most environmentally sustainable scenario is that which has the most effective and complicated treatment of sewage water and sludge.

ID SERVICE
AB Background, Intention, Goal and Scope. The analytical laboratory is traditionally considered to be a service provider. This has resulted in laboratory environmental management being considered mostly from a pollution prevention and waste minimization perspective. There is a recognized need to view environmental performance of a laboratory service provider from a broader perspective. This broader perspective is inclusive of sampling, analysis and the potential for impacts to arise from the use of output information products. A generic methodology for the measurement and benchmarking of the overall environmental performance of an analytical laboratory and its outputs using the Laboratory Product Model (LPM) is described. Environmental performance indicators, relating to inputs and processing are proposed.
   Objectives. The project seeks to broaden the focus of environmental performance away from the individual analytical unit processes to a more encompassing 'cradle-to-grave' approach incorporating sample collection and results reporting and use. To support this approach, a functional unit of output for a laboratory has to be defined. Methods. A life cycle assessment approach, incorporating life cycle inventory considerations, is applied within the LPM conceptual framework.
   Results and Discussion. This approach facilitates a shift in thinking from laboratory service to the life cycle of laboratory product inputs and outputs. It enables LCA methodologies to be applied to environmental performance through the application of the LPM. The definition of a laboratory product output facilitates benchmarking and comparison of laboratories.
   Conclusions. The LPM approach assigns a critical role to the laboraiory for the sustainability of the laboratory operations from sample collection, through analysis to the use of its product outputs.
   Recommendations and Outlook. The application of the LPM offers a top down approach for the evaluation of the environmental performance of an analytical laboratory. It is expected to provide a useful tool for assessing and benchmarking the environmental performance of analytical laboratories.

AB The process of identifying and ranking the competitive factors is critical to management for formulating manufacturing strategy because it prioritizes criteria by which manufacturing performance will eventually be evaluated An empirical study of 382 US computer and electronics firms shows that higher product quality and lower production cost are the most important competitive factors. However, the correlations of these two competitive factors and sales growth and profitability performance measures are not statistically significant. The results suggest that achieving high quality or low cost alone is not enough to improve or sustain a firm's competitive position and there is a need to explore the emerging role of innovation and advanced manufacturing technology for achieving sustainable competitive advantage.

AB This paper Outlines a model for assessing the sustainability of shop floor based process improvement programmes. The model was developed as Part of a larger research Programme, investigating the inhibitors and enablers for process improvement. The model is based on the SMMT (Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders) Industry Forum MasterClass Process Improvement activity, but can be applied to any intensive shop floor based process improvement programme. The model's purpose is to identify the Level of sustainability achieved by process improvement programmes and consists of two elements. The first element identifies five different levels of sustainability at cell level. The second element operates at factory level and examines the degree to which the tools and techniques have been spread between, cells.

AB Policy and decision making in the context of sustainable development requires rapid, effective and efficient access to and integration of appropriate current information from a wide range of sources and disciplines, including land cover dynamic information derived from remotely sensed data. The analysis of data from high spatial resolution satellite sensors has potential in land cover monitoring. In this paper, a post-classification method is used to detect land cover change from multi-temporal satellite data, and particular attention is given to the selection of an appropriate method for land cover classification. The use of a Geographic Information System (GIS) allows further spatial analysis of the data derived from remotely sensed images and analysis of the impact of land cover change on regional sustainable development. The satellite-derived data used in this study are Thematic Mapper (TM) data acquired by Landsat-5 on 14 May 1985, 20 May 1987, 26 April 1990 and 20 May 1993 in Ansan City, Korea. The results obtained show that land cover change in the west coastal zone of Korea has occurred in the past decade as a result of both natural forces and human activities, which has in turn impacted on the regional sustainable development. The results thus provide very useful information to local government for decision making and policy planning.

AB Successful strategic planning determines the ultimate fate of an enterprise. Many high-technology enterprises lack a comprehensive framework that facilitates an integrated approach. Derived from the diverse, extant literature on leadership, technology management, marketing and new product development, a Generic Value Tree offers a solution. This comprehensive schema highlights the linkage between technology and marketplace. It represents an objectives hierarchy that asserts that maximising enterprise equity demands a strategic focus on four branches: pursuing strategic intent; nurturing an intelligent enterprise; designing innovative goods and se;;ices; and amassing user preference. Its usefulness is tested in two settings: one relies on secondary data; the other relies on primary data collected in a field setting at an actual strategic planning session. The Generic Value Tree is a valuable diagnostic tool in the search for sustainable competitive advantage.

AB In this paper, technological and managerial innovation are seen as the dual keys to achieving environmental sustainability. Much research on environmental sustainability has focused upon the role of large organisations. Traditionally, they have been perceived as major contributors to environmental degradation and their task is to find innovative solutions to minimise pollution. However, small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) represent more than 80% of enterprises operating throughout Europe and this identifies them as significant contributors to environmental problems. This paper, based upon the findings of two research projects funded by the European Commission, focuses on SMEs' potential to innovate environmentally and the role they can play in minimising industry's environmental impact. It identifies the barriers, motivating factors and benefits experienced by SMEs and places emphasis on effective networking as a support for environmental innovation.

ID MANAGEMENT
AB Product innovation has long been considered as the outcome of New Product Development (NPD) projects, that is, efforts isolated in time and space and performed by a subsystem of the overall organisation. This paper aims to enlarge on this perspective by looking at product innovation as a continuous process of knowledge creation, embodiment and transfer that occurs with the contribution of a large part of the organisation and is extended to all phases of the product life cycle. NPD projects are only one, yet an extremely important phase of this process which we will refer to as Continuous Product Innovation (CPI), Contributions of all the other downstream phases to innovation can be relevant and are not limited to providing feedback on experience collected for future application. All phases of CPI can be actual opportunities to innovate the product applying knowledge from different sources inside and outside the organisation. On the basis of evidence from 12 explorative studies, this paper will discuss how a sustainable competitive advantage can be gained through careful management of this continuous and cross-functional process of knowledge creation, transfer and integration inside and outside the organisational boundaries of a firm, A supportive model is proposed to help companies to assess their own ability and to share experience concerning knowledge management in Product Innovation.

AB For firms to survive in the highly competitive Aerospace Component Supply Market they must have some sustainable competitive advantages. Customers are demanding continual price reductions and improvements in lead times from their suppliers. In the Asia Pacific region developing economics such as China, Indonesia and Malaysia are prepared to support the aerospace industry through government intervention. Lacking such support, Australian companies such as Hawker De Havilland (HdH) must compete on price and lead-time in a relatively high wage market to survive. The major competitive advantage HdH enjoys is the knowledge and skill of its workforce. This study examines strategies HdH has put in place to enable them to maintain their competitive position by creating a learning organisation.

AB This paper criticises the ubiquitous use of co-variation design in strategy research in which constructs are correlated across temporal and conceptual distances or gaps. It is argued that such design yields puny results and inconsequential knowledge about strategy phenomena. Several illustrative studies from the strategy literature are analysed to show the inadequacy of their design and the poverty of their findings. To supersede this design, the paper proposes a process approach, in which the transformation of constructs is monitored within and across organisations. The benefits of this approach are listed and exemplified in the case of the R&D performance connection. Benefits to constructs such as configurations are also listed. The paper concludes by asserting that for progress to occur in strategy research, new theories and concepts are not needed. Existing constructs can and should be used, but in a different methodology: process approach.

ID INTERNATIONALIZATION; PERFORMANCE; KNOWLEDGE
AB Explores perceptions of exporting education in sporadic and regular exporting firms as a means of enhancing organizational knowledge to improve the firm's long-term competitive advantage in global markets. Export development and performance are dependent on the acquisition and utilization of relevant knowledge in exporting. An analysis of sporadic and regular exporting firms' views toward formalized export education programs that contribute to long-term organizational knowledge is the central focus of this study. Results indicate that sporadic and regular exporting firms, although similar in many respects, vary, significantly with regard to export planning activity, educational attainment of employees, export proportion of sales, and exporting experience. In addition, sporadic exporters are less interested in formal export education programs and are more reliant on the government as a source of exporting knowledge and information. The types of information offered through such sources frequently do not lead to a sustainable competitive advantage in exporting and make only a limited contribution to organizational learning. A discriminant model correctly classifies 86 per cent of exporting firms into sporadic and regular groups. Discusses conclusions and managerial implications.

ID SUBSTANTIAL EQUIVALENCE; PRINCIPLE
AB An effective application of the Precautionary Principle (PP) hinges on the stipulation that, "a lack of scientific certainty shall not be used as a reason for postponing measures.'' The practical consequences of this expression are presently not clear enough in most contexts of use to enable constructive communication and therefore the PP is not sufficiently operational now. A pragmatic and fundamental methodology for understanding scientific (un)certainty in different practical contexts needs to be put in place to create a communicative basis for effective precaution. Lack of clarity about problem definition and problem ownership creates artificial controversies that will obstruct a precautionary approach. Given the fact that different practical contexts of scientific (un)certainty exist, it may seem from one context as if no precaution is warranted whereas concerns from another relevant context may suggest otherwise. Therefore, an integrative methodological framework for communicating about scientific (un)certainty is sorely needed in international policy-making. By putting a focus on the relevance of specified research questions for the objective of taking precaution, a communicative methodology may be adopted that is dedicated to the design properties of a sustainable future. Precaution cannot be operationalized without a methodological basis that allows for effective transparency and evades the stalemates of artificial controversy. Existing debate methodologies have so far not managed to accommodate these pressing demands.

TI Beyond land titling for sustainable management of agricultural land:
   Lessons from Ndome and Ghazi in Taita-Taveta, Kenya
SO JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURE IN THE TROPICS AND SUBTROPICS
LA English
DT Article
DE land titling; sustainable land management; policies; Kenya
AB This paper is based on a 1996-1999 case study that was done in semi-arid Ndome and Ghazi, Taita-Taveta District, in Kenya to determine the root causes of persistent erosion damage in the area. More than 10 years after land adjudication was done in these areas, more than 70% of the farmers still operate under tenure insecurity mainly due to lack of title deeds (r = 0.94**). Contrary to conventional expectation of land development, owning of land under private property rights was motivated by the sense of belonging, wealth, power and to some degree for speculative purposes. Adoption of structural soil and water conservation measures was still well below 50%. Preference was still given to indigenous land and water management (ILWM) technologies, with adoption rates ranging from 60% to more than 90%. No evidence existed that directly linked land improvement to land titling. For sustainable land management, land titling remains a critical incentive to farmers. However it will have to be accompanied by land use policy reforms that address four main issues, thus: deliberate efforts to preserve agricultural land, equitable distribution of available land, putting as much land as possible to agricultural use, and mechanisms to enhance prevention and control of land degradation. How these objectives can be achieved within the Kenyan context is the conceptual gist of this paper.

TI Environmental benefits of genetically modified crops: Global and
   European perspectives on their ability to reduce pesticide use
SO JOURNAL OF ANIMAL AND FEED SCIENCES
LA English
DT Article
DE GM crops; pesticide reduction; global; European Union
AB The Green Revolution, which brought together improved varieties, increased use of fertilizer, irrigation and synthetic pesticides, is credited with helping to feed the current global population of 6 billion. While this paper recognizes the ability of pesticides to reduce crop losses, it also discusses their potential negative effects on public health, with particular emphasis in developing countries, and the environment. The response of the agricultural industry in bringing forward new technology such as reduced application rates of targeted pesticides with lower toxicity and persistency is noted. However, with increasing world population, a slowing of the rate of crop improvement through conventional breeding and a declining area of land available for food production there is a need for new technologies to produce more food of improved nutritional value in an environmentally acceptable and sustainable manner. Whilst the authors recognize that the introduction of genetically modified (GM) crops is controversial, the benefits of these crops, including their effect on pesticide use is only now beginning to be documented. Published data are used to estimate what effect GM crops have had on pesticide use first on a global basis, and then to predict what effect they would have if widely grown in the European Union (EU). On a global basis GM technology has reduced pesticide use, with the size of the reduction varying between crops and the introduced trait. It is estimated that the use of GM soyabean, oil seed rape, cotton and maize varieties modified for herbicide tolerance and insect protected GM varieties of cotton reduced pesticide use by a total of 22.3 million kg of formulated product in the year 2000. Estimates indicate that if 50% of the maize, oil seed rape, sugar beet, and cotton grown in the EU were GM varieties, pesticide used in the EU/annum would decrease by 14.5 million kg of formulated product (4.4 million kg active ingredient). In addition there would be a reduction of 7.5 million ha sprayed which would save 20.5 million litres of diesel and result in a reduction of approximately 73,000 t of carbon dioxide being released into the atmosphere. The paper also points to areas where GM technology may make further marked reductions in global pesticide use.

AB The University of Michigan Housing Division's (Housing) study on creating an environmental management system based on sustainability, completed in July 1999, develops a rationale for organizational alignment with sustainability and assesses leading edge practices. The study recommends altering Housing's current mission statements as well as creating a freestanding sustainability mission statement. The study includes sustainability assessments of 11 operational and decision-making areas. The assessments extend beyond traditional environmental audits by developing sustainability visions, prioritized recommendations and indicators for each area. The study, which forms the basis of Housing's current environmental initiatives, concludes that sustainability management must be holistic, systemic and integrated. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

DE eco-costs; eco-efficiency; eco-indicator 95; EVR; LCA; product-service
   systems; PSS; single indicator; sustainability
AB At the Delft University of Technology, a new model has been developed to describe the sustainability of products, the `EVR model'. This model comprises two concepts:
   the `virtual eco-costs' as a LCA-based single indicator for environmental impact
   the EVR (Eco-costs/Value Ratio) as an indicator for eco-efficiency
   In this publication, an experiment is described to test whether the EVR model leads to a good understanding of the eco-efficiency, of a product-service combination. In this experiment three separate groups of 8-11 people were asked to rank four alternative solutions of a product-service system (the after sales service and the maintenance service of an induction plate cooker) both in terms of sustainability and of general preference. The three respective groups were:
   customers (among whom representatives of consumer organizations)
   business representatives from the manufacturing company of the induction plate cookers
   governmental representatives (employees of the Dutch ministries of environmental affairs and economic affairs, and of the Dutch provinces as well as consultants involved in governmental policies), all experts in the field of sustainability
   The basic idea was to ask each group to rank the four alternatives after three levels of information input:
   Level 1: basic explanation of the four alternatives. Some major features and characteristics such as price were given, but no environmental data.
   Level 2: on explanation of an LCA of the four alternatives, given in nine impact classes and the Eco-indicator 95.
   Level 3: an explanation of the EVR model and the EVR data of the four alternatives.
   Each time the group was asked to rank the proposed alternatives in terms of expected environmental performance and of `best choice in general' (`Which system would you have bought in a real life situation?').
   From the experiments it can be concluded that:
   The concept of eco-costs was accepted by the majority of the non-experts: they based their ranking on it. and they preferred it rather than direct LCA output or the damage based eco-indicator 95 data.
   The environmental experts in the governmental group did not directly accept the concept of eco-costs model (they wanted in depth information first); they tended to stick to their existing knowledge of LCA data and the Eco-indicator 95.
   'Overall' preferences of the customers and business representatives were primarily ranked on the `perceived value'/costs ratio of the product-service combination; the sustainability of the product-service combination played a secondary role. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The number of tools and approaches to develop sustainability is growing rapidly. Sometimes they are presented as if they are contradictory or in competition. However, a systems approach consistent with basic principles and the requirements of sustainability shows that these tools are complementary and can be used in parallel for strategic sustainable development. In fact. it is only when using these approaches outside of the systemic context of sustainability that they become contradictory. This paper is a collective effort of scientists who have pioneered some of these tools and approaches.
   The paper maps essential elements for developing sustainability and documents how these elements relate to the application of the respective tools. The objective is to show how these tools and approaches relate to each other and build on each other when used for planning for sustainability. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Innovation does not automatically lead to societal progress, as is implicitly assumed in technology push-oriented policies, This assumption is an inheritance of the Enlightenment i.e.. the belief that science ill automatically lead to a better quality of life. The strive for Sustainable development needs an approach to towards innovation that can be characterised as society pull: the society has to decide which (balance of) economical, ecological and social goals are to be met. Society pull can he organised by developing shared perspective, for the future, which are inspiring for public and private policy-makers and investors. In this paper this is worked out as transition management: a process approach directing innovation towards sustainable development. A crucial aspect of transition management is that innovation is no longer driven by the past. but attracted by the future. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A new trend of product-service systems (PSSs) that has the potential to minimise environmental impacts of both production and consumption is emerging. This article attempts to build a theoretical framework for PSS and serves as a background for identifying possible investment needs in studying them. There are three main uncertainties regarding the applicability and feasibility of PSSs: the readiness of companies to adopt them, the readiness of consumers to accept them, and their environmental implications.. The main finding is that successful PSSs will require different societal infrastructure, human structures and organisational layouts in order to function in a sustainable manner.

ID ENERGY
AB Six electricity production systems are evaluated using energy and energy (Environmental Accounting. Emergy and Environmental Decision Making. New York:Wiley, 1996. 370pp.) accounting techniques, in order to rank their relative thermodynamic and environmental efficiencies. The output/input energy ratio as well as the emergy-based emergy yield ratio (EYR) and environmental loading ratio (ELR) have been jointly used to explore and compare system performances. Generation of CO2 has also been accounted for in order to compare renewable and nonrenewable energy sources. The production systems include both plants using nonrenewable energy sources (natural gas, oil, and coal thermal plants) and the so-called renewable energy sources (geothermal, hydroelectric, and wind plants). A method for evaluating the environmental contribution to electric production is shown to provide important information that can be used to support the environmentally sound public policy. Renewable power plants were characterized by high energy return on investment, while fossil fueled plants exhibited average energy efficiency in the 25-36% range. EYR varied from a high of 7.6/1 for hydroelectric generation to about 4.2/1 for the oil thermal plant. The renewable energy plants required the highest environmental inputs per unit of output while fossil fuel plants required relatively small environmental inputs for cooling and to support fuel combustion. Environmental loading was highest with thermal plants. Using an emergy index of sustainability, it is quantitatively shown how renewable energy source plants like wind, hydroelectric, and geothermal had higher sustainability compared to thermal plants.

DE environmental services; emergy accounting; electric production
   processes; carrying capacity
AB Strategies to deal with thermal and chemical emissions from electricity production processes are compared. Accounting for the environmental services required to dilute emissions is suggested as an unavoidable step towards correct evaluation of sustainability of processes. Calculations are performed in several case studies by means of the emergy accounting methodology. An emergy-based yield indicator decreases by 40-70% coupled to a parallel increase of a loading indicator, when the environmental services required for the dilution of pollutants are correctly accounted for. As a consequence of including environmental services, a lower sustainability is calculated for each investigated process when compared to evaluations that do not include them. Accounting for environmental services also provides a way to evaluate the carrying capacity of the environment in relation to human dominated processes. The requirement for environmental services to effectively recycle by-products at different space-time scales translates into the need for a suitable support area for the process under study. Two support areas are suggested, one using local constraints, and a second using global constraints. The former is suggested as a near term, regional carrying capacity, while the latter is a long term, global carrying capacity. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The sustainable enterprise is entering a new phase. Private enterprise engages in a shift from environmentally friendly production methods towards true sustainable entrepreneurship, dealing both with quality and volume aspects of natural capital. Corporate governance changes at two levels. First, the internal governance of the firm alters as new environmental preservation demands come forward. Secondly, the external governance of the firm changes as new initiatives need to be employed to ensure adequate and sustainable social, technological, and infrastructural conditions for production. It is argued that the preservation of non-reproducible 'key stocks' of energy, biodiversity, and space requires new and special attention in the strategic management of the sustainable enterprise. Also, it is shown that evolving ethical values of intergenerational equity demand a timely transition to new business practices. Finally, a program for governments and enterprises to enhance progress towards the next stage of sustainable entrepreneurship is presented. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Environmental management schemes used today by companies promote marginal improvements from existing systems. We have compared the environmental reports presented by companies in the Swedish transport sector in relation to their carbon dioxide emissions, choice of indicators, and long-term goals. It is concluded that these reports cannot be used for benchmarking, nor for useful ranking of performance. The supply chain structure of the transport sector creates a problem with assigning the liability for carbon dioxide emission along the chain. The dramatic changes required by the transport sector in connection with climate change indicate that marginal improvements have to be assessed regarding long-term sustainability criteria. Comparing the situation of the transport companies to the criteria for applying backcasting we find that companies in the sector are well suited for using backcasting as a tool for strategy development. It is suggested that explicit contractual agreements of CO2 performance of transport services are used to increase awareness and responsibility. Further it is suggested that integrated supply chain backcasting may be attempted as a way to identify efficient long-term strategies. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB The objective of the paper is to identify major strategic issues for a firm aiming for change towards ecologically sustainable activities in its network. One purpose is to develop and apply a theoretical approach that takes the strategic actions of the firm and its network context into consideration. Empirically, the aim is to identify, describe and categorize various strategic issues when an actor aims to introduce waste recycling activities in its network. The framework is applied to a case describing a food retail chain's ecological re-positioning in a system for the recycling of waste. The paper identifies a set of strategic issues including managerial implications for a firm that takes on the role of change agent in its industrial network. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB The paper provides an over-view of Integrated Product Policy (IPP). It stresses scientific approaches, describes the development process of IPP within the European Union and analyses the activities in several countries. In this context. a development model is introduced to illustrate the varying dynamics of adopting this approach and putting it into practice. Finally, the paper ends with some challenges for the future IPP-process, namely linkage IPP/innovation, clarification and concretisation of the concept at the example of some pilot projects, linkage IPP and sustainability and possible additional development stages.

AB Innovative and sustainable telemedicine, telehealth and c-health developments require the strategic planning, design and implementation of appropriate telecommunication networks and infrastructures. In this paper, we review major aspects of networking and telecommunication technologies applicable to expanding telehealth care markets, practices and research. To explore strategic network planning concepts, we brainstorm on networking requirements and various telehealth and e-health applications in biomedical research, clinical care and public health domains. To provide guidance on appropriate network design and implementation, we study examples of telemedicine and telehealth networks deployed in terrestrial and satellite settings. We believe that by bringing together state-of-the-art telecommunication and Internet-related technologies and relevant biomedical, clinical and public health-related expertise, the field of telemedicine, telehealth and e-health will have the potential to infiltrate new frontiers and uncharted territories, particularly in the area of knowledge management. Finally, although many improvements may still be possible for enhancing present and future network and Internet-related technologies, we agree with the expressed view of many that advances in telemedicine, telehealth and e-health is currently impeded by the lack of clear and supportive legal infrastructures.

SO JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING
LA English
DT Article
DE trucks; permits; integrated systems; data systems
AB The automation of oversize/overweight (OS/OW) vehicle permitting can be achieved through GIS-based systems. OS/OW permitting involves network work pathfinding given spatial and temporal constraints that are associated with the physical roadway network. This paper presents a data model design that extends and satisfies the consensus functional requirements of OS/OW permitting. Although departments of transportation at the state level invest millions of dollars in development and management of enterprise databases of bridges and highways, many GIS-based OS/OW permitting systems require development of application-specific versions of these databases. Consequently, agency motor carrier service divisions are faced with huge data management problems. The system design in this paper facilitates sustainability by being consistent with the notions of enterprisewide data integration. A robust location-referencing strategy and adherence to the national intelligent transportation systems architecture achieve enterprisewide data integration. This paper presents general system requirements, an OS/OW application design, an enterprisewide database schema, and algorithms for finding OS/OW vehicle routes given spatial and temporal roadway restrictions. The system design accommodates multiple data sources, multiple location-referencing methods, and state-to-state interoperability. Spatial and temporal constraints for OS/OW permitting are represented in a unified modeling language class diagram.

AB Indonesia has been severely hurt by the recent economic crisis, which has been accompanied by social tensions. For a sustainable long-term recovery, it is essential that Indonesia attracts FDI inflows, and manages to achieve a reasonably equal spatial development. FDI is important since other capital funds are scarce and an equal spatial development is important to avoid social tensions. However, there is a possible contradiction between FDI and even regional development since FDI tends to locate in clusters. This article discusses FDI and an even spatial development in Indonesia, and offers some policy suggestions for a sustainable long-term recovery.

AB This article draws on organizational and cross-cultural consultation tenets, to analyze the contract negotiation of a school reform initiative by focusing on the contracting and cross-cultural issues that emerge at that stage. A case from one school presents illustrative examples generated and grounded by qualitative methodology using participant observation, semistructured interviews, extant records, and researcher logs. Themes related to contract negotiation that were derived from the analysis include conflicting expectations and beliefs; dissatisfactions with procedures and policies; lack of empowerment; pedagogical dissonance; and feelings of blame, inadequacy, and racism. This case highlights problems that can occur in school-based, cross-cultural organizational consultation when a rigid adherence to the content of consultation overshadows the consultation process. It is suggested that framing consultation as a coconstructed, participatory process that includes consensual contract negotiation may promote successful school reform. This is significant when the consultants and consultees do not share common cultural reference points. It is argued that consultants who value cultural reciprocity between themselves and consultees while being intentional in their use of process skills have the best potential to effect sustainable school-based change.

AB Land application of municipal wastewater is widely practised worldwide as a means of treating wastes and obtaining a benefit from the water and nutrients by growing pastures, trees, and sometimes edible crops such as vegetables, fruit and fibre, etc. Irrigation of pastures by treated and untreated sewage near Melbourne, Australia, for more than a century has increased heavy metals concentrations in the soil, but appears not to have increased their concentrations in the herbage and in animal tissues of animals grazed on these pastures. There seem to be sound reasons why this practice may be sustainable.

AB The lessons of history indicate that mismanagement of natural resources and the environment often leads to potentially adverse consequences. The increasing interest in economic development, particularly in the developing countries of the world coupled with increasing population pressures and the globalization of economic activity is placing noticeable stresses on the ultimate sustainability of both human and environmental systems. Sustainable development is not a new concept. It has been an area of concern for different elements of society for some time. Yet efforts to understand the implications of sustainable development have not, until recently, been formalized. We have focused singularly on economic development and environmental quality as if they were mutually exclusive. This paper focuses on the concept of concurrency as both a conceptual framework and practicable method of understanding and implementing the ecology and economy of sustainability.

TI Dynamic analysis and assessment for sustainable development
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES

DT Article
DE sustainable development; assessment; dynamic analysis
AB The assessment of sustainable development is crucial for constituting sustainable development strategies. Assessment methods that exist so far usually only use an indicator system for making sustainable judgement. These indicators rarely reflect dynamic characteristics. However, sustainable development is influenced by changes in the social-economic system and in the eco-environmental system at different times. Besides the spatial character, sustainable development has a temporal character that can not be neglected; therefore the research system should also be dynamic. This paper focuses on this dynamic trait, so that the assessment results obtained provide more information for judgements in decision-making processes. Firstly the dynamic characteristics of sustainable development are analyzed, which point to a track of sustainable development that is an upward undulating curve. According to the dynamic character and the development rules of a social, economic and ecological system, a flexible assessment approach that is based en tendency analysis, restrictive conditions and a feedback system is then proposed for sustainable development.

AB Many products are harvested from the forests of the eastern United States that are not timber-based but originate from plant materials. Over the past decade, concern has grown about the sustainability of the forest resources from which these products originate, and an associated interest in managing for these products has materialized. A content analysis of the management plans of 32 eastern national forests revealed that seven of the plans addressed nontimber forest products (NTFP). We used interviews with USDA Forest Service district- and forest-level managers to convey their ideas about NTFP management and to identify critical issues that affect efforts to manage for these products.

AB The under-researched history of water management experience in Australia has been deeply implicated in a protracted coming-to-terms with a prodigiously demanding national territory. While providing new insights into a chronicle of human occupation extending over scores of thousands of years, the story of that experience may also illuminate the tensions between developmentalism and conservationism during the modern era and promote a more secure anchoring for debates on sustainability and national identity. Three sample studies demonstrate that 'environmental adaptations' were distinctively balanced and confused by economic, political and social considerations, and by the evolution of scientific and technological ideas. Selected themes, periods and areas are as follows: modes of organization-centralization and decentralization in Victoria, 1880-1914; the formation of irrigation policy-Queensland, 1920 1936; and institutional change and the bioregional alternative the Murray-Darling Basin, 1975-2000. The resultant emphasis indicates an expanding potential for the insertion of supplementary forms of applied scholarship. (C) 2002 Academic Press.

TI Potted-plant/growth media interactions and capacities for removal of
   volatiles from indoor air

AB Results are presented of an investigation into the capacity of the indoor potted-plant/growth medium microcosm to remove air-borne volatile organic compounds (VOCs) which contaminate the indoor environment, using three plant species, Howea forsteriana (Becc. (Kentia palm), Spathiphyllum wallisii Schott. 'Petite' (Peace Lily) and Dracaena deremensis Engl. 'Janet Craig'. The selected VOCs were benzene and n-hexane, both common contaminants of indoor air. The findings provide the first comprehensive demonstration of the ability of the potted-plant system to act as an integrated biofilter in removing these contaminants. Under the test conditions used, it was found that the microorganisms of the growth medium were the "rapid-response" agents of VOC removal, the role of the plants apparently being mainly in sustaining the root microorganisms. The use of potted-plants as a sustainable biofiltration system to help improve indoor air quality can now be confidently promoted. The results are a first step towards developing varieties of plants and associated microflora with enhanced air-cleaning capacities, while continuing to make an important contribution to the aesthetics and psychological comfort of the indoor environment.

AB Many common concepts in recreation and leisure research originate from the "interests" of four groups: users, legislators, managing agencies, and researchers. These interests, and their tics to social class, make frequently discussed concepts like overuse, business-like management for public agencies, benefits/values, and sustainability ontologically suspect. A functionalist approach is advocated as an alternative. Researchers need to be aware of the "political" context of research concepts to avoid pitfalls in their application.

AB Workforce productivity has become a critical factor in the strength and sustainability of a company's overall business performance. Absenteeism affects Productivity; however, even when employees are physically present at their jobs, they may experience decreased productivity and below-normal work quality-a concept known as decreased presenteeism. This article describes the creation and testing of a presenteeism scale evaluating the impact of health problems on individual performance and productivity. A total of 175 county health employees completed the 34-item Stanford Presenteeism Scale (SPS-34). Using these results, we identified six key items to describe presenteeism, resulting in the SPS-6. The SPS-6 has excellent psychometric characteristics, supporting lite feasibility of its use in measuring health and productivity. Further validation of the SPS-6 on actual presenteeism, (work loss data) or health status (health risk assessment or utilization data) is needed.

AB The green management literature repeatedly argues that in order to behave in a sustainable manner, organizational actions will need to go beyond technical fixes and embrace new environmentally responsible values, beliefs and behaviors. In this context, developing sustainability is frequently viewed as largely dependent on the extent of green culture change in organizations. However, empirical evidence for such a change in culture is not apparent, although much anecdotal support has been cited. Seeks to address some of the shortcomings in extant literature and supplies contemporary evidence of managers' perceptions of the extent to which the green culture change is occurring and of factors acting as barriers or facilitators to such change. Begins with a review of the literature pertaining to organizational culture and greening. Following this, details the research design and methodology. Thereafter, lays out the findings of the interviews in detail. Finally, discusses these findings and suggests a number of implications, conclusions and directions for further research.

SO JOURNAL OF ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGE MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
DE ethics; connecting; emergent strategy
AB Scrutinizes one of the main features of the conventional credo of organizational management. The "ethic of self-preservation" (ESP). The ESP is the inevitable by-product of a culture that denies interiors and encourages materialistic consumerism and narcissistic self-interest. Several pertinent questions will be explored: What is an ethic and what role does it play in governing both personal and collective behavior? What specifically is the ESP? How is it fostered by the prevailing culture of narcissism? What impact if any, does it have on the maintenance of organizational integrity? Furthermore, how can the Chaos principle of Connectivity be construed as an imperative for organizational adaptation and sustainability? Finally, what lessons can Chaos lend practitioners of organization development that will permit them to grasp, and ultimately, accept a new ethic based on the fact of connectivity in the essential process of organizational change?

   rural Bangladesh
SO JOURNAL OF PEASANT STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
AB This article investigates the changes in agrarian structure brought about by the development of export-oriented freshwater prawn cultivation in south-western Bangladesh. Prawn farming ill this particular context has spread among agricultural producers so rapidly within the last decade that many of the agrarian institutions have been carried over or been adapted to the new production regime. Thus the institutions governing landholdings and contractual labour arrangements involved ill prawn farming have many things in common with those involved ill rice production. While landholders generally have benefited from the new prawn economy, it is difficult to say whether the position of landless men and women from poor households has improved on a sustainable basis. The employment gains of local male workers are currently under threat from cheaper migrants, while new jobs for women from poor households are highly intensive, potentially hazardous, and poorly paid.

SO JOURNAL OF PROFESSIONAL ISSUES IN ENGINEERING EDUCATION AND PRACTICE

   education; engineering education
AB Traditionally recognized construction professionals such as architects, engineers, and surveyors occupy segregated roles in the construction industry. With the rapidly growing complexity and ever increasing sophistication in project procurement and construction, new disciplines have been added to the traditional construction professions, The characteristics and the roles of the different disciplines in the construction industry are becoming less clear-cut. Specialism within the different disciplines and the working relationship among them are also not easily defined. Transprofessional practice among the several disciplines of construction professionals is commonplace. The skills needed by each discipline and the education structure required to develop those skills cannot be usefully examined on a discipline-by-discipline basis. This paper, based on a research study carried out with a questionnaire survey, aims to investigate these phenomena in professional practices within the construction industry and to develop cogent and sustainable directions for the education of construction professionals in the new millennium. Results from the study suggest that the demands of a transprofessional discipline practice call for construction professionals to critically reexamine their professional skills and realistically evaluate the professional demands made on them by the ever-increasing complexity and technological sophistication in construction and project procurement. The work concludes that the curricula for educating aspiring construction professionals should embrace a multidisciplinary and an integrative-professional approach. Such an approach should be implemented in curricula designed for undergraduates and for the continuing professional education of practitioners.

ID SYSTEMS
AB A conceptual approach is commonly needed to provide guidance for developing new strategies concerning the use and management of renewable resources such as rangelands. The theoretical model constructed in this paper captures the essential aspects of dynamic and stochastic issues associated with the management of rangelands. We discuss the connections between the model and range policy. Specifically, we point out scenarios in which there is a limited role for policy. This is compared to scenarios when policy has a significant role to play in ensuring the sustainable use of rangelands. Finally, we suggest 2 ways in which our approach might be extended and used in a practical application.

AB An understanding of the impacts of grazing during and following drought on rangeland ecosystems is critical for developing effective drought management strategies. This study was designed to examine the effects of drought and grazing on blue grama [Bouteloua gracilis (H.B.K) Lag. ex Griffiths] and western wheatgrass [Pascopyrum smithii Rydb. (Love)] tiller growth dynamics. Research was conducted from 1993 to 1996 at the Fort Keogh Livestock and Range Research Laboratory located near Miles City, Mont. An automated rainout shelter was used during 1994 to impose a severe late spring to early fall (May to October) drought on 6 of twelve, 5- x 10-m non-weighing lysimeters. Twice replicated grazing treatments were: 1) grazed both the year of (1994) and the year after (1995) drought; 2)grazed the year of and rested the year after drought; and 3) no grazing either year. Drought had minimal impact on tiller relative growth rates of plants grazed twice, although it reduced (P less than or equal to 0.01) rates of axillary tiller emergence for blue grama (79%) and western wheatgrass (91 %), respectively. Defoliation periodically increased relative growth rates (P less than or equal to 0.05) and tiller emergence (P less than or equal to 0.01) of both species. Neither drought nor grazing affected tiller densities or tiller replacement rates of either species nor did they affect productivity of blue grama. Drought, however, reduced (P less than or equal to 0.01) productivity of western wheatgrass 50% in 1994 whereas grazing reduced productivity (P less than or equal to 0.01) by 46% in 1994 and 69 % in 1995. Moderate stocking levels (40-50% utilization) during and after drought did not adversely affect the sustainability of these dominant native grasses.

AB Previous reviews of the status of rural hospitals conclude that rural hospitals play a major role in ensuring the provision of health services in rural areas, are an essential part of the social and economic identity of rural communities, have had mixed success in their ability to respond to environmental threats, and are very sensitive to public policies due, in part, to their small size. The evolving hospital paradigm in the United States and a turbulent economic and health care environment have created an uncertain future for the rural hospital. Hospitals are being forced to shift their emphasis from filling acute inpatient care beds to providing a more diversified set of services through linkages with other institutions and provider groups. This presents challenges for rural hospitals, which often serve as the foundation for health care delivery in rural communities yet struggle to overcome the effects of troubled local economies, shortages of health professionals, and public policy inequities. This article reviews key trends and challenges facing rural hospitals from the perspective of their structure and organization, financial sustainability, quality of care provided, and strategic linkages with other entities. It concludes with the presentation of a research and policy analysis agenda that addresses the feasibility of the role of the rural hospital as the hub or coordinator of the rural health care delivery system, the fiscal viability of the rural hospital in the post-Balanced Budget Act period, strategies for measuring and improving the quality of care provided by rural hospitals, and the structure and value of horizontal and vertical linkages of rural hospitals.

ID DEGRADATION
AB A bioremedial study was undertaken to elucidate the role of a soil bacteria] isolate fluorescent Pseudomonas sp. in biodegradation and removal of organic pollutant, catechol, from the environment. Free and immobilized cells of fluorescent Pseudomonas, a plant growth promoting rhizobacteria, isolated from wheat rhizosphere and entrapped in calcium alginate beads were screened for their in vitro catechol ( 1, 2 dihydroxy benzene) degrading efficiency. The bacterium degraded catechol under all the four physiological states tested. Agitation enhanced its rapid degradation. Shake cultures of both immobilized and free cells degraded 83.2 per cent and 82.2 per cent catechol, respectively in 72 h indicating high efficiency of immobilized cells for bioremedial purposes. Thus versatility of fluorescent Pseudomonas to degrade phenolic pollutants as well as to enhance plant growth can be exploited for biotechnological applications.

AB The spectacular performance of Indian agriculture witnessed during the second half of the 20th century against the onslaught of rising demographic pressure is a vivid demonstration of the growing effectiveness of our agricultural research and development system. However, the issue of sustainability in agriculture still remains a question. Management of natural resources, especially soil and its fertility status and vegetation following suitable agronomic management practices for sustainable agricultural production, represents a most daunting task and is certainly going to receive much attention in the years to come. Many workers established functional relationships between nutrients and other agronomic factors at different locations in India but systematic compilation of those relationships is a rare effort. The present paper reviews the latest information on inter-relationships between nutrients and other agronomic factors (seed rate, planting density, age of the seedling, planting method, irrigation, weed control, tillage, bacterial inoculation and cultivar etc.) on field crops. Major findings of first and second order interactions are highlighted. None of the second order interaction was found significant; thus only first order interactions were discussed. The interactive effect of nutrients and seed rate varied with soil type. In sandy loam soil when 125 kg seed ha(-1) was used, wheat responded up to 60:30:40 kg N, P(2)O(5) and K(2)O ha(-1), whereas in clay loam soil it was up to 80:40:30 kg N, P(2)O(5) and K(2)O ha(-1) with the use of 25 kg higher seed rate. When chickpea was grown with a medium seed rate of 75 kg ha(-1) it responded up to 30 kg N and 60 kg P(2)O(5) ha(-1) saving 10 kg N and 20 kg P(2)O(5) in comparison to when a higher seed rate of 100 kg was used. Younger seedlings (20-25 days) performed better than old seedlings (35-40 days) in timely sown rice with the recommended dose of N, P(2)O(5) and K(2)O (120:60:40). However, the adverse effect of late transplanted rice with aged seedling (35 days) on yield was nullified by using higher number of seedling/hill (4-5) and using higher dose of fertilizer (150:75:75 kg N, P(2)O(5) and K(2)O ha(-1)). French bean, a negligible nodule-bearing legume responded to higher dose of N (160 kg) even under medium plant density (30 cm x 10 cm) in the tarai belt of North India. In general, interaction between cultivar and nitrogen level was non-significant in cereal but significant in oilseeds. The optimum dose of N for rapeseed cv. TH-68-8 and cv. TCH-2 was calculated to be 66.0 kg ha(-1), whereas it was 90 kg N ha(-1) for cv. RH-30. Soil moisture influenced the response of crops to fertilizer and vice-versa. Mustard responded up to 40 kg N ha(-1) under residual soil moisture and up to 60 kg N ha(-1) under limited irrigation; sunflower up to 120 kg N ha(-1) when irrigation was applied at 0.4 irrigation water/cumulative pan evaporation (IW/CPE) ratio. However, at 0.6 IW/CPE ratio the crop responded up to 80 kg N. Significant interaction of nitrogen and weed control on grain yield of wheat was observed. Interestingly, isoproturon, an urea group herbicide, along with 75 kg N ha(-1) gave significantly higher grain yield than with 100 and 125 kg N ha(-1) indicating a saving of 25-50 kg fertilizer N.
   Mustard inoculated with Azotobacter or Azospirillum, and receiving moderate level of fertilizer N (30 kg ha(-1)) gave similar grain yield to the uninoculated crop receiving higher dose of N (60 kg ha(-1)).

AB Genetic diversity is important for success of crop improvement. Its utilization has facilitated enhanced ability to produce, locate, and access desirable genes. This paper presents a thorough discussion of the ideas and strategies for conservation of cytoplasmic and nuclear heterogeneity in crop plants. It is focused that maintenance of greater genetic diversity in field condition may provide an in-built natural protection to crop vulnerability to pathogens vis-a-vis genepool conservation for sustainable productivity. Several examples with the manifestation of genetic relationship between plant reproductive systems and planting of mixtures of varieties or species possessing nuclear and cytoplasmic diversity providing better option for sustainable yield improvement have been elaborated. Intergenomic interaction-complementation between genes for morpho-economic traits (e.g., QTL, quantitative trait loci) endowed in both nuclear genome and cytoplasmic organellar genomes (mitochondrial and chloroplastic) seem to play greater role for enhanced productivity while strengthening conservation of heterodiversity and biodiversity in crop plants. Conservation and maintenance of overall heterogeneity for both nuclear and organellar genomes have been conceived as possible solutions to combat vulnerability of monocultured crops to pests and diseases. Genetic diversity and divergence require assessment for two sets of attributes. The first relates to marker diversity between individual copies of genes, and second for variation for adaptation. The differences should be detected at the DNA level, for a sample of homologous sequences representative of various classes of sequences (nuclear, organellar, structural, regulatory, spacer). The point has been made that deliberately produced heterodiversity for desirable traits in crop population in field cultivation has much to offer for both enhanced and sustainable yield production, especially in regard to the control of biomass and harvest index (grain yield) damages owing to vulnerability for insect, pest and pathogen led disease attacks.

TI Livestock improve household food security and sustainability of

DE Ethiopia; smallholder livestock production; highland mixed farms; food
   adequacy; humus balance; sustainability
AB The role of livestock in determining the socio-economic status, food security and sustainability of smallholder mixed farms was studied during 1999 and 2000 in the Harar Highlands of Eastern Ethiopia. Community level information on farm households was collected using semi-structured interviews, key informant interviews, and field observations. A well-being instrument was developed on the basis of community level data to rank the households into poor, medium, and well-to-do categories. Detailed characterization of the households in the three groups was carried out by an in-depth case study of individual farms followed by a wider scale formal survey. Community level interviews revealed that smallholders considered meeting household food requirements and maintaining soil fertility of farm plots most important for farm sustainability. The energy content of the food consumed by a farm family and the soil humus balance of annually cropped plots were used as proxy indicators for household food balance and soil fertility, respectively. Case study revealed that medium and well-to-do were high in household energy adequacy levels and positive in humus balance in annually cropped plots. Livestock accounted for 27% of the total household energy supply. In contrast, food supply in the poor category was 15% below the adequacy level and the field humus balance was negative. Poor had minimal livestock holding and livestock contributed only 2% of the total household energy supply. Results from the farm survey were similar to the case study. Medium and well-to-do had positive household food balance (180 +/- 20.6%, and 186 +/- 17.8%, respectively) and humus balance (385 kg/ha and 360 kg/ha, respectively) while poor had deficit household food balance (65 +/- 15.8%) and negative soil humus balance (-365 kg/ha). The contribution of livestock to total household energy supply varied significantly (P < 0.01) with the farm category, and accounted for 3.1 (0-5.7%), 23 +/- 6.8% and 17 +/- 7.9% of the total in the poor, medium and well-to-do, respectively. The results suggest that farms with less than one Tropical Livestock Units are not sustainable in the Harar Highlands of Eastern Ethiopia. Therefore, any agricultural development initiative in Ethiopia must include both crop and animal components for success. (C) 2002 by The Haworth Press, Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Nitrogen fertilization is essential to produce high forage yields in the Canadian prairies but its long-term use have been observed to alter the chemical soil properties and composition of forage. Lime application is used to ameliorate soil acidity and create favorable soil conditions for sustainable crop production. We studied the effects of 27 annual applications (1968 to 1994) of 0, 56, 112, 168, 224 and 336 kg N ha(-1) and one surface application of lime in 1991 (finely-ground CaCO(3) to bring pH of surface 15 cm soil close to 7.0) at Crossfield, Alberta, Canada. We measured the concentration of macroelements in the 0-5, 5-10, 10-15 and 15-30 cm layers of a thin Black Chernozemic (Typic Boroll) soil and smooth bromegrass (Bromus inermis Leyss) hay in 1994. The concentration of NO(3)-N in soil increased linearly with N rate in all layers and it also increased with soil depth. The concentration of NH(4)-N increased markedly with N rate in the 0-5 and 5-10 cm layers, and its response to the N rate was linear for the 0-5 cm and quadratic for the deeper layers. The concentration of extractable P in the soil decreased at low N rates and then usually increased at higher N rates. The concentrations of extractable Ca, Mg, K and Na in the surface soil layers declined with increasing N rates in most cases, while their concentrations in deeper soil layers declined with higher N rates after initially increasing at lower N rates. The concentration of extractable Ca indicated that the downward movement of lime was restricted mainly to the 0-5 cm soil layer. Liming usually reduced the concentrations of NO(3)-N, P, NH(4)-N, Mg, K and Na in some of the shallow soil layers, but it tended to increase NO(3)-N, Mg and Na concentrations in some deeper soil layers and increased Ca concentration in shallow soil layers. In bromegrass hay, total N concentration increased and the concentrations of total P, S, Ca, Mg and K tended to decline with increasing N rates; and lime reduced the concentrations of total S, Mg, K and Na at some N rates and it did not affect total N, P and Ca concentrations. The increased NO(3)-N and NH(4)-N concentrations in the soil at high N rates may present an increased potential of N losses through runoff, leaching and denitrification. Liming induced reduction in NO(3)-N, NH(4)-N and P concentrations and increased soil pH in shallow soil layers, in combination with increased dry matter production of bromegrass indicated reduced potential of environmental pollution from N and P losses by runoff and denitrification as well as increased sustainability of bromegrass production.

DE sugar beet; small/large farms; energy analysis; efficiency; environment;
   sustainable agriculture
AB The intensification of agriculture associated with the transition from subsistence based farming to cash cropping was evaluated using an energy analysis of small and large sugar beet production systems in Morocco. Total fossil energy inputs were 25,954 MJ/ha and 53,631 MJ/ha and energy outputs were 162,350 MJ/ha and 222,508 MJ/ha in the small and large farms, respectively. Energy input:output ratios were calculated as 1:3.46 and 1:2.30 if roots only are considered as output for small and large farms, respectively. Direct energy inputs, like electricity and fuel, range between 43 and 70% of total energy inputs. The most important indirect energy inputs were fertilizer and machinery. Irrigation was the most energy consuming operation in large farms and represents 1/3 of total energy inputs in these systems. The influence of the different energy inputs and operations is discussed and a comparison is made with other sugar beet producing regions in the world. Practical measures for saving energy and for environmental conservation based on this energy analysis are discussed. (C) 2002 by The Haworth Press, Inc.

DE Chisumbanje Vertisols; soil nutrients; sustainable cultivation; soil
   organic carbon
AB Soil and plant samples were taken from 29 fields that had been under cultivation for periods varying from 0 to 50 years in order to assess the relationship between period of dryland crop production and soil pH, organic carbon and soil nutrients of the Chisumbanje Vertisols, Zimbabwe. There was a steady decline in soil organic carbon, KCl-extractable N, and foliar concentrations of total K and Ca. The content of P and Mg in the soil associated with increasing cropping periods and the total content of N, P and Zn in the plants increased slightly. Though not significant (P < 0.05), the observed decline in organic C and some nutrients may become a serious limiting factor to sustainable crop production on the Chisumbanje Vertisols in the long-term. There is a need to encourage the smallholder farmers who cultivate the Chisumbanje Vertisols, and similar soils in Zimbabwe, to use fertilizers, but the program has to be coupled with measures to increase available soil moisture, as the latter is the most limiting factor in the area.

ID MAIZE
AB Soils of the West African Savanna dominated by kaolinite clays are inherently poor in fertility, fragile, and rapidly degraded under continuous cropping and livestock production systems. To ensure sustainable production, causes of soil degradation must be checked and other sources of fertility provided for crops. To achieve this, the use of herbaceous and forage legumes intercropped with maize were evaluated. The Study was conducted in Zaria, Nigeria (longitude 7degrees 30' and 7degrees 50' East, latitude 11degrees 00' and 11degrees 10' North), at the Ahmadu Bello University farm.
   Results show that the forage legume/maize treatments did not significantly deplete available soil moisture more than the sole maize treatment. Also, the legume/maize treatments resulted in positive carbon credits and higher total nitrogen content in the soils after two years of continuous cropping. Macrotyloma uniflorum, Stylosanthes hamata, and Lablab purpureus/maize intercrops did not reduce maize grain yields compared to the sole maize treatment. For sustained optimum grain yield of maize and improved soil conditions, Macrotyloma/maize intercrop treatment is recommended.

TI Agricultural sustainability: Comparing external and internal
   perspectives

DT Article
DE Nigeria; sustainable agriculture; sustainability indicators;
   participation
ID NIGERIAN SAVANNA; INTENSIFICATION; MIGRATION
AB This paper describes the results of a six year study based in a village (Eroke) in Igalaland, Nigeria, designed to compare an external vision of agricultural sustainability with internal perspectives. Cropping intensities were high, and change was apparent over the study period, with, for example, a decline in production of maize and an increase in production of cassava and some legumes. From an external perspective many of the indicators pointed towards unsustainability in agriculture, with the main driving force being individual household circumstance, and particularly the availability of labour. Households were dynamic, with constant immigration and emigration of males and females, but all members of the family saw emigration of young males as positive as it adds to 'household sustainability.' Agricultural sustainability was seen as negotiable, and often played off against wider concerns of family sustainability. If stakeholder participation is seen as a fundamental human right rather than just a methodological fix, then the internal perspective of what sustainability means and what it should be applied to needs to be considered and perhaps melded with external visions.

AB Water erosion is a major factor degrading soils of the Nigerian semi-and ecoregions, and making agriculture less sustainable. For example, soil erosion in the Northern Guinea savanna ecozones of Nigeria is prominent in cultivated areas during the early part of the rain-fed crop production season, when most soil surfaces are bare. In order to estimate the magnitude and timing of soil loss from cultivated lands. Selected herbaceous legumes (Macrotyloma uniflorum, Stylosanthes hamata and Mucuna pruriens) were inter-cropped with maize, a sole maize and a maize/straw mulched treatments were also maintained and evaluated for soil loss control potential. Sediments were collected in 94 liter capacity drums in each treatment. This study was carried out in Zaria (between longitudes 7degrees30' and 7degrees50' E and latitudes 11degrees00' and 11degrees10' N) in 1993 and 1994. Results obtained show that generally, higher sediment yields in 1993 and 1994, were received under legume live mulch and sole maize treatments, than straw mulch. Macrotyloma live mulch however controlled soil loss better than the other legume live mulch and sole maize. Straw mulch, followed by Stylosanthes and Macrotyloma live mulch treatments resulted in significantly higher maize grain yields than sole maize and Mucuna live mulch treatment. Measured and estimated soil loss, and suitable management practices that would ensure sustained productivity of the soils were suggested.

AB In Niger, a breakdown of the bush-fallow system, low crop yields and reduced availability of communal land have resulted from increasing population pressure. Agricultural intensification is critical to the future development of the region. Intensification of agricultural production in Niger must include adoption of sustainable yield increasing technologies, fertilizer use, supplementary irrigation and/or water conservation, high yielding cultivars and improved crop management practices. On-farm constraints analysis of crop productivity and technologies assessment was carried out in two irrigated perimeters: the Konni surface irrigation and the Djirataoua deep well system where supplemental irrigation is provided to rainy season crops in the event of long dry spells, and full irrigation is supplied to dry season crops. Konni is located in southern Niger, approximately 13degrees48'0"N, 5degrees15'0"E at approximately 257 in altitude; Djirataoua is located further east, approximately 13degrees20'0"N, 7degrees7'60"E at approximately 368 in altitude, near Maradi, which is located at approximately 13degrees28'60"N, 7degrees5'60"E, approximately 376 m altitude. In both the Konni and Djirataoua irrigation systems, use of supplementary irrigation has enhanced cropping intensity and crop productivity per unit area (yield) while generating greater employment opportunity. Analysis of long-term crop productivity trends during 1980-1997 revealed that sustainability of gained productivity is possible through agricultural intensification over years without any sign of productivity decline. These results show that the use of agriculture intensification technologies plays a crucial role in sustainable, increased crop production in the Sahel. The results of our diagnostic survey in these two perimeters showed that the major constraints to increased productivity are low fertilizer use, poor nutrient use efficiency, the lack of well adapted, high yielding varieties or hybrids, poor crop establishment and plant protection in farmers fields, and inappropriate input and output pricing. On-farm evaluation of the improved technologies, namely improved varieties or hybrids and optimal fertilizer use with optimal supplementary irrigation, resulted in a 35% increase in grain yields at the farm level. The lesson learned from this study is that developing sustainable agricultural production systems in Niger with higher yields, or production per unit area, than present-day yields depends upon supplementary irrigation if or where potential exists, and upon promotion of fertilizer use, high yielding cultivars and other innovative production technologies. This strategy will help reduce frequency and intensity of food shortages and will ultimately help reduce the incidence of poverty and starvation in Niger. (C) 2002 by The Haworth Press, Inc.

AB The Sustainable Agriculture Farming System (SAFS) Project was begun in 1988 to compare conventional 4-year and 2-year rotations receiving synthetic fertilizers and pesticides to low input and organic farming systems. In 1998 and 1999, we evaluated the influence of 10 years of organic, low input, and conventional management practices on soil chemical properties, processing tomato yields, and fruit mineral composition. The organic system had highest soil total C, N, soluble P, exchangeable Ca, and K levels as a result of 10 years of manure application and cover crop use. In both years, fruit yields were similar in the three farming systems. Organic fruits contained highest amounts of P, and Ca. Conventionally-grown tomatoes were richer in N, and Na, while the low input system had an intermediate values for N, P, and Na, and the lowest Ca concentration of the three systems.

AB The highlands of central Kenya are characterized by a bimodal rainfall distribution (600 to 2,000 mm yr(-1)), gently to steeply rolling topography, and a high population density (500 to 800 persons km(-2)) that has led to the exploitation of decreasingly productive lands and increased soil erosion. Most farmers in the central highlands practice mixed fanning, with dairy production under cut and carry systems the predominant livestock enterprise. This trial was established in 1993 to investigate the potential for incorporating fodder producing contour hedges into a maize cropping system. Maize production was reduced in treatments that contained Napier grass hedges, either pure or in combination with calliandra. The pure calliandra hedge was not competitive with maize. Seasonal runoff and soil loss were not significantly different between treatments during most seasons although these factors were quantitatively greater in the no-hedge control than in the hedge treatments. Fodder production was generally greater in Napier grass and combination hedge treatments. Maximum fodder production occurred in the pure Napier grass hedge during the sixth season. Over the experimental period, crude protein production was greatest in the combination hedge treatment. The combination of Napier grass and calliandra provides a sustainable agroforestry technology for soil and water conservation and the production of high-quality fodder for dairy farmers.

AB Sustainability of grasslands results from complex interactions involving climate, soil, and forage and livestock management. Soils from the central Appalachian region are acidic and thus unlikely to support legume production without substantial soil fertility management. A survey was conducted to determine if the level of legume forages in central Appalachian grasslands was sufficient for sustainable productivity and if the levels of soil nutrients are sufficient to maintain legumes. Results from this survey indicated that the soil in most fields had adequate levels of plant nutrients for satisfactory forage legume production; however, most fields had sub-optimal levels of forage legumes. These results suggest that increases in the abundance of legume forages in the central Appalachian grassland will occur with changes in livestock and forage management rather than increasing soil fertility.(C) 2002 by The Haworth Press, Inc.

ID WHEAT
AB Rice-wheat cropping systems occupy about 21 million ha in Asia and arc the most important in terms of self-sufficiency in food on that continent. A three-year field study at the Indian Agricultural Research Institute showed that rice-wheat cropping systems produced 8.6 t ha(-1) y(-1) of grain as compared to 4.9 to 5.4 for rice-lentil, rice-rapeseed and rice-chickpea cropping systems. Despite higher prices for the grains of lentil, chickpea and rapeseed. rice-wheat cropping systems were more profitable and therefore preferred by the farmers. However, removal of primary plant nutrients (NPK) by rice-wheat cropping system was 502 kg ha(-1) y(-1) (209 kg N, 45 kg P and 248 kg K) as compared to 236-352 kg ha(-1) y(-1) (112-183 kg N, 20 kg P and 131-145 kg K) by the other 3 rice-based cropping systems studied. Therefore, continuous NPK fertilization is essential for sustained productivity.

AB In this study, an attempt is made to assess the potential sustainable agricultural use of the land resources in Caoxian County in north China. Based on a land resources inventory (physiography, climate, soil, land use and management), the rotation of winter wheat-summer maize was selected as the major land utilization type of grain production in the study area. Land use requirements were adapted to the local conditions and hierarchical production potentials were estimated using the collected data. Satisfactory results have been achieved for six scenarios combining local management practices and input levels. The population carrying capacity has been obtained and guidelines for a sustainable use of land resources were formulated. Conclusions were drawn with regard to the methodologies applied.

AB The common practice in many countries of using chicken manure in soil as a source of nutrients to plants is of paramount importance in sustainable agriculture. However, the application of non-composted manure on soil could contribute to contamination of the environment by fecal microorganisms. This creates a health hazard to humans, domestic animals, and to wildlife. The impact of soil solarization on reduction of microorganism-indicators of fecal contamination in chicken manure-treated soils has not been evaluated. In this study, 1.5 kg/m(2) of chicken manure was applied to 40 cm deeply-ploughed clayish calcareous soils of four greenhouses. The soils of four other greenhouses wereleft as control-untreated with manure. Litter incorporation in the soil was performed by a harrow with 20 cm penetration depth. Irrigation was applied to soil of the eight greenhouses to obtain an average humidity at 40 cm-soil depth equivalent to 92.9%. Soil solarization of the chicken manure-treated soils with a 50 mum thick-polyethylene film for a period of six weeks resulted in an average 20 cm-soil depth temperature at 15 hr of 40 C in comparison to 28.3degreesC obtained in soil with no polyethylene film application. Solarization resulted in reduction in different microorganism-indicators per gram of chicken manure-treated soil collected at 20 cm depth in comparison to the count in the same soil before solarization. The percent reduction in counts in increasing order was: Staphylococcus aureus (26.3), total bacteria (45.5), fungi (71.3), Clostridium perfringes (81.8), fecal coliform (92.6), and non-lactose fermenting bacteria (100.0).

AB The Nigerian peasant farmers intercrop oil palm with selected food crops in the early stages of growth to maximize economic returns from the land. An experiment was initiated to Study the influence of companion food crops on the root distribution patterns of young oil palm in southwest Nigeria. The experiment used a randomized complete block design (RCBE) with three replicates. There were ten treatments comprised or four sole cropping and six involving intercropping oil palm with soybean (Glycine max), maize (Zea mays) and cocoyam (Xanthosoma sagittifolium). Yields of food crops were significantly different among the various intercrops and cropping seasons. The highest soybean seed was recorded in the oil palm + soybean plot and the lowest in the oil palm + soybean + maize + cocoyarn plot. Maize grain yields were highest in the oil palm + maize plot and lowest in the oil palm + soybean + maize + cocoyam plot. Cocoyam corm yields were highest in the oil palm + cocoyam plot and lowest in the oil palm + soybean + maize + cocoyam plot. The intercropped soybean, maize and cocoyam are useful for human consumption, animal feed and income. They play magnificent roles in nutrient cycling, erosion and weed control, water conservation. and maintenance of favorable soil physical properties in addition to reducing the risk of crop failure.

AB Effects of EM bokashi organic fertilizer on nodulation, physiological properties and yield of peanut plants were investigated in a nature-farming field. Compared to chemical fertilizer, EM bokashi fertilizer significantly increased both the nodule numbers per plant and fresh weight per nodule. The peanut plants fertilized with EM bokashi fertilizer also showed higher photosynthetic rate, transpiration rate and mesophyll conductance. Therefore, the vegetative and reproductive growth of peanut plant in EM bokashi treatment was promoted significantly. The shoot and root dry weights in EM bokashi treatment were significantly higher than those in chemical treatment. The total pod number and pod dry weight in EM bokashi fertilizer treatment were significantly higher than those in chemical fertilizer treatment. These results suggested that EM bokashi is an effective organic fertilizer in nature farming crop production. (C) 2002 by The Haworth Press, Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The sustainability of a telehealth programme is one measure of its success. However, the term 'sustainable telehealth' has almost become an oxymoron. Many telehealth programmes are initiated in good faith and are based upon well founded principles. Unfortunately, the initial funding cycle is rarely long enough to enable the programme to reach maturity and become integrated into the health-care system. Telehealth does not critically depend on technology; change management is much more important and it takes time for personnel to adopt new modes of practice. In addition, a telehealth programme needs a threshold number of installations before it can be deemed fully operational. In many cases an evaluation carried out at the conclusion of the pilot phase will fail to recognize the initial goals. As a consequence, the criteria used to justify further financial support are often at odds with the original goals and aspirations of the project initiators, and this leads to dissatisfaction by all parties concerned.

ID TELEPSYCHIATRY
AB Development of telemedicine mental health services in Alberta evolved via a pilot project, the delivery of routine services to a small group of centres and subsequent expansion to a province-wide programme. Success of the service was linked to support for telehealth by the provincial government and consultation between the Alberta Mental Health Board (AMHB) and local stakeholders. Assessments by the AMHB have shown that telepsychiatry is acceptable and sustainable at a realistic cost. However, there are few measures of clinical effectiveness available and none of cost-effectiveness. A detailed economic evaluation of the telemedicine mental health network would now be a major task. The expansion of telemedicine mental health services has increased the expectations of health-care decision makers. In addition, the complexity of the network has increased and new initiatives, such as the use of telepsychology, have been introduced. Management of this successful telehealth programme continues to be time consuming and challenging.

AB A demographic study was carried out on Bertholletia excelsa, the Brazil nut tree, in two primary forest sites in Northern Bolivia where Brazil nuts have been harvested for several decades. In spite of the large proportion (93%) of seeds that are harvested, reasonable densities of recently, emerged seedlings were found. Seeds of Bertholletia are contained in woody, fruits that are primarily opened by agoutis. Most fruits are left untouched on the forest floor for 1-2 y, before they are opened, possibly due to high energetic costs of fruit opening just after fruit fall. However, the proportion of viable seeds is strongly reduced in older fruits.
   Growth in diameter at breast height (dbh) was low for pole-sized trees (< 15 cm dbh) and adult trees (> 100 cm dbh) and peaked for intermediate-sized trees (30-60 cm). These trees often attained a growth rate of > 1.5 cm y(-1), which is high compared with other non-pioneer tropical trees. This, and the strong growth response to increased light availability found for seedlings and saplings, suggest that Bertholletia excelsa can be classified as a gap-dependent species. Matrix population models were constructed for both study populations. Population growth rates (lambda) were close to one, and were most sensitive to persistence in one size category. Age estimates revealed that age at first reproduction (at dbh > 60 cm) amounts to over 120 y, and age in the last category (dbh > 160 cm) to almost 300 y. Given the continuous rejuvenation of the Population, the stable population size, the high age at maturity and the long reproductive period, it is concluded that current levels of Brazil nut extraction may be sustained at least for several decades and perhaps for even longer periods.

AB This paper reports on long-term research work of recycling networks in Germany and Austria from a knowledge-based perspective. Using data from expert interviews, we discuss the key determinants of inter-organizational knowledge transfer within networks. In particular, we highlight the factor of mutual trust as important determinant of knowledge transfer in company recycling networks. One important goal of our empirical research is the institutionalization of knowledge transfer through the implementation of a central recycling agency in order to build core capabilities and to create intellectual capital.

AB This study shows that in the suburban rings surrounding Cleveland, Ohio average resale prices are sustained through capitalization of quality-price preferences for housing and school quality. Average housing resale prices are highest where local fiscal capacity is built upon a strong residential-nonresidential property tax base and where the total valuation resulting is capitalized into housing stock prices. High total valuation per pupil enables school districts to maintain satisfactory per pupil expenditures that contribute to the sustainability of resale prices. Nonetheless, regional restructuring, population growth, access to superior housing, open space and other amenities in the peripheral, inner- and outer-edge suburban rings are redirecting investment away from the contiguous ring suburbs, where the levying of high effective millages is causing total valuations per pupil to fall; Diminishing school district quality and shrinking tax bases in the contiguous suburbs are harbingers of suburban distress and housing disinvestment.

AB Between 1987 and 1996 the numbers of badgers Meles meles in Wytham Woods rose from 60 to 228 adults. The area occupied by the population has not changed and thus density has also risen from 10 adult badgers/km(2) to 38/km(2). This rise parallels an increase in badger abundance seen across Britain in recent years. The hypothesis that this increase is either the consequence of improved badger protection or of changes in habitat can be rejected for this site. Instead, a link between increasing numbers and changing weather patterns, possibly resulting from climate change, is investigated. In particular, attention is drawn to a correlation between mild winters and heavier body weights of badgers in January. Furthermore socio-spatial restructuring within the population may be the mechanism that has permitted high density to be sustainable. The increase in badger numbers at Wytham has not affected population sex ratio, which has remained relatively constant at parity throughout the study.

AB The impacts of livestock farming in southern Namibia's communal areas are investigated. Small stock farming is ubiquitous in this semiarid region, and provides many people with their only source of wealth and income. It is traditionally thought that livestock grazing negatively impacts on the vegetation resource. Using both interviews and interpretation of sequential aerial photographs, veld (a South African word descriptive of the general vegetation and soils within an area) resilience and changes in vegetation composition and cover were analysed. Results provide contrasting evidence. Resilience is illustrated by good plant regeneration after the 1999-2000 rainy season, an observation that provides support for a disequilibrium. interpretation of the landscape, suggesting that productivity here is primarily event driven and not unduly impacted by grazing pressure. Additional, contradictory, results show that vegetation composition has indeed changed in the communal lands, from predominantly palatable perennials to unpalatable annuals. Localized areas of degradation are also evident. Using sequential aerial photography, comparison of land units under commercial tenure (1970) with the situation subsequent to incorporation into Namaland (1998) indicates an increase in bare soil from 6.3 to 11 per cent over the time period in question. This increase is attributed to, among other factors, increased pressure form livestock grazing. Although separating anthropogenic factors from other biophysical ones is difficult, it is argued that appropriate management practices should be employed that take into account both the veld's resilience and the observed localized degradation and species composition changes.

AB Wetlands are critical resources in the highlands of southwest Ethiopia, where they perform numerous environmental functions and provide a range of benefits for local communities. In recent years, however, an increase in the drainage and cultivation of these areas and reports of wetland degradation have raised concerns over the sustainability of wetland agriculture. This paper presents the results of a study in which groundwater levels were monitored in a series of wetlands undergoing different stages of drainage and cultivation, to establish the hydrological changes taking place as a consequence. The results suggest that drainage and cultivation induce extreme spatial and temporal variations in the wetland watertable. This is linked in part to structural and chemical changes in the wetland soil which affect hydraulic conductivity. Statistical analysis of this variability revealed the existence of wetland subunits, exhibiting specific hydrological behaviour, which may reflect the influence of current and past land use. Although degradation of these wetlands does occur, many wetland users are aware of their impacts and have developed practices which, in most cases, prevent overdrainage to the extent that the wetlands cannot support agriculture. In this respect, it is argued that wetland use remains hydrologically sustainable, although this ultimately rests upon the ability of communities to continue to develop and apply their indigenous wetland management practices under rapidly changing environmental, socio-economic and political conditions.

AB Agricultural production in Turkey is not sustainable due to degradation and loss of croplands, rapid population growth, and inequitable economic growth (poverty and overconsumption). Degrading land uses and management practices disturb the life-supporting biogeochemical cycles within croplands and between croplands and natural ecosystems by increasing emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs: CO2, CH4, N2O, CFCs, and tropospheric O-3), pollution of water, soil and air, loss of soil organic matter and biodiversity, erosion, salinization and desertification. Sustainability-oriented management practices in croplands include maintenance of soil organic matter by conservation tillage and residue management, windbreaks, selection of crops ecologically adapted to local climate regimes, efficient crop rotation, enhancement of agrobiodiversity (e.g. intercropping and agroforestry), and adoption of proper drainage techniques. Implementation of these preventive and mitigative measures necessitates internalization of ecological principles into agricultural policy and management processes. This study explores the opportunities and limitations of agricultural sustainability in Turkey in a holistic manner. A multiple linear regression (MLR) model was developed to relate CO2 emissions to energy intensity (energy use/gross domestic product), affluence (gross domestic product/population) and population growth. Our MLR model with a high R-2 of 97 per cent revealed that stabilization of human population growth, and increasing energy efficiency in economic growth are essential to decreasing GHG emissions and enhancing environmental quality.

ID POLICY
AB One of the key requirements of the European Union (EU) for accession of Central European countries (CEC) to the EU is the establishment of free market economies which parallel the economies in Western Europe based on the adoption of the Acquis Communautaire (Acquis) from the EU. Central to this objective is the privatisation of lands and the establishment of efficient land markets. To this end the EU and many other countries and international organisations have committed significant resources to support land administration, and particularly cadastral projects, in Central Europe since 1992.
   This paper reviews the role that the establishment of land administration systems is playing in the accession of CEC to the EU. Other key requirements for accession to the EU are the adoption of the Common Agricultural Policy, the protection of human rights. environmental sustainability and institution building. The paper also considers the role that land administration plays in supporting these objectives and develops a generic framework for land administration projects in support of accession to the EU.
   As background the paper uses examples to highlight the historical context of land, the evolution of land administration in Central Europe, the reconstruction of property rights and the justification of land administration projects in the context of AGENDA 2000 for a wider Europe. The paper provides an international context by examining land administration trends globally.
   The paper concludes by highlighting the challenges facing the establishment of land administration systems in CEC. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The transition countries of East Central Europe have had to cope with some severe environmental problems inherited from the communist period when urban-industrial development accelerated and pressure from tourism increased, and while the balance between agriculture and forestry did not change greatly, intensification resulted in some degradation. However, biodiversity resources in ECE are still high in comparison with those of western Europe; yet there are dangers. First, although development pressures have relaxed during the transition, some unsustainable coping strategies have been induced. Second, development threats will become more intense as the enlargement of the EU proceeds and appropriate safeguards are called for. The Carpathians have been identified as a particularly vulnerable area and the World Wildlife Fund for Nature is playing a leading role in preparing a programme for ecoregion-based conservation. This paper examines the background to this Carpathian Ecoregion Initiative (CEI) and considers some of the implications of greater protection for core areas and encouragement of sustainable practices among stakeholder groups.

AB Compaction and loss of mechanical stability and biological activity in agricultural soils cause reductions of infiltration capacity and increase the risk of severe flooding events. Triggering factors among agricultural production techniques for such a "creeping sealing" are excessive mechanical loads through traffic and tillage operations, monotonous crop rotations, insufficient monitoring of structure forming parameters and processes and the use of pesticides.
   Maintaining a high infiltration capacity of soils is one of the most significant achievements of agriculture which is not covered by the prices of agricultural products. Independent of the production system conservation soil tillage improves significantly the infiltration capacity. But on conventional agricultural farms this technique has to be considered as one single factor in an otherwise hostile environment.
   On organic farms there are a number of factors with positive effects on infiltration rates. Organic farmed soils favour particularly the establishment of "biopores" resulting in on an average twice as high infiltration rates than conventional farmed soils. The spatial extension of organic farming is therefore a measure of prime significance in the combat against the negative effects of the anthropogenic sealing of soils.
   Research needs are allocated for the modelling of infiltration, dependent on soil physical, chemical and biological parameters on different scales, the development of methods to determine mechanical stress on soils and related critical values, the improvement of methods for estimating the lime requirement of soils and the sustainable implementation of conservation soil tillage on organic farming systems.

ID MODEL
AB The realization of strategies for sustainable land use assumes specific research concepts from the local to the global scale (micro-, meso- and macroscale). Therefore, landscape ecological science has to provide investigation methods for all these different scales. By combining "top-down" and "bottom-up" approaches in addition to coupled GIS-model applications and traditional methods, the investigation of landscape ecological structures and processes seems to be possible. The presented studies show this approach on examples of two study areas in Eastern Germany: A watershed of 400 km(2) and an administrative district of about 4000 km(2). The scale-specific applicability of several models and methods were tested for these investigations, and the validation of the calculated results are presented. An important outcome of the project should be the prevention of conflicts between agriculture, water management and soil, and water and nature conservation based on recommendations for land use variants with decreased pollutant loading within agricultural areas. The scale specific investigations can be considered as a base for establishing sustainable land use.

ID PSEUDOREPLICATION
AB Landscape ecology has made tremendous progress in recent decades, but as a rapidly developing discipline it is faced with new problems and challenges. To identify the key issues and research priorities in landscape ecology, a special session entitled "Top 10 List for Landscape Ecology in the 21st Century" was organized at the 16th Annual Symposium of the US Regional Association of International Association of Landscape Ecology, held at Arizona State University (Tempe, Arizona, USA) during April 25-29, 2001. A group of leading landscape ecologists were invited to present their views. This paper is intended to be a synthesis, but not necessarily a consensus, of the special session. We have organized the diverse and wide-ranging perspectives into six general key issues and 10 priority research topics. The key issues are: (1) interdisciplinarity or transdisciplinarity, (2) integration between basic research and applications, (3) Conceptual and theoretical development, (4) education and training, (5) international scholarly communication and collaborations, and (6) outreach and communication with the public and decision makers. The top 10 research topics are: (1) ecological flows in landscape mosaics, (2) causes, processes, and consequences of land use and land cover change, (3) nonlinear dynamics and landscape complexity, (4) scaling, (5) methodological development, (6) relating landscape metrics to ecological processes, (7) integrating humans and their activities into landscape ecology, (8) optimization of landscape pattern, (9) landscape sustainability, and (10) data acquisition and accuracy assessment. We emphasize that, although this synthesis was based on the presentations at the "Top 10 List" session, it is not a document that has been agreed upon by each and every participant. Rather, we believe that it is reflective of the broad-scale vision of the collective as to where landscape ecology is now and where it may be going in future.

AB In this paper, we formalize the problem of finding a routing path for the streaming of continuous media (e.g., video or audio files) that maximizes the probability that the streaming is successful, over a network with nonuniform edge delays and capacities, and arbitrary time-dependent edge reliabilities. We call such a problem the most sustainable path (MSP) problem. We address the MSP problem in two network routing models: the wormhole and the circuit-switching routing models. We present fully-distributed polynomial-time algorithms for the streaming of constant-size data in the wormhole model, and for arbitrary-size data in the circuit-switching model. Our algorithms are simple and assume only local knowledge of the network topology at each node. The algorithms evolved from a variation of the classical Bellman-Ford shortest-path algorithm. One of the main contributions of this paper was to show how to extend the ideas in the Bellman-Ford algorithm to account for arbitrary time-dependent edge reliabilities.

TI State policies and the preservation of forest cover: Lessons from
   contrasting public-policy regimes in Costa Rica
SO LATIN AMERICAN RESEARCH REVIEW

ID SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT; TROPICAL FORESTS; LATIN-AMERICA; MANAGEMENT;
   DEFORESTATION; CONSERVATION
AB This study evaluates the impact of state policies on forest cover in Costa Rica, focusing on the influence of public policies on private incentives for preserving forest cover. Three periods are analyzed: the "laissez-faire period" when high rates of deforestation were largely unrestrained; the "interventionist period" when state policies created protection for some wildlands, especially with the creation of parks and reserves, but when many regulatory policies produced mixed results at best; and the current "hybrid period" featuring major policy changes and mixing market-oriented and interventionist approaches but not always in a coherent design. Despite significant successes, current policies appear unlikely to provide sufficient incentive to maintain the desired amount of forest cover unless the international community compensates Costa Ricans for the benefits that their forests provide the world.

TI Ecologically noble Amerindians? Cattle, ranching and cash cropping among
   Shuar and colonists in Ecuador
SO LATIN AMERICAN RESEARCH REVIEW

DT Article
ID PERUVIAN AMAZON; FOREST; INTENSIFICATION; SUSTAINABILITY; CONSERVATION;
   INDIANS
AB Observers have argued that as indigenous peoples become more acculturated and their reserves more populous, they begin to exploit tropical rain forests much as colonists acid other outsiders do. The history of changes in land use between 1950 and 1980 among the Shuar, an indigenous group in the Ecuadorian Amazon, would appear to support this convergence thesis. The Shuar began to clear land, plant pastures, and acquire cattle, much like their mestizo competitors for land. Using survey and remote-sensing data for a later period, from 1987 to 1997, we demonstrate that convergence has given way to divergence in land-use trends among the two groups. While mestizo smallholders throughout the region continue to rely on cattle ranching, Shuar smallholders close to roads have begun to reforest their lands and cultivate formers garden crops like coffee and cacao as cash crops. These recent trends in Shuar land use suggest that even when Amerindians become more acculturated, they still maintain more biologically diverse landscapes than their mestizo neighbors.

ID 2 SPATIAL SCALES; AFRICAN
AB The remaining West African giraffes (Giraffa camelopardalis) are found in Niger (62 individuals in January 1998). Their feeding behaviour was studied by direct observation during two periods of 6 and 12 mo. The giraffe's diet is diverse : at least 45 plant species were eaten, depending on spatial arrangement and a given plant's stage of growth. Time spent browsing during the dry season was twice that devoted to browsing during the rainy season (46 and 23 % respectively). Time spent feeding on a plant was correlated with the total time spent feeding on this species. Giraffe browsed at a level which domestic animals cannot reach usually, between two and four metres for females and juveniles and between four and five metres for adult males. The total browsing time on a species was not correlated with its occurrence in the field. The small number of giraffes, the diversity of their diet and the lack of competition with domestic animals indicate a weak impact of the giraffe on the vegetation and the possibility for the population to increase in this area. Giraffe are located in an area with a strong human presence and they feed on species used daily by the rural communities. This brings to light the close link existing between communities living in the same environment. The acknowledgement of that link requires the consideration of ecological factors in their relationship with regional economic expansion programs.

TI Nutritional plight of Orissa: An overview
SO MAN IN INDIA
LA English
DT Article
AB The present paper reviews the nutritional status of the people of the State of Orissa, India. The population of Orissa mainly depends on agriculture and around half of them are living below poverty level. The malnutrition in Orissa varies widely across region, age, gender, social groups; and several socio-economic factors and cultural practices determine the malnutritional status. Regular drought, famine and scanty of work in many places of Orissa particularly in tribal areas result in food insecurity, which led to severe malnutrition. The cultural taboos and improper feeding practices during postnatal and antenatal stages resulted malnutrition among children. The integrated child development scheme, which is in implementation extensively in the State, is not having the intended impact on nutritional status of children and mothers. Regarding the intake of various nutrients by people of Orissa; the National Nutritional Monitoring Bureau reports that among majority of people in Orissa, the average intake of nutrients is lower than recommended dietary intake (RDI). Hence, it is concluded that efforts must be made with adequate and sustainable commitment to deal with the problem of malnutrition. There must be sufficient component of health and nutrition education for these people. Effective nutrition intervention programmes with more involvement of communities should be developed to enhance the nutritional status of the people of Orissa.

AB In 1995, in collaboration with local Bedouin fishermen, five no-take fisheries reserves were established within the Nabq Natural Resource Protected Area, South Sinai, Egyptian Red Sea. The abundance, size structure and catch of commercially targeted groupers (Serranidae), emperors (Lethrinidae) and snappers (Lutjanidae) were investigated before the establishment of these reserves, then in 1997 and again in 2000. By 1997, these fish had shown a significant increase in mean abundance within two of the no-take reserves. By 2000 each family and three individual species (Lethrinus obsoletus, Cephalopholis argus and Variola louti) had increased in abundance in the reserves. There were significant increases in mean individual length of the serranids Epinephelus fasciatus and C. argus and of the lethrinids L. nebulosus and Monotaxis grandoculis. Meanwhile, mean recorded catch per unit effort (CPUE) within the adjacent fished areas increased by about two-thirds (P <0.05) during the 5 years. The establishment of the no-take reserves appears to have played a key role in maintaining the sustainability of the fishery. The involvement of local Bedouin and fishermen in the co-management of fisheries resources was critical to the success of this initiative.

AB Small-scale biogenic or physical features, such as depressions, burrows, shells, boulders, cobbles and sand waves, dominate soft-sediment coastal and shelf environments. Such structures may provide refuge from predation and feeding areas for juvenile fish. We investigated the potential for juvenile snapper Pagrus auratus to utilise areas characterised by small-scale structures by sampling soft-sediment habitats that varied in both sediment characteristics and biogenic structure. Juvenile snapper abundance was estimated at each site using opera house traps, while variations in small-scale benthic habitat structure were quantified from video transects of the seafloor. The captured fish had 172 +/- 43 mm fork length, indicating that they were 1 to 2 yr old. Statistical modelling revealed that complex habitat structure had a positive influence on the abundance of juvenile snapper, suggesting that these areas are preferentially utilised. This finding highlights the potential for disturbance of such structures (by, for example, trawling or dredging) to affect the abundance of juvenile snapper.

AB Most phytoplankton species have a tendency to sink. Phytoplankton require light for photosynthesis, however. Therefore, phytoplankton species that sink too fast will not be able to sustain a viable population in the euphotic zone. This points to the existence of a maximal sustainable phytoplankton sinking velocity, Using a reaction-advection-diffusion model of phytoplankton growth in a stratified water column, we derive that this maximal sinking velocity is inversely proportional to the turbidity of the water column. In other words, clear waters can sustain species with high sinking rates, whereas turbid waters can sustain species with low sinking rates only. We show that this prediction is both qualitatively and quantitatively supported by empirical data. An intriguing implication is that export production of sinking phytoplankton might be sensitive to the turbidity of the water column.

AB The present contribution is an extension of the trophic models that we have previously designed for benthic communities in Tongoy Bay (north-central Chile). It represents the first attempt to use Levins' loop analysis in a complex harvested system along the Chilean coast. Ecological and extended eco-social models were developed for seagrass, sand-gravel and sand habitats in order to propose sustainable management strategies for the harvest of the red algae Chondrocanthus chamissoi, the scallop Argopecten purpuratus, the snail Xanthochorus cassidiformis and the crab Cancer polyodon. Based on Levins' loop analysis it was possible to estimate both the local stability (sustainability) for each of these model systems and to simulate the changes in the standing stocks of the main groups as response to external factors. Our results suggest that to increase the standing stocks of adult scallops the following man-made interventions should be implemented: (1) seagrass habitat: partial removal of the 3 sea star species Luidia magallanica, Heliaster helianthus and Meyenaster gelatinosus; and (2) sand-gravel habitat: seeding of scallop recruits and juvenile scallops, and removal of the sea star H. helianthus only. According to our results, the sand habitat would not support any harvest. The extended model for the seagrass and sand-gravel habitats were found sustainable only if the fishermen were 'self-damped', that is, when the fishing effort and fish quota were restricted. Even though loop analysis did not allow for explicit quantitative reasoning, 'what if' questions can be answered with sufficient understanding and realism. Therefore, this qualitative modelling appears as a valuable complementary mathematical tool defining and assessing the sustainability of management options within a holistic scope. We also recommend the application of this framework in other benthic management areas along the Chilean coast.

AB The eastern Baltic cod fishery, as many fisheries worldwide, is experiencing a major crisis. The combination of current environmental conditions, fishing mortality rates, and stock size indicates that this fishery is not sustainable. In order to rebuild the population and sustain the fishery in the future, it is essential to define a biologically appropriate exploitation level. In this paper, we take a decision-theoretical approach and use risk analysis to compare different management actions in terms of fishing mortality rates, and predict stock size in a short, medium and long-term perspective. We consider alternative hypotheses about the stock biomass in 1999 and analyse the risk of stock decline below three thresholds: quasi-extinction (B-ext, defined by us), the safe biological limit, and the precautionary. approach limit as defined by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES). Results show that the current fishing mortality implies a tremendous risk of driving the Baltic cod stock below B-ext (1000 t) within 10 yr. This result is robust to alternative assumptions about model structure as well as to the magnitude of environmental stochasticity. Hence, we consider a substantial reduction of the fishing mortality to be the only way of avoiding the far-reaching ecological and socio-economic consequences of continued exploitation at current levels.

AB Conservation of exploited marine populations requires knowledge of interannual variation in the characteristics of and relationships between the spawning stock and recruitment, which determine Population resilience and persistence. We examined relationships between spawning stock abundance, postlarval recruitment, larval abundance, and female size of the blue crab in Chesapeake Bay, both within the Spawning grounds over a 13 yr interval (1988 to 2000) and within lower-bay tributaries over 20 yr (1979 to 1998). Our findings establish that there has been a concurrent, persistent and substantial reduction in the spawning stock, recruitment, larval abundance, and female size, Specifically, in 1992 to 2000: (1) spawning stock abundance declined by 81 female size by 8%, and spawning stock biomass by 84%; (2) mean size at maturity (L) diminished by 9%; (3) larval abundance and postlarval recruitment were lower by approximately 1 order of magnitude compared with earlier years. The decrease in these variables was rapid, occurring over 1 to 2 yr, and therefore indicative of a phase shift in the Spawning stock and recruitment, rather than a progressive diminution, We propose that the initial descent resulted from poor recruitment in 1991, despite high spawning stock and larval abundance, and that the poor recruitment in 1991, in concert with high fishing and natural mortality, subsequently led to a diminished spawning stock in 1992 and thereafter, We further suggest that the Spawning stock, larval abundance, and recruitment are unlikely to rebound to former high levels without significant reductions in fishing and natural mortality along with enhanced environmental conditions conducive to successful recruitment. The key consequences of a diminished spawning stock and recruitment are a heightened probability of recruitment failure and reduced resilience to demographic and environmental stochasticity. In addition, the relationships between spawning stock abundance (SSA) and larval abundance, SSA and postlarval recruitment, and SSA and female size were positive and significant. The demonstration of a concurrent decrease and significant association between spawning stock abundance and recruitment, larval abundance and female size is unique for the blue crab and for marine invertebrates in general, and indicates an urgent need to conserve the Spawning stock for long-term sustainable exploitation and population persistence.

AB In an attempt to provide more sustainable and environmentally acceptable coastal defence options, engineers and policy-makers alike are increasingly turning to 'softer' approaches such as managed realignment. However, gaining public acceptance of managed realignment schemes can be challenging given that the local communities often view managed realignment as 'giving in' to the sea (Coastal defences: processes, problems and solutions. UK, Routledge, 2001). By studying public perceptions, engineers, planners and policy-makers will have a better understanding of the public's reactions, concerns and issues of managed realignment, which not only fills the existing research gap but also promotes public awareness and knowledge alongside the consultation process. This paper reviews findings from a pilot study conducted at a public exhibition and meeting in Brancaster, North Norfolk. Questionnaire surveys were used to collect the data and address three main research objectives (1) to gain an insight into the locals' perceptions of flooding in Brancaster; (2) to assess their awareness of the managed realignment scheme; and (3) identify the main issues that they considered to be important. The results demonstrated that many variables influence public perceptions of managed realignment, including personal experience, lack of information and media influence. The study concludes that while there is no formula to calculate which variables come into play, researching public perception towards managed realignment projects must be addressed by following a case-by-case approach.

AB Measurement of ecological, climatic and anthropogenic changes underpins the formulation of effective management strategies for sustainable use and protection of the marine environment. Sensors are traditionally used in marine studies to determine physical parameters, but there is increasing demand for real-time information about chemical and biological parameters. These parameters are currently measured in samples collected at sea and subsequently analysed in the laboratory. Biosensors fuse the exquisite sensitivity and specificity of living systems with the processing power of microelectronics to deliver simple, inexpensive measurement systems for use in the field or deployment in situ. While their potential for use in the marine environment is enormous, much published work to date has focussed on applications in freshwater and wastewater. Marine applications pose a substantial challenge in the robustness required for remote application, but recent developments in portable medical devices and receptor design suggest that these demands can now be realistically tackled.

AB Valdivia, a medium-sized city located in the south of Central Chile, is characterized by moderate demographic growth. Thus, it represents a special case among Latin American medium-sized towns whose growth rates in most of the cases surpass those of the capital cities. This paper analyses the causes and effects of slow growth and its consequences for a sustainable development of Valdivia. The study is based on detailed maps which document the development of the city during the past 25 years. Three-dimensional functional maps of the city centre represent the dominant function in each storey of the individual buildings.
   Finally it is discussed whether moderate growth may stimulate sustainable development. It is evident, that Valdivia succeeded in conserving much of its cultural identity and urban heritage. The city mirrors the economic potential of its region. It possesses the potential for the protection and restauration of the urban environment, and this may help to implement sustainable development processes.

AB Proper management, conservation and sustainable use of plant genetic resources (PGR) are fundamental to ecologically sustainable development and food security. As PGR are fundamental to the fulfilment of basic human needs like food, fuel fodder, fibre etc., their loss -has serious implications on economic and social development of nations. Therefore, every nation has the responsibility to conserve, manage, restore, and sustainably use the PGR within its jurisdiction.

ID MEDIATION; SUCCESS
AB What are the enduring effects of community-based conflict resolution processes? According to the research reported here, lessons participants learn in conflict resolution processes disseminate to their communities; secondly, such dissemination can be measured by content analysis of participants' constituent organization newsletters. The authors illustrate their findings with a case study of the New Community Meeting conflict resolution model (NCM), implemented 1997-98 in an Oregon community to address business-environmental conflict over growth and sustainable development Content analysis of business and environmental newsletters over 21 months, including before and after NCM, shows increasing positive and decreasing negative references to former adversaries over the period, together with advocacy for collaboration. The authors frame this study using social exchange theory, and conclude that this theoretical paradigm fits conflict resolution and consensus-building processes well.

AB Unique systems of breeding and calving management have been developed to allow New Zealand cattle herd owners to maintain seasonally concentrated calving patterns. Improved pastures are used as the sole ration for most beef and dairy cows with limited conservation and no grain feeding. Patterns of calving are described in relation to herd Planned Start of Calving (PSC) dates, calculated as 282 days after the first date of insemination in the preceding seasonal artificial breeding (AB) programme. Corticosteroids have been systematically used in over 80% of New Zealand dairy herds to induce premature parturition (calving induction) during the third trimester of pregnancy for about 25 years, to condense calving patterns into periods of 6-12 weeks. Widespread use of calving induction has minimised the adverse effects of declining reproductive performance in dairy herds on the sustainability of seasonally concentrated calving. The use of calving induction is now discouraged on animal welfare grounds and due to possible consequences for the marketing of New Zealand dairy products.
   Recent declines in the reproductive performance of dairy herds are linked to increased prevalence of extended periods of postpartum anovulatory anoestrus (AA), which has become the major form of infertility in dairy herds in New Zealand and can be related to reliance on grazed pasture as the sole diet for cows of increasing genetic merit. The prevalence of AA is influenced by parity, breed, recent genetic origin within a breed, body condition score, herd and year. Management strategies such as once daily milking, preferential grazing or feeding of silage, have not proven as successful as hormonal treatments.
   Although seasonally concentrated calving has remained a standard feature of the industry's low-cost, pasture-based system of management, continuing research will be required to economically maintain this pattern.

AB New Zealand has lead the world in pastoral farming of red, wapiti and fallow deer since this was first sanctioned in 1970. Among technological advances in deer production systems have been milestones in our understanding of deer health and welfare in an intensive pastoral farming environment, contributed by the combined efforts of veterinary practitioners, producers and researchers. These advances have impacted enormously on the health and wellbeing of New Zealand's farmed deer population, and contribute significantly to the success of deer production systems and the sustainability of the industry's international markets and reputation. These activities have brought local and international distinction upon the veterinary profession in New Zealand, by demonstrating innovation and initiative in establishing a new discipline of veterinary endeavor.
   This paper briefly reviews the important milestones in veterinary knowledge of capture-stress management, deer mortalities, the key disease syndromes of tuberculosis, yersiniosis, malignant catarrhal fever (MCF), internal parasites, trace elements and miscellaneous conditions, and selected animal welfare issues.

DE proliferation resistance; actinide fuels; plutonium recycling
ID REACTOR
AB A feasibility study of a proliferation-resistant fuel form for commercial power reactors was conducted. An increase in Pu-238 is known to increase the heat load in pure plutonium metal. At high Pu-238 concentrations in spent fuel, the heat load in the plutonium may, be sufficiently high that it will be less desirable for weapons production. An actinide-based fuel is proposed that will increase the ratio of Pu-238/Pu-239 in spent fuel, leading to a fuel form resistant to diversion for weapons use. Two actinides were considered, Np-237 and Am-241, for seeding in low-enriched (3% U-235) uranium oxide fuel. The ORIGEN point depletion code was utilized to calculate time-dependent spent-fuel concentrations of Pu-238, Pu-239, Np-237, Am-241, and other nuclides of interest. The preliminary results show that both Np-237 and Am-241 in small quantities generate significant Pu-238 in spent fuel, and more importantly, both actinide-based fuels shift the Pu-238/Pu-239 ratio significantly higher at relatively small initial concentrations. Based on a closed-loop actinide-fuel life cycle study, a (237)ATp-based fuel cycle seems much more sustainable as compared to Am-241. However, Am-241 addition to Np-237-based fuel may, have benefits in reducing the end-of-cycle deficit of 237Np.

SO NURSE EDUCATION TODAY
LA English
DT Article
ID CLIMATE-CHANGE; MALARIA; BIODIVERSITY; PERSPECTIVE
AB The environment is an established domain of nursing knowledge, but some authors argue that the traditional perspective is too narrowly focused on the immediate environment-to appreciate the relevance of the global environment. This article explores how human activities are bringing about global changes through their impact on biogeochemical cycles, land use and mobility of organisms, altering biodiversity and climate, and ultimately compromising the ecosystems services that sustain our planet. The consequences of global change for population health are examined, including the emergence of drug-resistant diseases, and the implications of climate warming and pollution for health. Addressing these issues presents a considerable challenge for nursing at all levels, in promoting sustainable policies, integrating environmental considerations into clinical practice, and in. the nursing role as health educators. The greatest challenge is to education, to raise awareness of the relevance and importance of the global environment to health, and to empower nurses with sufficient understanding of the issues to apply them to practice, participate in debate and contribute to policy-making that aims to reduce the burden of global changes. The extent to which the profession is prepared to diversify in response to these challenges is discussed. (C) 2002 Harcourt Publishers Ltd.

LA English
DT Article
DE nutrient audit; nutrient balances; nutrient depletion
ID NITROGEN; BALANCES
AB Mining of nutrients from the soil, particularly in developing countries, is a major problem, causing soil degradation and threatening long-term food production. This paper develops a methodology for carrying out nutrient audits, which includes the calculation of nutrient balances and an evaluation of trends in nutrient depletion/enrichment. Nutrient balances for arable farming are constructed for 197 countries for 1996 and for the world and two specific countries - a developed/enriching country (Japan) and a developing/depleting country (Kenya) for the period 1961 - 1996.
   The results indicate that nutrient efficiency is approximately 50% for N, 40% for P, and 75% for K. In some countries in Western Europe and in Japan and the Republic of Korea, with large, mixed farming systems, there is a surplus of N, P, and K. However, in almost all other countries, food production is currently dependent on depleting large quantities of nutrients from soil reserves and this is likely to continue. The world average soil depletion of nutrients in 1996 was estimated to be 12.1 kg N ha(-1), 4.5 kg P ha(-1), and 20.2 kg K ha(-1). The depletion of K is particularly severe and could ultimately lead to a serious loss of crop productivity in several countries. There is an urgent need to investigate this issue further. Analytical tools, such as the nutrient audit model described, can play an important role in assessing the problem, and in developing sustainable nutrient management policies, strategies, and practices.

TI Priorities and strategies for addressing natural and anthropogenic
   threats to coral reefs in Pacific Island Nations
SO OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
ID MARINE; BONE
AB Marine habitats and resources have been assumed to be almost unlimited, and that if one habitat became degraded or a particular fisheries resource depleted, there always would be another to replace it. The importance of coral reef ecosystems, in particular, may be seen in their numerous ecological, aesthetic, economic and cultural functions. Pacific islanders recognize that healthy reefs are essential for creation, support, protection and repair of their islands, and serve as a living pantry for the subsistence harvest and consumption of many reef organisms. The ability of coral reef ecosystems to exist in balanced harmony with other naturally occurring competing/limiting physico-chemical and biological agents has been severely challenged in the last several decades by the dramatically increased negative and synergistic impacts from poorly managed anthropogenic activities. In addressing these threats, a paradigm shift may be occurring in the evolution of the role of scientists in society from simply observers of the natural world with tenuous linkages to resource managers and the public, to partners in modern society's quest for answers to pressing questions related to sustainable use and conservation of coral reef resources. Management principles are beginning to. include human motivation and responses as part of coral ecosystems being studied and managed. Managers of coral reef resources face the challenge of balancing conservation and development objectives in the context of the inherent uncertainty of natural systems and the political and social pressures of human systems. Working together, scientists, managers and policymakers can develop priorities and strategies for societal and economic decisions that are strongly coupled with an increasingly comprehensive understanding of the environment. This in turn will lead to both socio-economic health and coral ecosystem health. Employing this new paradigm for interactions between scientists, managers and policymakers, participants of the Pacific Regional ICRI Symposium in Noumea, New Caledonia developed three principal sets of recommendations for addressing natural and anthropogenic threats to coral reefs in Pacific Island Nations: (1) develop and implement a new overarching Participatory Island Ecosystem Management System (PIEMS) for each of the Pacific Island Nations (2) improve existing, as well as design and implement new, capacity-building programs; and (3) improve scientific understanding of coral reef ecosystems with effective translation and transfer of information. Details for each set of recommendations are provided in this paper. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

TI Evaluating the contribution of beach quality awards to the local tourism
   industry in Wales - the Green Coast Award
SO OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB The agencies involved in the Green Sea Partnership have designed a beach award scheme, the Green Coast Award (GCA) to develop tourism through sustainable management plans at rural beaches in Wales. To date there has been little evaluation of the value of the GCA. This paper aims to test the underlying presumptions that the GCA drives up environmental standards and promotes tourism through sustainable beach management. Field work was conducted over a 2-week period, selecting I I case study beaches, five in Anglesey and six in Pembrokeshire. A semi-structured questionnaire was employed to collect data on beach user perceptions and observation techniques permitted recording of actual implementation of GCA standards. Analysis of the sample (n = 469) demonstrated that beach users have very little knowledge and understanding of beach award schemes, in particular the GCA, with only 11% stating they had heard of the award and a similar low percentage stating the award was important in beach selection. However, a high degree of correlation was found to exist between what beach users believed to be important beach management issues and their perception of the high level of management of those issues on the case study beaches. There-fore, although the GCA might not be well recognised by beach users the Green Sea Partnership has accurately identified the needs of the consumer, having an indirect impact on the experience of the beach user. All case study beaches were found to offer very high environmental standards, suggesting that management measures introduced by the GCA have improved beach quality. Encouragingly, the results also showed statistically (P = 0.05) that beach users who were aware that the beach visited was in receipt of a beach award were also more likely to state a beach award to be important in beach selection. The paper is concluded by suggesting that if further resources are to be invested in the GCA scheme then improved communication must be achieved between the environmental and tourism agencies and greater effort made in promoting the award.

SO OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
ID ISLANDS
AB This article presents the results of a study performed in 1997-98 on the presence, performance and institutional resilience of sasi, a local traditional resource management system in Central Maluku, Indonesia. The presence and functionality of sasi in 63 villages was determined by way of structured key informant interviews that explored the existence of sasi ceremonies, presence of written rules and sanctions, level and consistency of activity over time, area of application of rules, and governing authorities. Performance was measured in I I villages with strong sasi and 11 villages where it was weak. Performance was expressed in terms of biological and social sustainability, efficiency and equity. A number of factors were identified that contribute positively to the resilience of sasi as a local institution. The results of the study can be useful in the revitalization of traditional institutions or the establishment of new institutions in the context of decentralization and co-management in Indonesia and elsewhere.

TI Theoretical strategy considerations for beach management
SO OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB With increasing leisure time and opportunity and raised quality expectations, beach and bathing-related recreational management has become an increasingly important component of Integrated Coastal Area Management. Unfortunately, scientific literature appears to have allocated scant regard to such management needs and rarely in a comprehensive manner. Considerations of strategic management were reviewed and four key components identified relevant to beach and shoreline management. These were, analysis, planning, management and monitoring. In this context, dimensional analysis, comprising of five main aspects (substantive, spatial, temporal, quantitative and qualitative) was discussed in detail and presented as a management tool allowing improved definition of scale and scope of bathing environment-related problems, a clearer assessment of beach characteristics influenced by natural coastal dynamics and anthropogenic use and formulation of effective management strategy. The outcome from the development of management tools specifically addressing beach and bathing area needs are manifold, as they provide an opportunity to positively influence a plethora of social, economic and ecological issues at the coast (e.g. recreation, shoreline defence, wildlife habitats, data collection, conflict resolution, local community involvement and planning for sustainable development).

TI Institutional mapping of Oregon coastal watershed management options
SO OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB Institutional mapping is a technique that builds on the logic of Geographic Information Systems (GIS). In GIS, coverages placed over a base map show spatial relations. Social institutions are more difficult to "map" physically. Institutional mapping uses three social coverages-scale, power, and capital. Four sets of institutions affecting watershed management-salmon restoration, water quality improvement, forest management, and land-use planning-illustrate the institutional mapping process. Analysis indicates that water quality institutions under the Clean Water Act (CWA) have a slightly higher ranking on scale, power, and capital. Based on these rankings, CWA requirements are predicted to have greater potential for improving watershed health in coastal settings than institutions associated with salmon restoration, forest management, or land-use planning. The differences are not large, and overlapping goals for protecting salmon, improving water quality, sustainable forest management, and effective land-use planning institutions offers the strongest prospect for improved watershed health.

AB Guidelines are presented for a process to plan for the sustainable management of coastal and marine ecosystems of discrete sites. The guidelines provide an agreed starting point to initiate a site-planning effort, help organize a complicated process into discrete components, incorporate principles of community-based and collaborative management, minimize the risk of conflict by directly involving representatives of all interest groups and identifying and addressing all issues at an incipient stage, promote development of a sense of ownership and support for resulting management initiatives by all stakeholders, address the cumulative effects of adverse impacts to coastal and marine environments, and implement an integrated approach by considering all interrelated elements that affect the site through the collaboration of all interest groups. Site-planning is a process of reviewing past progress and assessing current and future issues, threats, and needs to identify priority management intervention activities that will sustain ecological, economic, and cultural values; balance multiple and often incompatible objectives; address priority threats to natural ecosystem functioning; conserve ecological processes and biodiversity; achieve sustainable development; and fulfill institutional, policy, and legal needs. Examples of intervention tools for coastal and marine resources planning and management range from developing and implementing integrated site management plans, to identifying and promoting opportunities for alternative sustainable economic income generation.

TI Public perception of development issues: impact of water pollution on a
   small coastal community
SO OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB Public participation has been recommended as an effective way to achieve sustainable development and a sound development policy should reflect the needs and the desires of the local community. To achieve effective public participation, a full understanding of public attitudes with regard to environmental/development issues is essential. We conducted a survey to study public attitudes and perceptions concerning coastal water pollution in Holbox Island, Quintana Roo State, Mexico and report our survey results together with the local inhabitants own ideas about how the development of the island should proceed. Results show that local inhabitants did not perceive that water pollution is a serious menace to their coastal community and most would be willing to participate in long-term water quality monitoring. A majority of the people interviewed do not want urbanisation and tourist development on Holbox Island, preferring instead to promote conservation of natural environment/resources and preservation of traditional local culture, suggesting that a policy of well-planned, moderate development would be the best strategy for this area. Our study has shown that environmental education and public awareness campaigns are useful tools for providing important local players with essential knowledge regarding environmental and social issues, thereby enabling policy makers to incorporate the desires of the local inhabitants in making the appropriate choices for preservation and development of Holbox Island and its surrounding ecosystems.

TI Community-based ecotourism management moving towards sustainability, in
   Ventanilla, Oaxaca, Mexico
SO OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB Community-based ecotourism is an option for rural development, but few cases have shown this to be sustainable. This paper assesses the sustainability of the Ventanilla community-based ecotourism management (CBEM) project, located in the South Pacific coast of Mexico. Families were surveyed with semi-structured and structured interviews, carried out in 1999 and 2000, respectively, in order to obtain the socio-demographic profile of the community, the natural resources and services exploited and the socio-economic relevance derived from the latter. The results obtained permitted identification of sustainable indicators such as, community cohesion, benefit sharing equity, commitment for conservation and management, within the political, social, economic and environmental context. The Ventanilla analysis is innovative in that it takes an integrated coastal management perspective for assessing CBEM using sustainable indicators. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

ID ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; MANAGEMENT; VALUATION; BENEFITS
AB This review article examines the importance of valuing environmental resources in the context of sustainable development. The different values stemming from ocean and coastal resources, relevant methodologies and issues raised by valuation approaches are reviewed. The authors then present practical policy-relevant valuation examples, and conclude by outlining progress since 1992 and remaining challenges. It is argued that while the Rio summit has shifted somewhat the emphasis from classical cost-benefit analysis to safe minimum standards through the adoption of the precautionary principle, economic valuation still provides useful information to decision-makers and should be part of a holistic decision-making process. It should be recognised, however, that although valuation techniques have been refined and linked to reliability protocols, they remain imperfect and for some commentators controversial. Further progress is needed on assigning monetary values but also on decision-making systems that better integrate monetary, social, and natural science criteria. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB Shipping and ports are major factors in coastal and ocean development and have significant direct and indirect impacts on coasts and oceans. Transportation systems and particularly international shipping have always influenced coastal settlement and economic development activities. The emergence of issues, such as biodiversity protection, biosecurity and climate change, mandate a more integrated approach to dealing with ocean-based activities, such as shipping. However, the maritime industry-shipping and ports-is internally fragmented and both are isolated from the contemporary integrated coastal and ocean discussion and practice, despite their impact on coastal and ocean activity. This article argues that the maritime sector is a key factor in effective integrated marine ecosystem development and protection and should take a leadership role. However, there needs to be increased capacity to do so. Education and training relevant to sustainable development and integrated management practice needs to be widely and methodically available, particularly in the initial stages of Maritime Education and Training (MET) where professional values and practices are developed. Marine and maritime education should be integrated with a view to preparing people to work in an environment in which there is a wider range of actors and activities involved in matters relating to the impact of the shipping industry on coastal development and preservation. There needs to be education to encourage reflective thinking and human relations skills development for both on shore and seagoing personnel. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The Agenda 21, the major document outcoming from the conference at Rio 1992, includes Chapter 17, where the challenge for an appropriate management of the Ocean and Coastal ecosystems, was addressed. This paper attempts to analyze the Latin American experiences and perspectives to accomplish the goals for human resource development needed for the sustainable management of Oceans and Coasts according to the Agenda 21. To do so, the following topics have been developed: (i) short review on the status of the scientific research and formation in Latin America, (ii) analysis of the major trends and patterns for educational partnership in Marine Sciences and Technology in the region, (iii) examination of the areas of the Chapter 17 that have been best accomplished in the region, (iv) examples of bilateral efforts between European and Latin American institutions for regional scientific development, (v) main problems for establishing educational partnerships on Oceans and Coastal issues. Finally, some initiatives for a plan of action, are proposed. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The establishment in 1960 of UNESCO's Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission, and in early 80s, of United Nations Environment Program (UNEP)s Caribbean Environmental Program, constituted an unquestionable and strategic step forward in the promotion, development and strengthening of marine sciences in the Caribbean Region. This was a fundamental factor for coastal and marine resources management. Caribbean experiences demonstrate that scientific and capacity building programs for sustainable development are important factors for cooperation and integration, both at national and international levels. The experience demonstrates also that the only viable solution at short and medium terms is to achieve a true spirit of coordination and association. This would certainly allow the region to reach a "sustainable regional capacity", by means of which collective answers would meet the national and regional problems. This concept is an essential complement in the process of international cooperation in an era marked by economic and social globalization. The viability of coastal areas research is sustained not only on national capacity but also on the actual level of human and institutional integration, and on the one that can be reached in the future. Then, it is possible to conclude that within the next 10 years, science and society will have to face serious challenges in marine and coastal issues. Overcoming these challenges will allow the society to achieve: a wise and ecologically sustainable use of coastal areas; a real holistic approach in marine and coastal issues; qualitative and quantitative improvement in communication, cooperation and coordination among individuals and institutions, economy sectors and local governments; the development of appropriate environmental education and culture in all sectors of society. And all this will result in integrated management of marine and coastal zones as an issue of strategic character and the very unique opportunity to reach sustainable development.

AB The coastal areas of the Northern Cape, South Africa, and the transfrontier region with Namibia are in a state of rapid transformation from a mining-based economy to one supporting diverse and sustainable livelihoods. Land-based diamond mining activities are in the early stages of decommissioning while a number of planning and development initiatives are underway. Key obstacles to integrated planning and development in the region are insufficient and inaccessible information. Knowledge management (KM) and information sharing mechanisms can facilitate meaningful participation and promote decision-making at the local level. The distance learning and information sharing tool is an internet based KM tool that promotes transparency and collaboration and provides open access to information resources for sustainable development.

   regionalisation - a post-modern dilemma

ID SEAS PROGRAM; MANAGEMENT
AB Essentially, this paper aims at considering how the ocean regionalisation may be implemented focusing on the principle of sustainable development, on the subsequent criteria designed by the inter-governmental organisation framework, and on the approaches from the scientific literature. In this respect, a model is proposed, according to which two main stages are identified: (i) the stage of the modern approach to the ocean, which was operated by the modern society and was supported by the culture of modernity; (ii) the stage of the postmodern approach, which has been triggered by the converging inputs from the changes in society and nature. The watershed between these two stages may be located in the 1970s. The investigation may be carried out considering a triangular relationship between (i) the changing ocean reality (ontological dimension), (ii) the representation of this reality (semiological dimension), and (iii) the building up of signified, consisting in theories, meta-theories and values (epistemological and ethical dimensions). In this framework, special relevance is attributed to the interaction between science and policy.
   Moving from this basis, how ocean regionalisation had been conceived by oceanography, geography and law is considered focusing on the implications that have arisen in terms of ocean management. Analysis is essentially focused on three questions: (i) how much the conceptual implications of the approach to the ocean regional scale have been underestimated, and how ample the political consequences have been; (ii) why the political designs referring to this spatial scale of the ocean, which have been carrying out since the 1970s, have been marked by a lack of consistency of the legal framework with the prospect of operating sustainable management programmes; (iii) whether, and what kind of, discrepancy has solidified between the legal framework, provided by the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), and the ecosystem-oriented approach to the ocean, designed by the UN Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED).
   These considerations lead to identify three cardinal needs. First, the need to try lessons from the Regional Seas Programme of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) by carrying out a critical analysis of the conceptual background and methodological endowment which it was based on, and of the subsequent political outcomes. Secondly, an increasing need for scientific approaches supported by the consideration of the ocean as a bi-modular system consisting in ecosystems and organisational patterns, being both modules subject to the impacts from global change and globalisation. Thirdly, a need to design and operate a more effective interaction between science and policy, and, as far as science in itself is concerned, the need to design a more epistemologically-sound interaction between natural and social disciplines.
   Moving from this discussion, it is proposed to distinguish the mere ocean area, where the organisational patterns have not yet created a real ocean system, from the ocean region, which differently has acquired the features of an ocean system. These two kinds of spaces may be found in the coastal milieu, extending up to the outer edge of the continental margin, in the deep-ocean, extending seawards from the continental margin, or they may extend across the continental margin and the deep-ocean. Where it is agreed that ocean reality may evolve on the basis of these two reference patterns, the following sequence of conceptual mises-au-point and statements may be considered.
   (.) The ocean area-This kind of ocean space may solidify in those areas where the ocean is frequented and used in the traditional ways without benefiting from a well-designed organisational pattern. Human presence and resource uses have brought about spatial differentiation but not such a real cohesion which may be only achieved by adopting an organisational plan.
   (.) The ocean region-This occurs only where an ocean area is endowed with such an organisational framework that allows the pursuit of clearly pre-determined objectives in terms of environmental, resource management, and economic development. This is the product of an extensive human interaction with the ocean ecosystem, and of a substantial political approach to the ocean milieu.
   Where it is agreed that ocean reality may evolve on the basis of these two reference patterns, the following sequence of conceptual mises-au-point and statements may be considered:
   (.) The ocean region and regional strategy-At the present time, ocean regions may be found only in quite limited parts of the ocean world.
   (.) The final objective-Where the decision-making centres conform their programmes and actions to the principles and guidelines from UNCED, the objective of each ocean region should be the pursuit of sustainable development on the regional scale.
   (.) Sustainable region-This occurs where the regional organisation is primarily based on the protection of the ecosystem integrity, where economic development operates through the optimisation of resource usage, and where social equity, including the access to the natural and cultural heritage of the ocean environment, is guaranteed.
   (.) Ocean regionalisation-When an individual ocean is subject to the organisational forces that lead to the creation of regions, it can be stated that an ocean regionalisation has occurred.
   (.) Global change-Ocean regionalisation should be viewed as one of the most important consequences of the global, environmental and social change that characterises the present phase of society.
   (.) Globalisation-The setting up of a transport and communication global network, together with the associated establishment of global production and consume patterns, of market strategies and social behaviour, may be regarded as the cardinal set of socio-economic factors, which ocean regionalisation is going to increasingly depend on.
   (.) Enlargement of the geographical approach-The development of ocean regions encourages to set up effective inter-disciplinary approaches, that primarily should focus on: (i) the consistency of the regional organisation with the regional objectives; (ii) the consistency of the ocean resource use with the protection of the ecosystem, primarily the safeguard of its biodiversity, productivity and resilience; and (iii) the configuration and functions of the decision-making system in guiding regional organisation.
   (.) Ocean region and ecosystem-The most desirable conditions in terms of optimal ocean organisation on the regional scale occur where the spatial extent of the ocean, which is encompassed by an individual regional management programme, fully coincides with the spatial extent of an ocean ecosystem, or with a set of contiguous ecosystems.
   (.) Decision-making systems-The more the co-operative process between decision-making systems operating in contiguous ocean regions develops, the greater the potential for a holistic political approach to the oceans becomes. The spatial consequences deriving from the interaction between the decision-making centres are of peculiar interest. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Concepts of security are no longer limited to the military form, but other potential, economic, ecological, social aspects are becoming included.
   Emphasis needs to be put on integration of all dimensions of security. Many environmental problems present threats to human health and welfare and hence to the well-being of nations. The environmental issues cannot be ignored in context of any comprehensive security concept, but environmental security should not be treated in isolation.
   Integration of sustainable development and regional security may address many of the current maritime issues. Such integration may best be handled jointly and at regional levels.
   With this in mind and the realization that there is now a clear awareness and understanding that issues such as poverty, underdevelopment, population growth, environmental quality and sustainable resource use, are interrelated and interdependent and must be dealt with as such, the paper aims to highlight some aspects of regional security and sustainable development issues with reference to the Mediterranean basin. The aim is to initiate a process to pursue integration of sustainable development and comprehensive regional security with focus on the Mediterranean.
   The approach is based on the concept of the Common Heritage of Mankind as proposed by Arvid Pardo in 1967. It has 4 dimensions: economic; ethical; environmental; peace and security. In dealing with the proposal of Arvid Pardo the United Nations General Assembly decided to split up the concept: the Conference on the Law of the Sea was to deal with the peaceful uses of oceans and sea-beds; the Conference on Disarmament with the security aspects, then considered as military. UNCED 92 maintained the separation in addressing only environment and development, with management also included. However, peace and security were not included. It is time now to include these elements, and also consider the enforcement issue. The paper aims at illustrating this need through some examples from the Mediterranean basin.

AB Continued over-fishing in the face of scientific warnings, fishing down food webs, destruction of habitat, and accelerated pollution loading-especially nitrogen export-have resulted in significant degradation to coastal and marine ecosystems of both rich and poor nations. Fragmentation among institutions, international agencies, and disciplines, lack of cooperation among nations sharing marine ecosystems, and weak national policies, legislation, and enforcement all contribute to the need for a new imperative for adopting ecosystem-based approaches to managing human activities in these systems in order to avoid serious social and economic disruption. The global environment facility (GEF) has been approached by developing countries in overwhelming numbers for assistance in securing the futures of their shared large marine ecosystems (LMEs). This paper describes GEF supported processes being used to assist them in adopting a science-driven, ecosystem-based approach to the management of human activities affecting coastal and marine ecosystems and linked freshwater basins. At risk are renewable goods and services valued at $10.6 trillion per year. A total of 10 LME projects I involving 72 countries have been approved by the GEF Council, and another 7 LMEs involving 54 countries have GEF international waters projects under preparation. A five-module assessment and management methodology is being tested that moves the countries toward adopting practical joint governance institutions through place-based management. This LME approach engages stakeholders, fosters the participation of the science community, and leads to the development of adaptive management institutions. Comprehensive initiatives in four LMEs are described. The importance is underscored for establishing and coordinating partnerships between the North and South for specific LMEs and their linked watersheds. These coordinated North-South partnerships significantly augment, Catalytic interventions made by the GEF leading to reforms and investments that are helping make the transition to sustainable development.

AB The Arctic Council is an intergovernmental forum for the Arctic states, which have an outreach beyond the Arctic circle. It is a unique international regime for cooperation among governments and indigenous peoples. The Arctic Council has a very light administration and no obligatory funding. The Host Country of the Council provides a Secretariat and serves as a hub in a network in active operation. Projects are administered by a lead partner, often a Member State or a Indigenous people's organisation. Most of the work is done in Working Groups of Experts. In 1998, The Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme delivered a science-based Assessment Report on Arctic Pollution Issues. This report has influenced strongly on the global negotiations on persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and heavy metals. The Stockholm Convention on POPs 2001 is a significant step forward for the protection of the Arctic environment and for people living in the Arctic, who are dependent on harvesting as a central source of livelihood. The Arctic Council has adopted a Regional Plan of Action, which follows the UNEP methodology on the Protection of the Marine Environment from land-based activities. In June 2001, a report on the status and conservation of Flora and Fauna was delivered to the Arctic Council by the experts, who were requested to prepare recommendations on biodiversity conservation on the basis of the status report. The most important project for the time being is the Arctic Climate Impact Assessment. Close to 200 climate scientific experts from I I countries are participating in the project, which will deliver its final report in 2004. Science-based decision making is an Arctic Council brand. In addition, the Council takes into account traditional knowledge provided by indigenous peoples. The overall goal is to enhance sustainable development in the Arctic. The Council contributes to a better knowledge base for decision-making. Political recommendations are agreed upon unanimously. Much of the implementation is done by the member states themselves and appropriate international organisations. The ambition is to integrate sustainable development principles into all activities and projects under the auspices of the Arctic Council. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The Paper presents the regional perspective on the conditions and efforts for the integrated coastal management (ICM) that exist in the Wider Caribbean Region (WCR).
   The Caribbean Action Plan was adopted in 1981 with an initial workplan of activities of evaluation and control of marine pollution, evaluation of impacts on the coastal area, fishing studies, watershed management, evaluation of natural hazard effects, energy accounting systems studies, urbanisation of the coastal area, building capacity and training. The Convention for the Protection and Development of the Marine Environment of the WCR is the only regional legal framework for the protection and sustainable development of marine resources.
   The Paper describes some region-wide ICM-related programme initiated or supported by the CEP as well as actions at the national level. Other ICM-related general activities and training programmes of CEP are also presented.
   Trends in national policies in ICM and current developments and issues are also highlighted and recommendations made. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This article reviews the potential benefits and shortcomings of the Convention for the Conservation and Management of Highly Migratory Fish Stocks in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean adopted in September 5, 2000, in Hawaii. The research findings rely on a detailed review of the negotiation process and the protracted debates between member states of the Forum Fishery Agency (FFA) and distant water fishing nations. The importance of this Convention for the long-term sustainability of the Pacific tuna stocks is emphasized in light of existing global fisheries instruments and regional mechanisms of cooperation whose limitations are outlined.

AB Although much information exists on the role of non-human mammals (both terrestrial and marine) on seashores and in maritime terrestrial environments, it is widely scattered in the literature. This review represents the first attempt to draw this disjointed information together. The reasons for past neglect are several: in some habitats, e.g. temperate rocky shores, such interactions are genuinely of relatively minor significance and have typically been ignored; the focus of marine mammal research on land has generally been ethological, not synecological; and the activity of small mammals, being predominantly nocturnal, passes largely unnoticed by (mostly) diurnal ecologists.
   Oceanic and inshore island populations are most at risk from introduced mammals. Cats, dogs, rats and mink are important predators of seabirds. Grazers such as goats and sheep cause coastal habitat degradation. Eradication of goats is especially important on islands and in faunas with high proportions of endemic species. Attention is focused below on mammalian involvement in ecological processes in a range of ecosystems: viz. salt marshes and shore meadows, sand dunes and machair, intertidal sand flats, shingle beaches, rocky shores, caves, cliffs, lava tubes, mangroves, seagrass and kelp beds and ice-edge habitats. Ecological observations on Marsupialia, Insectivora, Chiroptera, Lagomorpha, Rodentia, Cetacea, Carnivora, Sirenia, Perissodactyla, Artiodactyla and Primates are presented. Contemporary issues involving coastal mammals (particularly livestock husbandry) are collated, namely marine pollution by nutrient outwash (eutrophication), microbiological water quality, radioactivity and the impact of climate change and sea-level rise (particularly on ice-edge and saltmarsh habitats).
   Any exploitation of shores by terrestrial mammals has to be intermittent and cyclical on a tidal basis. Evictions of terrestrial mammals from feeding or nesting sites in coastal ecotone habitats may follow tidal or storm events, and can be locally catastrophic (generating carcasses for scavengers). Expanding mammalian populations on islands run the risk of exhausting food resources and starving, especially in winter. Certain marine mammals, however, like manatees, dugongs and bottle-nosed dolphins, may exploit the intertidal zone during its periodic immersion at high tide. The role of mammals, particularly grazing livestock, is much greater in saltmarsh and sand-dune ecosystems (including machair habitats) than in the intertidal zone. Occasional strandings of cetaceans or deaths of seals, particularly neonates, provide intermittent bounties of energy for opportunistic scavengers like foxes, hyenas, jackals or bears (even humans in isolated situations), depending on location. Other coastal energy bounties come in the form of turtle and iguana nests raided for eggs by foxes, raccoons and mongooses. Bearded pigs may also intercept hatchlings on their way to the sea. Fringing densely wooded hinterlands, shorelines and beaches form unobstructed highways for larger animals and may, historically, have played an important role in facilitating their post-glacial dispersal. The importance of productive shorelines for foraging by grazing, predatory and scavenging mammals will be magnified along bleak hinterlands, for example, desert coasts. The sea otter and giant kelp story has become an ecological paradigm reinforcing the need for better understanding of the ramifications through ecosystems of changes to the status of keystone species. Bats and flying foxes, for instance, are key species in mangrove ecosystems, as essential pollinators. Some bats catch fishes. Accumulated bat droppings may be important sources of nutrients under roost sites.
   Chemical interactions (social signalling) between mammals in coastal situations are largely unknown. This and several other areas of relative ignorance (suitable for modem techniques like radio tracking, appropriately designed enclosure/exclosure experimentation, habitat restoration and pest eradication) are highlighted as requiring future research. Habitat management and sustainability at this important boundary would be improved if the effects of, and implications for, mammals were considered.

AB Five years ago the problems being addressed by major educational resources were how to locate and structure a burgeoning universe of Web sites in order to serve their subject and professional communities with useful and relevant content. Today, new challenges, demands and opportunities are emerging: the linking of content with community, static information with dynamic news. Describes the evolution of three educational resources in the social sciences (SOSIG, Biz/Ed and Regard) and their use of personal profiling, distributed contributions and RSS news channels to serve and gather information. Examines the issues that arise from changing user bases and technologies, sustainability and the need for collaboration, data protection and privacy concerns. Analyses the tensions these and other services face as they move toward a model that links the static with the dynamic, content with community.

ID NUMBER
AB In consequence of accelerated applications of new land-use systems, agricultural landscape research is challenged to provide results on their sustainability. Studies on biodiversity that are carried out with minimal sampling programs have become increasingly popular. However, concerning insects, the observed number of species in these studies underestimates the true species richness. In such studies, the non-parametric estimators might provide a more reliable tool to gain information about the true species richness. The objective of this paper is to evaluate how accurately and precisely estimates of species richness in studies with few pitfall samples correlate with those of studies with higher sampling intensity. This indicates how much effort could be saved in collecting data on species richness of insect communities.
   The species richness of carabid beetles at ten temporary wetlands in the East-German agricultural landscape was surveyed by nine pitfall traps per site. Estimates of species richness were calculated in scenarios with four, five or six pitfall traps per site. The observed number of species and the non-parametric estimators, Chao2, Bootstrap, Jacknife1 and Jacknife2, were included in the study to estimate species richness in each scenario, respectively. The estimates in the scenarios were compared with estimations based on the whole data set. While Chao2 was the most accurate and precise estimator, the Bootstrap estimator performed only slightly better than the number of observed species. Jacknifel and 2 performed intermediately. Only Chao2 performed more precisely than the observed number of species. In conclusion, the number of samples might be reduced to five or six pitfall traps per site in studies carried out in small habitats with minimal sampling programs. The non-parametric estimators provide possibilities to carry out studies on species richness with reduced sampling efforts as well as, to gain more reliable information on species richness re-analyzing studies already carried out.

AB This paper distinguishes short- and long-term financing problems in social health insurance systems in Germany and other European countries. The first part focuses on recent healthcare reforms in Germany that are directed at short-term problems, in particular measures of cost containment in the pharmaceutical sector such as the introduction of a drug formulary and reforms in the system of risk adjustment to enhance competition between sickness funds. The second part discusses the likely effects of the aging of the population on the sustainability of present types of mandatory insurance coverage in Germany and possible reforms that could solve the problems. It is argued that the proposed distinction between basic and supplementary benefits requires a system of explicit rationing (e.g. by age), which determines the package of basic benefits several decades in advance.

AB The management of water resources is best done on an integrated catchment basis; taking into account the impact of pollution on available water quantity and quality. A study was done from June 2000 to March 2001 in Harare, Zimbabwe, to establish major water and nutrient flows in the Chivero subcatchment area. Lake Chivero is part of the major water supply source for Harare and is located downstream. Discharges from sewage treatment works, urban and rural agriculture, and industries, have caused a severe stress on water quality of the eutrophic lake. The study quantified major water flows through gauging stations on rivers, current metering, and hydrological modelling. Flows for raw water abstractions; sewage and water treatment works were obtained from continuous metering and pumping readings. Water samples were collected monthly for sewage, rivers and Lake Chivero, and analysed according to standard methods. Water and nutrient balances were developed. The results showed that urban water demand would exceed available treatment capacity by the year 2003. Sewage effluent presently is the major source of nutrients in the rivers. The absence of adequate flushing of the lake gives rise to accumulation of the nutrients in the lake. It was concluded that the current situation is not sustainable. It was recommended that the next water supply source be found outside the catchment so that its water can help flush the lake, and that sewage be treated to higher standards (without any pasture irrigation) and discharged directly into the rivers for recycling. The other alternative is to recycle the nutrients in controlled urban agriculture, thereby reducing fertiliser runoff. Stricter regulations and regular monitoring was recommended to control industrial pollution. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID CATCHMENT MANAGEMENT
AB Air, land and water are the three fragile components of the Spaceship Earth. These three components are highly integrative resources and therefore, must be properly planned and managed in order to ensure adequate public health, food supplies and transportation. The quality of life is directly dependent on how well these resources are planned and managed for sustainable development. The above three resources are highly integrated and thus the need for multi-purpose water resources planning and management: Multi-purpose water resources planning and management also emerged as a result of an increase in competing and conflicting water uses and due to rapid population growth and rising expectations of a better life.
   This paper discusses the conventional and integrated water resource planning and management approaches for sustainable development. The author agues that, both approaches if implemented very well are geared to deliver the same end results 'sustainable development'. However, the paper concludes that, both approaches have failed to deliver the end results due to a missing link. This missing link in both approaches is the institutional framework that coordinates water resources planning and management responsibilities and activities at all levels of government.

DE access to water; water inequity; water institutions; inappropriate
   tariffs; productive
AB In southern Africa, gross disparities in access to water are symptomatic of the overall uneven pattern of development. Despite post-independence egalitarian rhetoric, in countries such as Zambia and Zimbabwe inappropriate models (piped house connections in the urban areas, high technology irrigation schemes in the agricultural sector), combined with weak macro-economies and poorly formulated sectoral policies have actually exacerbated the disparities. Zero or very low tariffs have played a major role in this. Although justified as being consistent with water's special status, inadequate tariffs in fact serve to undermine any programme of making water accessible to all. This has led to a narrowing of development options, resulting in exclusivist rather than inclusivist development, and stagnation rather than dynamism.
   A major part of the explanation for perpetuation of such unsatisfactory outcomes is the existence of political interest groups who benefit from the status quo. The first case study in the paper involves urban water consumers in Zambia, where those with piped water connections seek to continue the culture of low tariffs which is by now deeply embedded. The result is that the water supply authorities (in this case the newly formed, but still politically constrained 'commercialised utilities') are unable even to maintain adequate supplies to the piped customers, let alone extend service to the peri-urban dwellers, 56% of whom do not have access to safe water. The paper outlines some modest, workable principles to achieve universal, affordable access to water in the urban areas, albeit through a mix of service delivery mechanisms.
   In a second case study of rural productive water in Zimbabwe, the reasons for only 2% of the rural subsistence farming households being involved in formal small-scale irrigation schemes 20 years after independence are explored. Again, a major part of the explanation lies in government pursuing a water delivery model which is not affordable or sustainable on a wide scale. Its provision, via substantial capital and recurrent subsidies, for a small group has a large opportunity cost for society as a whole. The small-scale irrigators have a vested interest in ensuring that the subsidies are maintained, but in the process continue to absorb a disproportionate amount of resources which could be used for development elsewhere. By choosing simpler, cheaper water technologies, and assisting farmers with growing and marketing high value crops, the resources could instead be used to benefit a much larger proportion of households. With well designed programmes aimed at achieving equity, large numbers of subsistence farmers could improve their incomes and start working their way out of poverty. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

DE participation; stakeholder; water resources management; gender
AB The 1998 Zimbabwe Water Act introduced the ideas of 'lowest appropriate authority' in the management of water resources. To this end, the country has been divided into seven catchments. This new set-up is intended to achieve efficiency, accountability and sustainability through stakeholder participation. This paper critically examines the way in which the idea of 'stakeholder participation' has been operationalised in the new water reform process. We examine recent experiences of participation in the creation and operation of the new water management structure, in particular Catchment Councils in Zimbabwe, and argue against an uncritical or atheoretical understanding of 'participation'. To simply assume that inclusivist language translates into wider benefits for society is to ignore the profoundly political nature of the entire water reform process. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB Society derives a wide array of important benefits from biodiversity and the ecosystems in which it exists. These ecosystem services are essential to human existence and operate on such an overarching scale, and in such intricate and little-explored ways, that most could not be replaced by technology. Accordingly, approaches to integrated water resources management (IWRM) do not regard the ecosystem as a "user" of water in competition with other users, but as the base from which the resource is derived and upon which development is planned. A goal of IWRM should be to maintain, and whenever necessary, restore ecosystem health and biodiversity.
   Achieving the sustainable use of water resources and thus the maintenance of ecosystem services requires a rediscovery of the hydrological cycle and the water resources system. Such a rediscovery could;
   . identify characteristics that are critical to the provision of ecosystem services with emphasis on biophysical, economic, social and environmental characteristics and linkages in the system,
   . provide improved understanding of the behaviour of the interactions of the system, leading to the ability to provide cause and effect predictions and ultimately,
   . manage the water resources system guided by both biophysical and socio-economic indicators, end-points and value systems applicable to this rediscovery.
   In this paper, the concept of an ecosystem approach to the management of water resources is assessed in the light of a reanalysis of the hydrological cycle. The approach to maintenance of ecosystem functioning in South Africa through the so-called Resource Directed Measures is considered in the light of this assessment. It is concluded that there is a danger that, traditional command and control approaches to management of the water resources system will continue to be applied under the banner of IWRM and that this will result in the failure of natural systems to sustain the provision of ecosystem goods and services.

AB While groundwater is a small component of water resources in South Africa it plays a significant role in irrigation water supply at more localized scales. Aquifer yields are generally low, ranging from less than 1-20 l/s, with most of the aquifers yielding near to the lower end of the scale. The Dendron dolomitic aquifer in the Northern Province of South Africa is a high potential one by local standards, with yields of about 20 l/s. Some boreholes in the area yield much higher than the average 20 l/s. The aquifer has been the sole source of irrigation water for commercial agriculture for more than 20 years. In the eighties groundwater levels were observed to be declining due to over-abstraction. This trend has continued to the present with current water levels averaging about 50-100 m below ground, a drop of more than 50 m in the last 30 years. In 1991 the Department of Water Affairs and Forestry informed farmers that a management strategy would be required to ensure sustainable use of groundwater. Several steps to manage groundwater were taken. Although users are of the opinion that groundwater levels have been increasing, in fact the rate of groundwater level decrease has been increasing. This paper discusses the effect of cropping pattern and irrigation management changes on groundwater levels. The implications of different water management strategies on the sustainability of groundwater-supported agriculture are analysed and recommendations made. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB The aquatic weed situation in the Kafue River in Zambia continues to be a major challenge to the sustainable utilization of the water resources of the river. The general methods for managing the weeds, especially the water hyacinth, include use of bio-agents, chemicals, mechanical and physical approaches. These have had very little impact. This paper reports on a project that is investigating weed management strategies which involve use of cleaner production (CP) approach and the utilization of the weed for economic purposes. In addition, the ecological implications of these methods are being assessed.
   Effluent assessments indicated that apart from nitrates and phosphates, other effluent parameters met the Environmental Council of Zambia standards. Results further show that all the 24 areas surveyed for CP have uncontrolled socio-economic activities which generate both point and non-point sources of pollution that enter the water bodies. To minimize pollution, efforts include devising policy and technical strategies with the involvement of the affected riparian community. Production of mushroom by the communities using the water hyacinth substrate has been demonstrated. Up to 2.1 kg of mushroom was harvested from a single flush" over a period of 4-5 weeks. Vegetables grown on soils treated with water hyacinth manure performed better than those grown using commercial fertiliser. The economics of the production are however, yet to be confirmed. If weed usage is proven economically and ecologically viable, the riverine community is envisaged to play a big role in aquatic weed management.
   High numbers of invertebrates known to be sensitive to pollution have been recorded in the weed-infested Kafue River implying that the water is of "good" quality for these aquatic invertebrates. This observed quality of water may be due to water hyacinth playing a role by sieving pollutants from the river. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Integrated water resources management (IWRM) is viewed by policy makers and practitioners as facilitating the achievement of a balance between water resource use and resource protection, and the resolution of water-related conflicts. The IWRM approach has found particular use in the new water policies of Southern African countries such as Zimbabwe, where water scarcity, after the land question, is perceived to be a major threat to political, economic, social, military and environmental security. Ultimately, IWRM is seen as providing a framework towards ensuring broader security at the local, national, regional and global levels. However, the pilot phase implementation of the new water policy in the various regional countries has revealed that although the legal and institutional frameworks have been put in place, the implementation of the IWRM approach has tended to be problematic (J. Latham, 2001; GTZ, 2000; Leestemaker, 2000; Savenige and van der Zaag, 2000; Sithole, 2000).
   This paper adopts a case study approach and empirically examines the institutional challenges of implementing the IWRM approach in the post-pilot phase of Zimbabwe's new water policy. The focus is mainly on the institutional arrangements surrounding the Pungwe-Mutare Water Supply Project located within the Save Catchment Area in Eastern Zimbabwe. The major findings of the study are that, while there persist some problems associated with the traditional management approach, there have also emerged new challenges to IWRM. These mainly relate to the transaction costs of the water sector reforms, institutional resilience, stakeholder participation, and the achievement of the desired outcomes. There have also been problems emanating from unexpected political developments at the local and national levels, particularly with regard to the government's "fast track" land resettlement programme. The paper concludes that there is a need for a more rigorous effort towards integrating the management of water resources by the catchment level institutions.

AB Air pollutants change plant metabolism, yield, crop quality, soil fertility, temperature regimes and hydrology. Type of air pollutants, deposition rate and structure of ecosystem bias the effects on agriculture. Increased CO2 concentrations generally cause positive effects through increased root mass, litter and crop residues thereby increasing soil organic matter and plant growth. Accelerated CO2 concentrations are associated with higher temperatures entailing negative effects on soils. The reduction Of SO2 emissions has a major effect on the productivity of agricultural crops (yield losses, reduced natural resistance, increased non point N losses, increase of surface ozone concentration). N depositions contribute indirectly to N2O emission through an increased amount of N in the nutrient balance. Deposition of ammonia compounds is a primary cause of soil acidification. Ammonia contributes to transboundary air pollution and nitrogen enrichment of nutrient-poor soils. Air pollutants affect agriculture and may endanger a sustainable crop production. That is inconsistent with the requirement to protect the natural resources soil, water, atmosphere, and energy.

AB Agroforestry affords diversification and intensification of farming systems through the integration of indigenous trees such as canarium (Canarium schweinfurthii [Burseraceae]) which produce marketable products. Although biodiversity in agrosystems is one of the cornerstones of sustainability, little is known about the colonizing organisms of the species introduced. A study was carried out in six Divisions of the grassfields of Cameroon in order to identify the most common epiphytes and parasites of the canarium tree. Sixteen species of vascular epiphytes were recorded, of which 93.75% were holoepiphytes and 6.25% hemiepiphytes. Of the different families encountered, Orchidaceae represented 62.50%, Polypodiaceae 25%, and Davalliaceae and Cactaceae each only 6.25%. In the grassfields of Cameroon, the distribution patterns of vascular epiphytes vary in two ways. Horizontally, there is a significant difference between divisions (P<0.001). Microsorium punctatum and Rhipsalis baccifera were specific to Menoua Division and Microcoelia macrorrhynchia to Mezam Division. Vertically, there is also significant variation from the tree base to the canopy (P<0.001), the lower and middle canopy being the preferred positions. Four species of parasites were recorded: Ficus thonningii, Ficus vallis-choudae (Moraceae), Hymenodyction floribundum (Rubiaceae) and Tapinanthus loranthus (Loranthaceae). The Moraceae and Rubiaceae prefer the basal and lower trunk, whereas the Loranthaceae prefer the lower and upper canopy of the tree. The parasites, in contrast to the epiphytes, lead to the death of the canarium tree.

ID ISSUES
AB The established practice of forest ecosystem inventory and monitoring is recognised as a main support for terrestrial natural renewable resource survey programmes. Inventory and monitoring programmes focused on an overall assessment of ecosystem attributes evolving into global environmental survey programmes have been devised, but implementation is still quite contradictory. The state-of-the-art is discussed here, with special reference to the European Union and Italy. Topical issues are reviewed, with selective concern to: remote sensing capability, probability sampling, forest type (habitat) classification and landscape ecology sustainable management indicators. Benefits brought by information technology are highlighted. Its development and the implementation of approaches based on a sound "per habitat" landscape ecological perspective will bring unique benefits, thus leading to an effective integration among sector surveys aimed at global environmental inventory/monitoring.

AB Recent studies have shown that growth rates of Pinus sylvestris, Picea abies and Fagus sylvatica in Europe has increased. Average volume growth rate has increased by around +50% and height growth rate by around +10%. This paper attempts to match this size of growth change to those that have been reported after experimental manipulation of certain environmental forcing agents, that are known to have changed recently (CO2; anthropogenic N; changes in temperature or rainfall and recovery from past forest utilisation). It concludes that it is unlikely that any one agent alone is capable of consistently and solely increasing growth rates to the levels observed. Thus the cumulative growth gains probably arise as a result of a combination of factors. Given the difficulty of experimenting on large trees, the paper advances a series of hypotheses, which might be used to separate the relative impacts of each agent through field-based studies. The consequences for sustainable forest management are two-fold. In the first place what constitutes sustainability is obviously dynamic and affected by management. Sustainable levels of production set in the immediate post-war years would have been lower than is the case today. Indeed, in Europe that is largely what has happened. Partly as a result, the harvest in Europe is today 70% or less of what is really sustainable. In the second place, we need to be aware of the likely human factor in the recently accelerated growth rate. It seems likely that at least a component of the recovery in growth rates is due to the cessation of deleterious practices grazing, litter-raking, charcoal-burning.

AB Sustainable forest management is described, in theory and in practice, especially in the regions where the forest resources have been damaged seriously for economic development. It emphasizes the need to exert the multi-functions of forest ecosystems. The paper analyses the main benefits and constraints of sustainable forest management with regard to the special natural and economic conditions of China. According to the basic principles of sustainable forest management, China has been taking the relevant actions. Six national programmes and participatory forest management for forest resources utilisation and conservation are operative as regional implementation strategies. Demonstrations, with 13 sample sites in different typical regions, and 8 Criteria and 80 Indicators based on the Montreal Process for monitoring and assessment of sustainable forest management at the national level, have been established and tested. Biological diversity conservation, plantation management for timber production natural forest protection, non-wood products and technical training will become the priorities for sustainable forest management in China.

AB During the last decade, the concept of ecosystem management has increasingly influenced forestry practice, but in different ways on federal and private forests. In western Oregon, about two thirds of federal land is reserved for non-commodity use and federal forest managers follow a strict path of ecosystem management. Stands are managed to retain or develop structural complexity and species diversity while landscapes are managed to mimic natural disturbance patterns. On private lands, state and federal regulations and incentives such as Habitat Conservation Plans (HCP) and green certification influence how private forestlands are managed. Large industrial owners continue to focus on timber production within the limits of state and federal laws, with some adopting HCP's that increase landscape planning and landscape diversity. Small private forest managers are more likely to define sustainable forestry in terms of balancing ecological requirements defined in state and federal laws against their aesthetic preferences and how to derive income from their forest. Some have chosen green certification as a way to assure themselves, neighbors and perhaps wood buyers that they are practicing sustainable forestry. At a landscape level these differences are sometimes complimentary. For example, late successional wildlife species are provided for on federal lands, while early successional wildlife species are provided for on large private land. The patch size for disturbance can be large on federal (50-1000 ha) lands where large contiguous areas are designated as late successional reserves or wilderness. Patch size tends to be medium on state and large private (20-50 ha) and small on small private (2-30 ha) forestland. Because ecosystem management varies by forest type and management objectives it is unlikely that the practices adopted in the Pacific Northwest will be applicable in all regions of the world.

AB Involving the public in government decision making regarding sustainable development is a complex and difficult problem. This article suggests that weak public consultation, occurring at the operational planning level, is in part responsible for the lack of policy innovation in this realm. A case study technique considers approaches to public consultation in the development of sustainable development policy in the Canadian province of Manitoba. Using document reviews and qualitative interviews, two specific periods of policy development are traced with the outcomes of each being measured against creative consultative approaches established in the literature. It is revealed that using more complex consultative approaches at the normative policy planning level results in a number of positive implications, including mutual education and learning, participant satisfaction, policy innovation that has broad-based support, and results that have lasting implications on consultative processes.

AB Microbial polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) reserve polymers are interesting polyesters that can be sustainably produced by biotechnological means from a variety of renewable substrates. By feeding cosubstrates to selected cultures of prokaryotic microorganisms composition, structure and therefore physical properties of the PHAs can be influenced during their biotechnological production. Cheap substrates stemming from agricultural waste and surplus streams have to be used in order reduce product costs to a level similar to that of conventional plastics. Continuous production in combinations of a stirred tank reactor for microbial growth and a tubular plug flow reactor for PHA accumulation in the microbial biomass form the ideal production system. PHA is accumulated within the producing cells and has to be extracted. A system of chloroform, ethanol and water allows reusing the extracting solvent chloroform without prior redistillation.

AB There is no proof that a new paradigm of economic theory has been enthroned, rending old economic laws invalid. According to followers of the new paradigm, knowledge creation transformed into new products of information industries should bring increasing returns, accelerate growth to rates unseen in the past, ensure low inflation with full employment, and free the economy from the business cycle. They see a productivity increase of 3 - 4 % annually as sustainable in the long run. Critics of the now paradigm argue that productivity increase in the USA in the last decade was predominantly cyclical and will not be sustainable, that the information technologies so far had little positive impact on the rest of the economy, and that the business cycle is far from being dead.

AB In this paper I first discuss the group of potential determinants of current account development according to surveyed empirical and theoretical literature. In this respect I strive to introduce several alternatives of each variable effect on current account if it is possible. I follow with the formation of the current account model suitable for the Czech Republic. Estimating the model, I employ cointegration techniques ADL and JOH as vast majority of variables in this model is integrated of order I(1). I find significant and robust influence of the domestic economic growth, the stages of development hypothesis, the degree of openness of the economy and terms of trade on balance of current account. Further, I apply the logic of standard test of stability to analyze the notion of sustainability of current account deficit in the case of the Czech Republic in a context of time series.

AB A new solvent-free synthetic process of layered polymer crystals as novel organic intercalation materials from (Z, Z)-muconic acid is described. This process includes the monomer synthesis, topochemical polymerization, transformation to poly(muconic acid), and intercalation. Alkylammonium muconate monomers were prepared by grinding muconic acid and the corresponding alkylamines in a ceramic mortar without any solvent. Topochemical polymerization of the alkylammonium muconates in the crystalline state was carried out under UV irradiation with a high-pressure mercury lamp or sunlight. Transformation from poly(alkylammonium muconate) to poly(muconic acid) was achieved by thermolysis at 250degreesC under reduced pressure with a maintenance of their crystallinity. Intercalation of alkylamines into the polymer crystals proceeded by grinding poly(muconic acid) and alkylamine similar to the monomer synthesis. This process is a new type of polymer synthesis using green and sustainable materials and reactions as the solvent-free system.

AB The conversion of primary energy from nature and the subsequent utilization of the secondary forms of energy are basically related to the development of mankind; the production of heat-and light-used to be the main product of fuel utilization in the early days. However, the requirements of our society have changed due to an increase in population, prosperity, and widening of the essentials of life.
   In particular, the needs for high-value goods and products in our modem world are strongly associated with a growing demand in energy for stationary and mobile applications. Therefore, the major task of scientists and engineers over the previous almost two centuries was to develop essentially combustion technologies to convert available fossil fuels into heat, power, and electricity.
   In fact, in our modern society, electricity has become the major form of applicable energy with an increasing tendency over recent decades. While by the turn of the last century only 1% of all fossil primary energy was converted to electricity, this has grown worldwide to close to 40% and is expected to rise further in relation to the advances of the gross national product.
   The technology of fossil fuel conversion for heat and electricity production experienced major, distinct development periods based upon external driving forces as a consequence of changing requirements of our industrialized surroundings. Therefore, a strongly expanding economy with a corresponding demand for increasing capacities and plant availabilities was observed during the beginning of the second half of the last century. More recently, awareness of the negative effects of pollution has resulted in the development and application of emission control measures which were successfully implemented during previous decades.
   More recently, the discussion of energy utilization in connection with the global climate resulted in a reconsideration of the use of fossil fuels, and in particular in a diversification of the primary energy sources which opened a new field for research and development. Furthermore, the present tendencies of fiberalization of the energy markets in Europe and beyond and its consequences toward stronger cross-boundary competition lead again to new strategies and technological consequences in order to fulfill requirements such as a sustainable security of supply under environmentally acceptable conditions and at cost-competitive levels.
   After a review of the historical achievements in research and in technology development as a consequence of the changing needs of society, the presentation will concentrate on the present status of energy conversion followed by a detailed discussion of options and strategies in order to satisfy future market demands.

AB Biomass is a truly renewable, sustainable source of energy; in its firewood form, at least, it has always been humanity's primary fuel. Nevertheless, it is only in the very recent past that it has been regarded as a viable substitute in power generation for the fossil fuels that have caused most of the world's environmental pollution problems. This paper distinguishes between truly renewable, sustainable sources of fuel from agricultural sources, i.e. biomass, and the disposal of domestic, urban and hazardous waste in energy-from-waste (EfW) plants; although these differences may appear to be marginal, and any EfW plant is of value for power generation, there are particular reasons why the generation of power from genuine biomass reaps environmental benefits.
   The bulk of the paper discusses the generation of electric power from a variety of different biomass substances, some from purpose-grown 'energy crops' but mostly from 'agricultural residues'. While this is predominantly through conventional combustion systems with steam turbines, more recent experience of both gasification and pyrolysis, with power generation by other prime movers, such as gas turbines and reciprocating engines is also covered. The concluding section of the paper looks briefly at the relative benefits of combustion, gasification and pyrolysis and what the future is likely to hold for each of these technologies.

AB With the growing international consensus concerning the harmful health and environmental impact of fossil energy use, there is on the political level recognition of nuclear power's potential role in delivering large quantities of energy without releasing common environmental pollutants and greenhouse gases. The energy consumption in Korea has greatly increased with rapid economic growth and industrialization since 1970. The average annual growth rate was 8% in 1970s and more than 10% in 1980s and 1990s except during the '98 financial crisis.
   Due to the lack of domestic energy resource bases, the rapid economic growth and industrialization has to be supported by the imported energy. Thus, the imported energy dependence of total energy supply has rapidly increased from 47.5% in 1970 to 97.5% in 1997. The fossil fuels share of energy consumption grew up to 88.2% in 1997. This resulted to CO2 emission of 140 million ton-C, which account for 1.8% of world greenhouse gases emission. (MOCIE, 2000) Because of rapid industrialization, Korea has relatively higher energy intensive industries compared to most of the developed countries with 3.1 ton-C/capita and 0.49 ton-C/million Won.
   Thus, energy policy is being focused on the improvement of energy efficiency and optimum energy mix for the reduction of GHGs. At present, 16 units of Nuclear Power Plant are in operation, 6 units under construction. The nuclear share of electric power generation was 43% last year. This share will be increased up to more than 50% by 2015. In order to meet voluntary GHGs emission target, a drastic switching to non-carbon energy bases would be necessary.

AB Environmental harmonization of nuclear energy technology is considered as an absolutely necessary condition in its future successful development for peaceful use. Establishment of Self-Consistent Nuclear Energy System, that simultaneously meets four requirements - energy production, fuel production, burning of radionuclides and safety, strongly relies on the neutron excess generation. Implementation of external non-fission based neutron sources into fission energy system would open the possibility of approaching the Multi-Component Self-Consistent Nuclear Energy System (MC-SCNES) with unlimited fuel resources and zero radioactivity release. This provides strong evidence that nuclear energy could be considered as a base for the future sustainable growth in long perspective. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB The system of a fast reactor fed with natural uranium is discussed as a future sustainable energy producing system, concentrating especially on the waste problem. The following conclusions have been derived:
   1. When the reprocessing with very small leakage rate can be employed, the conventional fast reactor has a potential to confine all actinides in the core.
   2. The total toxicity of LLFPs is smaller but comparable to the toxicity of burned natural uranium with its daughters.
   3. When the isotope separation is employed for each LLFP, whole LLFPs can be incinerated using the conventional fast reactor system with natural uranium.
   4. When only the element separation is employed, the incineration of Pd-107 should be given up even by employing several design changes, but its toxicity is only 0.0002 of the incinerated uranium toxicity. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB This article analyses the 'partnership principle' - which is of particular importance for multilevel governance interpretations of European integration - as it evolved in EU regional policy-making. After sketching in the crucial analytical lines of the current debate on 'partnership' on the example of the implementation of the EU structural policy in Germany, I examine how it functions. A closer look at two important sub-fields of 'partnership' - 'societal participation' and 'policy evaluation' - reveals that theoretical expectations regarding its transforming potential, in terms of pitting supranational and subnational actors against central state authority and thereby circumventing the latter, have not materialized. On the contrary, recently rising resentment and out-and-out conflict between the European Commission and regional authorities so far point to theoretically unexpected limitations of 'partnership', calling into question whether it is an appropriate and sustainable inter-administrative co-ordination device - at least when viewed from the perspective of the EU multilevel governance thesis. In the light of the reported insights into the practice of 'partnership', this 'new mode of EU governance' thus needs to be reassessed.

ID PERSISTENCE
AB The article tries to incorporate "political corruption'' (top level corruption) into economic growth analysis. We propose a microeconomic framework. An agent of the public sector, who wants to optimize his cash flow resulting from budget misappropriations, will be highly sensitive to the instability related to his office. The natural equilibrium for the politician will be to fall into a 'high political instability - low growth' trap, in which corruption appears endemic. However, the control of corruption by society will be possible. We consider a model in which alternative politicians compete with the incumbent politician but benefit from a common political reputation. It is shown that this situation leads to "dynamic collective reputation'', which should restrain misappropriation practices. This theoretical framework will be useful in defining a "sustainable'' degree of political competition and in understanding the asymmetric effects of extrinsic shocks on the growth process.

AB Eucalyptus savannas on low nutrient soils are being extensively cleared in Queensland. In this paper we provide background information relevant to understanding nutrient (particularly nitrogen) dynamics in sub/tropical savanna, and review the available evidence relevant to understanding the potential impact of clearing Eucalyptus savanna on nutrient relations. The limited evidence presently available can be used to argue for the extreme positions that: (i) woody vegetation competes with grasses Cor resources. and tree/shrub clearing improves pasture production, (ii) woody vegetation benefits pasture production. At present, the lack of fundamental knowledge about Australian savanna nutrient relations makes accurate predictions about medium- and long-term effects of clearing on nutrient relations in low nutrient savannas difficult. The future of cleared savannas will differ if herbaceous species maintain all functions that woody vegetation has previously held, or if woody species have functions distinct from those of herbaceous vegetation. Research suggests that savanna soils are susceptible to nitrate leaching, and that trees improve the nutrient status of savanna soils in some situations. The nitrogen capital of cleared savanna is at risk if mobile ions are not captured efficiently by the vegetation. and nitrogen input via N(2) fixation from vegetation and microbiotic crusts is reduced. In order to predict clearing effects on savanna nutrient relations, research should be directed to answering (i) how open or closed nutrient cycles are in natural and cleared savanna, (ii) which functions are performed by savanna constituents such as woody and herbaceous vegetation, native and exotic plant species. termites, and microbiotic 7 crusts in relation to nutrient cycles. In the absence of detailed knowledge about savanna functioning, clearing carries the risk of promoting continuous nutrient depiction.

TI Soil and water salinity in Queensland: The prospect of ecological
   sustainability through the implementation of land clearing policy
SO RANGELAND JOURNAL

DE salinity; ecological sustainability; regional planning; biodiversity;
   legislation
ID NORTH QUEENSLAND; SALINIZATION
AB In Queensland, legislation has recently been enacted that outlines minimum standards for the retention of native vegetation in bioregions and prescribes Performance Requirements for the maintenance of biodiversity and ecological processes, and the prevention of land degradation. It also details Acceptable Solutions to satisfy the Performance Requirements. It this paper we analyse the links between science and action to determine whether the legislation and associated policy are likely to lead to sound management decisions being made for prevention of land and water salinity. We also compared the requirements for biodiversity protection relative to those for salinity control. For salinity (and biodiversity) the minimum standards and Acceptable Solutions in the legislation have a sound technical basis. The main challenge in implementing the salinity Performance Requirements will be provision of information required to assess salinity risk at appropriate scales. This information is: (1) salinity hazard assessment at catchment/regional scale planning scale; (2) technical information to support a sub-catchment scale implementation; (3) guidelines, procedures and local expertise for interpretation of salinity hazard at the property scale. In the process of assessing clearing applications there is no formal role for planners or decision makers at the sub-catchment level who could play ail important role in coordinating information gathering for land managers developing clearing applications. There are also limited pathways for accessing relevant scientific information and expertise at an appropriate level to provide support for land managers. We suggest that this situation is likely to limit the successful implementation of the policy for preventing land and water salinity. The minimum standard of 30% retained vegetation would provide similar protection for biodiversity and salinity control at the bioregional level. In smaller areas (e.g. ail individual property) however, there could be contrasting requirements I, or the retention of vegetation.

TI Economics of vegetation clearing in Queensland
SO RANGELAND JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
DE vegetation management; economics; cost-benefit analysis
AB Vegetation management in Queensland has been controversial in recent years. This is because of the complexity of the issues, the different interests of the various stakeholders. and the difficulty of finding efficient and acceptable solutions. While vegetation clearing generates production benefits to landholders. it may also generate spillover effects of greenhouse gas emissions and biodiversity losses on other groups in society. As well, there are questions about impacts on sustainability where clearing, is associated with risks of salinity and other land degradation impacts. This paper provides an overview of these issues from an economic perspective. Economic theory and applied results are used to explore reasons For disagreement over clearing and where the balance between private and public interests might lie. File use of regulation, property right mechanisms, taxes and community planning are discussed to address problems associated with externalities. The need for better information. changed goals and norms. and regulation are outlined in relation to sustainability issues. The justification for some different approaches to regulation is also explored.

DT Article
DE communication; stakeholders; awareness; extension; vegetation management
AB Science communication. including extension services. plays a key role in achieving sustainable native vegetation management. One of the pivotal aspects of the debate on sustainable vegetation management is the scientific information underpinning policy-making. In recent years. extension services have Shifted their focus from top-down technology transfer to bottom-up participation and empowerment. I here has also been a broadening of communication strategies to recognise the range of stakeholders involved in native vegetation management and to encompass environmental concerns. This paper examines the differences between government approaches to extension services to deliver policy and the need for effective communication to address broader science issues that underpin native vegetation management. The importance of knowing the learning styles of the stakeholders involved in native vegetation management is discussed at a time of increasing reliance on mass communication for information exchange and the importance of personal communication to achieve on-ground sustainable management. Critical factors for effective science-management communication are identified Such as: (i) undertaking scientific studies (research) with community involvement, acceptance and agreed understanding of project objectives (ii) realistic community consultation periods: (iii) matching communication channels with stakeholder needs; (iv) combining scientific with local knowledge in in holistic (biophysical and social) approach to understanding in issued and (v) regional partnerships. These communication factors are considered to be essential to implementing on-ground natural resource management strategics and actions, including those concerned with native vegetation management.

TI Bore Drain Replacement in south-west Queensland: Benefits and costs for
   land managers
SO RANGELAND JOURNAL

DE Great Artesian Basin; project evaluation; benefit-cost analysis; land
   manager perceptions
ID PATTERNS
AB The Bore Drain Replacement Project (BDRP) in south-west Queensland provided government subsidies to land managers to convert water distribution systems from open earth bore drains to piped water systems, thereby addressing Great Artesian Basin (GAB) sustainability issues. To fully evaluate the benefits and costs of the project for land managers, both a financial benefit-cost analysis and a study of land managers' perceptions were conducted.
   The main benefit for land managers from bore drain replacement, was a substantial decrease in operating costs (mean decrease of 87%). Results of the financial benefit-cost analysis showed that the mean private benefit to total cost ratio (Bp:CT) (0.86, at a real discount rate of 6%, over 10 years) was less than the break-even value of unity. The mean BP:CT (0.6) for land managers with less than 50% of bore drains on mulga (Acacia aneura F. Muell ex. Benth) land systems was also less than unity, while those land managers with bore drains predominately on mulga land systems had a mean Bp:CT that only marginally exceeded unity (1.1). With a government subsidy (study mean 72%), the private benefits to private cost ratio (Bp:Cp), averaged across all land managers in the study, was 2.25. The break-even subsidy level for land managers was calculated as 17% of the total capital cost.
   Land managers perceived a number of important benefits from bore drain replacement that were not included in the financial benefit-cost analysis, due to difficulty quantifying values. These included benefits from changes in grazing management, increased time-savings and an improved quality of life. In general, there were no changes documented in animal productivity, native and feral animal populations, or carrying capacity in the 18 months since piping, although potential changes for the future were identified. Some land managers noted improvements to natural resource condition near bore drains after closure, while most expected little deterioration in natural resource condition near the new water points.
   Recommendations are made for ongoing funding support for bore drain replacement, including further monitoring and evaluation, with emphasis on conducting an economic public and private benefit-cost analysis. Land managers' capacity to pay, willingness to adopt change and public benefits of the project should be considered in cost sharing arrangements and determination of future government subsidy levels.

AB Studies were conducted to compare visual estimates of ground cover and canopy cover by both inexperienced and experienced observers and to compare those estimates with those from more objective methods in native pastures in the high rainfall, temperate rangelands of northern NSW. Ground cover and canopy cover of 60 quadrats was estimated using visual, mapped area, digital image analysis and photo point quadrat methods. Inexperienced observers were trained by estimating ground cover of reference quadrats. Differences between mean visual estimates of ground cover and canopy cover for experienced and inexperienced observers were not significant (P>0.05). Mean ground cover estimates by the mapped area, digital image analysis and point quadrat methods were also not different from each other. The overall relationship between mean visual estimate and mean objective estimate of ground cover was non-linear (second order polynomial, R-2 = 0.93), observers tending to underestimate in the mid-range (20 to 80%) of cover compared with objective methods. Mean visual estimate of ground cover was 73.7% compared with the mean objective estimate of 83.7%. Visual estimates of canopy cover (mean 34.6%) were highly correlated (R-2 = 0.90) With those of the mapped area method (mean 34.3%) and the relationship was linear. Measurement of ground cover is a standard technique used in many pasture ecology and management studies and is increasingly being used by land managers to monitor pasture production and sustainability. inexperienced observers were trained quickly and easily to estimate ground cover and canopy cover with sufficient accuracy to identify ranges of cover using visual estimation, indicating that the visual estimation technique should be suitable for estimating ground cover in land management research.

AB The MARKAL models generator was utilised to build up a comprehensive model of the anthropogenic activities system which points out the linkages between productive processes and waste disposal technologies. The aim of such a study is to determine the optimal configuration of the waste management system for the Basilicata region (Southern Italy), in order to support the definition of the regional waste management plan in compliance with the Italian laws, A sensitivity analysis was performed to evaluate the influence of landfilling fees on the choice of waste processing technologies, in order to foster waste management strategies which are environmentally sustainable, economically affordable and highly efficient. The results show the key role of separate collection and mechanical pre-treatments in the achievement of the legislative targets. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The Mexican freshwater fish that are at risk or extinct are listed by family, state, basin/region, and causes of risk. Of the 506 known species, 168 are at some level of risk, and 25 are believed to be extinct. States with the most reports are: Chihuahua ( 46); Coahuila ( 35); Nuevo Leon ( 20); Sonora ( 19); Durango ( 18); and Tamaulipas ( 15). With the exception of Sonora, these states are largely located in the Rio Bravo region, and are all arid or semiarid. Most extinctions have occurred in Nuevo Leon ( 8) and Coahuila ( 7). The main causes of risk reported are: habitat reduction or alteration ( 86); water depletion ( 83); presence of exotics ( 76); small or declining population ( 73); and small habitat ( 57). All of which result in very local endemism. These causes of risk develop easily when the distribution is small. The critical factor is aridity, which is associated with desertization. Water conflicts were to be expected, and the result is resource non sustainability.

AB While biologists have been aware of the existence of native Mexican trouts for over a century, they have received little study. The few early studies that did muchmore than mention their existence began in the 1930s and continued into the early 1960s, focusing primarily on distributional surveys and taxonomic analyses. Starting in the 1980s the Baja California rainbow trout became the subject of more detailed studies, but very little remains known of mainland trouts of the Sierra Madre Occidental. We review earlier studies and report on our own collections and observations made between 1975 and 2000. We present newly discovered historical evidence that leads us to conclude that a "lost" cutthroat trout, a lineage not previously known from Mexico, was collected more than a century ago from headwaters of the Rio Conchos ( a major tributary of the Rio Grande (= Rio Bravo)), a basin not previously considered to harbor a native trout. We review the last century of regional natural resource management and discuss our own observations of trout habitats. Impacts of logging, road building and overgrazing are widespread and expanding. Many streams suffer from heavy erosion, siltation and contamination, and though long-term hydrologic data are generally not available, there is evidence of decreased discharge in many streams. These problems appear related to region-wide land management practices as well as recent regional drought. Trout culture operations using exotic rainbow trout have rapidly proliferated throughout the region, threatening genetic introgression and/or competition with native forms and predation on them. Knowledge of distribution, abundance, relationships and taxonomy, not to mention ecology and population biology, of native trouts of the Sierra Madre Occidental remains inadequate. Vast areas of most mainland drainages are still unexplored by fish collectors, and even rudimentary information regarding basic biology, ecology and population structure of stocks remains lacking. Concentrated exploration, research and management of this long overlooked and undervalued resource are all urgently needed. The history of natural resources exploitation that placed so many native trouts of the western United States on threatened and endangered species lists is repeating itself in the Sierra Madre Occidental. Without concerted action and development of region-wide socio-economic solutions for current, largely non-sustainable resource management practices, native Mexican trout gene pools will soon be in grave danger of extinction.

AB Institutional and legal frameworks have a wide scope and need for improving or refining existing fisheries management tools, and for increasing capabilities of the public and private sectors to better manage the development of fisheries activities, either in marine or freshwater ecosystems. Despite the large surface area covered by inland waters in Mexico, its production during the last 20 years remained at the same level, i.e. production used for local consumption in rural areas supports food for the poorest communities. The present document deals with the most recent legal exercise that shows that there are many opportunities to strengthen technical cooperation and develop policies and commercial issues related to freshwater fish in inland waters.
   The Mexican federal administration during the years 1994 to 2000 fully endorsed policies that benefited the relationship between the government and fisheries sector. The Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries ( CCRF), was adopted in 1995 as a global intergovernmental consensus on the promotion of sustainable fisheries and aquaculture developments. Following its basic principles and norms, the National Fisheries Institute (INP) elaborated the National Fisheries Chart in 2000. This is an example of recent advances to develop legal instruments that fit the need for fisheries management. Such efforts and their implementation can be seen through technical data sheets in the (CNP) as well as other suggestions provided to further promote the sustainable development of inland fisheries in Mexico.

AB Although a large portion of the world's fanned shrimp is produced in Asia, shrimp culture operations do not succeed over the entire area. There have been several problems and impediments that are yet to be resolved. one of these problems is disease. Several shrimp diseases have threatened shrimp production, but the most devastating ones are the viral diseases, namely, yellow-head virus (YHV), and White Spot Syndrome Virus (WSSV). At present, there is no curative procedure for the two viral diseases. As such, preventive measures are thought to be more practical. Several preventive measures have been studied and introduced, but the most acceptable one is the improvement of growout systems. Asian shrimp culture employs three shrimp culture techniques: the extensive, semiintensive, and intensive systems. Beginning with the extensive about 3 decades ago, parts of this system were modified into a semiintensive system in 1980, and later the intensive type was introduced. The extensive type evolved from the hunting and gathering of food by the nearshore communities. Mangrove environments were modified into trapping ponds for livestock during the stormy months. This system uses low technology and requires vast and low-lying areas, such as mangrove forested areas. The intensive system uses higher technology, requires a smaller area, and higher elevations. Thus, it does not require mangrove areas, but it is suitable for areas behind the mangroves. The production is quite high when compared with the two other systems. Because of the high stocking density and intensive feeding, however, this type of shrimp culture is faced with several problems, such as coastal pollution caused by the farm effluent and disease problems. The intensive system was later modified to a more biosecure system, that is, a closed recirculating water system, a reduced or zero water exchange system, and shrimp culture at inland locations away from coastal influences. These innovations have made shrimp culture more efficient in controlling diseases, more sustainable, and more environmentally friendly.

AB Anguillid eels are high-value aquaculture species. Eel aquaculture techniques were developed in Japan and subsequently transferred to Taiwan and South Korea. When glass eel and elver supplies became a constraint in Japan, Taiwan used this opportunity to establish its own eel aquaculture industry. Later on, China and Malaysia also started to develop eel aquaculture. In Europe, many countries also adopted the Japanese eel aquaculture techniques, although Italy and France already had a long history of very extensive eel aquaculture.
   Driving forces for the development of eel culture techniques have been the need to overcome temperature limitations, enhance productivity, and comply with increasingly stringent environmental regulations while reducing production costs. Culture techniques have evolved from primitive methods to the highly sophisticated intensive systems. In this article, the current major growout culture systems are grouped into three categories: the outdoor culture system, the greenhouse culture system, and the intensive recirculating culture system. Innovations in Taiwan that apply Danish intensive recirculating culture technology are described separately.
   The eel aquaculture industry is facing constraints, such as unstable glass eel and elver supplies, lack of knowledge on larval rearing, disease occurrences, inconsistent product quality, limited markets, and a lack of culture techniques for other eel species. The challenge is to overcome these constraints in a sustainable manner with the technical, environmental, and economic considerations.

ID ICTALURUS-PUNCTATUS; VITAMIN-C; AERATION
AB In the southeastern United States, the commercial cult-Lire of channel catfish Ictalurus punctatus has developed into a mature and sustainable industry. This article explores the catfish industry as a case study for the development of a sustainable pond aquaculture industry. The prerequisite knowledge base to support catfish industry development was largely in place by 1960. The industry developed from multiple centers, but became firmly rooted in northwest Mississippi by the mid-1960s. The industry expanded and became progressively more vertically integrated, a process that was completed by the mid-1970s. During the 1980s, industry output expanded at a rate nearly three times greater than the increase in pond area, indicating significant intensification of production, related to the widespread adoption of paddlewheel aeration. Factors that contributed to the success of the channel catfish industry include the characteristics of channel catfish, physical and edaphic factors, personal attributes of farmers, regional socio-economics, marketing and product promotion, and research and extension. Many of the important technical challenges to production of catfish in ponds are related to an inadequate level of control over production at the current level of system intensity. These problems are manifest in diseases and environmental impacts. The unique and complementary roles of catfish producers, research scientists, and organizations or institutions in developing solutions to industry challenges are discussed. Catfish production in ponds as currently practiced is sustainable, but further increases in profitability and solutions to challenges faced by catfish producers will require a greater emphasis on efficiency rather than yield.

AB A careful survey for mammals, reptiles, and amphibians, was conducted at the wetlands and rainforests of Ikpan Forest block, Cross River State (south-eastern Nigeria), during the period 1998-2001. The surveys proved that Ikpan Forest, although formally not protected at either regional or national levels, houses an extraordinarily rich biodiversity, including many vertebrates of ecological, biogeographic, and conservation importance. Among mammals, the most important taxa are primates (11 different species, including Mandrillus leucophaeus, Pan troglodytes, Procolobus badius preussi), forest elephants, forest buffalos, and many ungulates. Manatees and leopards may also be present. Among reptiles, Osteolaemus tetraspis, Kinixys spp., Varanus niloticus ornatus, Python sebae, and chameleons are especially important in conservation terms. Moreover, the study forest houses a conspicuous diversity of species of snakes (27) and amphibians (27), including many species which are good ecological indicators of forest quality, and some species which were rarely recorded in Nigeria before (e.g., the anurans Bufo superciliaris and Conraua crassipes). The study area has potentials for conservation and sustainable development (eco-tourism), but should certainly be monitored carefully in the next years to avoid the negative effects of timber extraction, local hunting, farming, and fishing with dynamites.

ID NONRENEWABLE RESOURCES
AB In a research-driven endogenous growth model, a non-renewable resource gives rise to pollution. Consumption may either grow or decline along the optimal balanced growth path, but the (flow) pollution level necessarily diminishes continuously. Any positive balanced growth path is sustainable. Utility may improve, even though consumption declines. Although positive growth is optimal, the market economy may nevertheless result in permanently declining consumption possibilities. At the same time, a growth-enhancing government policy may improve long-run environmental conditions. The pollution externality does not distort the decisions of the market economy, so that a specific environmental policy is superfluous.

   PERSPECTIVE
AB Participatory action research is a process in which researchers operate as full collaborators with members of an organization (stakeholders) in linking theory and research to acceptable and effective practice. Schools are being charged to use this approach to address the challenges of developing system-level interventions for many of their current problematic areas, such as family-school partnerships with economically disadvantaged and culturally and linguistically diverse families. Participatory action research is a means for school psychologists, as participatory researchers, to provide leadership for collaborative research within schools for the development of system-level interventions. A case study is described in which a school psychologist served as the participatory researcher in an action research process for the development of a family-school partnership program in a Chapter I, ethnically and linguistically diverse elementary school. The outcomes indicated that the participatory action research process resulted in the design and implementation of a research-based family-school partnership program that was culturally specific, was acceptable to stakeholders (parents and teachers), and had the potential for sustainability. Participatory action research is a viable means for school psychologists to provide leadership in developing research-based, effective and acceptable system-level interventions in their schools.

TI Of superquarries and mountain railways: Recurring themes in Scottish
   environmental conflict
SO SCOTTISH GEOGRAPHICAL JOURNAL

AB Development proposals in areas with renowned natural heritage frequently stir up environmental controversy. In recent years, the Scottish Highlands and Islands have seen two particularly high-profile conflicts of this type: the proposals for an aggregates superquarry on Harris and for a funicular mountain railway in the Cairngorm ski area. The first was turned down, the second has gone ahead. These showdowns between development and conservation interests shared characteristics which typify environmental conflicts: tension between 'insiders' and 'outsiders', polarised viewpoints, contrasting interpretations of sustainable development, criticism of the planning system and disagreement over decision making procedures. This paper explores these themes through detailed considerations of the two specific debates and of the arguments that were fielded to support or oppose the projects.

TI Reducing the risk of sexual HIV transmission - Quantifying the per-act

AB Background: Sexual acquisition of HIV is influenced by choice of partner, sex act, and condom use. However, current risk-reduction strategies focus mainly on condom use.
   Goal: To estimate the contribution of choice of partner, sex act, and condom use on the per-act relative and absolute risks for HIV infection.
   Study Design: Per-act relative risk for HIV infection was calculated with use of estimates of HIV prevalence, risk of condom failure, HIV test accuracy, and per-act risk of HIV transmission for different sex acts. Absolute risks were calculated on the basis of these relative risk estimates.
   Results: Choosing a partner who tested negative instead of an untested partner reduced the relative risk of HIV infection 47-fold; using condoms, 20-fold; and choosing insertive fellatio rather than insertive anal sex, 13-fold. Choosing one risk-reduction behavior substantially reduces absolute risk of HIV infection for heterosexuals but not for men who have sex with men.
   Conclusion: Clarifying the magnitude of risk associated with different choices may help people make effective and sustainable changes in behavior.

AB The combination of certain features of fire disturbance, notably fire frequency, size and severity, may be used to characterize the disturbance regime in any region of the boreal forest. As some consequences of fire resemble the effects of industrial forest harvesting, conventional forest management is often considered as a disturbance that has effects similar to those of natural disturbances. Although the analogy between forest management and are disturbance in boreal ecosystems has some merit, it is important to recognise that it also has its limitations. Short fire cycles generally described for boreal ecosystems do not appear to be universal rather, important spatial and temporal variations have been observed in Canada. These variations in the fire cycle have an important influence on forest composition and structure at the landscape and regional levels. Size and severity of fires also show a large range of variability. In regions where the natural matrix of the boreal forest remains relatively intact, maintenance of this natural variability should be targeted by forest managers concerned with biodiversity conservation. Current forest management tends to reduce this variability: for example, fully regulated, even-aged management will tend to truncate the natural forest age distribution and eliminate over-mature and old-growth forests from the landscape. We suggest that the development of strategic-level forest management planning approaches and silvicultural techniques designed to maintain a spectrum of forest compositions and structures at different scales in the landscape is one avenue to maintain this variability. Although we use the boreal forest of Quebec for our examples, it is possible to apply the approach to those portions of the boreal forest where the fire regime favours the development of even-aged stands in burns.

AB In Fennoscandia, use of the natural forest as a reference for restoration and management of forest biodiversity has been widely accepted. However, limited understanding of the structure and dynamics of the natural forest has hampered the applications of the natural variability approach. This is especially the case in areas, where the natural forests have almost totally vanished. This review was motivated by the idea that despite these difficulties the essential features of the natural forest can be reconstructed based on biological archives, historical documents, research done in adjacent natural areas, and modeling. First, a conceptual framework for analyzing the relationship between forest structure, dynamics and biodiversity is presented. Second, the current understanding of the structure and dynamics of natural forests at different spatiotemporal scales in boreal Fennoscandia is reviewed. Third, the implications of this knowledge, and gaps in knowledge, on research and on practical restoration and management methods aimed at forest biodiversity conservation are discussed. In conclusion, naturally dynamic forest landscapes are complex, multiscaled hierarchical systems. Current forest management methods create disturbance and successional dynamics that are strongly scale-limited when compared with the natural forest. To restore some of the essential characteristics of the natural forest's multiscale heterogeneity, diversification of silvicultural and harvesting treatments, as guided by natural disturbance dynamics, is needed to produce more variation in disturbance severity, quality, extent, and repeatability.

TI Termites as pests of crops, forestry, rangeland and structures in
   southern Africa and their control
SO SOCIOBIOLOGY

CT 21st International Congress of Entomology
CY AUG 20-26, 2000

ID ISOPTERA; DAMAGE; MACROTERMITINAE
AB Termites are an important component of tropical and sub-tropical ecosystems. The majority of species are economically harmless; of a total of 50 termite genera recorded from southern Africa, only 18 have one or more known pest species. Termites attack a wide range of crops at all stages of the growth cycle. Crop losses estimated at between 3 - 100% have been recorded. Post-harvest loss due to termite activity is common on many small-scale farms. Members of the fungus-growing sub-family Macrotermitinae (Termitidae) are responsible for the majority of crop damage and 90% of tree mortality in forestry. The genera most commonly involved include; Macrotermes, Odontotermes, Pseudacanthotermes, Synacanthotermes, Microtermes, Ancistrotermes, and Allodontermes together with Microcerotermes (Termitinae). The harvester termite, Trinervitermes trinervoides (Termitidae: Nasutitermitinae), common to the southern part of the region, is an occasional pest of overgrazed rangelands. However, Hodotermes mossambicus (Hodotermitidae) is the major role-player in the destruction of rangeland in the and and semi-arid areas throughout the region. Populations of this species build up during dry summers and increase over successive dry years to a level where they remove 60% or more of the standing grass biomass and all the litter, posing severe competition to domestic stock and game and exposing soils to erosion by both wind and water. This species also periodically causes severe damage to crops. While termites rarely attack indigenous tree species, exotic species such as Eucalyptus and Acacta, grown commercially and in communal woodlots, are frequently severely damaged. Seedlings in the nurseries and newly planted trees are particularly susceptible to attack during the first 6 - 9 months after planting. Mortalities vary between 19 - 78%, occasionally approaching 100% in some areas. The indigenous East African subterranean termite Coptotermes amanii (Rhinotermitidae) is responsible for severe damage to buildings and wooden structures. Psammotermes allocerus (Rhinotermitidae), widespread in the more and western parts of the region, regularly infests buildings and causes considerable damage to timber. Termites of the genera Macrotermes and Odontotermes cause the heaviest destruction of seasoned timber both within buildings and extramurally. Indigenous dry-wood termites, while occasionally infesting buildings, are not a serious threat. The exotic species, Cryptotermes brevis (Kalotermitidae) has, however, caused considerable damage in coastal areas of South Africa. A case is made for increased research effort on sustainable non-chemical control and for standardisation of ways of quantifying termite damage and linking it to yield loss.

DT Article
AB This article considers the position of sociology in a non-sociological context, that is, the Czech Agricultural University in Prague. The substance of the paper is a consideration of the role of sociology in relation to rural issues, including their practical dimension as relates to rural development. The background of the paper is constituted by both discussions in the Czech lands and abroad, which address the role and position of sociology and its relation to the lay public, and the question of how (and also if) it is possible to cope with the skepticism of lay people (a skepticism that the authors have experienced in the exercise of their professional activities) in relation to the findings and information provided by sociology. The authors suggest that the possibility exists of presenting non-trivial findings and information for lay people. Sociologists have at their disposal many instruments for mapping the actions and ideas of specific people when investigating such issues. If the results of sociological research are embedded within specific practical measures addressing rural issues, then the chance for social acceptance increases and the project is more likely to be sustainable. In such a situation, sociology is both related to concrete practices and circumstances (the doubts of lay persons about its meaninglessness disappear), yet it also retains its academic discourse, as a part of sociology, as a science. As a reflection of the latter, the article demonstrates the interconnections between general sociology and rural sociology, because of the centrality of the countryside and agriculture in contemporary society.

AB The objectives of this study were to (i) evaluate the effect of legume cover crops such as mucuna or velvetbean (Mucuna pruriens L.), jackbean (Carnivalia ensiformis L.), and stylo (Stylosanthes guianensis L.) on cogongrass (Imperata cylindrica L.) growth and performance, (ii) determine the influence of land preparation methods on cogongrass growth, and (iii) determine the interactive effect of land preparation and cover crops on the growth and survival of cogongrass. Two sites in Ghana were selected: an area near Mampong (Ashanti region in the Tropical Rain Forest Zone) and another in Wenchi (Brong-Ahafo region in the Forest-Savanna Transition Zone). These sites are located between 7degrees and 8degreesN with Mampong in the south and Wenchi in the north. The experimental design was a randomized complete block with a 3 x 4 and 3 x 3 factorial arrangements in 1996 and 1997, respectively. Results indicated that both velvetbean and stylo used as legume cover crops provided excellent control of cogongrass. In combination with land preparation methods, velvetbean and cultivation (plowing) gave the best control. The implication for biological control from a plant perspective is that these legume species will be excellent control measures for a noxious weed such as cogongrass. Furthermore, they are also useful for soil environmental restoration while the bean serves as valuable nutritious food for small farmers. By using these non-chemical means for weed control, farmers are able to reduce their cost of production while maintaining agricultural sustainability.

TI Yield and soil nutrient changes in a long-term rice-wheat rotation in
   India
SO SOIL SCIENCE SOCIETY OF AMERICA JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
ID NITROGEN MINERALIZATION; FERTILIZER INPUTS; CROPPING SYSTEM; TRENDS
AB Major improvements in the productivity of rice (Onza sativa L.) and wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) have occurred in South Asia since 1965-1966 when the Green Revolution began. However, after the 1980s, yield stagnated or declined. We analyzed grain yield trends, soil C, N, P, and K status, and P and K balances in a 14-yr rice-wheat experiment conducted at Punjab, India with 11 treatments comprised of various combinations of inorganic and organic sources of nutrients. Recommended levels of N, P, and K were supplemented with N through farmyard manure (FYM), wheat chopped straw (WCS), or sesbania (Sesbania cannabina Linn. & Merrill). Soil parameters were analyzed in archived soil samples collected periodically from 1988 to 1999. Rice yield declines ranged from 0.07 to 0.13 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1) dependent on treatment. Wheat yields declined by 0.04 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1) with applications of 75 and 100% N-P-K fertilizer but were maintained over the 14-yr period in the other treatments. Total soil N and available P and K declined in all the treatments except with FYM, in which total N was maintained and available P increased. Total soil C was either maintained or increased with time. Nitrogen and K depletion may have collectively contributed to the yield decline. Stable wheat yields may have been because of continuing variety improvement, resulting in higher harvest index (HI). Results show that current fertilizer recommendations are inadequate for maintaining yields. This cropping system may not be sustainable without increased K input to maintain soil K above sufficiency levels.

AB The physical deterioration of soil under continuous cropping is a problem in many humid, temperate areas. While soils of the Kairanga Series (Typic Endoaquept), Manawatu Region, North Island, New Zealand, are widely used for continuous cereal production, there is concern over the long-term sustainability of this land use. We report the results of a field experiment conducted on a sequence of sites on Kairanga soils, with cropping durations of 0, 4 and 28 years. Study objectives were to quantify physical differences between these soils and to assess a field method for measuring sensitivity to further compaction. Significant changes in key soil physical properties were recorded between the pasture and cropped sites in the 0-30 cm depth range. Most changes had occurred within the first 4 years of cropping. Physical properties that changed significantly included macropore volume (> 60 mum), air capacity volume (> 30 mum), air permeability, saturated hydraulic conductivity, unsaturated hydraulic conductivity (-0.4 kPa), and shear strength. Bulk density increased significantly only after a long cropping period, and penetration resistance measurements did not significantly differentiate sites of increasing cropping duration. Hence, bulk density and penetration resistance measurements on their own may not be adequate to assess cropping impact. Agricultural tractors were used under moist spring conditions to impose wheel traffic at an intensity of 273-305 Mg km ha(-1) on the study sites. The wheel traffic experiment confirmed the trends revealed by the initial site sampling, and also indicated that both soil deformation and soil compaction were the operational forms of soil disturbance at a soil water matric potential of -10 kPa. Soil physical conditions at the long-term cropped site (28 years) had stabilised and were in equilibrium with the soil's biological and physical environments, while the short-term cropped site (4 years) was still in a transition state, with the likelihood of further increases in bulk density and shear strength. To start appropriate a-melioration, it is important to identify when soils are in transition between pasture and long-term cropped states. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V All rights reserved.

AB "Globalization and social security" is devoted to sociological studies in the field of globalization, social security sustained development, Ontologically objective globalization-seen as interdependent planetary society in the making-processes root in fundamentally changing bases of human societal life. Analytic approach permits to single out some aspects of globalization such as communicational shrinkage of the world, growing global interdependence, making in place of an hierarchical society a global networks one with an economy working in real-time manner, growing interaction of cultures, de-etatization of international relations system. Destructive and constructive possibilities of global nature came to contradict archaic forms of social security, which had been for thousands of years built upon the principles of local communities, immortality of humankind and violence as an effective way to obtain material and spiritual supremacy. Growing scale and depth of global disparities and catastrophes ask for a new of global security system to be founded on cooperation and sustainable development.

AB The current trap fishery for the West Coast rock lobster Jasus lalandii in South African waters results in the capture, sorting and release of large numbers of undersized animals. Once removed from the water, they are vulnerable to damage from numerous sources. Even sub-lethal injury may result in a considerable reduction to individual productivity through decreased growth or reproductive potential. Given that the J. lalandii resource is heavily depleted, such wastage may have severe repercussions for the sustainability of the fishery. In an attempt to reduce these losses, 20% of the fishing gear used by the rock lobster industry has been modified to include grids designed to allow undersized rock lobsters (mainly females) to escape the traps before they are hauled. The efficiency of this gear (and two alternatives) was assessed by comparison with standard commercial gear over a range of fishing grounds. Results indicated that, in comparison to standard commercial traps, none of the alternative trap designs would be beneficial to the fishery in the long term, provided that overnight sets remain the most common fishing method. SELECT models were used to evaluate the fishing properties of commercial and bottom-grid traps relative to those of control (fine-mesh) traps. The results indicated that, given the choice, a rock lobster would preferentially enter a commercial trap, followed by a control trap, with bottom-grid traps being the least attractive. This suggests some level of saturation of control traps, a possibility that is of particular concern because the control trap design is used in a fishery-independent monitoring survey.

AB At Danger Point, South Africa, mariculture of the abalone Haliotis midae has led to increased demand for freshly harvested kelp Ecklonia maxima. This study estimates the biomass of E. maxima available for harvesting, investigates the effects of harvesting on the recovery of kelp and on the benthic understorey biota, and tests an alternative method of harvesting kelp by cutting off only fronds rather than whole plants. Estimates from diver sampling between May 1992 and November 1994 and infra-red maps indicate an E. maxima biomass at Danger Point of 22 973 tons fresh mass in 336 ha of kelp beds, insufficient to sustain projected abalone feed requirements in the area if harvesting is done in the traditional manner of cutting the stipes. However, sufficient frond material may be harvested sustainably if only fronds are cut, at distances 20-30 cm from the bases of fronds. Cutting at 10 cm from the base significantly reduced regrowth rates, and there was little regrowth after cutting at 2 cm. Yield per unit effort was higher for a four-month interval between harvesting them for one-, two- and three-month intervals. Two years after harvesting whole plants (in two 100 x 20 in lanes), biomass and density of kelp had recovered (similar in control and harvested lanes), and there were no detectable differences in the understorey communities, as measured by detrended correspondence analysis. Although harvesting of whole kelp has a minimal effect on the understorey biota and kelp itself recovers within two years, selective cutting of fronds allows plants to remains alive and produce a higher yield. This method is likely to minimize damage to the kelp bed system.

AB Of the southern African intertidal and shallow subtidal trochid and turbinid gastropods, Turbo sarmaticus, T. cidaris and Oxystele sinensis, are the most abundant large species, and therefore obvious targets for a winkle fishery. T. sarmaticus is harvested by recreational snorkel divers, and an application has been made for a permit to experimentally harvest the other two species commercially. This study involves four major aspects, namely morphometrics and flesh yield, shore-based abundance estimates, subtidal abundance estimates, and an estimate of the potential yield for each of the three species off the South-Western Cape, South Africa. Abundance and biomass of the winkles increased from west to east, highest densities being recorded in the low intertidal regions to 2 in depth. Low biomasses of the three species were recorded west of Cape Hangklip and are unlikely to support a fishery there. East of Cape Hangklip, invasion of rock lobsters Jasus lalandii has had a considerable impact on T. cidaris and O. sinensis populations. Consequently, a boat-based fishery with an estimated annual total allowable catch of 75.5 tons for T cidaris, with a bycatch of 9.9 tons for O. sinensis, can only be considered in the easternmost fisheries-management area between Kleinbaai and Quoin Point. Because previous studies on the harvesting potential of T. sarmaticus off the Western Cape concluded that it was not commercially sustainable, a total allowable catch for that species was not considered. Management options deserving considerations before the commencement of a giant winkle fishery are discussed.

   demographics; gillnets; socio-economics
AB Data collected by questionnaire and telephone surveys conducted during 1998 and 1999 are used to describe the socio-economic characteristics of inshore netfishers in the Western Cape. Approximately two-thirds of netfishers work or have worked in other fishing sectors and a further 6-50%, depending on the area surveyed, are retired. Very few (0-11%) permit-holders in most areas classified their occupations as netfishers and the majority claimed to make <5% of their income from netfishing. Estimated costs and returns to net permit-holders suggest that, in most areas, commercial netfishing at current levels of catch and effort is not economically sustainable in the long-term. Only Saldanha-Langebaan gillnetters and beach-seine permit-holders, on average, manage to cover their opportunity costs and make an economic profit. The lack of profits in other areas is compelling evidence that the net fisheries are at or beyond the open access equilibrium point, suggesting that effort reduction in the order of 60% is necessary if maximum economic yield is to be obtained from the fishery. The netfisheries provide part-time employment for approximately 2 000 crew in the Western Cape. Additional economic benefits and employment directly related to the fishery in the form of equipment and fuel purchases made by fishers, maintenance of fishing gear and the sale of fish are estimated to contribute at least R15 million to the regional economy annually. Between 42 and 76% of respondents felt that their catches had declined since they had started netfishing and most felt that no new permits should be issued. Knowledge of catch restrictions among respondents was low (53-73%), indicative of a lack of communication between management and fishers, poorly defined permit conditions and a lack of enforcement. Many fishers interviewed feel it is unfair that they are restricted to catching only low-value target species and do not adhere to the catch restrictions, even if they do know them. The importance of the netfishery for participants varies greatly between and within areas. In order to reduce effort equitably, current and potential new permit-holders should be assessed on an individual merit basis.

   EXPLOITATION; ORGANISMS
AB Evolution of a new policy for the management of marine fisheries in South Africa led to the Marine Living Resources Act of 1998 (MLRA). Among other innovations, this requires that management strategies be developed for subsistence fisheries. As a prerequisite, definitions and criteria are needed to identify and distinguish them. To achieve this, the Chief Director of Marine & Coastal Management (MCM), the authority responsible for managing marine fisheries, appointed a Subsistence Fisheries Task Group (SFTG) to make recommendations about definitions and modes of management. The process involved successive surveys and consultations with fishing communities, communication with MCM, and a national workshop of all participants. This led to consensus about the following definition:
   Subsistence fishers are poor people who personally harvest marine resources as a source of food or to sell them to meet the basic needs of food security; they operate on or near to the shore or in estuaries, live in close proximity to the resource, consume or sell the resources locally, use low-technology gear (often as part of a long-standing community-based or cultural practice), and the kinds of resources they harvest generate only sufficient returns to meet the basic needs of food security.
   This definition builds on the facts that existing subsistence fisheries are usually: (1) local operations; (2) customary, traditional or cultural; (3) undertaken for personal or family use; (4) primarily for nutritional needs (though excess resources may be sold to ensure food security); (5) based on minimal technology; and (6) undertaken by people with low cash incomes. They are specifically non-commercial and non-recreational. The definition was designed to allow protection of the rights of these people and sustainability of the resources. While developing this definition, it became obvious that the definition of "commercial fishing" in the MLRA is also inadequate, and a new definition was developed. Commercial fisheries span a wide spectrum, and the SFTG defined "small-scale commercial fishers" as a distinct component that has not received adequate attention, and for whom specific management plans need to be developed. They are distinguished by living on or close to the coast, having a history of involvement with fishing, being personally involved in hands-on day-to-day running of their enterprises, operating with limited amounts of capital investment and low levels of technology, and employing small numbers of people.

   TRENDS
AB The availability of resources and their suitability for subsistence and small-scale commercial fishers in South Africa were assessed and appropriate options for the management of resources recommended. Assessment of current resource utilization and recommendations for future subsistence and/or small-scale commercial use were based on information gathered during a nationwide survey of 144 subsistence fishing communities in South Africa and a review of relevant published and unpublished literature. Current patterns of resource use in three regions of the coast (West, South and East coasts) revealed that most true subsistence fisheries occur in the eastern half of the country. These fisheries are primarily focused on invertebrate species found on intertidal rocky shores and sandy beaches, or in estuaries. Fish are harvested by rod or handline, netting or traditional fishing methods (fishtraps, spearing, baited baskets). No "new" or previously underutilized resources were identified as suitable for subsistence fishing in any of the three regions. The potential for several new small-scale commercial fisheries was identified, but the need to retain certain resources for subsistence fisheries (rather than converting them to small-scale commercial fisheries) was evident in certain areas. Resources with high commercial value were not considered suitable for subsistence fishing, but rather for the introduction of small-scale commercial fisheries. The overall management strategy for the subsistence sector, which is currently in the process of being developed, must ensure sufficient flexibility to be able to take into account regional and site-specific requirements. It will also need to develop co-management structures, protect traditional fishing practices, avoid user conflict and provide for no-take areas, all within the framework of sustainable resource utilization.

AB This paper summarizes recommendations for the management of previously marginalized and neglected subsistence fisheries in South Africa. The recommendations stem from the activities and analyses of a task group appointed by Government and mandated to provide advice about management of the new fishing sector. The following focus areas were identified for attention: planning for implementation; definitions of subsistence fishers and other sectors; assessment and categorization of resources; determination of types of fishing activities; zonation; management systems; training; communication mechanisms; application and allocation procedures; compliance processes; research and monitoring; development of institutional capacity. Subsistence fishers were defined as poor people who personally harvest marine resources as a source of food or to sell them to meet basic needs of food security; they operate on or near to the shore or in estuaries, live in close proximity to the resource, consume or sell the resources locally, use low-technology gear (often as part of a long-standing community-based or cultural practice), and the resources they harvest generate only sufficient returns to meet basic needs of food security. A second group of informal fishers was identified that fishes for profit but cannot be equated to large industrial fisheries, and a new sector was proposed to accommodate these artisanal "small-scale commercial" fishers. Resources were classified for use by these different sectors based on accessibility, fishing methods, cash value and sustainability. In all, 12 different categories of subsistence and small-scale commercial 'fisheries were identified, and a preliminary list of resource species suitable for different fishing sectors is presented. A multi-tiered institutional management structure is recommended, with the national agency (MCM) controlling issues of national concern, and supporting and coordinating the activities of provincial and local structures. The management agents required for effective implementation were identified and include a dedicated national Subsistence Fisheries Management Unit, provincial management agencies that have the capacity to be delegated authority, Regional Fieldworkers, an independent Advisory Group for Subsistence Fisheries Management, local co-management structures, and community monitors responsible for observing and recording fishing activities and catches. Co-management, involving both authorities and users in joint management, is advocated in preference to previous top-down approaches, because of its potential to improve communication and compliance.

AB The National Environment and Health Action Plans (NEHAPs) are a novel attempt to integrate environmental protection and health promotion in political programmes. Throughout Europe, about 40 NEHAPs have been developed so far. The Swiss NEHAP was among the first to be developed in an industrialised country. We discuss strength and weaknesses of the Swiss NEHAP and draw first conclusions on the development and implementation process of such programmes, illustrated by examples of other European NEHAPs. The strengths of the Swiss NEHAP lie in the formulation of specific targets in selected areas, its approach as a environmental health promotion programme, and its comprehensive evaluation. Weaknesses in most NEHAPs are the lack of involvement of the general public and of the economic sector, and the absence of an implementation strategy along with adequate financing.

AB The approach to sustainable transportation issues in the United States was examined in light of findings from a study of sustainable transportation planning in Sweden, Germany, the Netherlands, and Scotland. In the European countries, reducing greenhouse gases has been the initial motivation for most sustainable transportation initiatives, but broader social, economic, and environmental concerns now figure into the idea of sustainability. In the United States, barriers to greenhouse gas reduction and planning for sustainability include uncertainty about the problem and the best ways to address it, uncertainties about public support, and the lack of a clear mandate for action. Nevertheless, efforts are under way locally in the United States to promote sustainable development, and transportation plays a central role in these plans. The European organizations visited are using many of the same strategies as are U.S. planners, but supporting their efforts are strong policy commitments, government incentives, and new planning processes emphasizing collaboration and performance measurement. Tracking the comparative success of these efforts would be an important next step.

AB Trends in urban transportation and environment are reviewed, with a focus on developing countries. "Sustainable transportation" is defined to include economic and environmental sustainability as well as equity as key criteria. Governance sustainability is also important if policies and technologies are to reduce the main externalities of urban transport. It is important to relate emissions to traffic, modal share, fuel use, and fuel characteristics; transport policies must confront all of these components if emissions are to be reduced significantly. Urban areas in developing countries have become the most polluted and congested cities in the world because of barriers to serious transport sector reform addressing these ills. However, some policies and technologies are permitting regions in Latin America and Asia to begin to change. Strong actions by cities, backed by national government formulation of equipment and fuel standards and supported by private-sector initiatives, are all needed-together with political will-to reverse the unsustainable trends in urban transport in the largest urban areas today.

TI LLM - a nonhydrostatic model applied to high-resolving simulations of
   turbulent fluxes over heterogeneous terrain
SO THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID LARGE-EDDY SIMULATION; CONVECTIVE BOUNDARY-LAYER; STRATOCUMULUS; SCALE
AB At the Deutscher Wetterdienst (DWD) an internal project named LITFASS was running to determine the representative turbulent fluxes of heat and momentum over heterogeneous land surfaces by observation and simulation. The project took advantage of the infrastructure of the Research Division at the DWD, where model research capacity is combined with the measurements made at and around the Meteorological Observatory Lindenberg.
   The paper describes the simulation component of the LITFASS-project. It consists of a high-resolving model, derived from the new operational non-hydrostatic, compressible Lokal-Modell (LM), which is denoted LLM (LITFASS-Lokal-Modell). The integration area covers the lower atmosphere in the vertical up to 3000 m with 39 model layers. The horizontal size of the integration area with 145 x 145 grid points (horizontal mesh width Deltas = 96.5 m) corresponds to a typical grid box of a meso-scale model. The LLM has to operate under real meteorological conditions. Therefore, the LLM is driven by time-dependent measured vertical profiles of wind, temperature and humidity and surface-based measurements (of radiation, precipitation, soil properties) supported by satellite information. The profiles are available for a great variety of weather situations occurring during the simulation period (1-20 June 1998). First model results from extended 24 hour-integrations against different kinds of measurements are discussed. They reveal the LLM to become a promising validation instrument, from which a systematic, sustainable validation system can be established beyond LITFASS for improving parameterization schemes in the NwP models of the DWD.

AB The problem of economic sustainability requires a more systematic attention by historians. Though not completely new, ecological history is still, certainly for the Netherlands, a field of research in statu nascendi, in comparison to the manyfold initiated research in foreign literature. The task of the historian is to provide, from his specific professionalism, the necessary historical foundation for knowledge and analysis of the present and future. For that purpose certain shifts in perspective are required, including a more systematic ecological interpretation of the past, including ancient and very ancient periods. Also an orientation towards the sciences is both possible and desirable. An ecological history should include the frameworks and forces of geography, demography and economy, as well as the contexts of culture, mentality and politics. The cultural context does not only include high-brow ideas, but also representations that are shared by people from different social backgrounds.

AB The goal of sustainable use is indefinite use of the planet by humankind. This objective, in turn, requires that the planet's ecological life support system, consisting of natural capital and ecosystem services, remains healthy for an indefinite period. Achieving sustainability will require a new view of the responsibilities of professionals, such as ecotoxicologists, to ensure a healthy ecological life support system. Because both human society and natural systems are complex and multivariate, a high degree of uncertainty will remain. Therefore, sound judgment will be needed in determining what, if any, precautionary measures should be taken until more robust information has been gathered.
   The role of ecotoxicologists in the quest for sustainable use of the planet is quite varied: 1) shifting goals and endpoints from an absence of harm to persuasive evidence of health; 2) increasing both temporal and spatial scales of ecotoxicological studies; 3) achieving a critical mass of qualified personnel; 4) including demographic change in ecotoxicological analysis and judgment; 5) developing new ecological thresholds; 6) being prepared for environmental surprises; 7) focusing on design for a quality environment; 8) developing ecosystem services as endpoints in ecotoxicological studies, and 9) being prepared for climate change and other events that might destabilize the biosphere and require major adjustments in the process of ecotoxicological testing. Both sustainable use of the planet and the field of ecotoxicology are rapidly developing fields that are mostly evolving in isolation from each other. To be successful, they must co-evolve.

AB Urban transport in most cities around the world is developing in an unsustainable fashion, as reflected by rapid growth in traffic congestion and air pollution driven by individual motorization. Strengthened bus systems, built on rapid bus corridors, and improved bus technologies could play an important role in putting cities on a more sustainable path. Results and some of the main messages are presented from a recent study at the International Energy Agency, Paris, which has assessed the situation in a number of the largest cities in the developing world, while also drawing on experience from several cities in the developed world. A principal finding is that buses tend to carry a large share of travelers but contribute only a small part of total traffic and pollution. Also, although bus ridership is declining in many cities, new types of bus systems are emerging that offer the potential to reverse these trends and have done so in several cities (e.g., Curitiba, Brazil, and Bogota, Columbia). Advanced bus propulsion systems, that is, fuel cell and hybrid buses running on a variety of fuels, could eventually provide substantial relief from bus-related pollution problems. However, in developing countries, spending scarce funds for cleaning up the emissions from present technologies, along with developing improved bus systems that enhance traffic flow, would provide far more relief in the near-term than spending on a few advanced technology buses. Both paths must be followed, but the latter must not obscure the former. Conditions necessary for bus systems to prosper are discussed and, in conclusion, recent promising developments are highlighted.

AB In urban areas worldwide, fundamental changes are taking place in participation of the public sector in planning, direct provision, and financing of urban bus services. Trends have emerged toward separating roles in transit planning and operation, opening markets to the private sector through direct entry or tendering, and establishing ways for the private sector to innovate in market development. Although in some cases these changes parallel U.S. practices in contracting out services, the international trends often radically alter both the balance of the initiative between the public authority and the operator, and participation in the market. These changes in turn require a fresh look at the functions and organization of a transport authority, so that it can effectively meet these new challenges. First, these trends and the underlying motivations in Europe, the former Soviet Union, Australia, and developing countries were reviewed. Second, competitive tendering in procuring urban bus services in a diverse set of selected locations was examined, taking into account the differences in both purpose and practice. Third, what the authority is trying to achieve and the functions it needs to assure were considered, along with the sustainability of the competitive tendering process. Unlike the typical U.S. experience in which the structure remains essentially unchanged, the Eurasian and Southern Hemisphere experiences typically involve fundamental changes to the system that have substantial transition costs and are not easily reversed. If either the process or the benefits are not sustainable, the implications are severe. Tender prices on re-bid, labor and human issues, and network design are suggested as key issues.

AB Recent economic expansion and population growth in developing countries have had a big impact on the development of large cities like Delhi, India. Accompanied by Delhi's rapid spatial growth over the last 25 years, urban sprawl has contributed to increased travel. The vehicle fleet projected at current growth rates will result in more than 13 million vehicles in Delhi in 2020. Planning and managing such a rapidly growing transport sector will be a challenge. Choices made now will have effects lasting well into the middle of the century: With such rapid transport growth rates, automobile emissions have become the fastest increasing source of urban air pollution. In India, most urban areas, including Delhi; already have major air pollution problems that could be greatly exacerbated if growth of the transport sector is managed unwisely. The transport plans designed to meet such large increases in travel demand will have to emphasize the movement of people, not vehicles, for a sustainable transportation system. Therefore, a mathematical model was developed to estimate the optimal transportation mix to meet this projected passenger-km demand while satisfying environmental goals, reducing congestion levels, and improving system and fuel efficiencies by exploiting a variety of policy options at the minimum overall cost or maximum welfare from transport. The results suggest that buses will continue to satisfy most passenger transport in the coming decades, so planning done in accordance with improving bus operations is crucial.

ID DEVELOPMENT POLICY
AB The consumer response to sustainable development initiatives provided the,focus for a series of research projects undertaken at the Transport Research Institute at Napier University. Evidence of the relationship between residential density and travel behavior is presented. Results are presented from a large household survey undertaken in four settlement classes within one key commuter corridor of the Belfast City (Northern Ireland, United Kingdom) region to determine their comparative sustainability in terms of travel behavior. It can be concluded that wide-scale land use policies can achieve significant reductions in overall private vehicle travel in urban areas. Densification is best suited to established urban areas and for influencing modal shift primarily to walking rather than public transit: The work also suggests that a more focused approach to planning decisions reflecting housing market segment preferences could yield a win-win situation for house owners and developers, albeit at the expense of some reduction in residential plot size. Local changes can bring global benefits. A great challenge falls to the urban designer to ensure that such trade-offs do not unduly undermine quality of life. Further thoughts are provided on the implications for policy makers in car-dominated cities in the United States.
