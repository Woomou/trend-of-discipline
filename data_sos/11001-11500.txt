AB A comprehensive mission for schools is to educate students to be knowledgeable, responsible, socially skilled, healthy, caring, and contributing citizens. This mission is supported by the growing number of school-based prevention and youth development programs. Yet, the current impact Of these programs is limited because of insufficient coordination with other components of school operations and inattention to implementation and evaluation factors necessary for strong program impact and sustainability. Widespread implementation of beneficial prevention programming requires further development of research-based, comprehensive school reform models that improve social, health, and academic outcomes; educational policies that demand accountability for fostering children's full development; professional development that prepares and supports educators to implement programs effectively; and systematic monitoring and evaluation to guide school improvement.

AB The role of body reserves stored during early pregnancy on the periparturient breakdown of resistance to nematode parasites was investigated. From the 35th day of pregnancy, 46 ewes were distributed in four groups and given access to a lucerne pelleted diet. Two groups were given food at maintenance (M and C) and the other two were offered food either ad libitum (H) or at 0.70 their maintenance requirements (L) in order to achieve three well differentiated levels of body reserves by the 90th day of pregnancy when backfat thickness reached a mean value of 10.6, 7.5, 7.4 and 5.0 mm for H, M, C, and L treatments respectively. After the 90th day of pregnancy all animals were given food at 50 g/kg live weight per day. All ewes in groups H, M and L received 5000 infective larvae per week (40% Teladorsagia circumcincta, 40% Trichostrongylus colubriformis, 20% Haemonchus contortus) from 5 weeks before to 3 weeks after lambing. The animals in group C remained as uninfected controls.
   Host resistance, as measured by faecal egg counts, was significantly affected by the nutritional treatment established during early pregnancy, showing a mean excretion of 546, 766 and 1007 eggs per gram (e. p. g.) for H, M, and L treatments, respectively, until 3 weeks post lambing. This response was accompanied by a significant effect on circulating eosinophils and better fed ewes showed a higher concentration with a maximum mean value of 10.1, 6.9, 5.5 and 4.0 cells per mm 3 for H, M, L and C treatments, respectively, 2 weeks post infection.
   The effect of the worm infection per se was evident in that the lambs of the M treatment ewes grew at 0.90 of the rate of those in the control treatment (189 v. 213 g/day). Ad libitum feeding in early pregnancy appeared to sufficiently compensate for this depressive effect, with the H ewes producing lambs that grew at a rate similar to those of the C ewes (213 v. 213 g/day).
   The results support the view that fat mass stored by ewes in early pregnancy is involved in the expression of immunity against gastro-intestinal nematode infection around parturition. Furthermore, the depressive effect of ewes' infection on lambs' growth rate can be overcome by increasing the plane of nutrition of their dams. These results have clear implications for grazing animals, particularly their nutritional management in early pregnancy and provide a simple management strategy in sustainable management systems.

AB The dynamics of the main nutrient fluxes of the biological cycle were quantified in a clonal Eucalyptus plantation throughout the whole planted crop rotation: current annual requirements of nutrients, uptake from the soil, internal translocations within trees, return to soil (litterfall and crown leaching) and decomposition in the forest floor. As reported for other species, two growth periods were identified in these short-rotation plantations: (1) a juvenile phase up to canopy closure, during which the uptake of nutrients from the soil reserves supplied most of the current requirements; and (2) a second phase up to harvest, characterized by intense nutrient recycling processes. Internal translocation within trees supplied about 30% of the annual requirements of N and P from 2 years of age onwards, and about 50% of the K requirement. The mineralization of large amounts of organic matter returned to the soil with litterfall during stand development represented a key process providing nutrients to the stand at the end of the rotation. The importance of the recycling processes was clearly shown by the small amounts of nutrients permanently immobilized in the ligneous components of trees, compared with the total requirements accumulated over the stand rotation which were two to four times higher. Small pools of nutrients circulating quickly in the ecosystem made it possible to produce high amounts of biomass in poor soils. The sustainability of these plantations will require fertilizer inputs that match the changes in soil fertility over successive rotations, mainly linked to the dynamics of organic matter in this tropical soil.

AB Aquaculture production systems may range from tanks and raceways, in which water quality is controlled by water dilution and discharge to the environment to captive water systems, in which water quality is controlled by microbial reactions within the tank or pond. Attempts at intensification of pond aquaculture beyond the commonplace practice of supplemental aeration may be classified into categories of physical/chemical techniques and a broad range of microbial techniques. Most of these techniques are directed at raising the 'ceiling' of the system ammonia detoxification rate. Physical-chemical techniques for intensification of pond aquaculture have included use of in-pond cages and raceways, water blending and shading of the algal community, as well as, direct flocculation and removal of algal and bacteria biomass from ponds. A variety of microbial processes can be used to reduce ammonia levels in a conventional pond. These processes include nitrification/denitrification, photosynthesis, and heterotrophic bacterial re-growth. In this paper, simplified microbial growth fundamentals, and elemental mass balances are used to analyze and compare the various aquaculture intensification techniques and, in particular, to compare conventional and heterotrophic techniques to the use of high rate photosynthetic systems. Direct or indirect photosynthetic systems include enhanced algal systems (with water mixing), polyculture, hydroponics, wetlands, and terrestrial irrigation/fertilization. The development of Clemson University's Partitioned Aquaculture System (PAS) constitutes an attempt to combine a number of the various physical, chemical, and microbial intensification techniques into a single integrated system. The PAS represents an adaptation of high rate microalgal culture to produce a sustainable, minimal discharge, high yield, and more controllable fish production process. The PAS combines the advantages of process control of recirculating tank aquaculture with the lower costs of earthen pond aquaculture. Central to the economic success of the PAS is the use of low speed (1-3 r.p.m.) paddlewheels as an energy efficient means of establishing a uniform water velocity field within an aquaculture pond. The PAS represents a redesign of the conventional aquaculture pond culture technology providing a spectrum of applications ranging from moderate yield (6700-11200 kg/ha) 'engineered ecosystems' to high yield (16800-33600 kg/ha) controlled 'production processes'. This high rate photosynthetic system offers the potential for a 90% reduction in total water usage per unit of fish produced. The modular nature of the PAS, the increased productivity per unit area, reduced water requirement, and reduced environmental impact offers the potential for fish culture systems to be installed at sites not currently suitable for conventional aquaculture.

AB The flow field and pollutant dispersion characteristics in a three-dimensional urban street canyon are investigated for various building array geometries. The street canyon in consideration is located in a multi-canopy building array that is similar to realistic estate situations. The pollutant dispersion characteristics are studied for various canopy aspect ratios, namely: the canyon height to width ratio, canyon length to height ratio, canyon breadth ratio and crossroad locations are studied. A three-dimensional field-size canyon has been analysed through numerical simulations using k - epsilon turbulence model. As expected, the wind flow and mode of pollutant dispersion is strongly dependent on the various flow geometric configurations and that the results can be different from that of a single canyon system. For example, it is found that the pollutant retention value is minimum when the canyon height-to-width ratio is approximately 0.8, or that the building height ratio is 0.5. Various rules of thumbs on urban canyon geometry have been established for good pollutant dispersion. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Changes in plant abundance within a eucalypt savanna of north-eastern Australia were studied using a manipulative fire experiment. Three fire regimes were compared between 1997 and 2001: (i) control, savanna burnt in the mid-dry season (July) 1997 only; (ii) early burnt, savanna burnt in the mid-dry season 1997 and early dry season (May) 1999; and (iii) late burnt, savanna burnt in the mid-dry season 1997 and late dry season (October) 1999. Five annual surveys of permanent plots detected stability in the abundance of most species, irrespective of fire regime. However, a significant increase in the abundance of several subshrubs, ephemeral and twining perennial forbs, and grasses occurred in the first year after fire, particularly after late dry season fires. The abundance of these species declined toward prefire levels in the second year after fire. The dominant grass Heteropogon triticeus significantly declined in abundance with fire intervals of 4 years. The density of trees (>2 m tall) significantly increased in the absence of fire for 4 years, because of the growth of saplings; and the basal area of the dominant tree Corymbia clarksoniana significantly increased over the 5-year study, irrespective of fire regime. Conservation management of these savannas will need to balance the role of regular fires in maintaining the diversity of herbaceous species with the requirement of fire intervals of at least 4-years for allowing the growth of saplings >2 m in height. Whereas late dry season fires may cause some tree mortality, the use of occasional late fires may help maintain sustainable populations of many grasses and forbs.

AB This paper deals with strategies for agrobiodiversity conservation and promotion based on studies on four plant groups (selected from 50 plant groups) occurring in the Yunnan Province of China. These plants are edible konjac (Amorphophallus), medicinal Paris, Musella lasiocarpa and wild tea (Camellia sinensis and its wild relatives), including their cultivars and wild populations. After analyzing the target plants, we conclude that the following strategies should be adopted to conserve and promote agrobiodiversity: (1) in situ conservation of agrobiodiversity, including habitat protection of wild populations, maintenance of native species and varieties in traditional agroecosystems, and relevant environmental education; (2) ex situ conservation and promotion of agrobiodiversity, including establishment of living collections and germplasm banks, and introduction of species and varieties into agroecosystems for agricultural practice; and (3) promotion and conservation of agrobiodiversity through sustainable uses, including technique development of propagation, cultivation, pest and disease control, on farm and off farm management, and other activities such as new variety breeding and scientific studies. Strategies developed here will be helpful to conserve and promote agrobiodiversity at agroecosystem, species, variety or landrace, and management system levels.

AB Pine residues originated from cuts and forestry tasks were studied with the main objective of using them as an alternative source of energy. Calorific values were measured using a static bomb calorimeter in an oxygen atmosphere. From these measurements a value of 7500 U kg(-1) for the mean lower heating value of these kind of residues was found. A rational and sustainable exploitation of the calorific energy contained in these residues can yield a gross benefit of C 2.8 x 10(8) per year through its transformation in electric energy. The study was made along one year, using samples collected in different previously characterized zones. Some other parameters such as: elementary composition, heavy metal content, flammability, and bioclimatic properties were also determined. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Two centuries of land use in the Mississippi River watershed are reflected in the water quality of its streams and in the continental shelf ecosystem receiving its discharge. The most recent influence on nutrient loading-intense and widespread farming and especially fertilizer use-has had a more significant effect on water quality than has land drainage or the conversion of native vegetation to cropland and grazing pastures. The 200-year record of nutrient loading to offshore water is reflected in the paleoreconstructed record of plankton in dated sediments. This record illustrates that the development of fair, sustained management of inland ecosystems is linked to the management of offshore systems. Land use in this fully occupied watershed is under the strong influence of national policies affecting all aspects of the human ecosphere. These policies can be modified for better or worse, but water quality will probably change only gradually because of the strong buffering capacity of the soil ecosystem.

TI Diet of bullfrogs in relation to predation on giant garter snakes at
   Colusa National Wildlife Refuge
SO CALIFORNIA FISH AND GAME
LA English
DT Article
ID RANA-CATESBEIANA
AB To evaluate predation by bullfrogs, Rana catesbeiana, on giant garter snakes, Thamnophis gigas, at Colusa National Wildlife Refuge (NWR) we collected 99 bullfrogs during three field seasons from 2000-2002. Crayfish, Procambarus clarkii, were in 90% of the bullfrogs and were usually the only food item. We found four neonate giant garter snakes in three bullfrogs. We estimated the total annual predation of bullfrogs to be about 22% of neonate production, a value similar to the 20% tail loss we documented for giant garter snakes on the Refuge as another index of bullfrog predation pressure. Even with mortality from bullfrogs and other predators, snake size classes indicate sustainable recruitment into the Colusa NWR giant garter snake population. Smaller bullfrogs and bullfrog tadpoles are also food for giant garter snakes, so further studies are needed to determine the net effect of bullfrog removal for local giant garter snake populations.

   integrated approach

DT Article
ID EFFICIENCY IMPROVEMENTS; FUEL SUBSTITUTION; SCENARIOS; CANADA;
   CONSUMPTION; BARRIERS; IMPACT; SECTOR; COSTS
AB Research in energy sustainability is gaining renewed priority because of the growing importance of climate-change issues and the ratification of the Kyoto Protocol by many countries. Increased energy efficiency and substitution of less carbon-intensive fuels are proposed as the principal means to reduce greenhouse-gas (GHG) emissions and associated climate change. The residential sector is an important area for improvement, as it accounts for 22 percent of global energy consumption. This paper illustrates the integration of four dimensions of energy issues within a single community study in Waterloo Region, Canada. First, it overcomes the limitations of single-discipline approaches to energy studies by recognizing the importance of social context in measuring the potential to reduce energy consumption. The 'sociotechnical' potential to reduce residential consumption by 25 percent is lower in our analysis than traditional measures of the technical potential, but is considered more achievable. Second, the paper examines how community-based implementation can enhance the effectiveness of a national energy efficiency program (EnerGuide for Houses, or ECH). Controlled marketing experiments demonstrated higher response rates for materials highlighting local partners. Third, the paper outlines how the local capacity developed by diverse stakeholders (city councils, regional government, federal government agencies, local utilities, local businesses, environmental nongovernmental organizations and the local university) was an important means of overcoming many of the barriers to taking action. Fourth, the paper details the examination of issues of energy efficiency and fuel substitution through a survey of residents' attitudes and comparison to behaviour. For example, stated 'willingness to pay' was compared to the actual sign-up rate for the first introduction of 'green' electricity in the Ontario residential market. The integration of these four dimensions in a single study offers a framework that can be reviewed and adapted to meet the needs of other projects.

AB Fish harvest policies typically rely on biological reference points for measures of a stock's status. We examine three common biological reference points based on fishing mortality rates corresponding to maximum sustainable yield with an age-structured deterministic model. We incorporate invariant life-history relationships into the model to maintain parsimony and focus model parameters on biologically plausible parameter space. A wide range of biological and fishery characteristics were used in the model so that our results pertain to the management of virtually any exploited population. Results indicate that two biological reference points based on spawning biomass are insensitive to life-history parameters, whereas one based on natural mortality is highly sensitive. All three depend largely on the choice of a stock-recruitment function and on steepness, a measure of the population growth rate. For each of the three, values have been previously proposed that were intended to safely apply to all fisheries; our results show that no such universal values exist. We recommend determining stock-recruitment functions a priori, establishing biological reference points on steepness explicitly and eliminating harvest policies based on the natural mortality rate altogether.

ID CELLULOSE
AB Xyloglucans and galactomannans are examples of hemicelluloses that can be accumulated in seeds of many plants, being extensively studied and used for industrial applications. Guar gum and starch are polysaccharides currently used as wet-end additives in papermaking, whereas xyloglucans have never been reported to improve paper quality. In this work we show that different types of xyloglucans improved the mechanical properties of paper sheets without affecting the optical ones. Addition of 1% (w/w) of hemicelluloses to cellulosic pulp was able to increase by about 30% the mechanical properties such as burst and tear indexes. Seeds of several species could be used as source for the production of wet-end additives, since the results did not vary with the source of polysaccharides. Even if the utilisation of these hemicelluloses will not cost less than starch or guar gum, it might represent an important strategy for sustainable use of rainforest species.

AB Ten years ago the Rio de Janeiro environmental summit injected a new urgency into the imperative that economic development must be done in ways that can be sustained for future generations. Since that summit, the concept of "Sustainability" has become widely accepted as a uniting and purposeful focus for the 21st century. In the decade since Rio science and technology has made some of its greatest ever contributions to reducing the environmental footprint of human activity, but the scorecard is still mixed. We have acknowledged some of the weaknesses of reductionist, individualist approaches that contribute to "the tragedy of the (social and environmental) commons". The challenge for chemical engineering is to evolve to suit this new context, so that it may continue to make a valued and knowledgeable contribution, emerging as a more sustainable profession.

AB There is great potential for agriculture in saline-alkali soil area in Songnen Plain, Northeast China. But the sustainable crop production in this area has been restricted by a few of main factors, such as less precipitation, higher evaporation and frequent drought, high salinity and alkalinity, high exchangeable sodium content and poor infiltration of the soil, and insufficiency and low availability in nutrition. It is also considered that there are a few of favorable conditions for agricultural development in this region, such as sufficient light and heat resources, rich ground water resources, plenty of manure produced by livestock, and so on. At the same time, scientific management and measurements have been employed; rational irrigation and drainage system has been established; reclamation, amendment and fertilization of soil, and suitable strategies of cropping practices have been made for the sustainable development of agriculture. Great progress has been made during 1996 - 2000.

AB The Daqing lakes are located in the region with sub-humid continental monsoon climate. Through historical comparison of the environment before and after oil field exploitation in the area, the paper analyses the impact of oil field exploitation on the eco-environment of the lakes, including the impact of diversion works, drainage works, exploitation and utilization of groundwater, dropped crude oil and petrochemical wastewater on the lakes water body. The analysis shows that oil field exploitation caused serious pollution to soil in the lakes area and deterioration of the eco-environment. The impact became more evident with passage of time, and the intensity varied with areas, getting more serious from west to east, which meant that the eastern part of the lakes were influenced much more seriously by the human activities. To improve the eco-environment of the Daqing lakes and make them sustainable utilization, the effective protection measures should be taken.

AB According to the on-the-spot sampling investigation, this paper analyzes the conditions of different districts, different locales and different types of the vacant commercial housing as well as the contributing factors, which was completed in recent three years in Guangzhou urban district. It is found that vacant ratio of samples in Guangzhou accounted for 20.94%, which is relatively high. The authors argue that real estate industry of Guangzhou has made rapid progress, at the same time, people should not overlook the vacant commercial housing. It will benefit the sustainable development of the real estate industry of Guangzhou to carry out effective measures and actively to make use of present vacant housing.

AB Future heads of interdisciplinary or monodisciplinary endoluminal endoscopic units as well as physician endoscopists will have to satisfy high demands on their diagnostic and therapeutic endoscopic skills. Certification for endoscopic privileges and continuous education need sustainable training and quality assurance. To achieve such goals, endoscopic skills should be measurable for assessment and not learned on patients alone. Also the number of procedures performed in any endoscopic technique should not be the only variable for assessing the quality of an endoscopist. New simulators for endoscopic training offer a completely new approach to a structured curriculum for gastrointestinal endoscopy. Computer-based simulation has a great potential to support basic manual skills in diagnostic endoscopy and may help to recognize pathologic lesions. The introduction of simulators using specially prepared animal organs has also made it possible to teach interventional endoscopic procedures step by step in an interprofessional team approach (physicians and assistants). Experienced tutors will both teach and evaluate students using validated assessment instruments as has been shown for endoscopic hemostasis. Growing experience will help us to develop new curricula for diagnostic and interventional endoscopy, which will increase safety for our patients, secure an interprofessional approach and offer continuous and documented assessment. This development will without any doubt also open new avenues for improved quality assurance in gastrointestinal endoscopy.

TI Sustainable development - From by-product synergy to capital stock

DE sustainable development; by-product synergy; FutureWatch;
   eco-efficiency; community awareness
AB Sustainable development in the mining and metallurgical industrial sectors can be implemented by two distinct groups: the managers and operators of existing facilities, working with industrial processes and systems that have been operating for many years, in some cases, several decades; and those who are engineering and building new facilities or upgrades of existing plants.
   The focus of this paper is to look at approaches and tools available to bring sustainable development thinking and action to these two distinct areas. The paper will discuss the concept of working with existing facilities and processes to minimize waste and maximize product from a regional raw material/resource consumption perspective using by-product synergy. The BPS concept has been carried out in Texas (e.g., TXI-Chaparral's STAR), in Calgary, Alberta, with Suncor assistance, in Montreal, Quebec, with Noranda as project leader, and currently in Ontario with Dofasco as industry champion. Successful outcomes are presented. The paper will also discuss a new approach to designing greenfield facilities or upgrades to existing plants using a sustainable development review process. Undertaking the review early in every project can institutionalize the concept of discussing and implementing waste elimination, design for environment, eco-efficiency, risk minimization and community awareness and involvement in the future capital stock. The review process has been developed as an excellent tool for measuring and reporting on a corporation's sustainable development progress. Examples of how this approach has been adopted in the mining and metallurgical industry, and the resultant outcomes are given.

DE sustainability; economic development; residents' attitudes
AB Given Girne's limited growth potential, tourism is its most important activity Consequently, growth has both negative and positive impacts upon the environment and its values. It is therefore important that the tourism industry remains positive and sustainable in every way it interacts with the environment. For this to happen, a strategy that takes into consideration all related aspects has to be developed. One important step towards this is to learn about the attitudes of the people whose lives are affected by tourism. The purpose of this article is to analyze the existing situation, the physical condition of the environment and to learn the expectations and attitudes of the local residents in Girne, Northern Cyprus. To accomplish this, a questionnaire survey was prepared and administered to some people living in the historic areas of Turkish Mahalle and Liman Arkasi in Girne as well as visiting tourists. They were asked to answer questions about themselves, their physical environment, their attitudes about tourism and their future expectations. The paper presents background information on tourism in Girne and summarizes the responses to questions that were put to the residents and the tourists on their needs and aspirations regarding developments for tourism.

AB Nuclear energy: obstacles and promises. Nuclear energy has distinctive merits (sustainable resources, low costs, no greenhouse gases) but its development must overcome serious hurdles (fear of accidents, radiophobia, waste management). The large unit size of present-day reactors is compatible only with large electrical grids, and involves a high capital cost. Taking into account these different factors, the paper outlines how nuclear energy may contribute to the reduction of greenhouse gases, and which are the most promising developments.

TI Mexico's community-managed forests as a global model for sustainable

SO CONSERVATION BIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION; SQUARE WHEEL; PARKS
AB Researchers concerned with sustainable management of forests in the tropics have argued that the road to improved stewardship of forest resources is the transfer of responsibility to the local communities who get their livelihoods from them. On the other hand, conservationists have declared that the only way to stem the tide of deforestation is to place as many tracts as possible under strict protection. In this context, Mexico presents a national laboratory for studying the social and ecological benefits of delivering forests to local people. As a little-noticed result of the Mexican Revolution in the second decade of the twentieth century, well over half of the forests of Mexico were placed in community-held lands. In historic struggles that passed through several phases, most of these communities have now gained substantial control over the use of their forests. Because of the substantial degree of social capital in rural forms of organization in Mexico, this control of forest resources has led to an estimated 290-479 community forest enterprises ( CFEs ), through which communities are producing timber on their own lands. New studies are beginning to suggest that important gains in both social and economic justice, good forest management, and biodiversity protection are resulting from the actions of these CFEs. As more forests globally are being devolved to local communities, it is important to carry out more research on the Mexican model of community forest management for timber production.

AB After decades of overexploitation and severe depletion, Atlantic herring stocks in waters of the northeastern United States have recovered. Fishery managers now consider the herring resource to be underexploited. Nevertheless, some fishery managers and sustainable fishery advocates in New England have expressed concern that the fishery management plan may not adequately consider the importance of herring as prey for marine mammals, seabirds, and piscivorous fish. Several studies suggest that consumption by these predators is significant, yet trophic interactions are not explicitly considered in stock assessment models. Instead, as in most fisheries stock assessments, predation is subsumed within the natural mortality rate, and no empirical estimates of herring consumption are used in the models. The goal of the present study was to assess the consumption of herring by marine mammals and to compare this level of consumption with estimates of natural mortality derived from herring stock assessment models. Using the most recent estimates of abundance and the best available data on diet, we estimated total annual consumption of herring by eight marine mammal species in the Gulf of Maine. Our results indicate that marine mammals consume 93,802-189,898 metric tons (mt; 1 metric ton = 1000 kg) of herring annually. In addition, piscivorous fish and seabirds are important predators of herring. We estimate that the consumption of herring by these upper trophic level predators may have exceeded the estimate of natural mortality used in stock assessment models by more than fourfold in 1991. We suggest that fisheries management must move beyond a single-species approach to one that includes formal consideration of trophic relationships.

AB This case study from northeastern Alberta, Canada, demonstrates a fundamentally different approach to forest management in which stakeholders balance conservation and economic objectives by weighing current management options from the point of view of their long-term effects on the forest. ALCES(R), a landscape-scale simulation model, is used to quantify the effects of the current regulatory framework and typical industrial practices on a suite of ecological and economic indicators over the next 100 yr. These simulations suggest that, if current practices continue, the combined activities of the energy and forestry industries in our 59,000 km(2) study area will cause the density of edge of human origin to increase from 1.8 km/km(2) to a maximum of 8.0 km/km(2). We also predict that older age classes of merchantable forest stands will be largely eliminated from the landscape, habitat availability for woodland caribou will decline from 43 to 6%, and there will be a progressive shortfall in the supply of softwood timber beginning in approximately 60 yr. Additional simulations involving a suite of "best practices" demonstrate that substantial improvements in ecological outcome measures could be achieved through alternative management scenarios while still maintaining a sustainable flow of economic benefits. We discuss the merits of our proposed approach to land use planning and apply it to the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin.

DT Article
AB Surveys of those applying pesticides in Cameroon was made as an initial part of a programme to introduce the adoption of minimum requirements for pesticide application equipment as the initial part of a programme for the sustainable improvement of rural workers and family health, to protect the environment and improve crop production efficiency. The survey considered those growing cocoa, coffee, oil palm, maize, cotton, tomatoes, groundnuts, plantains, bananas and various other crops. The main herbicides used by the growers were paraquat and glyphosate, while metalaxyl, maneb and copper were the principle fungicides. Cypermethrin and chlorpyrifos were the main insecticides. The survey showed that lever-operated knapsack sprayers are the most widely used type of equipment, but in the drier areas where water supplies are less readily available, CDA rotary atomiser sprayers are used, especially on cotton. Hand carried thermal foggers and motorised knapsack mistblowers were also used especilly in cocoa. Various problems with the equipment caused leakage on operators who generally did not wear protective clothing. The need for further training and dissemmination of information throughout Africa is stressed. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The incidental mortality of dusky dolphins (Lagenorhynchus obscurus) in the Patagonian trawling fishery is a well-known problem, especially in mid-water trawl fisheries for shrimp and anchovy. Therefore, it is necessary to determine if recent levels of dolphin bycatch are compatible with the persistence of the dusky dolphin population. This was assessed by comparing annual bycatch rates with a sequence of critical values. These values were based on the maximum rate of increase (r(max)) = lambda - 1, where lambda is the finite rate of increase. The finite rate of increase was estimated from a Leslie matrix where Monte Carlo procedures were employed to incorporate parameter uncertainties (age at first reproduction, survival rates, and fertility). Model life tables were used for survival, and reproductive parameters were estimated from available data on calving interval and age at sexual maturity. Uncertainties associated with annual bycatch rates were also included in the analysis through another randomization procedure that incorporated the variability in dolphin catch per unit effort, nominal fishing effort, and population size. This modeling approach rendered frequency distributions for the parameters of interest. Considering the critical values for incidental mortality rate as (1/2)R = (1/2)r(max) and (1/4)R = (1/4)r(max), and a 2-yr calving interval scenario, the probability that recent dolphin bycatch rates exceed the maximum annual removal rates were higher than 0.3. These results suggest that incidental mortality due to fishing could be, or may become, a threat for the dusky dolphin population off Patagonia. Therefore, a more accurate and intense monitoring program is needed to avoid the decline of this population. Also, this issue should be included in the fishery management strategies to be implemented in the near future.

AB Soil erosion is a physical and economic problem of natural capital degradation. Even along an intertemporally efficient trajectory, one can have in a loss of soil fertility and a continuous decline of agricultural net revenue. Moreover, soil erosion is a major source of surface water pollution in rural areas. Erosion control is thus a challenge for sustainable resource management and internalizing external effects. To sustain the level of farm income, an 'agricultural Hartwick rule' is proposed which addresses both on-farm and off-farm effects of soil erosion. First, it requires the investment of the soil rents into alternative capital. Second, additional measures are required to comply with an ambient quality target. A charge-subsidy scheme proves the most adequate from a perspective of cost-effectiveness and sustainability, if effluent charge revenues are earmarked to subsidize cropland retirement at the watershed scale. In combination with the investment of soil rents this enables to maintain the level of farm income constant over time while respecting the ambient quality target. Altogether, this fulfills the requirements of efficiency and sustainability. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The importance of non-timber forest products (NTFPs) to rural income was examined in a highland community in the Sierra de Manantlan Biosphere Reserve, Jalisco-Colima, Mexico. Rapid Rural Appraisal (RRA) techniques were used to interview 70% of households in the community of El Terrero. Of the nine plant species identified as NTFP sources, the two principal species traded by the community were tila (derived from the flowers and fruits of the tree Ternstroemia lineata), and blackberry (Rubus spp.). Collecting and selling of NTFPs was almost exclusively undertaken by women, with 80% of respondents participating. NTFP sale ranked as the most important source of cash income for 30% of women interviewed, and either second- or third-most important for the remainder. The research examined harvesting impact on populations of T lineata, an understory tree species characteristic of cloud forest, which this was assessed in the four most-frequented collecting sites. Our results suggested that current harvesting approaches appear to be sustainable, although 95% of the women interviewed reported a decline in resource availability within the last 15 years, apparently resulting from illegal cutting. Suggestions are made with respect to the sustainable development of NTFP resources to help alleviate poverty within the Reserve.

ID DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES; EDUCATION; QUALITY
AB Balochistan Province of Pakistan initiated two pilot programs attempting to induce the creation of private schools for poor girls. Randomized assignment to treatment and control groups are used to measure program effectiveness. The pilot schools were successful in urban areas, but relative failures in rural areas. Urban schools benefited from larger supplies of children not served by government schools, better availability of teachers, and more educated parents with higher incomes. Use of experienced school operators in the urban pilot was another critical difference. All urban schools appear self-sustaining or else require a modest subsidy, whereas only one rural school may survive as a private school. These pilots show that private schools may offer a viable alternative supply of educational services to poor urban neighborhoods in developing countries. However, they are not likely to offer solutions to undersupply of educational services to rural areas. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Constructing parental involvement in an education action zone: whose
   need is it meeting?
SO EDUCATIONAL STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
ID MOTHERS
AB This paper illustrates some of the tensions and contradictions in schools' attempts to develop parental and family involvement through a case study of parental involvement in an Education Action Zone. It focuses on how schools constructed parental involvement, the kinds of work they engaged in, the issues raised in managing and resourcing parental involvement projects, the perceived benefits of running the projects and the likelihood of the projects being sustainable. It is argued that the models of parental involvement that schools developed had important consequences for the role parents were allowed to play. Varying roles impose different kinds of demands on schools and parents and require different kinds of relationship between schools, parents and the local community. The more expansive the view of parental involvement, the greater the costs in running such projects and, hence, particularly in poor areas, the less chance of them being sustainable. Moreover, there were evident contradictions between the standards and inclusion dimensions of parental involvement projects. In particular, there was, and is, an evident tension for the schools around constructing parents as a resource for schools to tap into in the drive to raise standards and constructing the school as a resource for parents and the wider community to tap into in the drive to promote local regeneration and inclusion. This is being resolved in favour of the standards agenda.

AB Biomass is an attractive renewable fuel to supplement coal combustion in utility boilers. Coal cofiring was successful with up to a 20% biomass mix. Results of extensive applications have shown that cofiring of biomass with coal have accomplished the following: (1) increased boiler efficiency, (2) reduced fuel costs and (3) reduced emissions of NOx and fossil CO2. Every ton of biomass cofired directly reduces fossil CO2 emissions by over 1 ton. Woody biomass contains virtually no sulfur, so SO2 emissions are reduced in direct proportion to the coal replacement. Biomass is a regenerable biofuel. When a fossil fuel is replaced by a biofuel, there is a net reduction in CO2 emissions. Biomass can contain considerable alkali and alkaline earth elements and chlorine, which, when mixed with other gas components derived from coal such as sulfur compounds, promotes a different array of vapor and fine particulate deposition in coal fired boilers.

AB The problem of massive emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) from the burning of fossil fuels and their climatic impact have become major scientific and political issues. Future stabilization of the atmospheric CO2 content requires a drastic decrease Of CO2 emissions worldwide. In this study, energy utilization and its major environmental impacts are discussed from the standpoint of sustainable development, including anticipated patterns of future energy use and subsequent environmental issues in Turkey. Several aspects relating to energy utilization, renewable energy, energy efficiency, environment and sustainable development are examined from both current and future perspectives. Turkey is an energy importing country; with more than half of the energy requirement being supplied by imports. Domestic oil and lignite reserves are limited, and the lignites are characterised by high ash, sulfur and moisture contents. Because of increasing energy consumption, air pollution is becoming a great environmental concern for the future in the country. In this regard, renewable energy resources appear to be one of the most efficient and effective solutions for sustainable energy development and environmental pollution prevention in Turkey. Turkey's geographical location has several advantages for extensive use of most of the renewable energy sources. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI European schemes for promoting renewables in liberalised markets
SO ENERGY POLICY
LA English
DT Article
AB The paper describes possibilities and problems for penetration of supply systems based on renewable energy sources in liberalised markets. The analysis is based on recent development in EU with different models for support of installations based on renewable energy. These include feed-in models with guaranteed minimum tariffs, tender models for different bands of technologies, and green certificates trading models with obligatory consumer quota. The paper describes the market situation in selected European countries, including Germany, the UK, Holland and Denmark. An EU directive from September 2001 has postponed the decision on a possible harmonisation of promotional models until at least 2005 in order to obtain more practical experience with the different support schemes. A critical evaluation is given in this paper of the different models with proposals for a balanced development between environmental and trading concerns. It is argued that too much emphasis is presently given to the side of free trade at the expense of long range planning for a sustainable energy development. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

TI Carbon quota price and CDM potentials after Marrakesh
SO ENERGY POLICY
LA English
DT Article
DE Kyoto protocol; carbon market; quota price; CDM potentials
AB The Kyoto Protocol sets quantified GHG emission reduction commitments for Annex I Parties. But their emission reduction requirements related to BAU projections, one of the key factors to effect on future carbon market, are uncertain. Both the decisions made in Bonn and Marrakesh would have further consequences for how the future carbon market will take shape. This paper, with application of the carbon emission reduction trading model, evaluates future carbon quota price and Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) potentials under different BAU projections, and does sensitivity analysis on carry-over of AAUs, CERs and ERUs, implementation rate, transaction cost, holding of CERs in Non-Annex I Parties, etc. to assess the impacts of relevant decisions of COP6-bis and COP7 on the carbon market.
   Under different BAU projections, future carbon quota price and CDM potentials could vary widely. Carry over of AAUs, CERs, ERUs, and holding of CERs in Non-Annex I Parties could raise both quota price and total CDM potentials considerably. Implementation rate could have big impacts on both carbon quota price and CDM potentials, especially for the cases formerly with relatively high CDM potentials, and it could also change the regional distribution of CDM potentials. Transaction cost's effect on the carbon market would be comparatively low, but would become unignorable in the market whose quota price is low. It would lead to a downward trend in price while upward in CDM potentials when increasing the implementation rate or lowering transaction cost.
   Withdrawal of USA would dramatically shrink carbon price and credit amount, and large numbers of hot air and sink credits would further greatly crowd out the CDM projects; carry over of AAUs, CERs and ERUs, holding of CERs in Non-Annex I Parties, prompt start of CDM projects, etc., would, however, enhance the total CDM credits to ensure more investment and technology flow to developing countries to promote their sustainable development.

AB Environmental decisions made by individuals, civil society, and the state involve questions of economic efficiency, environmental effectiveness, equity, and political legitimacy. These four criteria are constitutive of the economic, social, and environmental dimensions of sustainable development, which has become the dominant rhetorical device of environmental governance. We discuss the tendency for disciplinary research to focus on particular subsets of the four criteria, and argue that such a practice promotes solutions that do not acknowledge the dynamics of scale and the heterogeneity of institutional contexts. We advocate an interdisciplinary framework for the analysis of environmental decisionmaking that seeks to identify legitimate and context-sensitive institutional solutions producing equitable, efficient, and effective outcomes. We demonstrate the usefulness of our approach by using it to examine decisions concerning contested nature conservation and multiple-use commons in the management of Hickling Broad in Norfolk in the United Kingdom. We conclude that interdisciplinary approaches enable the generalisation and transfer of lessons in a way that respects the specifics and context of the issue at hand.

AB The author reports the results of a survey of more than five hundred local planners in the United States. The purpose of the survey was to measure the extent to which an ecological definition of sustainable development is reflected in planners' views and opinions. Through statistical and other quantitative analyses of the results of the survey, it was found that the conceptual integration of sustainability is most related to the planners' academic background, the state public policy context in which they work, and their general level of support for the concept. Although there is much consistency between planners' views and sustainability there remain several areas of conceptual conflict, primarily in relation to nonurban issues (that is, agriculture and natural open space) and private market forces that affect the use of land.

AB Research on the effects of ozone on agricultural crops and agro-ecosystems is needed for the development of regional emission reduction strategies, to underpin practical recommendations aiming to increase the sustainability of agricultural land management in a changing environment, and to secure food supply in regions with rapidly growing populations. Major limitations in current knowledge exist in several areas: (1) Modelling of ozone. transfer and specifically stomatal ozone uptake under variable environmental conditions, using robust and well-validated dynamic models that can be linked to large-scale photochemical models lack coverage. (2) Processes involved in the initial reactions of ozone with extracellular and cellular components after entry through the stomata, and identification of key chemical species and their role in detoxification require additional study. (3) Scaling the effects from the level of individual cells to the whole-plant requires, for instance, a better understanding of the effects of ozone on carbon transport within the plant. (4) Implications of long-term ozone effects on community and whole-ecosystem level processes, with an emphasis on crop quality, element cycling and carbon sequestration, and biodiversity of pastures and rangelands require renewed efforts.
   The UNECE Convention on Long Range Trans-boundary Air Pollution shows, for example, that policy decisions may require the use of integrated assessment models. These models depend on quantitative exposure-response information to link quantitative effects at each level of organization to an effective ozone dose (i.e., the balance between the rate of ozone uptake by the foliage and the rate of ozone detoxification). In order to be effective in a policy, or technological context, results from future research must be funnelled into an appropriate knowledge transfer scheme. This requires data synthesis, up-scaling, and spatial aggregation. At the research level, interactions must be considered between the effects of ozone and factors that are either directly manipulated by man through crop management, or indirectly changed. The latter include elevated atmospheric CO2, particulate matter, other pollutants such as nitrogen oxides, UV-B radiation, climate and associated soil moisture conditions.

AB The regulation of the emissions of 'traditional' primary air pollutants (fluorides, sulfur dioxide) has changed the pattern of exposure of ecological systems, with greatly reduced exposure close to sources, but with a smaller effect in some remote areas. Measurements show that recovery is occurring at some sites, in fresh water chemistry (reduced acidity) and in sensitive biota (sustainable fish populations). However, the pattern of change in exposure has not always been simply related to emission reductions. An understanding of responses to recent changes will improve our predictions of the response to future emission changes, both locally and globally.
   As exposure to 'traditional' pollutants is reduced, the potential for other pollutants to have effects becomes more evident. In the aqueous phase, we need to understand the role of soluble and suspended organics, but this also means explicit recognition of the possibility of phase exchange, and the role of photolytic reactions on plant, soil, and water surfaces. Do highly reactive free radicals in the atmosphere, formed by the action of sunlight on volatile organic compounds, have direct effects on plants? Organic compounds and heavy metals may be bioactive as gases and particles, but for many potentially toxic compounds, the experimental evidence for biotic response is very limited.
   To evaluate the potential effects of pollutants, we need to understand the pathways by which airborne pollutants enter and react within ecosystems. For vegetation, we have to consider bidirectional fluxes, and distinguish among uptake through stomata, through leaf surfaces, or through roots. There are several challenges for the future. (1) Can we devise experiments that permit exposure of vegetation to gases, particles, and/or aqueous pollutants at 'realistic' concentrations? (2) Can we include the potential interactions with photolytically derived free radicals, and the dynamics of exchange? (3) How do we allow for responses to pollutant mixtures, or the simultaneous exposure to pollutants in gas, particle, and aqueous phases? The recognition of the importance of the dynamic exchange of pollutants between phases will be the key to the development of effective experimental approaches to evaluating cause-effect relationships between pollutant mixtures and ecosystem responses.

AB Human health vulnerabilities to ecosystem degradation are well documented. Destabilization of natural ecosystems and the biosphere have posed an entirely new set of risks to human health and preclude any simple extrapolations from the past. Newly emerging diseases, increasing prevalence of many vector borne diseases, increased exposure to harmful UV radiation and a number of other transformations in the natural environment, have decidedly negative implications for the sustainability of human health. Curricula in medical schools are responding to these new realities by exposing the connections between health and ecology. The program in Ecosystem Health at the University of Western Ontario serves as one model for connecting these disciplines. This program has resulted in a perceptible shift in values and professional responsibilities of emerging physicians. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Mesoamerica (Southern Mexico, Guatemala, Belize, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica and Panama) is a culturally diverse region considered a conservation priority due to its biotic richness and high endemism. The Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) sets out obligations and objectives for national parties to cope with biodiversity reduction, and encourages these national parties to develop measures to conserve and manage biodiversity. This paper presents trends in Mesoamerican countries in the implementation of the CBD, specifically in relation to the general measures for conservation and sustainable use (Article 6), identification and monitoring (Article 7), and in situ conservation (Article 8) derived from examination of reports from the CBD National Reports unit, questionnaires to national focal points, and interviews in the field. In general, there was increased effort toward CBD implementation and related issues. The scientific capacity, political stability, and accessibility to resources in each country, however, influenced the rate at which capacity was being built and the relative importance governments afforded to each of the CBD articles. Lack of resources or institutional limitations are identified as major impediments to fulfilling obligations. The CBD is also poorly known among actors in civil society and at several levels of administration. Overall, Costa Rica and Mexico are exceptions in the region with regard to inventory and monitoring, and the efforts to incorporate biodiversity into broader intersectoral policies. However, the measures required to ensure the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from biodiversity arc poorly developed, or not developed at all, in the region. It is pivotal that, since Mesoamerica is one of the poorest regions in the world, any attempt to conserve biodiversity in the region must include sustainable use and equity.

AB Reclamation of saline lands seems difficult for climatic and economic reasons, but cultivation of salt-tolerant plants is an approach to increasing productivity and improvement of salt-affected wastelands. A five-year field study was conducted to evaluate the effects of growing a salt-tolerant species Leptochloa fusca (L.) Kunth (kallar grass) on chemical properties of a saline sodic soil irrigated with poor quality groundwater. Soil salinity, sodicity and pH decreased exponentially by growing kallar grass as a result of leaching of salts from surface (0-20 cm) to lower depths (>100 cm). Concentrations of soluble cations (Na+, K+, Ca2+ and Mg2+) and anions (Cl-, SO42- and HCO3-) were reduced through to greater soil depths. A significant decline in soil pH was attributed to release of CO2 by grass roots and solublization of CaCO3. Both soil salinity and soil pH were significantly correlated with Na+, Ca2+, Mg2+, K+, Cl-, HCO3- and sodium adsorption ratio (SAR). Significant correlations were found between soluble cations (Na+, Ca2+ and K+), soluble anions (Cl-, SO42- and HCO3-) and the SAR. In contrast, there were negative correlations between soil organic matter content and all chemical properties. The ameliorative effects on the soil chemical environment were pronounced after three years of growing kallar grass. Cultivation of kallar grass enhanced leaching and interactions among soil chemical properties and thus restored soil fertility. The soil maintained the improved characteristics with further growth of the grass up to five years suggesting that growing salt-tolerant plants is a sustainable approach to biological amelioration of saline wastelands.

TI An uncommon alliance: Ecofeminism and classical Daoist philosophy
SO ENVIRONMENTAL ETHICS
LA English
DT Article
AB Classical philosophical Daoism and ecofeminism converge on key points. Ecofeminism's critique of Western dualistic metaphysics finds support in Daoism's nondualistic, particularist, cosmological framework, which distinguishes pairs of complementary opposites within a process of dynamic transformation without committing itself to a binary, essentialist position as regards sex and gender. Daoism's epistemological implications suggest a link to ecofeminism's alignment with a situational and provisional model of knowledge. As a transformative philosophy, the cluster of concepts that give specificity to the Daoist notion of transformation offers content and direction for the notion of transformation central to many ecofeminist philosophies. These affinities offer possibilities for developing the relevance of both philosophies to bear upon a theoretical understanding of how we can live in a respectful and sustainable relationship with our natural environment.

TI The evolving forest regime and domestic actors: Strategic or normative
   adaptation?
SO ENVIRONMENTAL POLITICS
LA English
DT Article
ID WORLD
AB How have forest-related international environmental agreements (IEAs) affected domestic policy and forest owners in industrialised, forest-rich countries? This question is investigated by identifying and explaining the effects of IEAs on Norwegian forest policy and forestry. The analysis shows that international commitments and recommendations have had little effect on domestic forest policy. While environmental certification of forest owners by private initiative is in compliance with international recommendations and European criteria and indicators of sustainable forest management, competitiveness concerns and pressures from environmental organisations and the marketplace have been more important for this initiative than IEAs. Although environmental certification can be explained as strategic adaptation to market demands, this mechanism is dependent upon actors valuing and having internalised certain norms and principles. It is argued that IEAs have contributed to establish, strengthen and disseminate norms and principles regarding conservation of old-growth forests and biodiversity. The interplay between rational calculative and cognitive processes is thus important for understanding domestic adaptations to forest-related agreements.

AB We shed light on the Hartwick rule for capital accumulation and resource depletion by providing semantic clarifications and investigating the implications and relevance of this rule. We extend earlier results by establishing that the Hartwick rule does not indicate sustainability and does not require substitutability between man-made and natural capital. We use a new class of simple counterexamples (i) to obtain the novel finding that a negative value of net investments need not entail that utility is unsustainable, and (ii) to point out deficiencies in the literature.

SO EPISODES
LA English
DT Article
AB Groundwater is an important but under-utilised water resource. Its use is growing. Approaches to the management of groundwater are evolving, with sustainability as the current approach it? New Zealand, and other countries. Models of aquifer geometry, geology, groundwater flow, and groundwater quality are developed from observed data. These models are integrated using an economic model of groundwater use and groundwater quality to predict the total economic value of groundwater. This approach to modelling the sustainability of groundwater is demonstrated for the Delta Zone of the groundwater system it? the Waimea Plains, Nelson, New Zealand.
   Four scenarios of use are investigated; actual, allocated, two-times allocated and five-times allocated. It is predicted that the economic value of irrigation from groundwater in the zone is $2 million with actual and allocated water usage. With use of two-times allocated, the economic value of irrigation from groundwater is $3.5 million. The Waimea River is predicted to be dry for at least one week in a dry year with this scenario. The economic value of irrigation from groundwater is -$1.3 million with water use of five times irrigation. This economic loss is due to land being taken out of production because of saltwater intrusion, and the costs of moving a water supply system caused by predicted saltwater intrusion. This research provides key information to assist the water management agency in setting allocation limits for groundwater resources.

TI The diffusion of new environmental policy instruments
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL RESEARCH

ID EUROPEAN-UNION; GREEN; CONVERGENCE; STRATEGIES; STATES
AB New Environmental Policy Instruments (NEPIs) are becoming increasingly attractive. From a global perspective, there has been a rapid diffusion of these market-based, voluntary or informational instruments. This article examines the spread of four different NEPIs - eco-labels, energy or carbon taxes, national environmental policy plans or strategies for sustainable development, and free-access-of-information (FAI) provisions. The adoption of NEPIs by national policy makers is not simply a reaction to newly emerging environmental problems or to real or perceived deficits of traditional command and control regulation, rather the use of NEPIs can also be ascribed to the inner dynamics of international processes of policy transfer or policy diffusion. These processes make it increasingly difficult for national policy makers to ignore new approaches in environmental policy that have already been put into practice in 'forerunner' countries.

AB With our biosphere steadily degrading, a solid psychological perspective on environmental, social, and economic (un)sustainability is urgently needed. This should supplement and strengthen biological, technological, and economic perspectives. After discussing positivistic and constructive psychology, we summarize major environmental problems with their social and economic implications. We also compose some essential psychological reasoning about them, including the commons dilemma model, different behavioral processes and strategies of behavior change, and various aspects of human quality of life (QoL). Psychologists can help analyze and mitigate the biggest sustainability problems: population growth, resource-intensive consumption, and harmful technologies-if their research is well-tuned to other environmental sciences, if the incentive structure for this work is improved, and if more attention is paid to the collective side of human behavior.

AB In sustainable inland fisheries management, the principle of ecosystem-based management encompasses a shift from single-species management driven by stocking towards a systems CC view characterized mainly by habitat rehabilitation. It is not clear whether anglers are aware tn of this paradigm shift. Thus, in a mail survey of anglers living in Berlin, Germany, we assumed that the majority of anglers perceive habitat rehabilitation to be the most beneficial action for improving recreational fisheries. Based on the answer pattern to an open-ended question, this hypothesis was rejected. The respondents suggested dimensions such as price, stocking, access, and enforcement considerably more frequently than measures to rehabilitate habitats. One explanation might be that anglers experience a shifting baseline syndrome as suggested earlier for fisheries scientists. If this syndrome applies on a larger scale, this has implications for long-term performance of ecosystem-based recreational fisheries management because of low constituency support for conducting habitat rehabilitation projects.

DE catch rates; growth rate; Metapenaeus dobsoni; recruitment
AB The population dynamics of Metapenaeus dobsoni (Miers) from the west coast of Sri Lanka was investigated based on catch/effort and length frequency data, using FiSAT software. Annual yield of M. dobsoni was estimated at 296 t in 1998 and 362 t in 1999. This species formed 54% of the total shrimp catch from the system. The asymptotic length (L (infinity) ) and the growth rate constant (K ) were estimated to be 11.49 cm and 1.02 yr(-1) for males and 12.8 cm and 1.73 yr(-1) for females. The fishing mortality coefficients were 2.42 and 1.85 yr(-1) for males and females, respectively. The natural mortality was estimated at 1.72 yr(-1) for males and 2.51 yr(-1) for females. The recruitment for the estuarine environment and the offshore areas was continuous but peaked twice per year. The maximum sustainable yield (MSY) was estimated at 294.65 t, around the current catch estimates. To obtain maximum sustainable economic yield (MSE = 293.56 t) the present effort should be reduced by 10%.

AB To develop practical and objective measures of forest condition, the Bioindicators of Forest Sustainability Project has. used a physiological, remote sensing approach that emphasizes identifying early warning measures of stress effects in forests. While stress indicators exist at the leaf level (e.g., chlorophyll fluorescence, pigment levels), developing reliable indicators at the canopy level is a challenge. Hyperspectral sensors, such as the Compact Airborne Spectrographic Imager (CASI), may be useful in remotely detecting vegetation stress effects. In this study, an inverse modeling approach demonstrated that the CASI could be used to map chlorophyll content (root mean square errors ranging from 12.6 to 13.0 mg/cm(2)) following different silvicultural treatments in a tolerant hardwood (sugar maple [Acer saccharum M.]) forest. This capability could be readily applied to operationally assessing forest physiological strain and in classifying forest condition based on chlorophyll content. A change analysis study was also conducted to evaluate chlorophyll estimation across seasons for a range of sites. The implications of these findings and recommendations for a prototype system to monitor forest condition are presented.

AB 1. Given the allometric scaling of thermoregulatory capacity in birds, and the cold and exposed Arctic environment, it was predicted that Arctic-breeding shorebirds should incur high costs during incubation. Using doubly labelled water (DLW), daily energy expenditure (DEE) during incubation was measured in eight shorebird species weighing between 29 and 142 g at various sites in the Eurasian and Canadian High Arctic. The results are compared with a compilation of similar data for birds at lower latitudes.
   2. There was a significant positive correlation between species average DEE and body mass (DEE (kJ day(-1) )=28.12 BM (g)(0.524) , r(2)=0.90). The slopes of the allometric regression lines for DEE on body mass of tundra-breeding birds and lower latitude species (a sample mostly of passerines but including several shorebirds) are similar (0.548 vs 0.545). DEE is about 50% higher in birds on the tundra than in temperate breeding areas.
   3. Data for radiomarked Red Knots for which the time budgets during DLW measurements were known, indicated that foraging away from the nest on open tundra is almost twice as costly as incubating a four-egg clutch.
   4. During the incubation phase in the High Arctic, tundra-breeding shorebirds appear to incur among the highest DEE levels of any time of the year. The rates of energy expenditure measured here are among the highest reported in the literature so far, reaching inferred ceilings of sustainable energy turnover rates.

ID TROPICAL MYCOLOGY
AB The challenge of monitoring and safeguarding the Earth's fungal resources is a daunting one that must be confronted. With only 74-120 K of the estimated 1.5 million fungal species on the planet described and limited human and financial resources, how can we identify priority areas for both systematic research and conservation? Further, what balance should be aspired to between in situ and ex situ conservation, and how should that be reflected in national and international policy? Mycology has too low a profile and remains an orphan within botany and microbiology; how can that perception be changed? The systems in place for educating new generations of mycologists are also failing; how can that be rectified? While contact between mycologists nationally, regionally, and globally has improved remarkably in the last two decades, concerted action on a scale hitherto not attempted is necessary to address these fundamental questions. Some actions for inclusion in a potential new international initiative designed to start to redress some of these key issues are suggested. The proposals include actions needing to be taken by individuals through to ones meriting coverage in international intergovernmental treaties: many are accompanied by targets and datelines. This contribution is intended to serve as a draft action plan (MycoAction Plan) for discussion, elaboration, and revision by the whole mycological community - working under the auspices of the International Mycological Association (IMA). It is envisioned that there will be plans for action from the worldwide (MycoAction Worldwide Plan) to the personal (MycoAction Personal Plan).

TI Sustainable Internet access for the rural poor? Elements of an emerging
   Indian model
SO FUTURES
LA English
DT Article
AB Although there are many projects, mainly supported by international donors, demonstrating that the Internet can be supplied to rural areas in developing countries, the real objective is to make these projects sustainable on a commercial basis. Among other things, this type of sustainability will require a project with unusually low costs of Internet delivery to poor, isolated users. In this paper we have examined a case from India, which uses a unique combination of low-cost indigenous technology and a low-cost model of delivery that exploits the ability of the informal sector to respond and adapt to local needs. This model, we feel, may serve as an example, to other developing countries seeking to bridge the global Digital Divide. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Waste reduction in focus
SO FUTURES
LA English
DT Article
AB Waste reduction and greater efficiency have the appearance of desirable and laudable initiatives in the quest for sustainability. There are undeniable benefits but they are limited. The emphasis on waste reduction is still on the end products, on reuse and recycling. The emphasis on efficiency is too restricted for it has multiple meanings. The benefits are limited-fundamentally because of the disordered state (high entropy) of our wastes, paradoxically because efficiency encourages consumption rather than conservation, and commercially because of deficiencies in our economic system. The emphases are well intentioned but counter-productive while we continue to employ processes and develop products not found in nature. They divert our attention away from developing processes and products which emulate the natural world. Natural processes restore order (low entropy), are effective, while being intrinsically efficient and extrinsically inefficient, and furthermore are desirably wasteful, thus promoting biodiversity unlike man-made processes and products.

AB The soil quality concept evolved throughout the 1990s in response to increased global emphasis on sustainable land use and with a holistic focus emphasizing that sustainable soil management requires more than soil erosion control. The concept includes two areas of emphasis-education and assessment-both based soundly on principles of soil science. Soil quality test kits, farmer-based scorecards, visual assessment procedures, fact sheets, and video presentations were developed as educational materials because many people have no basis to recognize, understand or appreciate the complexity of soil resources. Assessment tools for indexing soil quality at various scales were pursued to show the multiple functions (e.g. nutrient and water cycling, filtering and buffering of contaminants, decomposition of crop residues and other organic matter sources, and recycling of essential plant nutrients) that soils provide as the foundation for sustainable land management. Worldwide research and technology transfer efforts have increased awareness that soil resources have both inherent characteristics determined by their basic soil formation factors and dynamic characteristics influenced by human decisions and management practices. Soil quality assessment and education are intended to provide a better understanding and awareness that soil resources are truly living bodies with biological, chemical, and physical properties and processes performing essential ecosystem services.

AB Soil quality (SQ) assessment tools may facilitate adaptive management decisions that promote sustainable agricultural practices. However, without input from the target audience, these decision tools' potential for adoption remains unknown. In an effort to consider the end-user in SQ index development, we examined fanner reactions to index outcomes and uses for soil quality information. We calculated SQ indices for side-by-side comparisons of alternative (organic amendment) and conventional practices in the San Joaquin Valley, CA. The indices integrated chemical, biological, and physical data collected over 3 years in a participatory, on-farm demonstration project. In a focus group format, we asked the participating farmers about their perceptions of SQ in the study fields. We then asked the farmers to compare their perceptions with the calculated SQ indices by rating the amount of agreement between the two on a scale from 1 to 10, with 10 being excellent agreement. The survey results showed a mean of 8 and standard deviation = 1 (N = 12). When we presented all participants with a variety of output options for soil quality indicator information, they were asked to rate each for usefulness and understandability. The apparent disparity among their preferences (high ratings for the most and the least integrated data) was explained by the suggestion of several farmers that it would be most useful to have access to several forms of the information. Participants also discussed how they would most likely use the tools and what information would be needed for them to change a management practice. A demonstrated link between soil quality and economics was the most discussed need. In response to the farmers' emphasis on economic outcomes, we compared our SQ index with yield results (as one component of net revenue) for participating fields. Pearson correlation coefficients showed statistically significant correlations between yield and SQ index outcomes. Correlations were stronger within subsets of the data grouped by crop or soil suborder.

AB Salt-affected soils could produce useful forages when, irrigated with saline drainage water. To assess the productive potential and sustainability of using drainage water for forage production, a saline-sodic site (32.4 ha) in California's San Joaquin Valley was characterized for soil quality. The objectives were (1) to spatially characterize initial soil physicochemical properties relevant to maintaining soil quality on an and zone soil and (2) to characterize soil quality relationships and spatial variability.
   An initial mobile electromagnetic (EM) induction survey was conducted in 1999, with bulk soil electrical conductivity (ECa) readings taken at 384 geo-referenced locations, followed by an intensive mobile fixed-array survey with a total of 7288 geo-referenced ECa readings. Using the EM data and a spatial statistics program (ESAP v2.0), 40 sites were selected that reflected the spatial heterogeneity of the ECa measurements for the study area. At these sites, soil-core samples were taken at 0.3-m intervals to a depth of 1.2 m. Duplicate samples were taken at eight sites to study the local-scale variability of soil properties. Soil-core samples were analyzed for a variety of physical and chemical properties related to the soil quality of and zone soils.
   Soils were found to be highly spatially heterogeneous. For composite soil-core samples taken to a depth of 1.2 m, ECe (electrical conductivity of the saturation extract) varied from 12.8 to 36.6 dS m(-1), SAR from 28.8 to 88.8, and clay content from 2.5% to 48.3%. B and Mo concentrations varied from 11.5 to 32.2 mg l(-1) and 476.8 to 1959.6 mug l(-1), respectively. CaCO3, NO3- in the saturation extract, exchangeable Ca2+, Se, and As consistently had the highest coefficients of variation (CV) while pH(e), Pb, and Ca2+ in the saturation extract consistently had the lowest CVs at all depths. A one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to spatially partition the local- and global-scale variability. Local-scale variability was greatest for pH,. Laboratory measurements of saturated hydraulic conductivity (K-s) were very low (0.0000846-0.0456 cm h(-1)), whereas field measurements were considerably higher (0.49-1.79 cm h(-1)). Based on the Cl- data, the leaching fraction (LF) for the entire study area was estimated to be 17%.
   Soil quality was reflected in yield and chemical analysis of forage. Forage Mo contents determined from newly established Bermuda grass varied from 1 to 5 mg kg(-1) on a dry matter basis, and Cu/Mo ratios averaged 3.3, while forage yield in the establishment year declined with ECe, and failed to grow above ECe levels of approximately 22 dS m(-1). The initial soil quality assessment of the research site indicated that the sustainability of drainage water reuse at this location would depend upon maintaining, a sufficient LF with careful consideration and management of salinity, boron, molybdenum, and sodium levels.

TI Soil management effects on the nonlimiting water range

DE NLWR; oxygen diffusion; mechanical resistance
AB Water, oxygen, temperature, and mechanical resistance (MR) are soil physical properties that directly affect plant growth. In this research, the nonlimiting water range (NLWR), defined as the range of soil water content in which neither water, oxygen, nor MR is limiting for plant growth, was measured on soil samples from three field experiments. Undisturbed soil core samples were collected from an experimental field on Wasco silt loam (coarse-loamy, mixed, nonacid, thermic Typic Torriorthents) amended with dairy manure (25 and 50 ton/ha), sludge composting biosolids/green waste (25 and 50 ton/ha), and a control treatment from Shafter Field Experiment Station, Kern County. Similar samples were collected from a Reiff loam (coarse-loamy, mixed, nonacid, thermic Mollie Xerofluvents) and Yolo silt loam (fine-silty, mixed, nonacid, thermic Mollie Xerofluvents) treated with conventional 4-year rotation, conventional 2-year rotation, low-input, and organic farming systems in the Sustainable Agricultural Farming System (SAFS) in Davis, CA. The third set of samples were from a fine sandy soil (mixed, thermic, Typic Haplargid) irrigated with four saline waters with EC values of 0.5, 4.0, 8.0, and 12.0 dS m(-1) in a pistachio orchard located at Paramount Farms, Kern County, CA. The core samples were used to determine saturated hydraulic conductivity and water retention at - 1500 kPa (wilting point) and - 10 kPa (field capacity) to calculate the available water content and the NLWR. Oxygen diffusion rates (ODRs) were measured on the soil cores after they were equilibrated to field capacity, and MR was measured using an automated mini-penetrometer after the soil was equilibrated to - 1500 kPa. The results showed that organic amendments did not significantly change the ODR, MR, NLWR, and saturated hydraulic conductivity (K,). Mean values of MR and ODR were not significantly different in the four agricultural systems either, but soil under organic farming system had a relatively narrow NLWR because less water was retained at field capacity, indicating that the soil surface under this farming system has more large pores. The mean K-s was significantly higher in conventional 4- and 2-year rotations than in organic and low-input treatments. Increasing irrigation water salinity above 4 dS m(-1) progressively decreased the saturated hydraulic conductivity but had relatively little effect on other physical properties. In general, the treatment variables had relatively little effect on the NLWR, ODR, MR, or of surface soils, except for a decrease in K-s when irrigated with waters with more than 4 dS m(-1).

ID VALUATION; CONSULTATION
AB This paper develops a decision support system for evaluation of wetland ecosystem management strategy and examines its, so far partial, application in a case study of an important complex coastal wetland known as the Norfolk and Suffolk Broads, in the east of England, UK. Most managed ecosystems are complex and often poorly understood hierarchically organized systems. Capturing the range of relevant impacts on natural and human systems under different management options will be a formidable challenge. Biodiversity has a hierarchical structure which ranges from the ecosystem and landscape level, through the community level and down to the population and genetic level. There is a need to develop methodologies for the practicable detection of ecosystem change, as well as the evaluation of different ecological functions. What is also required is a set of indicators (environmental, social and economic) which facilitate the detection of change in ecosystems suffering stress and shock and highlight possible drivers of the change process. A hierarchical classification of ecological indicators of sustainability would need to take into account existing interactions between different organization levels, from species to ecosystems. Effects of environmental stress are expressed in different ways at different levels of biological organization and effects at one level can be expected to impact other levels, often in unpredictable ways. The management strategy, evaluation methodologies and indicators adopted should also assess on sustainability grounds whether any given management option is supporting, or reducing, the diversity of functions which are providing stakeholders with the welfare benefits they require.

AB The Matsukawa geothermal power station has continued successful power generation since 1966. The wells and reservoir have shown a very slow decline, which is a result of appropriate station sizing and adequate operational criteria. The power plant was sized only to meet the demand of the company's factory for its in-house electric use, instead of full utilization of the resource. The power plant has been operated so as to maximize the profit instead of insisting on operating continuously at full power. A proper understanding of the reservoir has helped to maintain stable operation. Station sizing (23.5 MWe since 1993) appears to be the most important factor in the successful development and operation of the Matsukawa geothermal field. The Matsukawa development is an example of the successful application of the MiniMax principle to the development of a geothermal project. (C) 2003 CNR. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB This paper describes factors facilitating and working against successful community mobilization in the implementation of an integrated prevention programme for cardiovascular disease and lung cancer in four community settings in Quebec, Canada. Implementation evaluation data from several sources showed that over the 3-year period, mobilization was partly achieved in all four communities, although the degree of success varied. The data support those of previous studies showing that several factors are key to effective intersectoral community mobilization: (i) involvement of concerned and influential community members with a commitment to shared goals and a visible community focus; (ii) formation of multi-organization systems among appropriate organizations, recognizing their strengths, resources and competencies, and preserving both their autonomy and interdependence with an appreciation of divergent perspectives; (iii) development of decision-making mechanisms through the setting up of formal structural arrangements to facilitate decisions with clear leadership; (iv) clear definition of objectives, tasks, roles and responsibilities; and (v) official support and legitimization from participating agencies, government authorities, and organizations with adequate resources devoted to partnership building. This study also replicated a number of barriers to the creation of sustainable intersectoral community mobilization, notably the potentially destructive role of power conflicts among the key institutional partners.

AB The development of resistance to all the currently available anthelmintic classes by the important nematode parasites of grazing livestock presents a major challenge to the continuation of efficient livestock productivity. The situation is most serious in the small ruminant (sheep and goat) industries, particularly in the hot and humid regions of the world, but is escalating at such a rate that all countries with significant sheep and goat numbers must consider that tackling this problem is an urgent priority. Although anthelmintic resistance in cattle parasites appears to be of minor concern, there is clear evidence that this is now increasing. This review presents an overview of the principles developed by experts, on ways to manage the conflicting objectives of efficient worm control and at the same time delay the selection for anthelmintic resistance.

The growth attributed to rising exports of low-value, contract furniture is not sustainable in the long-term as other cheaper manufacturers emerge. Industry liberalization coupled with the use of skilled workers, and not industrial policy, are the strategic elements for sustainability.

AB Greenhouse hydroponics and field experiments were conducted to determine how nitrogen (N) fertilizer treatments affect tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.) growth, yield, and partitioning of N in an effort to develop more sustainable fertilization strategies. In a hydroponics study, after 4 weeks in nitrate treatments, shoot dry weight was five times greater at 10.0 than at 0.2 mm nitrate. An exponential growth model was strongly correlated with tomato root growth at all but 0.2 mm nitrate and shoot growth in 10 mm nitrate. Root dry weight was only 15% of shoot biomass. In field studies with different population densities and N rates, height in the 4.2 plants/m(2) was similar, but shoot weight was less than in the 3.2 plants/m(2). At 12 weeks after planting, shoot fresh weight averaged 3.59 and 2.67 kg/plant in treatments with 3.2 and 4.2 plants/m(2), respectively. In 1998, final tomato yield did not respond to N rate. In 1999, there was a substantial increase in fruit yield when plants were fertilized with 168 kg(.)ha(-1) N but little change in yield with additional N. Nitrogen content of the leaves and the portion of N from applied fertilizer decreased as the plants grew, and as N was remobilized for fruit production. Both studies indicate that decreasing N as a way to reduce N loss to the environment would also reduce tomato growth.

AB In 1987, the Bruntland Report defined the goal of sustainability as "the ability to meet the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations... to meet their own needs." This definition, while stimulating considerable debate and research, leaves unresolved a number of problems for anthropologists, including dilemmas of measurement, boundaries, and agency. This paper suggests that a more direct engagement with the concept of sustainability could be helpful to anthropological analyses of economic systems and development options and draws on the three papers that follow to illustrate its potential. The paper then discusses three issues central to an anthropological sustainability-persistence, innovation, and responses to stresses and shocks. It concludes with a discussion of common property resources, as discussed in the papers in this collection, as an example of these anthropological issues at work within a sustainability framework.

AB Maasai people in East Africa are attempting to craft new sustainable livelihoods in response to increasing population pressure, a fluctuating livestock population, reductions in grazing areas, and a modernization process that places increased emphasis on a monetary economy. The adoption of cultivation by pastoral Maasai living in northern Tanzania over the last 40-years has been the most significant step in this livelihood diversification. The rapid social and economic changes that have accompanied diversification have challenged current attempts to integrate people into conservation efforts, especially in the Ngorongoro Conservation Area and the newly proposed Wildlife Management Areas of Tanzania. This paper examines the addition of agriculture to the livestock-based economy of Maasai people in northern Tanzania, how this relates to the literature on sustainable livelihoods, and the implications for conservation policy.

AB "Sustainable development" currently has a firm grip on the lexicon of development agencies from the World Bank to small nongovernmental organizations, but it offers little practical guidance for tackling diverse problems in specific places. The concept is of particular importance to pastoral populations throughout the world-those people dependent on livestock raising in and or semiarid lands whose survival depends on their ability physically and politically to maintain access to their pastures. This paper compares two pastoralist populations-East African Maasai and pastoralists of Mongolia-to discuss recent changes in the pastoral way of life and to describe what sustainability has meant in the past and what sustainability needs to mean in the future for pastoralist populations.

AB Local management systems are generally regarded as traditional systems developed over generations. However, in the Brazilian Amazon, as in many other regions, community or collective management is a response to more recent changes in the exploitation of local fisheries and other common-pool resources. Greeted with optimism initially as a potentially effective way of reconciling social and conservation objectives in rural development, experience with community management over the last decade has shown that achieving this potential can be elusive. This paper examines the process of forming community agreements for the floodplain lake fisheries of the Lower Amazon through the analysis of 77 written fishing documents produced from 1981 to 1997. We examine approaches to resource management revealed in the accords, the institutional arrangements for implementing them, and evaluate the performance of these accords over this 15-year period. The paper focuses on the strengths and limitations of this institution in its social and ecological characteristics, institutional robustness, and evolving relations with parallel changes in formal government management policy for regional fisheries.

ID SAO-PAULO
AB The construction of large reservoirs in South America and particularly in Brazil has intensified within the last 50 years. Built up primarily for hydroelectricity production, these artificial ecosystems now serve purposes such as: water storage for public use; fisheries and aquaculture; recreation; tourism, and irrigation. These artificial ecosystems were also built up with the purpose of enhancing the regional development. These activities produce multiple impacts among which are eutrophication, a serious problems with various ecological, economic, and social consequences. Basic studies on reservoirs have identified their main ecological characteristics and described some of their fundamental mechanisms of functioning. This information cover: factors involved in reservoir complexity, such as spatial scale, vertical and horizontal heterogeneity, temporal variation at several time scales and, in some cases, watershed/reservoir relationships, and the impact of non-point and point sources of nutrients. Numerous studies have been dedicated to describing aquatic biota, its relationship with environmental factors, and the impacts of degradation/pollution/eutrophication on biodiversity. Research priorities have been established mainly by limnologists in response to needs identified by environmental impact assessment. Due to the pressure of multiple uses, population growth, and economic factors, aquatic scientists now face a number of questions being posed by managers and engineers. These questions relate to a wide range of practical problems, the solutions to which depend on accumulated data related to the structural complexities and function mechanisms previously referred to. These problems can be divided into three main groups: (i) eutrophication processes and their characteristics, and water quality control; (ii) impact of fisheries, aquaculture, and exotic species introduction on the biota and the water quality; (iii) sustainable development of reservoirs and optimization management of their multiple uses. Predictive capabilities required in the face of these problems should be based on modeling development and intensive use of data-bases resulting from long-term studies on reservoirs. The predictions thus made possible would involve economic factors and the costs of recovery of eutrophic reservoirs. The experience of reservoir research and management in South America and in Brazil is, probably part of a world wide tendency on reservoir research and development with the aim to optimize multiple uses. Based on the cooperation of limnologists and engineers, ecosystem management models must eventually be applied at the watershed / reservoir level, where demands on the part of managers and decision makers will certainly promote a predictive, integrated, and adaptive approach, based on fundamental research.

AB This paper studies input-queued packet switches loaded with both unicast and multicast traffic. The packet switch architecture is assumed to comprise a switching fabric with multicast (and broadcast) capabilities, operating in a synchronous slotted fashion. Fixed-size data units, called cells, are transferred from each switch input to any. set of outputs in one time slot, according to the decisions of the switch scheduler, that identifies at each time slot a set of nonconflicting cells, i.e., cells neither coming from the same input, nor directed to the same output.
   First, multicast traffic admissibility conditions are discussed, and a simple counterexample showing intrinsic performance losses of input-queued with respect to output-queued switch architectures is presented. Second, the optimal scheduling discipline to transfer multicast packets from inputs to outputs is defined. This discipline is rather complex, requires a queuing architecture that probably is not implementable, and does not guarantee in-sequence delivery of data. However, from the definition of the optimal multicast scheduling discipline, the formal characterization of the sustainable multicast traffic region naturally follows. Then, several theorems showing intrinsic performance losses of input-queued with respect to output-queued switch architectures are proved. In particular, We prove that, when using per multicast flow FIFO queueing architectures, the internal speedup that guarantees 100% throughput under admissible, traffic grows with the number of switch ports.

AB Hyperion (a hyperspectral sensor) and the Advanced Land Imager (ALI) (a multispectral sensor) are carried on the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Earth Observing 1 (EO-1) satellite. The Evaluation and Validation of EO-1 for Sustainable Development (EVEOSD) is our project supporting the EO-1 mission. With 10% of the world's forests and the second largest country by area in the world, Canada has a natural requirement for effective monitoring of its forests. Eight test sites have been selected for EVEOSD, with seven in Canada and one in the United States. Extensive fieldwork has been conducted at four of these sites. A comparison is made of forest classification results from Hyperion, ALI, and the Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) of Landsat-7 for the Greater Victoria Watershed. The data have been radiometrically corrected and orthorectified. Feature selection and statistical transforms are used to reduce the Hyperion feature space from 198 channels to 11 features. Classes chosen for discrimination included Douglas-fir, hemlock, western redcedar, lodgepole pine, and red alder. Overall classification accuracies obtained for each sensor were Hyperion 90.0%, ALI 84.8 %, and ETM+ 75.0%. Hyperspectral remote sensing provides significant advantages and greater accuracies over ETM+ for forest discrimination. The EO-1 sensors, Hyperion and ALI, provide data with excellent discrimination for Pacific Northwest forests in comparison to Landsat-7 ETM+.

AB WHILE genetic improvement is just one of a number of methods available to sheep producers to enhance the performance of their animals, it has the great advantage of being permanent, cumulative, sustainable and cost-effective. This article outlines the different methods of genetic improvement that have been used in the UK over the past 30 years; some tried-and-tested strategies have changed little, such as the stratified system of crossbreeding which is employed to maximise heterosis (hybrid vigour) and breed complementarity, but other breed improvement techniques have changed a great deal, particularly with the advent of powerful computers and sophisticated software. The article goes on to discuss in more detail the processes involved in estimating an animal's breeding value, which form the basis of 'Sheepbreeder', a genetic evaluation scheme for the UK sheep industry.

AB The field trials on rice (Oryza sativa L.)-wheat (Triticum aestivum L. emend. Fiori & Paol.) cropping system were conducted during 1996-97 to 2001-2002 at Bihar Agricultural College, Sabour (Bhagalpur), for optimizing dose and frequency of phosphorus application. Rice and wheat responded significantly only up to 60 kg P2O5/ha. Average of 6 years data revealed that for getting optimum yield of wheat, P application was essential to the crop whereas in rice if the preceding wheat crop was raised with phosphorus, it was not essential to supply phosphorus to the rice crop. Application of P to both the crops every year resulted in the maximum P Uptake, which was also higher with increase in P level. The same treatment (P to both the crops) fetched the maximum net return (Rs 28,738/ha) and had the highest benefit : cost ratio (1.36). Application of P only to wheat every year, however, proved to be equally good in realising higher net return (Rs 26,466/ha). Higher P rates and its repeated application every year resulted in higher P build up in soil.

TI Apparent density in a vertisol with different agrosystems
SO INTERCIENCIA

DT Article
ID SOIL; NIGERIA; WATER
AB The physical properties of soils have received attention for their role in maintaining a sustainable sugarcane production. Under this scheme, the present study was focused on evaluating the apparent density (DAp) of a vertisol soil in sugarcane, pasture and medium perennial rainforest agro-ecosystems was evaluated. Soil samples were taken from the space between furrows of a sugarcane plantation that are used as trails for trucks, trails for crop-lifters, or never affected by machinery; 9 samples were taken at random per crop cycle. Pasture and forest soils were sampled at random with 6 repetitions. DAp at 0-10cm in depth was determined by the cylinder method. Eleven treatments were analyzed by a completely randomized design and orthogonal contrasts. Soils cultivated with sugarcane suffer from higher compaction during the harvest, irrespective of the crop cycle. Truck passage results, due to their heavier weight, in more compaction than crop-lifters. DAp increases with the number of crop cycles. The DAp, averaged over the various cane cycles, did not reach the critical values for the roots (1.60g cm(-3)); however, the DAp observed in sugarcane agro-ecosystems surpassed that of pasture and forest soils. The DAp observed in pasture agro-ecosystems is,intermediate between the forest and sugarcane, which suggests that soil cracking during the dry season, as well as their recent origin, might give the former a higher dampening capacity. This might also explain why the DAp has only changed 20% in relation to rainforests during the last 20 years.

ID PRODUCTS
AB Many claims have been made concerning the use of NTFPs as part of development and conservation strategies. Important amongst these is that because NTFPs play an important part in household incomes they can be used to raise the perceived value of forests and thus provide incentives for more sustainable use of the forest estate. However, migrant communities living around forest margins have often been perceived as groups of people most likely to take advantage of the free goods provided by forests in a way that degrades the forest environment as short term benefits are maximised over long-term sustainability. Empirical evidence from the forest zone of south-west Cameroon suggests that for many migrant communities NTFPs are not a significant part (no more than 6%) of household total income and that poorer groups seek diverse livelihood strategies that are not predicated on natural resource use. Whilst richer groups may continue to rely on sources of income from the forest and NTFPs may make up to 15% of household income, for rich and poor alike the value derived from NTFPs is generated by secondary forest and forest fallow rather than less disturbed forest that has been the focus of conservation interest. The view is put forward that forest managers and international donors interested in conservation and development need to reassess the potential contribution of NTFPs in poverty alleviation strategies, and acknowledge that forest conservation priorities of local communities require policies and management systems focused on 'sustainable systems for production of livelihood benefits' rather than protectionist approaches to areas traditionally defined as valuable forest.

AB Due to increasing recognition of the importance of Non-Timber Forest Products (NTFPs) to local livelihoods and biodiversity conservation, the need for accurate assessment of NTFPs growing stock and yields as well as identification of sustainable harvesting options has become more critical than ever before. This paper seeks to explore how learning is taking place in Nepal in order to develop NTFP resource assessment and sustainable harvesting techniques based on an analysis of case studies from contrasting contexts. Using an adaptive management approach as a framework, the analysis focuses on developing an understanding of the strong and weak aspects of the current methodologies, leading to recommendations for ways forward.

ID DIETARY-SUPPLEMENTS
AB Non-timber forest products (NTFPs) are receiving increased attention from standard-setting agencies including governments, trade associations, and private sector certification organisations. A sub-set of the NTFP category, botanicals, is witnessing a proliferation in standards-setting initiatives addressing topics as diverse as ecological sustainability, social justice, and product safety and efficacy. To examine this trend a survey of companies, industry associations, research institutions and NGOs worldwide was undertaken, and more than 100 sets of voluntary standards and regulations that apply to the trade or sourcing of botanicals were collected and analysed. It was found that many sets of standards under development are single-issue oriented and fail to address the wide and overlapping range of questions that arise as a product moves from source to shelf. Although a range of problems arises from this fragmented approach, steps are available to streamline processes and make standards development and implementation more effective.

AB Internet deception threatens the sustainability of Internet commerce because it undermines trust. This paper investigates the deceptive tactics available on the Internet and some of the factors that make them more or less likely to be adopted. An established theory of deception is applied to the Internet context to identify the deception tactics available on-line. The theory is then expanded with new hypotheses that link the selection of a specific tactic to the identity of the target and the purported identity of the deceiver. Content analysis of a broad range of documentary evidence published between 1995 and 2000 is used to build a database of 201 cases of Internet deception. Data from the database are used to test the hypotheses. The results suggest that deceivers select tactics as a function of their targets as well as their own purported identities. Practical implications for deterrence, prevention, and detection of Internet deception are discussed.

DE Indonesia; rural housing; housing improvements; demand-responsive
   approach; disease
AB For more than three decades, environmental health programmes in Indonesia have emphasized prevention and treatment of the high incidence of disease among villagers. One of the main causes of disease is the unhygienic conditions of typical rural houses - two-room constructions with dirt floors and walls of lightly fired bricks or woven bamboo skins. While most houses have few or no windows, the occupants frequently cook, eat, sleep and even keep animals in a single room. The main objective of the housing improvement programme was to improve air circulation and introduce more sunlight to kill bacteria, avoid dampness and eliminate smoke from cooking. The programme encourages villagers to construct a permanent floor, enlarge existing windows or insert new windows for good ventilation. This presentation will share the 'success stories' of housing improvement projects in Indonesia that adopted demand-responsive approaches instead of the conventional 'supply approach'. Through exercises like Wealth Classification and Social Mapping, a demand-responsive approach lets the community decide who is eligible for assistance, resulting in higher participation and accurate information on community demand and on materials needed. In addition to the successes, the failures will be discussed at field level. This presentation will discuss the lessons learned from: the World Bank-funded Kalisemut Case Study; government's Family Welfare Movement; Plan International's project in Yogyakarta, and AusAID-funded Sustainable Development through Community Participation Project in Lombok.

DE Lao PDR; rural water supply and sanitation sector; latrine; hygiene
   promotion; community; health
AB The Lao People's Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) is located in the Greater Mekong sub-region in East Asia, neighbouring with China, Cambodia, Myanmar, Thailand and Vietnam, with a land area of 236,800 square kilometres, and an average population density of 22 persons per square kilometre. The population of Lao PDR is 5.5 million with 49 ethnic groups. Most of the population is located in rural areas, with a significant number of the neediest villages in remote localities. In the past decade, there have been many positive developments in the rural water supply and sanitation (RWSS) sector. Despite improved coverage in latrine and water supply services, health remains a serious problem. The improved services were often not sustained or poorly maintained, while hygiene received inadequate attention. In Lao PDR, as in many other countries, the provision of a safe and reliable water supply and appropriate sanitation services, based on sustainable approaches, therefore, remains a challenge. This paper will provide an overview of the Lao PDR's RWSS Sector. Special emphasis is placed on actual field level application of informed choices for water supply, sanitation and hygiene awareness.

AB This paper presents analysis of interviews conducted at the United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) during June to August 1999, which reveal the concerns behind the development of the Ethics in Food and Agriculture Program at FAO. Formal interviews with 103 staff members of all positions and across all divisions of FAO, revealed that although ethics as a word was not widely and openly discussed at FAO until the end of the 1990s, as indicated by the nature of the programmes and policies, the members had deep ethical motivation for their work. The results of the keyword analysis of the interviews are presented under the general issues of food, rural development, information, genetic modification, private sector and funding, environment, animal issues and personnel matters. Most of the interviewed staff saw ethics as the basis of the constitutional mandate, with the role of FAO being to promote global food security, balanced conservation, management and utilization of natural resources, and sustainable rural development. Information dissemination, and the need for a participatory approach were also raised as major issues by a third of the people interviewed.

DT Article
DE hydrogen energy; IEA; hydrogen economy; hydrogen storage
AB Hydrogen systems can provide viable, sustainable options for meeting the world's energy requirements. Hydrogen is relevant to all of the energy sectors-transportation, buildings, utilities and-industry. It can provide storage options for baseload (geothermal), seasonal (hydroelectric) and intermittent (PV and wind) renewable resources, and when combined with emerging decarbonization technologies, can reduce the climate impacts of continued fossil fuel utilization. However, hydrogen energy systems still face a number of technical and economical barriers that must first be overcome for hydrogen to become a competitive energy carrier. Advances must be made in hydrogen production, storage, transport and utilization technologies and in the integration of these components into complete energy systems. To expedite the advancement of hydrogen technologies and realize a hydrogen future, nations have come together under the auspices of the International Energy Agency's (IEA) Hydrogen Program to collaborate and address the important barriers that impede hydrogen's worldwide acceptance. Through well-structured, collaborative projects, experts from around the world address many of the technical challenges and long-term research needs that face the hydrogen community. These collaborations have already led to significant advances in renewable hydrogen production and solid storage materials and to the development of tools to evaluate and optimize integrated hydrogen energy systems.

DE Africa; participatory forest management; inventory; pitsawyer;
   management plan; mapping
AB A workshop held in Tanzania in early 2002 brought practitioners of Participatory Forest Management (PFM) from 25 African countries together with donors and other interested organizations. One objective was to search for ways forward to improve and streamline implementing PFM. It was agreed that forest legislation permitting PFM is currently widespread and that many countries are somewhere on the path of implementation. It was also agreed that more needs to be done to further the definition and sharing of benefits from PFM forests in order for the practice to be successful and sustainable. The alarming rate of deforestation in many countries has not been sufficiently monitored or addressed by PFM.
   Lessons not yet learned from at least 30 years of experience include how to write satisfactory management plans and conduct inventories that would help define PFM benefits and monitoring aspects. This paper suggests ways to improve on these aspects of PEW planning. It also proposes a greater emphasis on inclusion of pitsawyer organization as a key component in sustaining forests for a longer time.

ID CONTINGENT VALUATION
AB This analysis estimates willingness to pay to improve community-based rural water utilities in the Dodoma and Singida Regions of Central Tanzania, using Multinomial Logit functions. Air estimate of willingness to pay provides an indication of the demand for improved services and potential for them being sustainable. Surveys were conducted in a total of 30 villages in the two regions. In the Dodoma Region, about 14% of respondents indicated that they were satisfied with the status quo, 64% suggested increasing water discharge and watering points, and 22% proposed other improvements relating to water quality. In the Singida Region, 31% of the respondents were satisfied with the status quo, 59% wanted deeper boreholes and watering points, and 10% indicated other types of improvement relating to water quality. The Multinomial Logit functions indicated that the interaction between the water quality variable and proposed bids were important in making choices with reference to the type of improvement desired. Respondents who wanted to increase water supply in Dodoma Region were willing to pay 32 Tsh above the existing tariff of 20 Tsh/bucket. In the Singida Region, the analogous amount was 91 Tsh per household per year above the existing user fee of 508 Tsh per household per year. If the tariff or user fees have to be increased, the estimated average potential revenue for the surveyed villages was 252 million Tsh/year (US$265 263) in the Dodoma Region, and 5.2 million Tsh/year (US$5474) in the Singida Region. In the future, strategic planning is needed to ensure that improvements proposed potentially improve cost recovery initiatives and increase the level of consumer satisfaction. Also, care will be needed to ensure that more disadvantaged community members do not suffer unduly from increases in tariff or user fees.

   poverty; indigenous knowledge; simple technology; development
AB The people inhabiting the mountains of the Central Himalayan region of India are heavily dependent on their immediate natural resources for their survival. However, this resource-poor mountain ecosystem is gradually becoming unable to provide a minimum standard of living to its continually growing population. In this ecosystem, human Population is doubling every 27-30 years, against the declining resource base, particularly forests. Forest are disappearing both quantitatively and qualitatively. Against the requirement of 18 ha of forest land to maintain production in I ha of cultivated land, the ratio of forests to cultivated land is only 1.33 : 1. The present production from grasslands supports 8 units of livestock, against the ideal 2 units, and the gap between the demand and deficit of fodder is more than 5-fold. Loss of vegetative cover is resulting in drying up of water resources, compelling the women to walk longer distances to collect water. This ecological deterioration, apart from human growth and interference, is compounded by mountain specificities such as inaccessibility, fragility, marginality, diversity, niche and adaptability. The specificities manifest in isolation, distance, poor communication, limited mobility, etc., resulting in limited external linkages and replication of external experiences, and slow pace of development. They, therefore, restrict options for economic growth, effecting poverty and affecting the quality of life of the people of the region. Poverty, in this mountain ecosystem cannot be understood and assessed independent of ecological wealth and would better be termed as ecological poverty. The development efforts to be effective in alleviating poverty here, should take into account mountain specificities and incorporate options which have larger human dimensions, such as mechanisms for population control, socio-economic and cultural conditioning, indigenous knowledge systems of the local people and simple technologies that are already in practice or have potential and are based on least external inputs.

AB The aim of this paper is to document the experience of public-private partnership (PPP) in the management of the domestic water sector in Amman city, Jordan. It also intends to reflect on the transformations in water management after the introduction of PPP using metaphors from ecology. Scenarios for water management are developed and assessed based on financial viability and political feasibility. Four scenarios for sustainable water development in Amman city are developed under two major drivers, i.e. importance and uncertainty. The scenarios developed in this paper are intended to illuminate possible ways that could affect the future of PPP for domestic water in Jordan. Based on document analysis, observations and lessons learned from ecology, scenarios for water management are developed. The process of building scenarios involves a number of steps, which include: (1) identification of focal issues and key decisions; (2) identification of key factors in the local environment; (3) listing and ranking driving forces by importance and uncertainty; (4) ranking driving forces by importance and uncertainty; and (5) considering implications. The outcomes under each critical uncertainty are assessed. Combinations of these outcomes will determine the general characteristics of each scenario. Lessons learned from the evolution of living organisms in nature, i.e. from innovation, growth, improvement and release, were utilized to characterize the water sector in Amman city after the introduction of PPP.

ID DENVER-INTERNATIONAL-AIRPORT; POLICY
AB Contemporary transportation systems and policies are discussed in terms of their relationship to sustainable development. The current situation is generally characterised by policies that favour motorisation and violate fundamental elements of sustainability. Accordingly, a new vision of sustainable transportation is required, one that incorporates intermodalism for both passengers and freight. Creating a sustainable intermodal system necessitates overcoming many obstacles and can be achieved only with appropriate policy and decision-making systems that incorporate genuine public participation. However, existing decision-making processes and public involvement mechanisms are inadequate. New approaches need to be developed and implemented if the new transportation paradigm is to be realised.

TI Making concepts matter: sustainable mobility and indicator systems in
   transport policy
SO INTERNATIONAL SOCIAL SCIENCE JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
AB Strategies for sustainable mobility and transport have, in recent years, been launched in many countries and also at the international level: so far, limited success has been recorded. However, the questions arise how the sustainability of transport systems and policies can in fact be measured, and how these measurements can be used in transport planning. This article focuses on indicators and monitoring frameworks applied in the transport sector. It explores a limited number of indicator systems presently in use, discussing if and how they contribute to making the concepts of sustainability operational for the governance of mobility. The six systems discussed include one general environmental indicator system, one transport policy performance measurement framework, and four indicator systems, which in particular focus on the interaction between transport and the environment. Four of the systems are national (Denmark, Canada and two from the USA), and two are international (the European Environment Agency (EEA) and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)). The paper concludes that these and other indicator systems appear to provide relatively limited guidance towards achieving sustainable mobility. There are four major issues which need considering if the aims of sustainability are to be incorporated more adequately: how to manage environmental comprehensiveness; how to bring causal factors into the systems; how to incorporate sustainability and policy targets; and how to link indicator systems and policy making.

TI The development, design and evaluation of sustainable local transport
   networks
SO INTERNATIONAL SOCIAL SCIENCE JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper is about the relationship between urban areas and transport, particularly the design and evaluation of sustainable local transport networks. It is presented in the context of the changes in thinking associated with new ideas for traffic engineering in the urban environment, to accommodate the complex mix of activities arising on highway networks, which are now taken into account by decision-makers; ways by which urban planning can help to bring about greater use of sustainable transport modes; the growing influence of architects and urban designers on street pattern and road layout in modern British housing schemes. After reviewing the history of urban form and the theories that have guided various trends in design, the paper comments on developments and identifies the shortcomings of lower densities and inflexible networks, particularly with regard to reinforcing the reliance on a single, unsustainable transport mode. More recent trends in the design of urban areas in Britain are noted: more continuous street patterns; a less rigid application of the simple road hierarchy; a more equal treatment of the different transport modes. As design ideas develop the need to appraise transport networks arises in parallel. The final section identifies a range of techniques for analysing networks. The paper concludes by noting that sustainable travel systems can be encouraged by increasing urban densities and ensuring that street networks are designed to favour the more environmentally sound modes. To achieve this, there needs to be an emphasis on the measurement of the performance of street networks. Quantitative appraisal techniques will become an essential part of urban planning in the future.

TI Can the post-apartheid South African city move towards accessibility,
   equity and sustainability?
SO INTERNATIONAL SOCIAL SCIENCE JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
AB Historically, towns and cities have developed at easily accessible transport nodes to the sea, rivers, or roads. Unfortunately, the macro accessibility of cities that has followed in general was not extended to the micro level. In this paper, transport sustainability is assessed in terms of the following definition: a sustainable city provides mobility for all by creating accessibility of destinations, preferably by slow modes or public transport. The use of the private car is limited, congestion does not exist, and measures are taken if noise pollution Occurs. From this perspective, accessibility within cities is often a problem, notably because of the separation between transportation and settlement planning. South Africa reflects this general pattern, which has resulted in unsustainable urban areas, but with the aggravating circumstance of the legacy of apartheid, which the paper explores in detail using the example of Cape Town. In order to give suggestions for the improvement of South African cities, urban spatial theories are described and examples of cities that developed based at least partly on those theories are given. However, European experiences have shown that settlement planning, even based on successful theories such as the corridor or the compact city approach, is not enough. There is a need for integrated settlement and transport planning. South Africa should investigate which additional integrated settlement and transport-planning policies should be put in place to improve the cities and to make them more equitable and sustainable.

TI Transport noise: a challenge for sustainable mobility
SO INTERNATIONAL SOCIAL SCIENCE JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
AB The paper starts with a brief overview of the impacts and perception of noise in the past in Europe. It has been well known for about 30 years that transport noise over critical levels causes serious annoyance. Moreover, recent epidemiological research indicates that it might also be responsible for a significant number of potentially fatal heart attacks. In the light of this knowledge, the transport noise protection policies of four European countries are analysed and compared with peoples subjective perceptions and objective exposure. Results show that transport noise is one of the most significant environmental problems since about 18-20% Of the Population in those Countries, as in the EU as a whole. suffer seriously from transport noise. Noise protection has in the past focused to a large extent on limiting emissions at the noise Source. However, no binding noise standards at the immission point have been set. In the last decade this has changed in Germany, Switzerland and the Netherlands, where noise legislation has been differentiated into non-binding standards for existing transport infrastructure and binding legislation for planned infrastructure. Looking Lit the policies that are available to comply with the standards, it is obvious that there is no silver bullet to solve the transport noise problem. Instead, the experience of those countries demonstrates that the fight against noise to ensure sustainable mobility can only be won by a comprehensive mix of policies, which require significant investments and, even more important, will take a long time.

TI Lessons from a landmark US policy for transportation, land use and air
   quality, and implications for policy changes in other countries
SO INTERNATIONAL SOCIAL SCIENCE JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
AB Normally, discussion about more sustainable mobility concentrates on the travel behaviour of individuals, but the transportation system is also very much influenced by the behaviour of institutions. This paper looks into changes in transportation planning and financing mechanisms initiated by the US Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act, introduced in 1991, and the Transportation Equity Act for the 21(st) Century, introduced in 1997. In spite of their limitations, these legislative provisions, driven by strong advocacy coalitions, have had a significant impact on US transport policy. They indicate lessons for other countries both in terms of the political process and in terms of interactions between levels of policy making. A top-down approach at the Federal level can be useful to enhance a nationwide bottom-up planning process at the local and regional level. The ability to induce reform even in an unbalanced and unsustainable transport system with high car ownership, extreme development of car-oriented infrastructure, and high car use is an indication of more general potential for change.

AB High efficiency, environmental friendliness, low operation and maintenance costs, and the lowest possible impact on the environment are some of the requirements of sustainable energy production. In the selection of new power generation systems, a number of steps have to be taken into account in order to meet these requirements. Here, the first law analysis has been implemented and investigated, followed by a combination of the first and second law analyses (exergy analysis), and thermoeconomics. Finally, an exergetic life cycle assessment (ELCA) has been carried out for two different power cycles to show how the irreversibility of a process is coupled to environmental issues. The study involves two cycles, a two-pressure level combined cycle and a humid cycle, to demonstrate the usefulness of the three. methods mentioned above in a pre-purchase process. The main goal of this study is to point out the advantages and the difficulties related to the implementation of each and every method, and to identify the target groups that can gain knowledge and information by using these methods. Since the operators of power plants often do not have access to detailed information about component materials, characteristics, etc., of the power cycle, assumptions have to be made when comparing different cycle configurations with each other. These limited types of data and information have also been used here to create a plausible scenario of how different pre-purchase methods can differ from each other.

AB Older men with HIV infection/AIDS, having often lived with the condition longer, are more likely to confront the stress of managing more advanced HIV disease than their younger counterparts. Meanwhile, they also are more likely to have less social support and experience more distress than younger persons with HIV infection. The moderating effect of social support on health functioning and distress is unknown for persons with HIV infection, particularly those who are older. Study objectives were to assess whether the association between perceived health functioning and psychological distress and well-being is moderated (or influenced) by social support and age and if the impact of social support on distress and well-being is more pronounced for older than for younger men living with HIV infection/AIDS. In this cross-sectional study of HIV-positive adult men (n = 199) who have sex with men, participants completed self-report assessments of perceived health functioning, social support, and psychological distress and well-being. Measures of health functioning and overall social support were significantly associated with outcome measures of distress and positive affect (all p <.05). However, the main effect for social support was qualified by a significant age-by-social support interaction for both outcomes (beta = -.190, p <.01 for distress; beta =.172, p <.05 for positive affect), indicating that the impact of social support on decreasing distress and increasing well-being was more pronounced in older men. The relationships between perceived health functioning and distress and well-being were not moderated by social support or age. The influence of social support on negative and positive moods in this population of HIV-infected men who have sex with men was significantly greater among older than among younger participants. With an increasing number of older people with HIV infection/AIDS, special efforts to create effective and sustainable social support interventions may be particularly beneficial to older persons living with HIV infection.

AB Social and behavioral HIV/AIDS prevention interventions designed to test their effects on older cohorts are sorely lacking in the scientific literature even though middle-aged and older people represent a significant minority of both existing and new AIDS cases. This article raises key issues relevant in developing and evaluating HIV/AIDS social and behavioral interventions for older cohorts. These interventions must build on our current understanding of behavior change and HIV prevention successes with younger populations while considering important intervention principles gathered from work with older populations in other health arenas. In addition, the authors expand on recent national panels and published reviews relevant to the topic and provide a set of intervention recommendations for use in tandem with these intervention principles. The article also calls for additional research into the sociocultural contexts that influence risk-taking among older cohorts and for the development of interventions at multiple levels. Pragmatic considerations such as identifying and dismantling ageism in interventions, delineating intervention outcomes, and planning for intervention transferability, dissemination, and sustainability also are raised.

TI Multiracial congregations: An analysis of their development and a
   typology
SO JOURNAL FOR THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF RELIGION
LA English
DT Article
ID UNITED-STATES
AB Although the overwhelming majority of religious congregations consist of members who share the same racial background, there are a significant number of multiracial congregations in the United States. We begin with an analysis of why most congregations remain uniracial despite racial integration in other institutions. Then, based con our two-year national study, we examine the key variables underlying the development of multiracial congregations. Specifically, we consider the primary impetus for change and the source of racial diversification. Based on the analysis of how some congregations have become multiracial, we present a typology of multiracial congregations. We find seven main types. It is our hope that the typology and analysis will illuminate the effects of racial diversity on the life cycle of congregations and serve as a useful framework to guide future studies of multiracial congregations. Ultimately, we intend this article to facilitate the development of formal theory and research on the genesis and sustainability of multiracial congregations. To that end, we conclude the article by offering hypotheses suggested by the typology and its underlying causes.

DE access to care; adolescents; School-Based Health Centers
ID MANAGED CARE; ADOLESCENTS; SERVICES; ACCESS; MEDICAID; DELIVERY
AB Purpose: To examine the current experience of school-based health centers (SBHCs) in meeting the needs of children and adolescents, changes over time in services provided and program sponsorship, and program adaptations to the changing medical marketplace.
   Methods: Information for the 1998-1999 Census of School-Based Health Centers was collected through a questionnaire mailed to health centers in December 1998. A total of 806 SBHCs operating in schools or on school property responded, representing a 70% response rate. Descriptive statistics and cross-tab analyses were conducted.
   Results: The number of SBHCs grew from 120 in 1988 to nearly 1200 in 1998, serving an estimated 1.1 million students. No longer primarily in urban high schools, health centers now operate in diverse areas in 45 states, serving students from kindergarten through high school. Sponsorship has shifted from community-based clinics to hospitals, local health departments, and community health centers, which represent 73% of all sponsors. Most use computer-based patient-tracking systems (88%), and 73% bill Medicaid and other third-party insurers for student-patient encounters.
   Conclusions: SBHCs have demonstrated leadership by implementing medical standards of care and providing accountable sources of health care. Although the SBHC model is responsive to local community needs, centers provide care for only 2% of children enrolled in U.S. schools. A lack of stable financing streams continues to challenge sustainability. As communities seek to meet the needs of this population, they are learning important lessons about providing acceptable, accessible, and comprehensive services and about implementing quality assurance mechanisms.

TI Evaluation of a pilot mentoring programme for nurse managers
SO JOURNAL OF ADVANCED NURSING
LA English
DT Article
DE pilot mentoring programme; nurse managers; expectations; management
   qualities; evaluation
AB Background. The Institute of Nursing Executives is a professional organization with a membership of approximately 150 Australian nurse managers and administrators. Members of rural zones were concerned by the lack of support available to new managers working in isolated areas and sought to develop a mentoring programme that would establish both professional development and support networks for these managers. A pilot programme was developed for two rural areas of New South Wales and one metropolitan site (the city of Sydney).
   Aim. The evaluation reported here aimed to determine participant expectations of mentoring and outcomes of the pilot programme.
   Method. The programme included matching and self-selection of mentor and mentee roles and attendance at a full-day Mentoring Workshop. The programme was evaluated by voluntary and anonymous pre- and postworkshop questionnaires sent to all participants, and postworkshop telephone interviews.
   Results. Thirty-seven participants (79% of those enrolled in workshop) responded to the preworkshop questionnaire (20 identifying as mentees; 17 as mentors). Findings reiterated the lack of professional support and access for rural/remote area nurse managers and illustrated that new nurse managers lacked confidence in coaching and stimulating staff. Expectations of both mentors and mentees were similar in valuing a confidential, on-going mentoring relationship. Postworkshop questionnaires (n=16) and telephone interviews (n=11) highlighted issues about personal choice and timing, expectations of a structured programme and making greater use of existing technology to support and maintain networks.
   Conclusion. The pilot mentoring programme was highly successful in identifying strategies for the development of a tailored and sustainable programme for newly appointed nurse managers. Provision of a highly structured and facilitated programme carries high expectations of continued external support. Nurse managers also expressed a desire to choose when, how and whom they would select as mentors. Suggestions for the future included a greater use of technology to facilitate e-mail and internet-based discussion groups and mentor support.

TI The impact of cattle ranching on large-scale vegetation patterns in a
   coastal savanna in Tanzania

AB 1. The success of large-scale cattle ranching in African savanna vegetation has often been limited by problems of bush encroachment and disease (in particular trypanosomiasis spread by tsetse flies). Mkwaja Ranch, occupying an area of 462 km(2) on the coast of Tanzania, is a recent example of a large ranching enterprise that failed within the savanna environment. It was closed in 2000 after 48 years of operation. In this paper we describe the main vegetation types of the area (excluding closed forest vegetation) and relate their patterns of distribution to the former use of the ranch for cattle.
   2. The study area comprised the former ranch and parts of the adjacent Saadani Game Reserve, which had not been grazed by cattle for many years and had never been used for large-scale ranching. Following field surveys, 15 distinct types of grassland and bush vegetation were defined and a vegetation map was created using a Landsat TM satellite image. A multispectral classification using the maximum likelihood algorithm gave good results and enabled all 15 vegetation types to be distinguished on the map.
   3. Two main spatial trends were detected in the vegetation. One was a large-scale decrease in the cover of bushland from the most intensively used parts of the ranch through more extensively used areas to the game reserve; this trend was attributed to differences in management history as well as to climatic and topographic factors. A second trend was a radial vegetation pattern associated with the enclosures where cattle were herded at night. High amounts of three bushland types [dominated by (i) Acacia zanzibarica , (ii) Dichrostachys cinerea , Acacia nilotica or Acacia mellifera and (iii) Terminalia spinosa ] occurred in a zone between 300 and 2500 m from the paddocks, with a peak in bush density at about 900 m (mean value for 18 paddocks). In contrast, bushland dominated by Hyphaene compressa was scarce close to the paddocks and became more abundant with distance. There was also a radial trend in the grassland communities: close to the paddocks there was short grass vegetation containing many ruderals and invasive weedy species, while the tall grassland types with species such as Hyperthelia dissoluta and Cymbopogon caesius occurred further away in the areas less affected by cattle.
   4. Synthesis and applications. The intensive modern livestock ranching as practised on Mkwaja Ranch proved to be unsustainable both economically and ecologically. In the end, the biggest problem faced by the ranch managers was not controlling disease, as had originally been feared, but preventing the spread of bush on pasture land. The results of our study demonstrate just how severe the problem of bush encroachment was, especially in areas close to paddocks. An important lesson for management is that grazing patterns need to be taken into consideration when determining the sustainable stocking rate for an area. To reduce the risk of bush encroachment in grazing systems with focal points such as paddocks or watering points, stocking rates need to be lower than in systems with a more uniform grazing distribution.

AB 1. Hares are considered to be a valuable game species in most European countries. Hunting needs to be sustainable and sound management of hare populations requires some knowledge of the species' demographic variability, especially regarding the breeding output, which is highly time- and space-dependent and may govern the population size and exploitability.
   2. Using shooting bag analysis and placental scar counts, mean fecundity and leveret survival were estimated at four study sites with contrasting hare numbers and density trends. These demographic parameters, harvest rates and adult natural survival rates (from the literature) were incorporated into a matrix projection model to analyse the population growth rate (lambda) sensitivity and to derive indices of sustainable harvest rate (ISHR, i.e. rates compatible with lambdagreater than or equal to 1).
   3. The age structure comprised 48-69% young; fecundity varied between 12.2 and 15.0 leverets per breeding female; and 85-100% of adult females bred. These data combined gave a birth-to-autumn leveret survival index of 0.14-0.29 and, when loaded into the matrix model, resulted in simulated lambdas that matched the density changes observed in the study areas. The model structure, although simple, accounted for most of the relevant biological information.
   4. ISHR was 30% when derived iteratively as a function of mean values of those parameters with largest elasticities (leveret survival and doe fecundity). When environmental and demographic stochasticity were included in the model, the proportion of endangered trajectories where the density threshold was < 1 km(2) over 50 km(2) varied sharply, with small changes in harvest rate or initial population size. Small populations could only sustain less than or equal to 20% harvest rates.
   5. Demographic parameters derived from killed animals during year t can be used a posteriori to understand the species' dynamics and as a baseline to modulate the shooting scheme in year t + 1. An actual sustainable shooting scheme would require an additional real-time local process that, automatically, would take all sources of change in numbers into account. A two-stage management strategy (e.g. first computing a catch-effort estimator of population size based on numbers killed very early in the shooting period, then defining flexible harvest quotas) would help managers to cope with the unpredictable dynamics of the species and resulting fluctuations in hare numbers.
   6. Synthesis and applications . The results of this exploratory study suggest that sustainable shooting of hares is possible provided some local data about their dynamics are available and slightly conservative quotas are used. Modelling approaches have potential in assessing the latter, but also as a check on the coherence of the estimates of the former (comparison of observed and modelled lambda).

AB This is a keynote paper focusing on regional perspectives on agriculture and biodiversity by exploring the situation in Northern Africa;. the West African Sahel, East Africa and the Horn, and Southern Africa: The paper establishes that in all these regions agriculture accelerates loss of biodiversity because of attempts by farmers to increase crop and animal production to feed the increasing population and contribute to the growth. of the national economies: Harmful agricultural practices, such as' overcultivation, overgrazing, bush fires, cultivation of marginal and easily eroded land, mechanization. and the widespread use of chemicals and pesticides, have intensified the degradation of the soil and vegetation and led to rapid decline of species types and their numbers. Agriculture and biodiversity can be complementary activities. If properly managed,. agriculture should enhance and not be the enemy of biodiversity in the drylands of Africa. There is need to assess the agricultural potential of the semi-arid environments and develop specific agricultural policies or programmes to enhance their sustainable utilization and. conservation of biodiversity. Information contained in this paper was gathered: from the existing literature (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB Botswana's Kalahari rangelands have historically supported a diversity of wildlife. and a number of subsistence livelihood activities, such as agropastoralism, hunting and gathering. Recently, however, concerns about environmental and livelihood sustainability in the Kalahari have been raised. This paper demonstrates the validity of these concerns using data from research undertaken in the Matsheng area of southwest Botswana. It is illustrated that: (a) Matsheng soils are too infertile,to sustain productive arable farming, (b) herbaceous vegetation. cover decreases in a reversed decay function towards settlements, (c) the herbaceous vegetation cover trend is inversely, reflected by woody-thorny vegetation,. (d) despite being a major rangeland 'activity, livestock production benefits only a minority of inhabitants, and (e) rangelands are no longer the major source of livelihood for the majority.

AB The Okavango Delta is one of Botswana's leading tourist-destination areas, mainly because of the rich wildlife resources it sustains and its scenic beauty. Tourism has stimulated the development of a variety of allied infrastructure and facilities, such as hotels, lodges and camps, airport and airstrips, in the Okavango region. Through its backward linkages, wholesale and retail businesses have also been established, especially in Maun; to offer various goods to the tourist industry. Tarred roads and other communication facilities have also been developed in Ngamiland District partly to facilitate tourism development. Tourism in the Okavango Delta also provides employment opportunities to local communities and it is a significant source of foreign exchange for Botswana. Despite its positive socio-economic impacts, the industry is beginning to have negative environmental impacts in the area such as the destruction of the area's ecology through driving outside the prescribed trails, noise pollution and poor waste management. This, therefore, suggests that tourism in the Okavango Delta has socio-economic and environmental impacts, issues which are addressed-by this paper based on the concept of sustainability.

ID CORPORATE SOCIAL-RESPONSIBILITY
AB For several decades, business has operated according to the tenets of neoclassical economic theory, where the primary obligation of corporations is to maximize profit for shareholders. However, the larger social mandate for business has changed, represented by the rise of language such as "sustainable development", "corporate social responsibility" (CSR) and "stakeholder groups." Nevertheless, the theoretical shift implied by the use of such language has not occurred. Issues of sustainable development and CSR continue to be justified in the terms of neoclassical economic theory through the rationalization of "doing well by doing good".
   Within this economic paradigm, CSR cannot move beyond enlightened self-interest (acting in socially responsible ways in order to further one's own ends) because all behavior must be justified economically. This implies that corporate socially responsible behavior will simply cease when it becomes uneconomic, regardless of the impact on interrelated systems which in turn will re-impact the business realm.
   Faced with bitter realities arising from complex interactions among social, political, cultural, economic and natural environments, we may better comprehend and negotiate these problems by moving out of a neoclassical economic justification of the stakeholder model of the corporation to an inter-systems model, shifting from a narrow comprehension of a single economic independent system analyzed apart from its larger context to a fuller understanding of business as one of a number of interrelated systems.
   Operational differences between the old and new mandates are described, and two ways to practically shift towards the new mandate are identified as a modified version of scenario planning and the introduction of the voice of the critic.

TI Stratiform rain in the tropics as seen by the TRMM precipitation radar

AB Across the Tropics (20degreesN-20degreesS), the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Precipitation Radar ( PR) indicates that for reflectivities greater than or equal to17 dBZ, stratiform precipitation accounts for 73% of the area covered by rain and 40% of the total rain amount over a 3-yr period (1998-2000). The ratio of the convective rain rate to the stratiform rain rate is 4.1 on average at the horizontal resolution of the PR data. Convective rain rates remain constant or decrease as the stratiform contribution to total rain increases, implying that stratiform rain production is not very dependent on the strength of convection. This relationship is especially evident over the ocean, where there are weaker convective rain rates than over land but relatively larger stratiform rain amounts. The ocean environment appears more efficient in the production of stratiform precipitation through either the sustainability of convection by a warm, moist boundary layer with only a weak diurnal variation and/or by the near-moist adiabatic stratification of the free atmosphere. Factors such as wind shear and the relative humidity of the large-scale environment can also affect the production of stratiform rain.
   Over land, higher stratiform rain fractions often occur during the season of maximum insolation and with the occurrence of very large, organized precipitation systems (i.e., mesoscale convective complexes). Monsoon regions show the largest seasonal variations in stratiform rain fraction, with very low values in the season before the monsoon and higher values during the monsoon. A strong gradient in stratiform rain fraction exists across the Pacific, with a minimum similar to25% over the Maritime Continent and a maximum similar to60% in the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) of the eastern-central Pacific. This near-equatorial trans-Pacific gradient becomes exaggerated during El Nino. A higher stratiform rain fraction concentrates latent heating at upper levels, which implies a stronger upper-level circulation response to the heating. Thus, the variations in stratiform rain fraction that occur before the monsoon and during the monsoon, across the Pacific basin, and between La Nina and El Nino imply vertical variations in the large-scale circulation response to tropical precipitating systems that would not occur if the stratiform rain fraction was temporally and spatially uniform across the Tropics.

AB This paper emphasizes the role played by the level of global environmental degradation (GED) in economic development; this link has been ignored in the existing literature on the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC). We develop a composite environmental degradation index (EDI) using Principal Components Analysis (PCA) and relate it to an appropriate measure of economic development, i.e., the human development index (HDI), with a view toward developing a global EKC (GEKC) for 174 countries. Several important conclusions relating to the global behavior of environmental degradation, the precise shape of the GEKC, and the pattern of distribution of GED are derived.

AB This paper examines variation in local perceptions of risk in semi-arid Tanzania, identifying factors that influence local perceptions of problems and testing the feasibility of risk mapping as a technique. Twelve villages in six districts were visited between February and April 2001. Villagers were asked about their worries and concerns in providing for themselves and their families using a risk questionnaire. The responses were grouped into 21 categories of problem and incidence and severity indices were calculated for each category.
   Most problems were associated with the availability of natural resources on which livelihoods depend but others related to human and social capital assets. In addition to environmental factors, livelihood strategy and gender both influenced people's perceptions of risk. Problems of irrigation and weather, for example, were important for agricultural communities while problems relating to livestock diseases, access to land and hunger were more important in pastoral communities. The risks cited by men and women generally reflected their traditional roles in society. Very broadly, the risks associated with natural capital tended to be seen as higher by men while women mentioned more problems relating to human and social capital. However, this was not always the case. Problems linked to finance, traditionally the concern of men, were ranked similarly by men and women.
   In projects designed to facilitate community management and control over common pool resources, the identification of common interests is particularly important. Risk mapping can provide a cost-effective way of gaining insights to help improve research design and to inform policy development. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All fights reserved.

TI Economic transition and environmental sustainability: effects of
   economic restructuring on air pollution in the Russian Federation
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
DE air pollution; economic liberalization; economic restructuring; process
   of transition; environmental performance; Russia
AB Economic liberalization in former socialist countries may have various implications for their environmental sustainability. Positive effects of this process are potentially associated with improved efficiency, investments into cleaner technologies, responsiveness to environmentally aware markets, and ending subsidies to heavy industries. On the other hand, market liberalization may result in weaker environmental controls, economic instabilities distracting attention from environmental issues, and increasing orientation towards profit-making leading to more intensive exploitation of natural resources. In addition, trade liberalization may result in shifts towards more pollution and resource-intensive industries.
   This article seeks to quantify effects of economic restructuring in Russia on air pollution from productive economic sectors in the 1990s. Air pollution in Russia had significantly declined in 1991-1999, however, this decline was largely due to economic decline, as the overall pollution intensity of the economy had decreased only slightly. The factors that affected the pollution intensity are: (1) a decrease in the combined share of industrial and transport activities in the economy and (2) changing pollution intensities of the industrial and transport sectors.
   The pollution intensity of the Russian industry had remained relatively stable during the 1990s. This was the result of the two opposite and mutually canceling trends: (a) increasing shares of pollution-intensive branches such as metal smelting and oil production vs. less pollution intensive manufacturing and (b) decline in pollution intensities within the industrial branches. The article proposes a methodology by which the contribution of both factors to the overall pollution intensity of the industrial sector can be quantified. The pollution intensity of the Russian transport sector appears to have declined in the first half of the 1990s and increased in the second half. The most recent trend can be explained by a rising proportion of private motorcars used for transportation of people and goods instead of traditional rail and other public transport.
   The findings of the paper demonstrate that shifts towards more pollution-, resource- and energy-intensive industries as a result of economic liberalization emerges as a significant negative factor of the process of economic transition threatening sustainability of emerging market economies. A research agenda to further investigate these impacts is proposed. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All fights reserved.

ID METALS; MARSH; SOILS
AB Where appropriate, managed realignment is the preferred policy option for sustainable coastal defences in the UK, since it provides both economic and ecological advantages. Until recently however, research has failed to address the social implications of this policy option having only acknowledged that communities in general, show reluctance in conceding land to the sea. Orplands managed realignment scheme is the third in a series of case studies to address a variety of social issues, but with a particular focus on the public acceptance of schemes and public confidence in the Environment Agency. It is hypothesised that local residents will be more accepting of a realignment scheme the longer it is in the public domain, rather than at its inception or construction. This paper presents findings from the Orplands scheme and demonstrates that overall scheme acceptance was greater at this site in comparison to previous case studies. Despite this, respondents did not show any more confidence in the Environment Agency and this has been attributed to their general scepticism towards a statutory body and the lack of recent contact between the various stakeholders. It is suggested that the development of criteria for consultation and public participation would facilitate public acceptance of managed realignment schemes. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

ID DECISION-MAKING
AB Ecosystem management (EM) is a holistic approach, in which public participation in decision-making, and incorporation of human preferences, needs and perceptions in management plans is a main element. The decision-making from human opinion method (DeMHO), presented here. can be used in EM in selecting the more suitable and socially acceptable management plan, in order to protect or restore an ecosystem. The method focuses on the quantification of the human opinion, preferences and perceptions, which are investigated after research on the local population of the ecosystem. The results of this research are the inputs of the method; multi-criteria decision-making procedures, such as the analytic hierarchy process (AHP), the expected utility method (EUM) and compromise programming (CP) are used to assign the appropriate weights and rank according to their importance the interest groups, the issues to be studied, and the alternative management plans. The alternatives are also evaluated by assessing their sustainable character. The paper presents DeMHO and its application in the National Park of Eastern Macedonia and Thrace in Greece, after a research through a questionnaire on the local population.

ID RICE; AIR
AB Fluidised bed paddy drying using superheated steam is a newly alternative approach instead of using the conventional hot air. The mechanism of mass transfer for paddy drying in a range of initial moisture content between 25% and 44.5% d.b. is strongly controlled by internal moisture movement inside the kernel and a two-series exponential equation is suitably used to explain its movement. Drying parameters in the equation are a function of temperature and bed depth. For the paddy quality, head rice yield from the superheated steam drying is more sustainable and has higher values than those obtained from the hot air drying, whereas the colour of white rice becomes darker, making it poorer quality. The percentage of white belly is significantly affected by the initial moisture content. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Fragmentation of forest types is an indicator of biodiversity in the Montreal Process, but the available national data permit assessment of only overall forestland fragmentation, not forest type fragmentation. Here we illustrate how to localize national statistics from the 2003 National Report on Sustainable Forests by combining state vegetation maps with national forestland fragmentation maps. The degree and scale of fragmentation of different forest types can be gauged from the amount of forestland that meets certain fragmentation thresholds at multiple scales of analysis.

AB We examined effects of body size and temperature on swimming performance in juvenile estuarine crocodiles, Crocodylus porosus, over the size range of 30-110 cm total body length. Swimming performance, expressed as maximum sustainable swimming speed, was measured in a temperature- and flow-controlled swimming flume. Absolute sustainable swimming speed increased with body length, but length-specific swimming performance decreased as body length increased. Sustained swimming speed increased with temperature between 15degreesC and 23degreesC, remained constant between 23degrees and 33degreesC, and decreased as temperature rose above 33degreesC. Q(10)-values of swimming speed were 2.60 (+/- 0.091 SE) between 18degreesC and 23degreesC, and there were no differences in Q(10) between crocodiles of different sizes. The broad plateau of thermal independence in swimming speed observed in C. porosus may be of adaptive significance by allowing dispersal of juvenile animals at suboptimal body temperatures.

TI China's accession to the WTO: The services dimension
SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC LAW

DT Article
AB China's GATS commitments represent the most radical services reform program negotiated in the WTO. China has promised to eliminate over the next few years most restrictions on foreign entry and ownership, as well as most forms of discrimination against foreign firms. In general, these commitments promote good policy. But the persistence of restrictions on foreign ownership (temporary in most sectors but more durable in telecommunications and life insurance) may dampen the incentives for foreign investors to improve firm performance. And initial restrictions. on the geographical scope of services liberalization could encourage the further agglomeration of economic activity in certain regions - to an extent that is unlikely to be reversed completely by subsequent country-wide liberalization. Finally, realizing the gains from, and perhaps even the sustainability of, liberalization will require significant improvements in the regulatory framework, and the appropriate sequencing of reforms.

AB This is the story of a struggle for survival in the Andes. Ravaged by the excesses of nature and a brutal insurgent conflict, and more recently by inroads made by economic globalization, the Serranos (inhabitants of the Peruvian sierra)face the prospect of ever-increasing poverty and the withering away of their villages and cultural traditions. Worldwide recession, or its threat, simply magnifies the problem. Although there are no permanent solutions, purely local initiatives centering on community-organized and community-operated enterprises have produced some creative approaches. These may offer alternatives and hope to other communities, and they are the focus of this study.

ID TRANSKEI; TAXATION; TRUTH
AB The strange collusion between occult belief systems and different trans-national social networks, embedded in specific transformations of local and global modes of production, results in unique but reinforcing modifications of witchcraft belief, its underlying structures and its impact on the process of democratisation. The amazing range of possible results has been indicated by the analysis of two outstanding examples of witchcraft violence in South Africa in times of transition: in the former homelands of Venda and Lebowa, seemingly 'traditional' elements of witchcraft accusations, mediated by a misguided struggle for liberation, stimulated the sympathetic attention of stakeholders beyond the local setting. On the other hand, the occult base of violence in the Transkei became so blurred by involvement of 'modern' elements of globalised markets of violence that it was hardly visible any more, although under cover its repressive effects were still very much alive. These different roots of witchcraft violence had serious repercussions on conflict resolution and genuine reconciliation, the base for any sustainable democratisation and development.

AB Several fuel concepts are under investigation at CEA with the aim of manage plutonium inventories in pressurized water reactors. This options range from the use of mature technologies like MOX adapted in the case of MOX-EUS (enriched uranium support) and COmbustible Recyclage A ILot (CORAIL) assemblies to more innovative technologies using IMF like DUPLEX and advanced plutonium assembly (APA). The plutonium burning performances reported to the electrical production go from 7 to 60 kg (TWh)(-1). More detailed analysis covering economic, sustainability, reliability and safety aspects and their integration in the whole fuel cycle would allow identifying the best candidate.

AB After recalling the existence of two competitive approaches to economics, the "subjective" and the "objective" one, and the main stylized facts about the energy sector, the paper critically examines different versions of "mainstream" economics of oil and sketches an alternative approach, based on the notion of "trilateral oligopoly." Some implications of this approach (dynamic rather than static substitution, an environmental policy based not on fears of scarcity but on the notion of sustainable development, the need for antitrust intervention for stabilizing oil prices) are then examined.

AB Background: Effective, rapid-acting, safe therapies are needed for the long-term treatment of psoriasis.
   Objective. We sought to evaluate infliximab monotherapy in maintaining clinical benefit in psoriasis.
   Methods: A total of 33 patients received 3 doses of 5 or 10 mg/kg of infliximab or placebo at weeks 0, 2, and 6 (double-blind phase). During the open-label phase (weeks 10-26), responding patients were evaluated for relapse (loss of at least half of the improvement in the Psoriasis Area Severity Index score at week 10) and retreated with open-label infliximab (5 or 10 mg/kg) as needed. Placebo nonresponders were treated with an induction regimen of infliximab (5 or 10 mg/kg) and followed up through week 26.
   Results: In all, 29 patients received either 5 or 10 mg/kg of infliximab in the open-label extension. At week 26, psoriasis area severity index response was maintained in 40% and 73% of patients receiving 5 and 10 mg/kg of infliximab, respectively.
   Conclusion: Infliximab produced a rapid, effective, and sustainable (through week 26) effect in patients with moderate to severe psoriasis.

   urbanization; geographic information system
ID LAND-USE CHANGE; GROUNDWATER RECHARGE; RIVER-BASIN; SWAT MODEL; RUNOFF
AB To adequately manage impacts of ongoing or future land use changes in a watershed, the magnitude of their hydrologic impacts needs to be assessed. A grid based daily streamflow model was calibrated with two years of observed streamflow data, using time periods when land use data are available and verified by comparison of model predictions with observed streamflow data. Streamflow data were separated into direct runoff and baseflow to estimate the impacts of urbanization on each hydrologic component. Analysis of the ratio between direct runoff and total runoff from 30 years of simulation results and the change in these ratios with urbanization shows that estimated annual direct runoff increased from 49.2 percent (1973) to 63.1 percent (1984) and 65.0 percent (1991), indicating the effects of urbanization are greater on direct runoff than on total runoff. The direct runoff ratio also varies with annual rainfall, with dry year ratios larger than those for wet years. This suggests that the impact of urbanization on areas that are sensitive to runoff ratios, such as stream ecosystems, might be more serious during drier years than in wetter years in terms of water quality and water yield. This indicates that sustainable baseflow is important to maintaining sound stream ecosystems.

AB A game-theoretic model is presented analyzing collusive non-investment. Firms decide whether to replace present production with an alternative that is improving over time. If both firms replace old with new, both will have invested without obtaining a sustainable competitive advantage; hence, there may be a reason to collusively not invest. Such collusion is shown to be more likely feasible when the alternate technology is rapidly improving. An example of such collusion is presented. It is also illustrated that, during Japan's 1950s-1970s rapid development, the necessary conditions for successful collusive non-investment existed for participants in Japanese government-sponsored cartels.

DE India; housing; urban development; construction
AB Adequate shelter for all is one of the most pressing challenges faced by developing countries. Based on its census of 1991, India had a shortage of 18.5 million houses in 199 1, and this number would have swollen since then. The construction sector represents the most pressing need, namely shelter. Technologies that are environmentally sustainable are another important issue in countries that are on the path to development. Earlier researchers have indicated that construction activity contributes 17% of the carbon dioxide emissions in India. This paper interweaves various issues and proposes a construction strategy for the Indian housing sector. Affordability of a house and availability of building materials for its construction are the main constraints upon access to shelter. This paper analyzes the possibility of containing cost and adopting technologies that can achieve lower emissions. Recent government policy statements have indicated that an annual supply of two million new houses would be required to meet the current shortage of housing in India. This paper estimates the investment and material requirements for the construction of two million houses and evaluates the construction technologies commonly used as well as low-cost techniques. It is asserted that proper selection of such techniques and material can reduce the costs and emissions substantially.

AB In spite of the optimum sustainability, environmental compatibility, and numerous health and other socio-economic benefits of walking as a mode of urban travel, the safety of pedestrians receives insufficient attention from both drivers and policy makers, especially in non-industrialized nations, and pedestrians remain the most vulnerable road users. This research paper begins by highlighting the plight of pedestrians in a number of industrialized and non-industrialized nations. Next, the result of the analysis of a systematic-random sample of 443 pedestrian injury/fatality accident records occurring over the 3-year period, 1996-98, in metropolitan Kuwait is presented. The characteristics of the injurious and fatal pedestrian accidents with regards to cause, result, time of day, vehicle type, location, pedestrian age, nationality, and gender, are compared and discussed. A number of recommendations for safety improvements for pedestrians conclude the paper.

TI Malaria and its possible control on the island of Principe

AB Background: Malaria can be eradicated from islands. To assess the prospects for eradication of malaria from the island of Principe in the Gulf of Guinea, we fitted a mathematical model to age-prevalence curves and thus obtained estimates of the vectorial capacity and of the basic reproductive number (R-0) for malaria.
   Methods: A cross-sectional malariological survey was carried out, in mid-1999, in six communities, comprising circa 17% of the total 6,000 population of the island. All houses in these communities were registered and their mode of construction recorded. Thick and thin blood films were prepared from all consenting individuals. Each individual was asked whether they possessed a mosquito net, whether they had slept under a mosquito net the previous night, whether they were allergic to chloroquine, and whether they had visited the main island of Sao Tome since the beginning of the year. Outpatient records from March 1999 until the end of December 2000 were also examined and the age and place of residence of diagnosed cases noted.
   Results: 203 (19.8%) of the 1,026 individuals examined were found to be infected with Plasmodium falciparum. By fitting the mathematical model of the Garki project to the age-prevalence curve we estimate that the basic reproductive number, R-0, on the island is approximately 1.6. Over a period of one year, a total of 1,792 P. falciparum cases reported to an outpatient facility at the island's hospital. Overall, 54% of the people interviewed slept under mosquito nets and were at reduced risk of infection. Conversely, people living in houses with openings between the top of the wall and the roof had higher risk of infection.
   Conclusion: This high incidence suggests that most of the malaria cases on the island attend the hospital and that treatment of these cases is an important factor reducing the effective rate of transmission. Providing that clinical cases are effectively treated, endemic malaria can probably be eliminated from the island mainly by reducing exposure to the vector with simple measures such as insecticide-treated nets and mosquito-proofing of dwellings. In contrast to traditional malaria eradication strategies, this would avoid the risk of malaria epidemics because the reduction in R-0 should be sustainable.

TI Maximum sustainable government debt in the overlapping generations model
SO MANCHESTER SCHOOL
LA English
DT Article
ID DEFICITS
AB The theoretical determinants of maximum sustainable government debt are investigated using Diamond's overlapping generations model. A level of debt is defined to be 'sustainable' if a steady state with non-degenerate values of economic variables exists. We show that a maximum sustainable level of debt almost always exists, and it normally occurs where variables such as capital are in the interiors, rather than at the limits, of their economically feasible ranges. This leads to a situation where, when debt is at its maximum, a further infinitesimal increase in debt causes a 'catastrophe', i.e. the economy embarks on a path of unchecked capital decumulation.

AB There is strong theoretical and empirical evidence supporting the idea that "first-to-market" leads to an enduring market share advantage. In sharp contrast to these findings, we find that at the business unit level being first-to-market leads, on average, to a long-term profit disadvantage. This result holds for a sample of consumer goods as well as a sample of industrial goods and leads to questions about the validity of first mover advantage, in and of itself, as a strategy to achieve superior performance. We replicate the typical demand-side pioneering advantage but find an even greater average cost disadvantage, which is the source of the pioneering profit disadvantage. In an extended analysis, we show that first-to-market leads to an initial profit advantage, which, depending on the sample or profit measure, lasts for about 12 to 14 years before turning into a disadvantage. Moreover, we show that pioneers differentially benefit from a lack of consumer learning, a strong market position and patent protection. These three moderating factors together can actually help pioneers achieve a sustainable profit advantage over later entrants. Finally, we find strong support for the theoretical argument that the entry order decision should be treated as endogenous in empirical estimation.

AB New methods for better identification of timber geographical origin would constitute an important technical element in the forest industry, for phytosanitary certification procedures or in the chain of custody developed for the certification of timber from sustainably managed forests. In the case of the European white oaks, a detailed reference map of chloroplast (cp) DNA variation across the range exists, and we propose here to use the strong geographical structure, characterized by a differentiation of western vs. eastern populations, for the purpose of oak wood traceability. We first developed cpDNA markers permitting the characterization of haplotype on degraded DNA obtained from wood samples. The techniques were subsequently validated by confirming the full correspondence between genotypes obtained from living tissues (buds) and from wood collected from the same individual oak. Finally, a statistical procedure was used to test if the haplotype composition of a lot of wood samples is consistent with its presumed geographical origin. Clearly, the technique cannot permit the unambiguous identification of wood products of unknown origin but can be used to check the conformity of genetic composition of wood samples with the region of alleged origin. This could lead to major applications not only in the forest industry but also in archaeology or in palaeobotany.

TI Speech, death, and double effect
SO NEW YORK UNIVERSITY LAW REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
ID PHYSICIAN-ASSISTED SUICIDE; OREGON; EXPERIENCES
AB In this Article, Professor Seana Shiffrin identifies and explores a tension between the Supreme Court's recognition of First Amendment protection for incendiary speech and the Court's argument for rejecting the claim to a right to assisted suicide. Constitutionally, speakers may not be held liable for the illegal actions they inspire in audience members, unless the very high Brandenburg standard is met. By contrast, it is constitutional to prevent those who would seek assisted suicide from doing so, on the ground that a culture in which some elect suicide will encourage a higher incidence of involuntary deaths. Here, those who would voluntarily seek to exercise an important liberty interest are restricted in light of the projected illegal action of others. Shiffrin argues that this same tension is replicated in the contrast between the Court's approach to incendiary speech and its approach to the regulation of secondary effects. Shiffrin contends that this tension holds special interest because the asymmetry it represents privileges intended harm over merely foreseen or foreseeable harm, inverting the traditional priority associated with the doctrine of double effect. Shiffrin argues that, surprisingly, this inversion may be defensible in legal contexts, even if it is not sustainable in interpersonal moral theory. In fact, the inversion can result from the use of double-effect-style reasoning at the level of rule formation. Although this inversion may seem counterintuitive, the justifications for the legal protections for freedom of speech and for self-determination may provide a plausible explanation. We may understand the doctrinal difference by examining the structure of the values at which each regulation is aimed. The value of freedom of speech can only be realized if speakers are insulated from responsibility for the persuasive impact of their speech; by contrast, the liberty interest valued in the context of assisted suicide does not encompass the side effects of that action. This justification may also have implications for the future interpretation of the secondary effects doctrine.

TI Classification management for grassland in Gansu Province, China
SO NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH

DT Article
DE multi-functionality of grassland; classification management;
   conservation grassland; productive grassland
AB Grassland is multi-functional. On the basis of the different functions performed by different grassland types, and regional development demands for grassland functions, the classification management concept of grassland was designed to ensure the sustainability of grassland ecosystems. Principles, financial mechanisms, and properties of classification management are introduced in this paper. To aid management of grassland, Gansu grassland is classified into two main management sectors. One is conservation grassland, mainly devoted to ecological and social values; the other is productive grassland, where attention is focused on economic benefits through moderate or intensive production, and contributing to social value by income generated. Conservation grassland makes up 6.05 x 10(6) ha, or 38% of Gansu Province. Productive grassland is 10.02 x 10(6) ha, 62% of Gansu Province, in which 8.93 x 10(6) ha is moderately grazed grassland and 1.09 X 10(6) ha is intensively grazed grassland. Management strategies are proposed for conservation and productive grassland respectively. Absence of grazing and cropping is predominant in the management of conservation grassland, to restore degenerated areas and protect grassland with important ecological value from destruction, and further to improve the environment. Agricultural measures, such as fertiliser and irrigation, are used to enhance the productivity of intensively grazed grassland, and rotational grazing is used on moderately grazed grassland. The management of productive grassland is contracted to the managers who are given sole responsibility for its profitability. The Government finances the conservation grassland in the China West Development.

AB The government context that series as a backdrop to energy policy-making at the turn of the millennium is characterised by trends towards deregulation of the electricity; markets and increasing awareness of sustainable development goals. Both trends are affecting nuclear energy and its fuel cycle, offering new opportunities and raising new challenges for the future. Industrial practices and research and development programmes supported by governments and/or industry are responding to evolving market and social requirements. Ongoing R&D programmes in the field of nuclear reactors and the fuel cycle are contributing to the enhancement of the technical, safety and economic performance of nuclear systems in operation and under development. Scientific and technological progress follow either evolutionary or innovative routes, but always aim at improving overall efficiency throughout the nuclear energy chain.

AB Agricultural revolutions in the past have been characterized by synergistic interactions between several innovations, which have yet to emerge with biotechnology. Although the intensification of agriculture has created new problems of sustainability, it has ameliorated others. The developing countries, with four-fifths of the present world population to support on only half of the arable land, currently have about 800 million chronically undernourished people, yet must also provide for nearly all further population growth. Nevertheless,financial support for the required agricultural research in the less developed countries (LDCs), although less than 3% as much as the annual OECD expenditure on support for its own agriculture, is currently being reduced. Only with a substantial boost to aid for the funding of public sector agricultural research in and for the developing countries will they be able both to eliminate chronic malnourishment and feed the additional two or more billion people.

AB Although local knowledge of their economic exploitation is still poor, a new look at vicuna may offer important economic possibilities for the inhabitants of the High Andes in Bolivia. This article investigates the possibilities for a change in vicuna production systems in Bolivia, which could result in increased economic benefits whilst guaranteeing the sustainability of the system. Its main conclusion is that future vicuna production systems can certainly be made more efficient and sustainable, but that more effort is needed to develop new marketing systems and technologies if the inhabitants are to take full advantage of the possibilities that vicuna production offers.

   HIV/AIDS; role of gender; policy guidelines
AB How to assist the rural poor to enhance their livelihoods and food security in a sustainable way is one of the greatest challenges we face. Food security strategies should be based on the premise that food insecurity and famine derive from failure of access to food rather than global food shortage. Food security is mainly about the access of poor households to food and about how political, economic and social factors affect households' food security. In this article, the relationship between hunger and poverty, the meaning of food security and sustainable livelihood security are explored. The article focuses on food security as one of the important elements of sustainable livelihood approaches, analysing the role of women in the household economy, food production and ultimately food security. Finally it assesses policy guidelines for promoting these approaches.

AB The objective of this work was to estimate the sustainable biomass of pirarucu Arapaima gigas (Cuvier, 1829) juveniles kept in small volume net cages. During 200 days four 1-m(3) net cages were stocked with 21 fish/cage and had an initial total biomass of 0.84+/-0.14 kg (21 fish/cage). The net cages were placed in a 50-m(2) pond with constant water flow. Conditioning factor, feed conversion, specific growth rate and gain showed that the sustainable biomass of pirarucu juveniles for intensive rearing in 1-m(3) net cages was approximately 29 kg. Fish length at the end of the trial, in relation to the reduced net cage space, was a limiting factor to obtain good biological indices.

AB Research by the USDA-Agricultural Research Service (ARS) on biological control of weeds has been practiced for many years because of its inherent ecological and economic advantages. Today, it is further driven by ARS adherence to Presidential Executive Order 13112 (3 February 1999) on invasive species and to USDA-ARS policy toward developing technology in support of sustainable agriculture with reduced dependence on non-renewable petrochemical resources. This paper reports examples or case studies selected to demonstrate the traditional or classical approach for biological control programs using Old World arthropods against Tamarix spp, Melaleuca quinquenervia (Cav) ST Blake and Galium spurium L/G apatine L, and the augmentative approach with a native plant pathogen against Pueraria lobata Ohwi = P montana. The examples illustrated various conflicts of interest with endangered species and ecological complexities of arthropods with associated microbes such as nematodes.

AB Nitrogen acquisition is one of the most important factors for plant production, and N contribution from biological N(2) fixation can reduce the need for industrial N fertilizers. Perennial forages are widespread in temperate and boreal areas, where much of the agriculture is based on livestock production. Due to the symbiosis with N(2)-fixing rhizobia, perennial forage legumes have great potential to increase sustainability in such grassland farming systems. The present work is a summary of a large number of studies investigating N(2) fixation in three perennial forage legumes primarily relating to ungrazed northern temperate/boreal areas. Reported rates of N(2) fixation in above-ground plant tissues were in the range of up to 373 kg N ha(-1) year(-1) in red clover (Trifolium pratense L.), 545 kg N ha(-1) year(-1) in white clover (T. repens L.) and 350 kg N ha(-1) year(-1) in alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.). When grown in mixtures with grasses, these species took a large fraction of their nitrogen from N(2) fixation (average around 80%), regardless of management, dry matter yield and location. There was a large variation in N(2) fixation data and part of this variation was ascribed to differences in plant production between years. Studies with experiments at more than one site showed that also geographic location was an important source of variation. On the other hand, when all data were plotted against latitude, there was no simple correlation. Climatic conditions seem therefore to give as high N(2) fixation per ha and year in northern areas (around 60degreesN) as in areas with a milder climate (around 40degreesN). Analyzing whole plants or just above-ground plant parts influenced the estimate of N(2) fixation, and most reported values were underestimated since roots were not included. Despite large differences in environmental conditions, such as N fertilization and geographic location, N(2) fixation (Nfix; kg N per ha and year) was significantly (P < 0.001) correlated to legume dry matter yield (DM; kg per ha and year). Very rough, but nevertheless valuable estimations of Nfix in legume/grass mixtures (roots not considered) are given by Nfix = 0.026 center dot DM + 7 for T. pratense, Nfix = 0.031 center dot DM + 24 for T. repens, and Nfix = 0.021 center dot DM + 17 for M. sativa.

AB NatureWorks(TM) polylactide (PLA)(1) is a versatile polymer produced by Cargill Dow LLC. Cargill Dow is building a global platform of sustainable polymers and chemicals entirely made from renewable resources. Cargill Dow's business philosophy is explained including the role of life cycle assessment (LCA), a tool used for measuring environmental sustainability and identifying environmental performance-improvement objectives. The paper gives an overview of applications of LCA to PLA production and provides insight into how they are utilized. The first application reviews the contributions to the gross. fossil energy requirement for PLA (54 MJ/kg). In the second one PLA is compared with petrochemical-based polymers using fossil energy use, global warming and water use as the three impact indicators. The last application gives more details about the potential reductions in energy use and greenhouse gasses. Cargill Dow's 5-8 year objective is to decrease the fossil energy use from 54 MJ/kg PLA down to about 7 MJ/kg PLA. The objective for greenhouse gasses is a reduction from +1.8 down to -1.7 kg CO2 equivalents/kg PLA. (C) 2003 Cargill Dow B.V. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

TI An assessment of fiscal sustainability in Romania
SO POST-COMMUNIST ECONOMIES
LA English
DT Article
AB This article analyses Romanian fiscal policy during the 1990s with the main emphasis on the aspect of sustainability of the budget situation. First, the study presents the general development of Romania's economy during the transition period as background for the subsequent policy analysis. Second, the problems of quasi-fiscal subsidies and payment arrears which led to very large quasi-fiscal deficits are highlighted. In the next step, a macroeconomic model is introduced to assess the degree of fiscal sustainability starting with the inter-temporal government budget constraint. The overall deficit for the general government, including central and local governments as well as other institutions belonging to the non-financial public sector, is computed using official statistics. The research findings suggest that Romania has followed an unsustainable fiscal policy in the transition period, particularly up to 1996. In the first half of the 1990s the government financed the deficit partly through seignorage and tried to deal with immediate pressures, preventing social dissatisfaction but neglecting long-term targets. The situation has improved slightly in recent years, nevertheless, there is still much to be done in this area.

TI Progress and prospects for the development of computer-generated actors
   for military simulation: Part I - Introduction and background
SO PRESENCE-TELEOPERATORS AND VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENTS
LA English
DT Article
ID ENVIRONMENTS
AB The development of computer-generated synthetic environments, also called distributed virtual environments, for military simulation relies heavily upon computer-generated actors (CGAs) to provide accurate behaviors at reasonable cost so that the synthetic environments are useful, affordable, complex, and realistic. Unfortunately, the pace of synthetic environment development and the level of desired CGA performance continue to rise at a much faster rate than CGA capability improvements. This insatiable demand for realism in CGAs for synthetic environments arises from the growing understanding of the significant role that modeling and simulation can play in a variety of venues. These uses include training, analysis, procurement decisions, mission rehearsal, doctrine development, force-level and task-level training, information assurance, cyberwarfare, force structure analysis, sustainability analysis, life cycle costs analysis, material management, infrastructure analysis, and many others. In these and other uses of military synthetic environments, computer-generated actors play a central role because they have the potential to increase the realism of the environment while also reducing the cost of operating the environment. The progress made in addressing the technical challenges that must be overcome to realize effective and realistic CGAs for military simulation environments and the technical areas that should be the focus of future work are the subject of this series of papers, which survey the technologies and progress made in the construction and use of CGAs. In this, the first installment in the series of three papers, we introduce the topic of computer-generated actors and issues related to their performance and fidelity and other background information for this research area as related to military simulation. We also discuss CGA reasoning system techniques and architectures.

AB The recent (2000) global water supply and sanitation assessment by the World Health Organisation found that over one billion people do not have access to improved water supply. The finding points to the challenges faced by municipal engineers and other professionals responsible for the provision of water services in developing countries. Population growth and the increasing poverty, particularly in the urban areas, compound the challenge. A key objective for water utilities is to provide services to the growing population, including the poor, in a financially sustainable manner. Strategic marketing offers an innovative method of meeting this objective. Research aimed at adapting and developing a marketing approach for use in the water sector was carried out in a number of developing countries between 1999 and 2001, with detailed field research in Kenya, Uganda and India. This paper discusses strategic marketing of urban water services and provides a methodology that water utilities could use to structure their service delivery options to customers while meeting their financial objectives. The paper outlines how utilities could structure service delivery with appropriate pricing and serve more excluded customers (including the poor) at affordable cost and achieve financial sustainability. The paper concludes that strategic marketing of water services has potential to improve services to existing and excluded (potential) customers while improving the utility's revenue base.

TI Corruption, cooperation and endogenous time discount rates
SO PUBLIC CHOICE
LA English
DT Article
ID UNOFFICIAL ACTIVITY
AB Virtually all uses of repeated games to study of cooperation assume that people's time discount rates are exogenous and fixed. Here we offer an evolutionary game embedded in a multi-period model of investment and consumption in which individual time discounts are determined by their convergence to values determined by Evolutionary Stable Strategies. Our substantive motivation, though, is corruption and its relationship to economic growth. To understand the observed relationship between levels of corruption and economic indicators of social welfare, we argue that corruption is a form of cooperation that requires close interpersonal monitoring. If we assume, moreover, that when people discount the future greatly the only sustainable forms of cooperation are those that allow for close monitoring, then our analysis can be interpreted as a dynamic model of the relationship between corruption and investment.

TI Profitable technical trading rules as a source of price instability
SO QUANTITATIVE FINANCE
LA English
DT Article
ID MARKETS; VOLUME; MODEL; CHAOS; RISK
AB This model incorporates technical trading rules (TTRs) that extract information from the price,. allowing the users to benefit from the information. Sustainable profits are possible as long as the price movements reflect changes in the security's intrinsic value. The choice to use the TTR rather than fundamental information is endogenous to the model. Increases in the popularity of the TTR can produce price bubbles and diminish the TTR's ability to extract a reliable signal. Large fluctuations in the TTR's popularity lead to unsustainable periods of positive profits coupled with long-term losses.

AB The objective of this article is to answer why and how firms in developing countries with limited R&D resources can gain sustainable competitive advantage through technology transfer (TT). Successful firms are those that can accumulate competence through internal technological learning after transferring technologies from external technology sources. Organizational intelligence, firm specificity of technology, and causal ambiguity are identified as three mediators between technological learning performance and several antecedents previously discussed in the literature. A survey of Taiwanese manufacturers is conducted to explore the technological learning phenomenon as an integral part of TT, which is important but often neglected. This article also provides an interesting research setting for the evaluation of technological learning theories.

AB Activities within waste management systems, such as energy and material recovery, can lead to indirect environmental impacts that occur outside of waste management systems. In this paper, the effect of including indirect greenhouse-gas emissions on the choice of waste management solutions on a national level is explored. The global warming potentials (GWPs) of future waste management solutions for Sweden are compared. These include direct and indirect GWPs resulting from recovering power, heat, biogas, materials and nutrients. Furthermore, two of the assumptions that are presumed to be crucial for determining the indirect GWPs are examined in sensitivity analyses. It was found that indirect GWPs of waste management could be large when comparing a range of waste management solutions. Including indirect GWPs may even change the ranking of the solutions. However, the estimates of the indirect GWs are sensitive to the assumptions made. Including them involves large uncertainties. Despite this, some general conclusions regarding the preferability of the respective solutions can be drawn. Including indirect environmental impacts is important when providing information to support strategic planning that involves choosing among waste management solutions. Ultimately, it is a question of improving the ability of waste management planners to design environmentally sustainable and robust waste management systems. increased knowledge of the indirect environmental impacts of waste management can contribute to providing such an improvement.

AB Soil chemical properties and soil mesofauna composition were assessed at a forest site in northern Austria, where 20 years earlier an amelioration treatment had been performed. The site had been treated with limestone, a high P slag, and ammonium nitrate to replace the poorly growing pine (Pinus sylvestris) forest with a Norway spruce (Picea abies) stand. This treatment was at that time a common means for the amelioration of nutrient-poor forest soils with recalcitrant forest floor layers. After treatment, a dense cover of a nitrophilic stinging nettle (Urtica dioica) developed. Most likely, the site had been over-fertilized, and inadvertently, an experiment with extreme N enrichment had been conducted. The abundance of collembolans increased, and dominance structure shifted from Isotomiella minor, Lipothrix lubbocki , and Isotoma notabilis at fertilizer treatment to Friesea mirabilis, Isotomiella minor, and Sphaeridia pumilis in the control, but the abundance of soil mesofauna generally decreased in the fertilizer treatment. Fertilization reduced the mass of the litter layer from 7.6 to 2.4 kg/m(2). The total carbon pool in the soil was reduced due to reduction of the litter layer. However, the content of soil organic matter in the upper mineral soil was significantly increased. A part of the applied and mineralized nitrogen had been lost from the soil, but N retention in the upper mineral soil was still considerable. Soil pH and the base saturation were sustainably increased. Carbon losses upon mineralization of the litter layer were not offset by the increase in C content of the mineral soil. Presently, the C pool in the soil of the fertilized treatment is lower than in the control. However, the overall nutrient enrichment of the soil may facilitate C sequestration in the fertilized site in the future.

AB Soil damage, compaction and displacement, during logging or clearing and cultivation affects both soil physical and chemical properties and reduces growth of regenerated or planted tree seedlings. Understanding the factors involved will aid management and set limits for indicators of sustainable management in eucalypt forests. In the first of two glasshouse studies, three Eucalyptus species were grown for 110 days in soils from six forest sites in Tasmania, Australia. Sites sampled ranged from low rainfall dry forest to very high rainfall wet forest. Soil was collected from three soil depths, in 10 cm increments to 30 cm, each packed in pots to four different bulk densities, ranging from that present in undisturbed field sites to that plus 0.17 g cm(-3). In the second study Eucalyptus globulus Labill. seedlings were grown in soil collected from disturbed and undisturbed sites, packed to two bulk densities, and fertilized with combinations of N and P. Increasing soil compaction, in Study 1, caused a proportional decrease in final mass of seedlings of up to 25%. Growth on soil from lower horizons (10-30 cm) averaged only 41% of that on topsoil, a significantly greater restriction of growth than that achieved through compaction. It was concluded that topsoil displacement and profile disturbance was a more significant form of soil damage than compaction. Above-ground dry weight of seedlings was most strongly correlated with soil total N but poorly correlated with other macronutrients. Growth of E. globulus seedlings grown on disturbed soils, in Study 2, averaged 30% of that on undisturbed sites. With added P and N on undisturbed sites growth averaged seven times that of the unfertilized seedlings indicating a general deficit of available P and N on the three soils tested. On soils from disturbed areas, there was also a response to fertilizing with N and P together but the response varied on the three soils. The effects of profile disturbance were ameliorated with fertilizer applications on only one of the soils. The results highlighted the importance of retaining topsoil in situ during forest operations. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) budgets were calculated for nine organic farms in the UK. The farms were situated on sandy loams, silty clay loams and silty loams over chalk with stockless farming systems and cattle, pig and poultry enterprises with a significant proportion of arable cropping. A soil surface nutrient budget was calculated for the target rotation on each farm using information about field management and measurements of the soil, crops and manure. Losses of N through leaching and volatilization were calculated independently using the NITCAT and MANNER models. Nutrient budgets for seven of the farm rotations showed an N surplus, six a P surplus and three a K surplus. The ratio of N inputs supplied in the form of biological fixation : manure : atmospheric deposition was approximately 2 : 2 : 1 for stocked systems and 2 : 0 : 1 for stockless systems. Phosphorus surpluses resulted from supplementary P fertilizer (rock phosphate) and additional feed for non-ruminant livestock. The stockless system without P fertilizer resulted in a large P deficit and stocked systems, which relied on recycling manure alone, a small P deficit. Only rotations with large returns of manure or imported feed showed a K surplus or a balanced K budget.

AB We compared the effects of conventional and organic arable farming on soil organic matter (SOM) content, soil structure, aggregate stability and C and N mineralization, which are considered important factors in defining sustainable land management. Within one soil series, three different farming systems were selected, including a conventional and an organic arable system and permanent pasture without tillage. The old pasture represents optimal conditions in terms of soil structure and organic matter inputs and is characterized by high earthworm activity. More than 70 years of different management has caused significant differences in soil properties. SOM content, mineralization, earthworm activity and water-stable aggregation decreased as a result of tillage and arable cropping when compared with pasture, but were significantly greater under organic farming than under conventional farming. Total SOM contents between 0 and 20 cm depth amounted to 15, 24 and 46 g kg(-1) for the conventional arable, organic arable and permanent pasture fields, respectively. Although less sensitive to slaking than the conventionally managed field, the soil under organic farming was susceptible to compaction when high pressures were exerted on the soil under wet conditions. The beneficial effects of organic farming are generally associated with soil biochemical properties, but soil physical aspects should also be considered. Depending on soil type and climate, organic farmers need to be careful not to destroy the soil structure, so that they can enjoy maximum advantage from their organic farming systems.

AB This paper reviews the techniques that have generated a large improvement in drilling and completion performance on the Good-wyn A Platform, Northwest Shelf, Australia. The collective effort of well-construction professionals using these techniques has resulted in the drilling of a 6263-m (20,550-ft) total depth (TD) well with a horizontal stepout of 5200 m (17,060 ft) at a tangent angle of 67degrees in 39 days from spud to well handover. This was 31% under the P50 authorization-for-expenditure (AFE) time estimate.
   This paper describes a method to produce systematic, steady, and sustainable improvements to well-construction operations. The methods described are a way of harnessing the collective brain-power of well-construction professionals and focusing that energy toward rigorous problem analysis or potential improvement areas, then systematically working through and implementing solutions.
   The technical limit methodology and performance improvement groups (PIGs) are best suited for complex, high-cost drilling projects, typically extended reach drilling (ERD) developments, high-cost mobile offshore drilling units (MODU) exploration or subsea operations.
   In addition, other tools, such as hazard management, learning system, and planning processes that contributed to success, are explained.

TI An elective partnership: Salvaging transatlantic relations
SO SURVIVAL

DT Article
AB The Iraq war clearly has had a sharply chilling effect on transatlantic publics' regard for one another. Whether the previous sense of solidarity can be restored in the future will depend on the policies that governments on both sides adopt in the crucial months to come. Developing a new, sustainable transatlantic relationship will require a series of deliberate decisions on both sides of the Atlantic-a partnership of choice, not necessity. For the United States, this means avoiding the temptation, offered by our unprecedented strength, to go it alone in pursuit of narrowly defined national interests. For Europe, the new partnership will require a willingness to accept that the United States plays a uniquely valuable role as a leader in a world where power still matters, and that a commitment to a rule-based international order does not obviate the need to act decisively against those who do not share that vision.

TI Limits to growth in the new economy: exploring the 'get big fast'
   strategy in e-commerce
SO SYSTEM DYNAMICS REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
ID MISPERCEPTIONS; FEEDBACK
AB Many e-businesses have pursued a 'get big fast' (GBF) strategy, pricing low and marketing heavily to build their user base, in the belief that there were significant sources of increasing returns favoring early entrants and large players. Until early 2000 the capital markets rewarded the GBF strategy, but since then market values have collapsed and scores of new-economy firms have failed. The rise and fall of the dot coms is not merely a case of a speculative bubble. Many firms stumbled when they grew so rapidly that they were unable to fulfill orders or provide quality service. GBF proponents focus on the positive feedbacks that create increasing returns and favor aggressive firms, but have not paid adequate attention to the negative feedbacks that can limit growth, e.g., service quality erosion. The faster a firm grows, the stronger these negative feedbacks may be. We address these issues with a formal dynamic model of competition among online and click-and-mortar companies in business-to-consumer e-commerce. The model endogenously generates demand, market share, service quality, employee skill and retention, content creation, market valuation, and other key variables. The model is calibrated to the online book market and Amazon.com as a test case. We explore growth strategies for e-commerce firms and their sustainability under different scenarios for customer, competitor, and capital market behavior. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

DE albacore (Thunnus alalunga); catch per unit effort; general linear
   models; abundance index; surplus production model
AB Albacore (Thunnus alalunga), harvested mainly by longline, has been productive in the Indian Ocean, The population dynamics of Indian albacore has been analyzed by various assessing models. However, the abundance index used previously showed variety within some extents to result in uncertain measures for the stock status. With respect to the importance of environmental factors in estimating an abundance index, the objectives of the present paper are to standardize catch per unit effort for Taiwanese longline fishery by involving a sea surface temperature in general linear model, and to assess the albacore stock using the estimated abundance index by surplus production models. The results obtained reveal that the standardized catch per unit effort follows closely the fishery and the maximum sustainable yield estimated ranges from 32,168 to 34,910 metric tons and effective fishing effort at maximum sustainable yield ranges from 296 to 313 million standardized hooks for different surplus production models. Therefore, the stock status is evaluated to be in healthy and fully exploited condition; and a close monitoring, still, an intensive analysis using age-structured models is recommended for subsequent studies.

AB This paper presents a case study of the Strahan Visitor Centre, Tasmania, Australia. We surveyed 252 on-site visitors using a structured questionnaire to determine who used the Centre and their assessment of the facility. Eight key informants with direct experience in Tasmania's tourism industry, or the design, management and operation of visitor centres, were interviewed to elicit their opinions on the Centre and the associated interpretation. The case study results, together with the qualitative, semi-structured key informant interviews, are used to discuss the main elements supporting sustainable visitor centres. This research identifies that it is not enough to only assess a visitor centre's sustainability by its popularity with visitors. It is also important to consider the needs of managers, operators, and local and cultural communities. Recommendations include adopting a consultative approach and involving stakeholders when planning, designing and operating visitor centres and valuing community, cultural and social capital when constructing new facilities.

AB The rapid and unplanned speed of development that took place on the Mediterranean Coast of Spain, after WWII led to some well documented negative impacts. In the closing decade of the 20th century, however, the Spanish Government took steps to rationalise development by adopting a more sustainable and planned approach. This includes the twin-track formulation of new tourism development plans to improve the quality of the well established Spanish tourist resorts (Plan de Excelencia Turistica), and develop new tourist resorts in municipalities where tourism activity did not exist (Plan de Dinamizacion Turistiea). Taking the inland village of Cuellar, which acted as a pilot for the national scheme, this paper draws on primary evidence in the form of nonprobability sampling, to provide some insights into local perceptions about the way the first Plan de Dinamizacion Turistica was approached.

AB When staff of the Papua New Guinea Institute of Medical Research first went into Wosera in 1979, to try and interest the community into participating in malaria research, the traditional warning sign of crossed bamboo sticks constantly blocked their path as they tried to enter the villages. In 2003, the site is a thriving research centre, with many projects under its belt, a successfully executed malaria vaccine trial to its credit, and similar to13000 people from 29 villages currently participating in demographic surveillance and various research projects. It has been a long road from community suspicion to sustainable community participation, and the field workers have learned many important lessons along the way that can be applicable to research programs in other disease-endemic areas.

AB A grazing trial was conducted to quantify N cycling in degraded Leucaena leucocephala (leucaena)-Brachiaria decumbens (signal grass) pastures grown on an acid, infertile, podzolic soil in south-east Queensland.
   Nitrogen accumulation and cycling in leucaena-signal grass pastures were evaluated for 9 weeks until all of the leucaena on offer (mean 600 kg edible dry matter (EDM)/ha, 28% of total pasture EDM) was consumed. Nitrogen pools in the grass, leucaena, soil, cattle liveweight, faeces and urine were estimated.
   The podzolic soil (pH 4.8-5.9) was found to be deficient in P, Ca and K. Leucaena leaf tissues contained deficient levels of N, P and Ca. Grass tissues were deficient in N and P.
   Grazing was found to cycle 65% of N on offer in pasture herbage. However, due to the effect of the plant nutrient imbalances described above, biological N fixation by leucaena contributed only 15 kg/ha N to the pasture system over the 9-month regrowth period, of which 13 kg/ha N was cycled. Cattle retained 1.8 kg/ha N (8% of total N consumed) in body tissue and the remainder was excreted in dung and urine in approximately equal proportions. Mineral soil N concentrations did not change significantly (-3.5 kg/ha N) over the trial period. The ramifications of grazing and fertiliser management strategies, and implications for pasture rundown and sustainability are discussed.

AB The sustainable city has now become a leading paradigm of urban development throughout the world. Although the practices, discourses and ideologies associated with the sustainable city have been widely disseminated, analyses of sustainable urban development remain surprisingly anodyne. Drawing upon the insights of regulation theory, this paper attempts to develop a critical engagement with the sustainable city as a space of socio-ecological regulation. Focusing upon two examples of sustainable urban development in practice-the first, the struggle over work-place environments in Stoke-on-Trent; and the second, the reinsertion of nature into the Black Country urban region-this paper explores the regulatory geography of the sustainable city and the environmental visions and practices with which it is associated.

AB With an extension of 1.2 million square kilometers, the Guarani Aquifer System is one of the largest transboundary groundwater systems in the world. It underlies parts of Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay and was only relatively recently recognized as a transboundary resource. The four countries are now in the process of starting up a project to elaborate and implement a common institutional and technical framework for managing and preserving the Guarani Aquifer System for current and future generations. This paper briefly presents the Guarani Aquifer System Project. The preparation process is described due to its particular interest for other similar multi-country endeavors. Following the presentation of the project, the paper takes a forward-looking approach and analyzes the applicability of current international law for transboundary groundwater resources in the context Of the Guarani Aquifer System. It concludes that while the basic principles espoused by international law relating to transboundary groundwater resources management are valid, they do not provide very specific guidance. The Guarani Aquifer System is unique and its complex features make it an eclectic case, which already is obliging all stakeholders to work out innovative measures - in the legal, institutional, technical, scientific, social, and economic realms - to develop appropriate activities for its sustainable management.

ID IRRIGATION
AB Jordan is extremely water-scarce with just 167 m(3) per capita per year to meet domestic, industrial, agricultural, tourism, and environmental demands. The heavy exploitation of water resources has contributed to declines in the levels of aquifers and the Dead Sea. Rapid growth in demand, particularly for higher quality water for domestic, industrial, and tourism uses, is significantly increasing pressure on agricultural and environmental uses of water both of which must continue to adapt to reduced volumes and lower quality water The agricultural sector has begun to respond by improving irrigation efficiency and increasing the use of recycled water Total demand for water still exceeds renewable supplies while inadequate treatment of sewage used for irrigation creates potential environmental and health risks and presents agricultural marketing challenges that undermine the competitiveness of exports. The adaptive capability of the natural environment may already be past sustainable limits with oasis wetlands having been most seriously affected. Development of new water resources is extremely expensive in Jordan with an average investment cost of US$4 to $5 per cubic meter This paper examines four integrated water resources management (IWRM) approaches of relevance to Jordan: water reuse, demand management, energy-water linkages, and transboundary water management. nile progress in Jordan has been made, the Ministry of Water and Irrigation continues to he concerned about the acute water scarcity the country faces as well as the need to continue working with concerned stakeholders to assure future water supplies.

TI Mekong River development - Whose dreams? Which visions?
SO WATER INTERNATIONAL
LA English
DT Article
DE Mekong River; sustainable development; symbolic/pragmatic dimensions;
   river landscape
AB We propose in this paper that the challenge to create a sustainable channel of commerce and prosperity in the Mekong River basin which contains 70 million people and encompasses the 230 million people of Cambodia, China southern province of Yunnan, Burma, Laos, Thailand, and Vietnam, represents the "last frontier" of Southeast Asia. Balanced, sustainable development has been pitted against purely economic objectives, which necessarily involve the taming of the Mighty Mekong by the investors, politicians, and technocrats who seek to build bridges, erect dams, and divert waters, disrupting the local lives which the river has traditionally sustained throughout a millennium of seasons. Now the voices of the people directly affected by the development projects have organized to express their alternative dreams for the river development. We argue that the Mekong needs to be envisioned from broad perspectives recognizing the symbolic and pragmatic dimensions of the river development from being more than a transportation route or source of commodity water to "seeing" the river as a landscape and ecosystem worthy of preservation and protection for future generations.

   optimisation; roadford reservoir; water supply
AB Due to the large and often competing demands for water and increasing importance of sustainability criteria, water resource managers have begun to examine closely ways in which the operation of existing and planned reservoirs could be optimised. Guidelines have been devised on the operation of multi-purpose, multiple reservoir water systems, but there remains no methodology generally accepted by water resource managers for deriving multiple-reservoir operating policies. This article proposes a new approach to the optimisation of the operation of multiple reservoir systems. The revised methodology develops the concept of an extended drought period to evaluate additional emergency storage reserve extending the reliability of the system. The operation of the Roadford Reservoir System, SouthWest England, consisting of nine reservoirs was studied. Through simulation analysis, the control rules for each reservoir were revised based on the concept of minimising demand deficit. This article highlights the superior results compared with the current operating control rules.

AB Small mammals can be useful indicators of sustainability in terrestrial ecosystems; hence, research and inventory of populations and communities have increased dramatically in recent years. Sampling methodologies to measure abundance and diversity attributes include removal- (snap and pitfall traps) and live-trapping, with the former predominating. We tested the hypothesis that removal-trapping of small mammals would alter patterns of abundance and species diversity compared with control (nonremoval) sites. Small-mammal communities were intensively sampled in coastal coniferous forest habitat in southern British Columbia, Canada. In a pulse-removal experiment, mean abundance of Oregon votes (Microtus oregoni) was significantly lower in removal than in control sites, whereas abundance of shrews (Sorex spp.) and species diversity were significantly higher in removal than in control sites. Abundances of 3 uncommon species, the long-tailed vole (M. longicaudus), southern red-backed vole (Clethrionomys gapperi), and American shrew-mole (Neurotrichus gibbsii), were significantly higher in removal than in control sites. Our results indicate that removal-trapping can disrupt small-mammal populations and yield spurious values for community characteristics. Ethical concerns notwithstanding, ecological studies of small mammals should use live-trapping to yield accurate estimates of population and diversity attributes.

AB Silicoaluminophosphate molecular sieves SAPO-5 and SAPO-11 were synthesised hydrothermally and their purity and structure were checked by X-ray diffraction (XRD). The calcined SAPOs were impregnated with 0.2 wt.% Pt and varying amount (0, 0.2,0.4 and 0.6 wt.%) of Ni and reduced in hydrogen atmosphere. The TEM analysis shows that the average particle size of the metal particles increases with increase of Ni loading. Acidity by TPD of ammonia and pyridine adsorbed FT-IR spectra studies show that the increasing addition of Ni decreases the total acidity of the catalysts. The Ni-Pt/SAPO-5 and Ni-Pt/SAPO-11 catalysts were subjected to n-hexane hydroisomerisation in hydrogen atmosphere and found that Ni addition up to 0.4 wt.% over 0.2 wt.% Pt loaded SAPO-5 and SAPO-11 increases the n-hexane conversion, isomerisation selectivity, dibranched isomers selectivity and sustainability of the catalyst. Further, Ni addition leads to a fall in activity of the catalysts. The activity of 0.2 wt.% Pt and 0.4 wt.% Ni/SAPOs in n-hexane hydroisomerisation was compared with 0.2 wt.% Pt and 0.4 wt.% Pd/SAPOs and found that Pt-Pd/SAPOs show higher activity and isomerisation selectivity than Pt-Ni/SAPOs. Further, SAPO-5 based catalysts always show higher activity with lesser isomerisation selectivity than SAPO-11 based catalysts. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A classic example of a sustainable fishery is that targeting sockeye salmon in Bristol Bay, Alaska, where record catches have occurred during the last 20 years. The stock complex is an amalgamation of several hundred discrete spawning populations. Structured within lake systems, individual populations display diverse life history characteristics and local adaptations to the variation in spawning and rearing habitats. This biocomplexity has enabled the aggregate of populations to sustain its productivity despite major changes in climatic conditions affecting the freshwater and marine environments during the last century. Different geographic and life history components that were minor producers during one climatic regime have dominated during others, emphasizing that the biocomplexity of fish stocks is critical for maintaining their resilience to environmental change.

AB Leaching of alkali metals and chloride from biomass reduces fouling and slagging in furnaces and boilers, especially for grasses and other herbaceous crops used as fuel. Leaching also produces large volumes of leachate for disposal or treatment. Leachates obtained by water-washing rice straw were treated by reverse osmosis (RO) for water recovery and to evaluate ion and chemical oxygen demand (COD) rejection by the membrane as a function of feed concentration. Recovery above 90% was achieved with rejection of COD and ions other than carbonate also above 90%. Similar results would be expected to apply to other biomass leachates. Flux approaching a recommended 40 1 M h was maintained at 90% recovery at a pressure half the maximum recommended pressure of the membrane tested. Flux declined above 90% recovery due to increasing osmotic pressure and probable fouling as salt concentrations likely exceeded solubility limits at the membrane surface. Cost of RO processing for a leaching facility handling 50,000 Mg year(-1) of biomass and generating 1.9 Ml day(-1) of leachate is estimated at $671 Ml(-1) of leachate exclusive of brine disposal. The cost increases to $719 Ml(-1) leachate for a facility of approximately half this capacity. RO costs add $7-8 Mg-1 to the cost of fuel processed. RO treatment reduces the volume of fresh water required for leaching and the volume of brine disposed. Where sufficient municipal wastewater treatment capacity exists the addition of RO to a leaching system may not be economically justified if costs assessed on the basis of strength are higher than costs assessed for flow. For treatment by evaporation ponds, RO offers a clear advantage over direct leachate disposal, reducing costs by 50% to 70%. Land application of both leachate and concentrate can take advantage of nutrients extracted from the biomass and could be used in the production of additional biomass. Application over an area one-tenth or more the original source area may be required to manage salts and to ensure that sustainable application rates are not exceeded. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB The development of a system capable of ensuring adequate protection of the environment from the harmful effects of ionising radiation is at present particularly debated. This need comes both from a restrictive consideration of the environment in the so far existing system for human radioprotection, and the planetary-wide growing concerns about man's technogenic influence on his environment which have yielded 'sustainability' and 'precaution' as guiding principles for environmental protection. Whilst evolving from the field of human radioprotection, the radioprotection of the environment needs to be discussed in a wider perspective, with particular emphasis on the most advanced concepts which emerge from the efforts to deriving improved approaches to Ecological Risk Assessment. For the sake of protection, the environment is traditionally addressed through its biota since these are the sensitive components of ecosystems. Similarities between man and biotas reflect the ubiquitous mechanistic effects of radiation on life which disrupt molecules. However, important differences also arise in a number of perspectives, from the large spectrum of different species of biotas to their hierarchical self-organisation as interacting populations within ecosystems. Altogether, these aspects are prone to promote complex arrays of different responses to stress which lie beyond the scope of human radioprotection due to its focus on individuals of a single species. By means of selected illustrations, this paper reviews and discusses the current challenges faced in proper identification of measurable effect endpoints (stochastic/deterministic, individual/population- or ecosystem-relevant), dose limits in chronic exposure (or levels of concern), and their consideration according to radiation type (RBE) and interactions with other contaminants (synergies/antagonisms) which represent critical gaps in knowledge. The system of human radioprotection has conceptually been targeted at limiting cancer induction (stochastic) in human individuals, whereas the current approach in radioprotection of biota targets reproductive success (deterministic) and cytogenetic effects, thought to have the highest significance at population and ecosystem levels. The focus on individuals in a bottom-up approach, due to the ease with which it may be quantified, has prompted the development of current ecotoxicological methods as a scientific foundation for environmental protection regulation. However, the most recent ecological theories, which emphasise on complex systems as a key to modem ecological understanding, call for the additional consideration of more holistic, top-down, approaches. Critically, dose-effect relationships of the subsystem components may lose their predictive ability at the system level. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Numerous Knoevenagel condensations of solid or liquid aromatic aldehydes are performed with four barbituric acids, Meldrum's acid, dimedone, cyanoacetamide, malodinitrile and methyl cyanoacetate in stoichiometric mixtures of the solids or of stoichiometric melts. The product yields are quantitative in 23 reported cases and the products do not require purifying workup. Therefore, these reactions are truly solvent-free, atom economic and sustainable and no wastes are produced. They are highly superior to less productive so-called 'solvent-free' techniques using solid supports and microwave irradiation that require solvents for removal of the support or reagents or side products. Similarly, the solution reactions generally requiring catalysts suffer from low yields and purifying workup. The new techniques provide numerous common electron-poor alkenes very easily. These are valuable building blocks for example in Michael additions. Also the latter can be quantitatively obtained in stoichiometric melts in the absence of any auxiliaries or microwave irradiation and this is demonstrated with stable and rearranging/cyclizing Michael adducts using dimedone. The quantitative yields are most easily obtained if the products are formed in the solid-state or if they crystallize directly from the melt at the reaction temperature.

TI Why and how should we assess occupational health impacts in integrated
   product policy?
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID UNEMPLOYMENT; COSTS
AB Integrated product policy (IPP) and life cycle assessment (LCA), one of the analytic tools used in IPP, focus traditionally on environmental impacts. However, in an attempt to consider other sustainability criteria and to avoid a shift from environmental health impacts to occupational health impacts one may want to include occupational health in IPP. Should and can occupational health impacts be included in LCA and IPP? Using published and unpublished occupational health data for injuries and illnesses and an economic input-output model of the United States, we provide attributional occupational health impacts measured in disability adjusted life years per dollars output for 491 industry sectors including supply chain impacts. Estimates for the "true" number of United States occupational health impacts suggest that this initial analysis underestimates the total impact 3-7-fold. A comparison suggests that United States occupational health impacts are about 10 times smaller than environmental health impacts and are, relatively speaking, important only for sectors with hazardous working environments but low environmental impacts. A consequential rather than attributional view suggests that a method to assess true consequences on long-term health impacts by product policies needs to be able to predict effects from present-day work place exposure and to account for likely changes in the labor market, including changes in unemployment rates and other substitution mechanisms.

AB Linkages between household energy technology, indoor air pollution, and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions have become increasingly important in understanding the local and global environmental and health effects of domestic energy use. We report on GHG emissions from common Kenyan wood and charcoal cookstoves. Our estimations are based on 29 d of measurements under the conditions of actual use in 19 rural Kenyan households. Carbon monoxide (CO), particulate matter (PM10), combustion phase, and fuel mass were measured continuously or in short intervals in day-long monitoring sessions. Emissions of pollutants other than CO and PM10 were estimated using emissions ratios from published literature. We estimated that the daily carbon emissions from charcoal stoves (5202 +/- 2257 g of C: mean SO) were lower than both traditional open fire (5990 +/- 1843 g of C) and improved ceramic woodstoves (5905 +/- 1553 g of C), but the differences were not statistically significant. However, when each pollutant was weighted using a 20-yr global warming potential, charcoal stoves emitted larger amounts of GHGs than either type of woodstove (9850 +/- 4600 g of C for charcoal as compared to 8310 +/- 2400 and 9649 +/- 2207 for open fire and ceramic woodstoves, respectively; differences not statistically significant). Non-CO2 emissions from charcoal stoves were 5549 +/- 2700 g of C in 20-yr CO2 equivalent units, while emissions were 2860 +/- 680 and 4711 +/- 919 for three-stone fires and improved ceramic stoves, respectively, with statistically significant results between charcoal and wood stoves. Therefore in a sustainable fuel-cycle (i.e., excluding CO2), charcoal stoves have larger emissions than woodstoves. When the emissions from charcoal production, measured in a previous study, were included in the assessment, the disparity between the GHG emissions from charcoal and firewood increased significantly, with non-CO2 GHG emissions factors (g of C/kg of fuel burned) for charcoal production and consumption 6-13 times higher than emissions from woodstoves. Policy implications and options for environment and public health are discussed.

ID PERFORMANCE; AREAS
AB Current research on sustainability of cities has favoured the implementation and conservation of greenery in the urban context. The benefits of plants are not just environmental but recreational, aesthetic and emotional. The full benefits of plants and the role they play in the ecology of cities remain to be mapped out but the general significance of plants appears to be uncontested. This paper proposes a new architectural and planning metric for greenery in cities and buildings. This new metric, the green plot ratio (GPR), is based on a common biological parameter called the leaf area index (LAI), which is defined as the single-side leaf area per unit ground area. The green plot ratio is simply the average LAI of the greenery on site and is presented as a ratio that is similar to the building plot ratio (BPR) currently in use in many cities to control maximum allowable built-up floor area in a building development. GPR allows more precise regulation of greenery on site without excluding a corresponding portion of the site from building development. It provides flexibility to the designer while simultaneously protecting the green quota in the design. This concept has been applied in a number of design competitions in which the author has collaborated with colleagues and various architectural practices. It has also been adopted as a planning requirement by the client authority for one of the competitions for which the author has entered. While seen as a fundamental and important metric, GPR is not in itself an indicator for all the ecological relationships between plants and cities. A larger set of related metrics need to be developed. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

ID IMPACT
AB As on land, plants are the real producers in the sea, and on them depend all marine living resources and the basic sustainability of ecosystems. Primary production is performed by chlorophyll-bearing plants ranging from the tiny phytoplankton to the giant kelps through the process of photosynthesis. Zooplankton play an important role as secondary producers, and together with phytoplankton they support the vast assemblages of marine food chain with all their diversity and complexity. Data on chlorophyll pigments, phytoplankton and zooplankton are regarded as a sound basis for environmental appraisal of ecosystems. This paper presents a set of data collected from the Saudi Arabian coastal waters near the desalination plants in AI-Jubail. Materials were collected from six different sites covering the intake and discharge zones during cruises carried out in 1997-1998. Analyses of chlorophyll pigments were made using the spectrophotometric method. Plankton samples were collected using a Nansen plank ton net with a mesh size of 75 mu and analyzed following standard procedures. Chlorophyll a, b, c and phaeophytin are the most commonly occurring pigments in seawater. Their concentrations showed wide fluctuation. The phytoplankton community was composed of 35 genera representing the Diatoms, Dinoflagellates and blue-green algae. Zooplankton were composed of Protozoa, Coelenterata, Ctenophora, Aschelminthes, Annelida, Mollusca, Arthropoda, Echinodermata. and Chordata. Arthropoda, represented by Cladocera, Copepoda and Crustacean larvae, formed the largest group followed by Chordata. The distribution of phyto- and zooplankton was examined and discussed on a seasonal, annual and intor-annual basis. In terms of species, overall species composition was not affected by plant discharge. The study brings out a greater understanding of the changes experienced by biotic communities as a result of impingement, entrainment and entrapment consequent to water passage through the plant structures. The study reflects the ecological relationships that the phytoplankton and the zooplankton of the region possess With respect to intake and discharge. Further, the study has brought to light a very redeeming feature of the ecosystem to sustain its productivity and planktonic abundance. It was observed that seawater temperature, conductivity and total suspended solids did not act as limiting factors. Besides throwing much light on the little known biological aspects of clesalination sites, the data provided constitute a significant addition to the knowledge base of marine living resources in an industrial zone of Gulf coastal waters.

AB Molecular crystals including salts undergo gas-solid, solid-solid, thermal, photochemical and catalyzed reactions if the crystal lattice allows for long-range anisotropic molecular migrations, if the product phase can form fast enough and if crystal disintegration provides fresh surface. This ingenious three-step solid-state mechanism is derived from atomic force microscopy (AFM) studies, the results of which correlate strictly with the crystal packing. It is secured by the results of various supporting experiments. The experimental mechanism is at variance with Schmidt's "topochemistry'' hypothesis with its well-known failures which are now easily settled. Topotactic reactions without molecular migrations are very rare and not at all typical for solid-state reactions. AFM scrutiny excluded several alleged cases of topotaxy and secured three of them with molecular precision. Very detailed solid-state effects that go down to the molecular level emerge from AFM investigations with single crystals on their different faces and are discussed. The efficiency of gas-solid and solid-solid reactions is unexpectedly high. Thus, the yield in one product is 100% due to favorable kinetics in most cases. These waste-free syntheses are fast, require rather simple equipment, save resources and are unbeatable in their wealth for sustainable environmental protection, inasmuch as they do not require workup procedures. The scaling up for industrial application is prepared at the kg level. Numerous selected examples of preparative interest out of more than 1000 are presented.

AB Just as the creation of shareholder value requires performance on multiple dimensions, the global challenges associated with sustainable development are also multifaceted, involving economic. social, and environmental concerns. Indeed, these challenges have implications for virtually every aspect of a firm's strategy and business model. Yet, most managers frame sustainable development not as a multidimensional opportunity, but rather as a one-dimensional nuisance, involving regulations, added cost, and liability. This approach leaves firms ill-equipped to deal with the issue in a strategic manner. Accordingly, we develop a sustainable-value framework that links the challenges of global sustainability to the creation of shareholder value by the firm. Specifically, we show how the global challenges associated with sustainable development, viewed through the appropriate set of business lenses, can help to identify strategies and practices that contribute to a more sustainable world while simultaneously driving shareholder value; this we define as the creation of sustainable value by the firm.

AB Large-scale chemotherapy programmes for helminth control continue to rely heavily on donor support. This is despite more than a 10-fold reduction in delivery costs from integrating drug distribution through the school system rather than using mobile teams and a marked decline in the price of albendazole and praziquantel. Even at these low prices (< US$ 0.25 per child treated with albendazole), it seems that school-based programmes may not be affordable to governments or communities. It is estimated, for instance, that mass albendazole treatment of school-aged children in Kenya could cost over US$ 3 million each year, which is 4% of current national expenditure on all health care. It has been suggested that a cost retrieval system could help ensure sustainability of these programmes. Some studies have shown that parents may be willing-to-pay for the treatment of their children but the actual amount that could be recovered and the ability of households to pay these amounts is uncertain. Furthermore, the costs incurred in implementing school-based delivery are likely to be much higher than the frequently quoted US$ 0.03 per child by the Partnership for Child Development (PCD) programmes, as this estimate does not include the 'external costs' for the scientific co-ordinating centre which was responsible for supporting these approaches. Whether these school health programmes could run independently of this system at such a low cost remains to be seen. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Different types of environmental indicators have been developed to meet the increasing need of assessment instruments of environmental impacts. As any tool developed by research, indicators must be elaborated according to a scientific approach. One of the important steps of this elaboration is the validation. The overall objective of this paper is to present a methodological framework to validate indicators. According to the definition of an indicator, three kinds of validation are presented: the "design validation" to evaluate if the indicators are scientifically founded; the "output validation" to assess the soundness of the indicator outputs, and, the "end use validation" to be sure the indicator is useful and used as a decision aid tool. The output validation is inspired from validation of simulation models, which is shortly reviewed. Because indicators differ from models in many cases, validation procedures commonly used in modelling have to be adapted. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB We constructed a simple simulation model (SESS) of the dynamics of forage growth and standing crop and cattle production to evaluate the ecological sustainability of management alternatives for extensive cow-calf production systems in northeastern Mexico and south Texas. Equations were written to estimate annual net primary production based on range condition, annual precipitation, and soil characteristics typical of the region. Simulations were conducted for annual precipitation levels of 300, 500, and 700 mm to estimate total and green standing crop dynamics, cattle grazing efficiency, and range condition trend for different stocking rates. The model-estimated stocking rates to achieve stable or slight improvement of range condition for the three precipitation levels were close to 58, 15, and 6 ha per animal-unit-year (AUY), respectively. With the model parameterized for precipitation and soil characteristics combined with the stocking rates recommended by COTECOCA (1979. Coahuila. Tipos de vegetacion, sitos de productividad forrajera y coeficientes de agostadero. Secretaria de Recursos Hidraulicos. Comision Tecnico Consultiva para la Determinacion Regional de los Coeficientes de Agostadero. Mexico), we conducted 20-year simulations for three groups of range sites of Coahuila, Mexico (annual precipitation: 1: 270 mm, 2: 351 mm and 3: 467 mm). The trends of body condition score and range condition for years 5, 10, 15, and 20 were similar within each of the three groups. The stocking rates recommended by COTECOCA were too high for sustainability on range site groups with 270 and 351 mm annual precipitation. The simulated probabilities for pregnancy rates at different stocking rates for the three groups indicated that the stocking rates recommended by COTECOCA were too high to achieve pregnancy rates greater than or equal to 80% in 8 out of 10 years with no supplement in the form of hay or concentrated feeds. Model simulations suggested that, in the absence of supplemental feed, ecological sustainability and acceptable livestock production could be achieved simultaneously at light stocking rates.

AB Contour hedgerow intercropping system (alley cropping) has been promoted as a promising option for sustainable land management in many parts of the world. It was introduced to China in 1991 as a management option of sloping croplands. Despite its effectiveness in soil conservation and soil fertility improvement, farmers' adoption had been unsatisfactory before 1998, mainly due to its lack of visible and direct income. Mulberry (Morus alba) is planted within two rows of hedgerows of nitrogen-fixing plants in order to increase economic benefits to Chinese farmers, and to fully use land resources and the rich soil nutrients under hedgerows. Compared to the mulberry conventionally planted on land risers, mulberry planted within hedgerows produces higher fresh and dry matter leaf biomass. The economic traits of the mulberry planted in hedgerows are superior to those of the mulberry planted on land riser. The innovation of incorporating mulberry trees in hedgerows helps solve the problems of land lost to hedgerows and lack of direct income, and initiates a new direction of use and management of the contour hedgerow intercropping system to achieve more benefits. Incorporation of mulberry trees in hedgerows has become the key factor for farmers' adoption of the technology in the project region. Study of other cash crops that can be incorporated in hedgerows is needed. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Insect pests, plant growth and plant yield in a crop of winter oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.) were studied to assess the potential value of spatial information in integrated pest management for this crop. Ceutorhynchus assimilis Payk., Ceutorhynchus pallidactylus (Marsh.), Meligethes aeneus (Fab.) and Dasineura brassicae Winn. were sampled from the nodes of a rectangular grid across the crop. Their spatial distributions were mapped, analysed and compared using Spatial Analysis by Distance IndicEs (SADIE). The relationships between the distributions of insects, plant growth and yield were assessed using regression techniques. The distributions of C assimilis, C pallidactylus and M. aeneus were complex with differing irregular patterns of aggregation, whereas D. brassicae was edge-distributed. Stem injury, chiefly caused by larval Psylliodes chrysocephala L., was associated with significant yield loss and the spatial distribution of stem injury was reflected in the distribution of oil yield. The distribution of larval M. aeneus was dissociated from that of pods which shed their seed before harvest. Spatial heterogeneity in plant maturation as a result of infestation could delay the choice of harvest date beyond the optimum to prevent seed loss from less injured plants. Some of the variability (21-31%) in insect numbers within the crop was explained by variation in plant density and in growth stage at mid-flowering. The spatial ecology of these pests is discussed in terms of the roles of environmental factors, behavioural responses and the implications of spatial patterns for yield loss and for developing sustainable integrated crop protection. The data indicate that decision support systems should use sampling strategies which incorporate spatial information to model crop loss more accurately and that there may be potential for spatially targeted applications of insecticide to optimise the influence of biocontrol agents in oilseed rape.

SO AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT

ID AGRICULTURE; EFFICIENCY; PATTERNS; ENERGY
AB Land use change in China is related closely to global environmental change and global food security. In this paper, we analyzed land use change for rice, wheat and maize production in China during 1961-1998 based on long-term historical data. The results indicated that the total land area planted for cereals had both increased and decreased between 1961 and 1998. The total area in cereals increased or remained unchanged during 1961-1978, a period when the "Cultural Revolution" occurred, and also increased during 1986-1990 when the Chinese government increased subsides to agriculture. However, the total area in cereals declined during 1980-1985, a period corresponding to the implementation of the "household responsibility system" policy, and during 1991-1995, when a large proportion of the rural labor force moved to urban areas. The center of cereal production has moved towards northern China although the major area planted for rice, wheat and maize together is still located in southern China. The yield per hectare for all crops has increased from 1.21 t/ha in 1961 to 4.83 t/ha in 1998, but the yield per unit chemical fertilizer use decreased from 164 (rice), 44 (wheat) and 93 (maize) kg/kg in 1961 to 10 (rice), 6 (wheat) and 9 (maize) kg/kg in 1998. The increases in yield per hectare and production per capita appear mostly due to the increased industrial energy inputs, especially the rapid increase in chemical fertilizer use after the "household responsibility system" in late 1970s. The decline of the yield per unit chemical fertilizer use appears as a result of fertilizer saturation, soil degradation, soil and water pollution, the shortage of irrigation in the north, the threat of flooding in the south, and poor and low quality land use, as well as other social, economic and technical issues. With limited reclaimed land resources remaining and a near saturation in the response of crops to fertilizers, increasing food demand from the increasing population will have to come mainly from increased land productivity that will almost certainly continue to lead to the decline of energy (e.g. fertilizer) use efficiency and continued environmental degradation. Alternatively China may begin to import large amounts of food. This situation will generate adverse effects on sustainable development in China, as well as food security in the world, especially if world energy is in short supply. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB The development of herbicide resistance is a major problem associated with continuous cropping systems in southern Australia. The use of a chemical fallow, followed by a summer-grown crop (e.g. grain sorghum), provides an option for controlling winter-grown weeds and reducing use of selective herbicides. This paper reports an experimental approach taken by a farming enterprise in assessing the suitability of grain sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) in a continuous cropping rotation in the Wimmera region of Victoria. Results are given from five seasons (1995-1999) where sorghum was grown in large unreplicated trials with a final average yield of 2.4 Mg ha(-1). Also a replicated experiment was conducted in one of the seasons (1996-1997), where the sorghum grew almost entirely on stored soil water, extracting about 150-170 mm from 115 cm depth: here the grain yield of the sorghum was 1.6 Mg ha(-1). The soil water storage in this cracking clay soil (HyperCalci-Chromic Vertisol (Grumic)) was about 250 mm (0-140 cm depth) at the end of the winter prior to sowing. The yields of winter crops grown immediately after sorghum harvest were also recorded, suggesting that the water use by the preceding sorghum crop did not have an adverse effect on the growth of these winter crops. Thus, the use of summer crops such as sorghum in the Wimmera region may provide another approach for integrated weed management in a continuously cropped system. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Background: For many persons who wish to obtain the health benefits provided by dietary n-3 fatty acids, daily ingestion of fish or fish oil is not a sustainable long-term approach. To increase the number of sustainable dietary options, a land-based source of n-3 fatty acids that is effective in increasing tissue concentrations of the long-chain n-3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) is required.
   Objective: The objective of the study was to examine the ability of dietary stearidonic acid (SDA) to increase tissue concentrations of EPA and DHA in healthy human subjects and to compare the effectiveness of SDA with that of the n-3 fatty acids alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) and EPA.
   Design: Encapsulated SDA, ALA, or EPA was ingested daily in doses of 0.75 g and then 1.5 g for periods of 3 wk each by healthy male and postmenopausal female subjects (n = 15/group) in a double-blind, parallel-group design.
   Results: Dietary SDA increased EPA and docosapentaenoic acid concentrations but not DHA concentrations in erythrocyte and in plasma phospholipids. The relative effectiveness of the tested dietary fatty acids in increasing tissue EPA was 1:0.3:0.07 for EPA:SDA:ALA.
   Conclusions: Vegetable oils containing SDA could be a dietary source of n-3 fatty acids that would be more effective in increasing tissue EPA concentrations than are current ALA-containing vegetable oils. The use of SDA-containing oils in food manufacture could provide a wide range of dietary alternatives for increasing tissue EPA concentrations.

AB Objective. This study describes key activities integral to the development of 3 community-based participatory research (CBPR) partnerships.
   Methods. We compared findings from individual case studies conducted at 3 urban research centers (URCs) to identify crosscutting adaptations of a CBPR approach in the first 4 years of the partnerships' development.
   Results. Activities critical in partnership development include sharing decision-making, defining principles of collaboration, establishing research priorities, and securing funding. Intermediate outcomes were sustained CBPR partnerships, trust within the partnerships, public health research programs, and increased capacity to conduct CBPR. Challenges included the time needed for meaningful collaboration, concerns regarding sustainable funding, and issues related to institutional racism.
   Conclusions. The URC experiences suggest that CBPR can be successfully implemented in diverse settings.

AB Biofiltration allows for environmentally sustainable mariculture. An intensive, biofiltered recirculating integrated system producing fish and seaweed on a semi-commercial scale was evaluated with respect to production and to nutrient and heat budgets. The system consisted of abalone (Haliotis discus hannai) and sea urchin (Paracentrotus lividus) tanks, an intensive fishpond (Sparus aurata), and a three-stage Ulva lactuca biofilter, which cleaned and recirculated 50% of the effluent back to the fishpond. To preserve water heat, the shellfish and fishpond units were both covered with greenhouses; the biofilter unit was covered with a greenhouse only during winter. Seaweed yield was variable and averaged 94 and 117 g m(-2) day(-1) (fresh weight) in periods with and without greenhouse cover, respectively. Protein content of U. lactuca averaged above 34% of dry weight. The biofiltration of only 50% of the water through the seaweed biofilter reduced the export of dissolved nutrients to the environment by nearly 30%. Peak ammonia excretion by the moming-fed fish coincided with maximum seaweed light-dependent ammonia uptake and concentrations of ammonia in the fishpond remained within nontoxic limits. Also, daytime photosynthesis of U. lactuca (uptake of CO2) met fish respiration (production of CO2), thus balancing fishpond pH levels within safe limits regarding ammonia toxicity. Daytime oxygen demand by the fish was partially met by the photosynthetically generated oxygen. Before covering the biofilter with a greenhouse, it lost much heat, reducing the temperature in the fishpond. Following the greenhouse covering of the biofilter, heat loss ceased and consequently the fishpond temperature was raised. Recirculation through the biofilter improved system sustainability; it reduced water use, lowered negative environmental impact, and maintained stable and safe water quality conditions in the fishpond.

SO ATW-INTERNATIONALE ZEITSCHRIFT FUR KERNENERGIE
LA English
DT Article
AB Since 1930, the World Energy Council (WEC) has been closely involved in problems associated with the use of nuclear power. At the meeting then held by the WEC Executive Committee in Berlin, Albert Einstein drew the attention of power utilities to this new source of energy. In addition to optimized use, technical progress, and waste management, the WEC regards aspects of safety, proliferation, and sustainability of nuclear power as matters of special importance. In the energy scenarios elaborated by the WEC since the 1980s' nuclear power plays one of the leading roles in the future energy mix. The sustainable management of energy resources, worldwide climate protection, but also equal access to energy for all people, require the use of nuclear power and the furtherance of its options. Moreover, the use of nuclear power in the industrialized countries helps to stabilize energy prices worldwide. This is in the interest especially of developing countries, for which low-cost, accessible energy sources are vital factors.
   The electricity supply crisis in California in 2001 has shown the continuity of supply to be one of the factors important in the deregulation of energy markets. Bottlenecks in electricity supply because of a lack of acceptance of electricity generation are problems affecting the future of industrialized countries. For instance, the increasing digitization of everyday life demands reliable power supply.
   In its studies of all available energy sources the WEC found no alternative to nuclear power.
   Factors of importance in the future development and use of nuclear power are public acceptance and the ability, and willingness, to take decisions in economic issues. Waste management, proliferation, safety, and research and development are other priorities.
   As a source of power protecting the climate, stabilizing costs, and offering a considerable potential, nuclear power is compatible with the objectives of sustainable development for the world of tomorrow.

ID FOREST POLICY
AB The Changbai Mountain Biosphere Reserve (CMBR) is the largest and one of the earliest natural reserves established in China. The continuous losses of species and ecosystems in the reserve since its establishment have raised numerous concerns within China and beyond, which also leads some people to question the function and efficiency of natural reserves in protecting biological and ecological resources. By collecting the published data, conducting field investigation, and interviewing local people, we present the current status of biological and ecological diversity/resources in the reserve and analyze the major factors causing biodiversity loss in the reserve in an ecological and socio-economic context. We found that the high human population pressure, mismanagement practices of resources, a poor resource evaluation system which underestimates the ecological value of the natural reserve, an inappropriate economic development policy, and rapid expansion of the tourist industry were the major causes leading to the biodiversity loss in the reserve in the past few decades. In order to manage the biological resources and biodiversity in the CMBR in a sustainable way, we recommend some strategies and measures which include balancing economic development and biological/ecological conservation, controlling human population in the reserve, encouraging collaboration within and outside the reserve, especially the areas around the reserve, enhancing governmental assistance and subsidy to the local residents, and promoting scientific research and biodiversity education in the local communities.

   DYNAMICS; MACROFUNGI; DENMARK; NORWAY
AB An analysis of factors influencing the diversity of macrofungi fruiting on decaying beech logs at site level is presented. Variables related to log size and shape and decay stage were found to explain up to 56% of the variation in total species richness and 42% of the variation in the richness of threatened (red-listed) species. Inclusion of variables relating to the vernal flora and the degree of soil contact further increased the explained variation in total species richness to 71%, but these variables were non-significant with respect to red-listed species. However, inclusion of the variable log type, distinguishing uprooted logs, logs broken at root neck and logs broken 1-7 and 8-15 m above ground, increased the amount of explained variation in richness of red-listed species to 50%. Among the log size and shape variables, the number of bole forks was superior in describing the variation in both total and red-listed species richness. Accordingly, forked trees should preferably be selected for decay in order to improve biodiversity, since they support comparably higher species diversity than unforked logs and have limited economical value. The importance of log type for the richness of threatened species appears to be connected with the occurrence of certain non-dominant primary decayers, causing heart rot, subsequently allowing the establishment of red-listed species. Accordingly, it is suggested that a high diversity of primary decayers may be a key to the conservation of wood decaying fungi. Microclimatic variables were found to have a limited effect on fruit body diversity on the studied logs; however, the microclimatic regime is discussed as an important factor in relation to management of dead wood for fungal biodiversity.

AB Steppe habitats in central Asia have suffered important land use changes during this century which are similar to those that have been pointed out as the causes of the decline of steppe birds in western Europe. During June 1999 we conducted road surveys of raptors in Eastern Kazakhstan to detect specific and community responses to land use changes. We detected I I species of raptors. Kestrels (Falco naumanni and tinnunculus) were the most common species in grasslands and agricultural landscapes, harriers (Circus pygargus and macrourus) were dominant in saline steppes and steppe eagles (Aquila nipalensis) were dominant in dry steppes. There were fewer species in agricultural habitats than in grassland and steppe habitats. Ground-nesting raptors were negatively affected by land use changes and four species were never detected in agricultural zones. Raptor abundance patterns differed between natural steppe habitats and human-transformed habitats, where a patchy distribution was detected. The future of raptor communities in Kazakhstan seems uncertain although the progressive abandonment of intensive agriculture may benefit species sensitive to human presence. The long-term conservation of vertebrate communities may depend upon the maintenance of ecologically and socially sustainable grazing systems. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Reliable techniques for predicting N mineralisation dynamics in soil are required for sustainable management of land resources. The concept of potentially mineralisable N (N-0) and its determination procedures were re-appraised in this study. Leaching soil before incubation removed considerable amounts of soluble organic N. But the leached soils had higher rates of net N mineralisation than the unleached controls during a subsequent 2-week incubation, suggesting that using the total amount of leached- (organic + inorganic) N for calculating N-0 may not be warranted. N-0 and the mineralisation rate constant k estimated with the conventional model-fitting technique varied significantly with soil, incubation time, temperature and moisture, without consistent trends. To obtain an N-0 value that is unequivocally indicative of soil N mineralisation capacity, the incubation should be conducted under standardised temperature (35degreesC) and moisture (55-65% water holding capacity or -30 to -10 kPa) conditions, and a standard mineralisation rate constant ((k) over bar =0.054 week(-1)) should be used for all soils. Assuming that No for a soil does not change with environmental conditions, its value was then fixed as a constant when fitting the first-order kinetic model to estimate k under non-standard conditions. This technique eliminated the confounding relationship between N-0 and k, which is inherent in the conventional curve-fitting procedure, and thus basically precluded the effect of incubation time on No estimation. The resultant N-0 represents not only the quantity, but also the quality of substrates and their interaction with the soil matrix. The k values showed close and consistent relationships with temperature and moisture.

AB The amount of corn stover that can be sustainably collected is estimated to be 80-100 million dry tonnes/yr (t/yr), a majority of which would be available to ethanol plants in the near term as only a small portion is currently used for other applications. Potential long-term demand for corn stover by non-fermentative applications in the United States is estimated to be about 20 million dry t/yr, assuming that corn stover-based products replace 50% of both hardwood pulp and wood-based particleboard, and that 50% of all furfural production is from corncobs. Hence, 60-80 million dry t/yr of corn stover should be available to fermentative routes. To achieve an ethanol production potential of 11 billion L (3 billion gal) per year (a target level for a non-niche feedstock), about 40% of the harvestable corn stover is needed. This amount should be available as long as the diversion of corn stover to non-ethanol fermentative products remains limited. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The effects of planting three eucalypt species and irrigating with meatworks effluent on soil were assessed during the first 3-year rotation of a short rotation forest regime at Oringi, Dannevirke, New Zealand. The results showed tree planting alone reduced the soil infiltration rates, but had little influence on soil nutrient concentration other than reduction of nitrate levels. Species variation had limited influence on soil change. Effluent irrigation relieved the reduction of infiltration rates by tree planting, and increased nutrient concentrations, but reduced the soil pH. These changes should be considered when managing eucalypt short rotation forests sustainably in the longer term, either linked with effluent irrigation or not. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB Currently the socioeconomic environment has defined a new industrial framework in which environmental aspects have to be considered when developing new products and implementing production methods. In the last years the environmental legislation has developed to pollution prevention and reduction, making the adjustment of the companies to this new approach towards sustainable development necessary. This work briefly describes the current situation of the environmental legislation applicable to industry, as much in Europe as in Spain, especially with regard to the politics of Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control and its repercussion in the ceramic industry. In the same way some of the main tendencies in environmental management in the ceramic sector are described, such as the European Ecolabel and the valuation of ceramic wastes in the ceramic sector. Finally, the results from the investigation on the environmental innovation applied to ceramic tiles manufacture are exposed. This innovation is based on the improvement of the efficiency with the recycling of ceramic wastes of diverse typology in ceramic compositions.

AB Climate change scenarios are discussed for Japan with clear implications drawn for the built environment in terms of increased temperatures of 4-5degreesC, rising sea levels and subterranean water tables. Research on the impacts and adaptation measures for global warming in Japan is reviewed. One of the most significant impacts of climate change in Japan will exacerbate the existing heat island phenomenon in cities by absorbing increased solar radiation. This will lead to further increases in temperatures in an urban microclimate with negative implications for energy and water consumption, human health and discomfort, and local ecosystems. The current urban heat island phenomenon and its impacts are described. The relationships between climate change and urban heat island impacts are discussed. Potential adaptation measures to those impacts are also discussed and proposed.

AB The differences between mitigation and adaptation strategies are explained in terms of their environmental, institutional and political significance and linkages. The potential climate changes for Canada's different regions are presented and discussed for their overall and specific built environment impacts. Current national strategies and polices related to adaptation are still in a formative stage, but they recognize that responding to climate change requires actions not only to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, but also to adapt to climate change. A national Framework for Adaptation is expected in 2003. Examples are provided of both the public and private sector efforts to consider adaptation to climate change at various scales. An overview of potential Canadian climate change trends and measures related to mitigation and adaptation is presented, with implications for establishing a research agenda for the built environment.

AB Examining the intersection of risk analysis and sustainable energy strategies reveals numerous examples of energy-efficient and renewable energy technologies that offer insurance loss-prevention benefits. The growing threat of climate change provides an added motivation for the risk community to understand better this area of opportunity. While analyses of climate change mitigation typically focus on the emissions-reduction characteristics of sustainable energy technologies, less often recognised are a host of synergistic ways in which these technologies also offer adaptation benefits, e.g. making buildings more resilient to natural disasters. While there is already some relevant activity, there remain various barriers to expanding these efforts significantly. Achieving successful integration of sustainable energy considerations with risk-management objectives requires a more proactive orientation, and coordination among diverse actors and industry groups.

AB The views, publications and research related to building design and climate change are reviewed in generic terms at the outset of this paper in order to identify a number of questions and potential research avenues. In particular, the links between the roles of building design and its implications for occupant behaviour are addressed in the context of the environmental performance of buildings and climate change. The emphasis is on the integration of adaptation with energy-efficient design, both in terms of how buildings can be designed to increase their adaptive potential and of the significance of occupant adaptive opportunities.

AB A simple two-stage game is examined, where firms compete in prices by chosen pricing instruments. Those considered include a simple, uniform pricing technology and a promotional pricing technology like an advertised discount coupon. Consumers are separated by types, informed and uninformed. Therefore, a motive for price competition exists for the purpose of separating the two types of consumers. It is shown that the sustainability of an asymmetric choice of pricing instrument between the two firms will prevail in a duopoly market in equilibrium. Consequently, the coexistence of two different pricing schemes is viable even when firms are otherwise symmetric.

ID CLASSIFICATION
AB As transportation surveillance technology, continues to advance, the measurement of more complete traffic information is becoming increasingly feasible. ICAN stands for Inductive Classifying Artificial Network and is used to conveniently describe a self-organizing feature map (SOFM) for vehicle type categorization using inductive signatures as input. Vehicle type categorization is the separation of vehicles into predefined classes and can be useful for improving transportation efficiency, cost, environmental sustainability, enforcement, safety; and education. ICAN mainly, focuses on the challenging task of differentiating between two-axle vehicles such as passenger car, sports utility vehicle (SUV), van, truck, and bus. This is in contrast to systems that classify according to the number of axles. One characteristic of ICAN is the simplicity, of the 13-neuron one-dimensional neural network, and the employment of a small training set of 13 signatures. The overall classification results of 87% (data set 1) and 82% (data set 2) for seven categories coupled with consistent performance across all vehicle categories was significant and encouraging. Field freeway data was used for testing ICAN representative signatures and video images of different vehicle types are presented.

AB A critical review of open literature and of institutional reports is given on the current discourse on 'sustainable development' (SD), and to its ascendant term 'sustainability' (SIB). Results of the Johannesburg World Summit on Sustainable Development, which reiterated its commitment to Agenda 2 1, did show the differences between the developed North, who favors environmental issues, and the less developed South, whose primary problems are development and equity in resource use. One of the major problems is also absence of a clear distinction between science and policy advice, which results in politicization of science. In the second part of the paper the environmental issues are discussed for the concept of 'sustainable tourism' and for 'ecotourism', a development activity considered of prime Importance for economic advancement of Croatia, in particular for its Adriatic coastal regions. Croatia's tourist industry has not established complex monitoring services, nor adopted a useful determination of the carrying capacity, not even for the major Adriatic islands, or some National parks. As a substitute there are some attempts to institutionalize environmental impact assessment, although maintenance of environmental quality seems of more importance for the tourist market. The extension into the future of the present form of management, promoted as 'sustainable', concentrating mainly on profit making, would result in environmental degradation and loss of market value of the Croatian tourist locations.

   and criterion
SO DRUSTVENA ISTRAZIVANJA
LA Croatian
DT Article
AB The subject of this article is the production of Croatia's future characterised by integral sustainability as a developmental concept and criterion. The concept and criterion of integral sustainability requires and presupposes conscious management, and not merely a spontaneous sequence of events, of social processes and relationship to the natural resources of life. Production is a conscious and planned process. There is sense in using the word "production" in association with the word "future". The word future denotes tomorrow, the tomorrow of a society, and here it denotes primarily the future of the living world, of air, water, earth, survival, the quality of living and people's health. The article is a contribution to reflecting upon the concept / criterion of integral sustainability in the context of Croatian society and the territory of the Republic of Croatia. In the article the author presents ecological "environmental", economic and sociocultural levels of integral comprehensive sustainability. Part of the text initially analyses the fundamental goals of the production of Croatia's future characterised by integral sustainability dealing with a) the preservation and development of natural resources of life with the aim of preserving health and the essential ecological, natural welfare of the population and the whole living world (flora and fauna), b) gradual "ecologisation" of the overall production of goods and services and the selection of such developmental choices which will more resolutely and sensibly make use of Croatian natural resources as capital for new forms of bio-economy, c) sociocultural aspects of sustainability of people's lives in Croatia in the part in which they are in relation with the ecological and economic aspects of sustainability. The final part of the article opens the subject of "production of active participants for the production of the future". Human resources, their knowledge and orientation as well as their ability and training for development on the level of integral sustainability is from a sociological point of view the fundamental precept for achieving such development.

AB The debate on sustainable development has reached the point when it has almost been forgotten how intertwined its environmental, social, technological and economic aspects are. The article therefore first analyses the disharmony of natural ecosystems and human activities, and then the most well known proposals for their synchronisation. Internal inconsistency of the sustainable development model has been shown and the debate following it for fifteen years described. Specially analysed is the development of the disciplines environmental and resource economics. The hypocrisy of some proponents of theoretical and practical solutions as well as the enterprising spirit and uncompromising quality of others has been detected. In continuation the author discusses insularisation as a way of protecting Nature and a model of promoting sustainable development. It is demonstrated that the establishment of insulas of sustainable development is implied by the European Union methodology used for the creation and implementation of developmental programmes both on local and regional levels. The most comprehensive Croatian example of these attempts is the implementation of the National Programme for Island Development and the Low on Islands.

DT Article
AB In the text the author investigates how and to what extent the concept of considerate/sustainable development is culturally founded. In the first part the author analyses the basic definition of considerate/sustainable development and indicates that many objections could be directed at it from the viewpoint of importance of the way in which cultural ideas participate in shaping society. The author demonstrates that the idea of considerate/sustainable development lacks several determinants necessary for such activity. For example, it is not clear as to how future generations are autonomously represented; how the social time of transition from present to future is formed; the idea implies prejudice towards the linear connection between the present and future; finally, it reinforces the currently existing society in the role of monopolistic supervisor and social creator of future generations. With such deficiencies the idea of considerate/sustainable development finds more accurate application in several practical fields of managing current political, economic or technical processes than in forming a new developmental paradigm. In the attempt to step over the identified limitations the author emphasises that the idea of environmental consideration needs to be returned to its natural context: the experience of (post)modernity. This transition enables the concept of considerate/sustainable development to lean directly onto the postmodern understanding of life. According to the author, there are four key features postmodernity uses in forming the understanding of life. These are: excess life, marginality, sanctity and heritage. Owing to that, life is socially constituted as a formative/fertile reality, selfpurpose, general heritage and nonmonopolistic resource. This is why it can be adopted also as a new universal cultural regulation making the achievement of the cultural/environmental consensus really possible.

TI The scientific deciphering of life: Autopoiesis and feedback loops
SO DRUSTVENA ISTRAZIVANJA
LA Croatian
DT Article
AB In the article some arguments for an affirmative answer to the question whether science can come close to understanding the nature of life are analysed. Commencing from the fact that life in late modernity (and not only there) occurs in the shadow of different threats, the author finds that in the centre of all this uneasiness stands the fear for life itself (in the individual but also in a derived, more general sense). Considering the philosophical (and theological) precepts on this "issue", the author also establishes a simple truth - that fear can truly be overcome only as the awakening of love for life. Activating biophilia could no doubt provide significant. support to the well-known concept of "sustainable development". However, the love of life could also become - although in a utopian perspective a "gravitational centre" of an "improved", axiologically and ethically sensitised (post) modernity. Since in modern conditions the arbitration of science cannot and should not be avoided with regard to any issue, the author wonders how much science can do in the sphere of advocating life. Analysing recent concepts of the American scientist Fritjof Capra, i.e. some of the most important precepts of his brave attempt towards a general synthesis of the new scientific understanding of life on all levels of living systems (from the 1990s), the author finds reason for renewing faith in science - even when life is concerned. Clearly, science can in this matter help only by understanding the nature of life better. Science is here established as a symbol of a new, environmental paradigm, which - in contrast to the centuries old Cartesian division of the world (image) into the spiritual and material - equally draws on the greatest achievements of twentieth-century western science as well as on the abundant non-western sources of knowledge.

DT Article
AB The topic of this paper is the relationship between sustainable development and business. In other words, it is of interest whether it is possible to reconcile economy and ecology (environmental protection), i.e. if society can develop without endangering natural resources as well as people's health. After introductory remarks and a short definition of the concept of sustainable development the paper comprises two main parts. The first consists of a historical review of the relationship between business and environmental protection. The second representing the stronghold of the paper analyses three types of relations between business and sustainable development today. The purpose of that part is to clarify differences in the behaviour of business towards sustainable development, that is, towards environmental protection and people's health. The types singled out are: the Paradigm of the Antigreen Situation (Business as Usual) - a type of business, as usually stated, lagging in time and space, more precisely still, characterised by open enmity towards environmental protection considered at a given point as a threat to economic growth and profit; the second type is somewhat more controversial, and it is called the Paradigm of Green Washing (Business as Un/Usual), within which there is a part of business characterised by the rhetoric of accepting sustainable development, while in practice it is usually reduced to partial projects which take up an insignificant percentage of the overall business results of certain corporations; and the third type, the Paradigm of Green Knowledge (Business as Unusual), represents the part of business which has turned towards sustainable development with a vision completely devoting itself to respecting environmental protection, human rights and people's health and one can only wish the latter would spread and propagate.

TI Planning for sustainable development: The significance of different

SO DRUSTVENA ISTRAZIVANJA
LA English
DT Article
AB The paper provides an insight into sustainable development as the basic principle to be followed in the planning activity the goal of which is to protect or enhance the things we, as society value. The subject of that endeavour is frequently directed towards landscape. The legacy of landscape evaluation present among the Croatian professional community is that landscape values are perceived as a visual and aesthetic category The conservation idea in planning focuses less on values attached to desired goals which are as a rule the result of opposing interests: developmental and conservational. This paper concentrates on the character of those values as appropriate for the sustainability concept implementation. It first indicates and then expounds the possible reasons for disagreement and contradictions concerning the meaning and interpretation of sustainable development. Subsequently, an approach is proposed towards evaluating landscape which enables both efficient protection and development. The-practice of achieving sustainable development in Croatia from the aspect of conservation planning is analysed in the third part, especially the mechanism of public participation in the decision-making process regarding landscape planning and landscape evaluation tools.

AB This paper describes a model, named "ENDLESS", useful to address the design process towards more eco-compatible solutions. In particular, this tool can support the designer in the choice of the product with an higher recyclability potential from a set of different alternatives. The model takes into consideration a Multi-Attribute Decision-Making method and allows calculating a "Global Recycling Index" (GRI) starting from a set of energy, environmental, technical and economic indicators. A weight is assigned to each parameter following the experience of the designer; a sensitivity analysis is then performed to state how the different assumptions can affect the final results. The model is implemented in a software and applied to a case study: to establish the best recyclability option of middle and low voltage electrical lines used for electricity distribution in Italy.

AB This paper examines the recent emergence of initiatives involving the reinsurance industry and the capital markets to develop mechanisms to finance the losses arising from catastrophic events. These initiatives are discussed from two perspectives. One perspective explores these financing mechanisms from the contention that catastrophic events are becoming increasingly non-insurable within contemporary risk society. In this regard the paper addresses issues relating to the coherence and sustainability of the risk networks underpinning efforts to maintain the insurability of catastrophic events. These catastrophe-financing initiatives arc also discussed from a second, although related perspective. This refers to the very emergence of these different financing mechanisms. In this regard the moving potential of liberal government or the inventive mechanics driving the development of different ways to manage catastrophic risk become significant. The paper argues that the emergence of these different catastrophe-financing mechanisms is occurring at the intersection of concerns over the non-insurability of the catastrophic and the extremes of capitalist ingenuity, suggesting both perspectives might offer insights into some of the possible future trajectories of risk society.

AB There is renewed interest worldwide in the production of sustainable energy from renewable sources, such as biomass, aimed mainly at the decrease of fossil fuels use. Except for its potential to be CO2 "neutral" during combustion, biomass has a low sulfur content and a high volatile concentration: these characteristics favor clean combustion conditions. The knowledge of the kinetics of biomass pyrolysis and combustion is important for the control of such thermochemical processes. The main objective of this work was to determine the kinetic parameters of thermal decomposition of two biomass materials, olive kernel and straw, and of their mixtures with a high- and a low-rank coal. The study was carried out using a thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA) in nitrogen atmosphere, at a heating rate of 10 degreesC/min. A kinetic model, involving first-order independent parallel reactions, was used. Activation energies and frequency factors were determined for two different particle sizes. The analysis indicated that the pyrolysis of the coals and the biomass samples could be modeled successfully via the independent reactions models, the pyrolysis of biomass being described by reactions corresponding to hemicellulose, cellulose, and lignin decomposition. The results showed that the chemical composition of each biomass type plays a fundamental role in the kinetics determination. Smaller conversion times and increased devolatilization rates were obtained, when biomass was added in the fuel blend with coal. The additive properties of coal and biomass, pyrolyzed in blends, were examined. It was proven that the mass loss vs time during thermal conversion of coal/biomass blends is well-described by the sum of each individual coal and biomass decomposition.

AB Bioresources comprised of over 220 billion oven-dry tonnes (about 4500 EJ) of annual production are potentially the world's largest sustainable source of energy. At present, technologies exist to pyrolyze biomass to produce a liquid product, namely, biomass-derived oil. This biomass-derived oil has found a variety of applications. In this investigation, biomass-derived oil (BDO) is gasified to synthesis gas and gaseous fuels. The gasification reaction of BDO was carried out at 800 degreesC under atmospheric pressure in an Inconell tubular fixed-bed down-flow microreactor using mixtures Of CO2 and N-2, and H-2 and N-2. Also, steam gasification was performed by feeding biomass-derived oil at a flow rate of 5 g/h along with steam (2.5-10 g/h) and nitrogen (30 mL/min) as a carrier gas. The gas product essentially consisted of H-2, CO, CO2, CH4, C-2, C-3, and C4+ components. Composition of various gas components ranged as syngas (H-2 + CO) from 75 to 80 mol % including 48-52 mol % H-2, and CH4 from 12 to 18 mol %. Heating values of the product gas ranged between 460 and 510 Btu/Scf. The present study shows that there is a strong potential of making syngas, hydrogen, and medium-heating-value Btu gas from the steam gasification of biomass-derived oil.

AB This article describes the state of the automobile industry and urban road transportation management in China. It reviews how the automobile industry is evolving to respond to challenges in economic development, environmental regulations, and technological change. The dynamics and barriers resulting from technological change of automobiles in response to reduction of exhaust emissions and energy-efficiency improvement are analyzed. It is argued that consideration of externality costs should be integrated in automobile industrial policymaking and transportation management. Efforts need to be made to use more economic incentives for emissions reduction, and to promote technological change for cleaner vehicle development. This paper questions the current government policy of encouraging private car ownership, and suggests that improvement in public transportation systems, stronger emissions control, and technology innovation on environmental friendly automobile technologies would be relevant to China's drive toward sustainable transportation development. Social inequities resulted from automobile use is also stressed in the analysis. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

DE Hexi Corridor; environmental change; protective strategy; northwest
   China
AB The regional hydrology and ecosystems of the Hexi Corridor region of northwestern China have changed over the last half century under the driving force of intense human activity and regional climate changes. Streamflow issuing from mountains in the eastern section of the Corridor by way of the Shiyang River has decreased significantly. Annual mountain outflow from the Heihe and Shule Rivers in the central and western portions of the Corridor, respectively, have tended to increase; however, their downstream discharge has decreased sharply. These lower reaches clearly display anthropogenic hydrological features. Water salinization and. pollution have worsened. Presently, up to 208 km of river courses exhibit the poorest water pollution grades of IV and V. Overall, the forested area in the south Qilian Mountain region has decreased by 16.5% in the last 50 years, but has recently begun to show a gradual increase. However, natural desert forests in the northern portion of the Hexi Corridor have continued in a trend of degradation and rapid disappearance, with 3431 km(2) lost in Minqin and Ejin counties alone. Grasslands have been progressively degraded and their area decreased such that grasslands in the Hexi Corridor region only cover 46.86% of their former area. Desertification has been exacerbated and the grasslands' stock capacity reduced. In the Hexi Corridor region desertification has proceeded swiftly over the last 50 years, reaching, in the early 1980s, a maximum annual rate of 2.15% of total initial grassland area. However, from the late 1980s through the 1990s their desertification rate has dropped significantly. A unified watershed-scale plan for water use and management in different regions of the Hexi Corridor, considering water demands for economic development as well as ecosystem maintenance and remediation, must be implemented. The improved and ultimate sustainability of regional development for the Hexi Corridor is linked to following ecological criteria in exploiting land resources, and to systematically protect ecosystem function, allowing for sound ecosystem development.

AB The Okavango Delta is a large alluvial fan complex in the northwest corner of Botswana. Both surface and groundwater in this area are important to wildlife, flora, and human settlements. A groundwater exploration study covering an area of over 14,000 km(2) was undertaken to assess the potential of groundwater to supply a major town and associated settlements. The primary control on groundwater development potential is water quality, with much of the area characterised by brackish/ saline aquifers. This largely reflects the high rate of potential evapotranspiration. As a consequence, freshwater aquifers are strongly dependent on recharge from surface water during annual flooding. In the absence of river flow, water quality in the fresh aquifers begins to deteriorate and the thickness of the fresh water lens reduces through upward migration from underlying saline aquifers. Lateral inflow from surrounding saline aquifers does not appear to be a significant. The impacts of evapotranspiration indicate the importance of regular surface water recharge to sustainable development of groundwater resources. Groundwater development strategies are changing as a result of the understanding of salinification processes in these aquifers.

ID CONTEXT
AB The European Union's Structural Funds are implemented by means of Regional Development Plans (RDP), whose regionally scoped environmental assessment is required. We highlight the deficiencies faced by this approach when subregional areas with high conservation natural values are involved and illustrate it with the case of the RDP of Andalusia region on Doana National Park area (Spain). Commissioned by the World Wildlife Fund, a Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) of the Andalusian RDP was carried out focusing on Donana and its area of influence, This is a complex space where some of the most environmentally valuable features in the continent coexist with a surrounding intense and multi-sector economic activity, threatening its conservation. In the absence of an established sustainability framework in the Region, a "trickle-down" SEA approach evidenced the need to produce a set of environmental, economic and social guidelines for sustainable management of land, against which the RDP objectives were tested for coherence. An "incremental" SEA approach was also tested, which involved the identification of 79 measures and actions stemming from the RDP provisions and other concurrent planning documents reviewed and the qualitative assessment of their individual and cumulative potential impacts on Donana environments. In the light of the results, a set of complementary mitigating measures was proposed for inclusion in tiered stages of the planning process. Measures to avoid, reduce, remedy and monitor the major types of impact were proposed, including provisions for public participation. SEA emerges as an instrument for nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) to carry out independent assessment of public development initiatives.

ID SECURITY
AB After describing an innovative technology, the close-coupled gasification and cyclonic combustor, this article explores the policy issues that inhibit a superior sustainable solution from flourishing. Discussion of technology includes defining biomass, explaining what biomass to energy means, what the advantages of biomass to energy are, and why gasification is a superior biomass to energy technology. Specifically the environmental benefits of alternatives to landspreading of traditional manure management are discussed, as well as the advantages of gasification versus traditional combustion techniques for high nitrogen fuels. The policy environment is explored, particularly regarding sustainability, manure management, and renewable energy. Artificial, non-sustainable barriers to renewable energy, and the impact of wide jurisdictional variability are discussed. North Carolina is identified as a unique jurisdiction to monitor because of its high volume of livestock manure, and laggard position in renewable energy advocacy. The authors contend that these two positions are unsustainable, and that pressures can be expected to force the state to modify its renewable energy policies or risk losing market share in livestock production to more pro-sustainable policy oriented states.

AB This paper reports part of a methodology for a model-based exploration of land use motivated by the lack of sustainability of small farming systems in southern Uruguay. Explorative land use studies aim to gain insight into future possibilities for agricultural development. They support strategic thinking during the design of new farming systems. The crop rotation plays a central role in a farming system and represents a logical starting point in the design process. The combination and sequence of crop species determine characteristics of farming systems such as crop yields, soil erosion, occurrence of soil-borne pests, diseases and weeds, and dynamics of nitrogen and labour. Here, we present a software tool called ROTAT, designed for generating crop rotations based on agronomic criteria in a transparent manner. The program combines crops from a predefined list to generate all possible rotations. The full factorial number of possible combinations of crops is limited by a number of filters controlled by the user. These filters are designed to eliminate crop successions which are agronomically unfeasible and for farm-specific reasons not practical or desirable. The filters represent expert knowledge in a quantitative and explicit way. The use of this computer program as a stand-alone tool in the process of designing crop rotations is illustrated with a published case study from an ecological pilot farm in Flevoland (The Netherlands). Using this software we were able to design 840 rotations based on the same crops and designing criteria that were used for the example farm. Many of these rotations might be interesting alternatives to the one actually implemented. Coupled with a sound procedure to evaluate the performance of such a large number of rotations 'a priori', ROTAT can reduce the risk of ignoring promising options and the arbitrariness present in previous studies dealing with design of rotations. The usefulness Of ROTAT for designing production activities in explorative land use studies based on linear programming is discussed. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Efficient crop husbandry is crucial in order to prevent unnecessary emissions of environmentally damaging inputs and to maintain economic soundness, but it raises the question of which productivity and efficiency levels should be realised. Agronomists and economists are still debating this issue, as they base their insights on different production functions: economists assume decreasing returns of input use, whereas the response curve used by agronomists is often described as linear with a plateau (LRP). The first objective of this paper is to reconcile these points of view by showing that due to annual variation in weather individual LRP curves turn into a concave function with decreasing returns when aggregated. The second objective is to present empirical evidence on the impact of weather variation on optimal input levels for the case of nitrogen in sugar beet in The Netherlands. Two methods were used: bio-physical simulation and estimation with a regression model using panel data. Optimal crop growth and nitrogen input were simulated with the Water and Agro-chemicals in the soil and Vadose Environment (WAVE) model, using weather data for 43 years. Parameters were assessed with and without additional weather effects. An agronomic crop growth simulation model such as WAVE might underestimate the effect of variation in weather on the agronomic efficiency of nitrogen, because pests, weeds and diseases as well as the effectiveness of biocides, the sowing date and possible harvesting problems are strongly influenced by the weather. To test for this effect, weather indexes that include these indirect weather effects on the occurrence of pests and diseases were derived from panel data by means of a regression model. These weather indexes were used to re-assess the impact of weather variability on the agronomic efficiency of nitrogen in sugar beet cropping. The results of the bio-physical simulation showed that due to annual variation in weather the agronomic efficiency of nitrogen use was reduced by 10% at the current ratio of prices of nitrogen and sugar beet. The variation in weather, including indirect effects, caused the agronomic efficiency to decrease by 13%. This relatively small decrease suggests that at least some of the indirect weather effects might have an opposite effect on the agronomic efficiency of nitrogen use compared with the direct weather effects. This hypothesis seems to be supported by the absence of a significant correlation between the two weather indexes and by the lower estimated variance of the weather indexes based on panel data.

AB Experiments were conducted to determine the protective effect triggered by the plant growth retardant prohexadione-Ca (Regalis(R)), bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and oligosaccharides (OLS) in different host-pathogen systems. These molecules did not show any direct antibacterial activity in vitro. On tobacco leaves, LPS infiltration (100 mug ml(-1)) prevented hypersensitive reaction (HR), whereas OLS at different concentrations did not give constant and reliable responses. On micropropagated pear plantlets in vials, only Regalis(R) and LPS (100 mug ml(-1)) gave a significant defence-related response against fire blight (Envinia amylovora): in particular, plant-derived antimicrobial compounds were related to flavan-3-ols and appeared to be newly synthesized after LPS application. Regalis(R), applied at different concentrations, significantly, lowered progression of bacterial wilt (Ralstonia solanacearum) and reduced leaf lesions of bacterial speck (Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato) and spot (Xanthomonas vesicatoria) on tomato plants in the greenhouse. OLS application (100 mug ml(-1)) significantly protected tomato leaves from bacterial speck, but not from bacterial spot. Two treatments with Regalis(R), at a twelve-day interval and at different concentrations (75+50 ppm), gave a valuable protection of grapevine leaves to downy mildew (Plasmopara viticola) in the greenhouse. When Regalis(R) was sprayed at different concentrations and at different times on potted plum trees kept outdoors it was apparently ineffective against bacterial spot/canker (Xanthomonas arboricola pv. pruni). These findings further support the potential of prohexadione-Ca and of other biotic molecules as tools for plant defence responses against different pathogens, in the perspective of integrated, eco-friendly and sustainable control programmes.

AB The Bean/Cowpea Collaborative Research Support Program (CRSP) has provided an opportunity for experienced US scientists to become involved in international research and development in a way that also has benefited their research for the USA. The comparative advantage of the CRSP is in plant breeding, but with a broad interdisciplinary approach that also develops compatible management and processing methods, thereby enhancing system sustainability, food quality and marketing opportunities for beans and cowpeas. The CRSP should continue to make uniquely important contributions to bean and cowpea cultivar development. In addition, it should give some emphasis to up-stream research, such as the development of improved technologies for indirect DNA-marker-assisted selection (MAS) that could lead to improved plant breeding methods. A careful approach to the development of transgenic lines is recommended that is limited to transferring important genes not currently present in the species into cowpea and possibly bean germplasm, for example those that confer resistance to specific major insect pests of cowpea. The CRSP should continue to play a major role in graduate education, and could take advantage of distance learning via the internet to enhance collaboration in education and research among universities in developing countries and the USA. CRSP scientists can and should play a key role in enhancing mutual understanding and collaboration on an international scale because this could make major contributions to world peace.

   PRINCIPLE; FISH STOCKS; MANAGEMENT; FISHERIES; SALAR; REQUIREMENTS
AB The control of exploitation in fisheries for Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) and trout (S. trutta L.) has both biological and socio-economic objectives, the former relating to the protection of the productive capacity and diversity of the resource and the latter to issues such as the allocation of any harvestable surplus to different user groups. In fulfilling the biological aims, managers can restrict catches or fishing effort to ensure that sufficient fish from each population are permitted to spawn; they may also consider options for increasing the production of the stock, such as habitat improvement or stocking. Biological reference points (e.g. limits and targets) are increasingly being used to provide an objective measure of the status of stocks and determine the possible need for management actions, although a range of other stock indicators may be required to fully protect the diversity of our stocks. This is consistent with the application of a precautionary approach to salmon fishery management as adopted by the North Atlantic Salmon Conservation Organisation (NASCO). NASCO has agreed that a limit reference point (or conservation limit) for Atlantic salmon should be set at the spawning stock size that will give maximum sustainable yield (S-MSY). Fisheries should therefore be managed to ensure that there is a high probability that these limits are exceeded, and actual escapement should usually be higher than these thresholds. NASCO has proposed that stocks should be maintained above their conservation limits by setting higher, and thus more precautionary, management targets, although alternative approaches are possible. ICES and NASCO have favoured a fixed escapement strategy for the management of salmon fisheries, although in practice, this strategy is being implemented in a variety of ways. In many fisheries, approaches more akin to 'floor policies' or 'proportional threshold harvesting' are being employed although the merits of different strategies for the management of commercial and recreational salmon fisheries have yet to be fully explored. Scientists still have some way to go in fully incorporating uncertainty into their management advice, but the objective must be to utilise the best information available to them, regardless of its imperfections, in developing management options and to account explicitly in their advice for the various sources of uncertainty both in the current state of scientific knowledge and in our ability to control fisheries. These management approaches have mainly been developed for the management of Atlantic salmon, but there would clearly be merits in developing similar approaches to protect production of both migratory and non-migratory trout stocks.

AB This paper draws together the findings of the others in this special issue which explores the scientific background to salmonid fisheries management. It considers the various options for action and sets them into a framework of an overall management plan. The primary importance of sound habitat management is stressed, at all scales from national and regional down to the riparian and in-stream level. An understanding of the fundamentals of population dynamics and carrying capacity is essential for effective management which involves management of exploitation and possibly stock enhancement. Benefit cost analysis, sustainability and risk management are also important elements of an effective management strategy. Finally, while fisheries management needs to be effective and incisive it also needs to be unobtrusive and sympathetic, for sport fisheries in particular, in order to maintain the "wild" nature of the resource being exploited.

AB As a species, humans depend heavily on their visual sense, make decisions as much from their hearts as from their heads (emotion- and value-based decisions versus analytical, logic- and knowledge-based decisions), and dislike environmental and other change. Societies in early stages of development have generally revered old people for their wisdom and experience, whereas many societies at more advanced stages of development have adopted a culture of youth. Attitudes toward forests have shown a similar trend. Respect for large and old trees was a feature of some early societies, whereas societies in and after the industrial revolution became more interested in younger, faster growing trees for technical and utilitarian reasons. However, as human population growth caused the area of unmanaged forest, old forest, and forests of large trees to decline, reverence has revived for large, old trees and for old forests. This trend has not been matched by a renewed respect for scientific knowledge about forests and for wisdom about forests based on long experience. Reflecting the pervasive effects of the culture of youth, issues in forestry, including the issue of old forests, are being judged largely on an aesthetic basis, on human emotional response to snapshot visual aspects, and on a dislike for chan e-the Peter Pan syndrome. "Old-growth" forest, whatever it is, has been deified as a symbol of the mythical "balance of nature," a concept discredited by ecologists as a Victorian anachronism. There are important spiritual, aesthetic, wildlife, and environmental values associated with old forests, and the area of such forests is declining. There are many valid reasons (social, scientific, and environmental) for sustaining significant and representative areas of such forests. However, conservation of such forests and ensuring a future supply of the values they provide will not be achieved unless the reverential respect for such forests is matched by another meaning of respect: understanding such forests and basing our relationship with them on that understanding. This paper challenges forest managers and forest scientists to gain a significant understanding of "old growth" to provide a logical, knowledge-based, and experience-based foundation for the identification, inventory, conservation, and management of this forest ecosystem condition, and to assert this understanding as a counterbalance to the necessary. but insufficient, value-based attitude toward old forests that arises largely from visual snapshots and the emotions they arouse.

AB How much old growth is there? How much was there? Is remaining old growth disappearing? If so, how fast and why? Is any more old growth being created? How fragmented are old-growth forests? What other forest types and land uses surround them? Scientists see these as challenging questions, never to be fully resolved. Policy makers see information gaps and want answers. They assume that because the public values old-growth forests, their continuing availability must be assured. Forest managers need to be convinced that old-growth forests provide unique values before taking costly measures to conserve them. The relative stability of old-growth forests is interesting from a management perspective. Are old-growth forests more resistant to high-intensity disturbances, such as crown fires and violent storms? Do they resist insect outbreaks? A related issue is the quality of ecosystem services provided by old-growth forests. Do they have an exceptional ability to provide clean water, to stabilize hydrologic regimes, and to moderate local climates? Can they be used to test hypotheses about complexity, stability, resilience, and ecosystem change? These questions provide a strong rationale for developing working definitions of old-growth forests, for retaining areas of old-growth forest, and for replicating old-growth features in landscapes managed for timber production. Old-growth forests are desirable sites for monitoring, serving as benchmarks for adaptive management. Knowledge about old-growth forests has already had a considerable impact on policy and management, particularly in coastal regions. Current research and monitoring systems may not be adequate for the task of identifying and describing the biological complexity and diversity inherent in old-growth forests. New investments in collecting and managing data from old-growth (and secondary) forests are needed, and will pay manifold dividends to future generations of Canadians. This paper suggests that the central role of old-growth forests in developing sustainable forest management should create an incentive for the forest science, policy, and management communities to unite in support of their conservation.

AB Prescriptions of the Forest Management Planning Manual (FMPM) for Ontario's Crown forests are examined for conformance with the elements of the Canadian Council of Forest Ministers (CCFM) Criteria and Indicators (C&I) of sustainable forest management (SFM). The examination identifies gaps and highlights forest management planning aspects that require gap-bridging interventions at the forest management unit (FMU) level. The three levels (parts) of the FMPM-Management Planning, Annual Operations, and Reporting & Monitoring-are examined. Gaps are categorized in three groups-major, intermediate, and minor gaps. Major gaps are recorded for five out of 22 elements of the CCFM C&I framework, and these gaps indicate inadequate prescriptions for the corresponding elements at all the three levels. Minor gaps are also recorded for five elements, and these gaps indicate inadequate prescriptions at the monitoring level. Intermediate gaps are recorded for 11 elements, and depending on the specific element and indicator, inadequacy of prescriptions may only be for operations, reporting and monitoring, or may also include the planning level. The main findings of the gap analysis are that none of the six criteria of SFM has been fully incorporated in the FMPM; Part C (Reporting and Monitoring) has the highest degree and Part A (Plan Contents) has the lowest degree of non-conformity with respect to CCFM CI framework; at the criterion-level the Global Ecological Cycles has major gaps while three criteria-Soil and Water Conservation, Multiple Benefits, and Society' Responsibility-have intermediate gaps; and the changes in the FMPM have been incremental while the shift in the concept of forest management from Sustained Yield Timber Management to SFM was a drastic change.

AB Sustainable forest management involves, among other things, maintaining diversity of ecosystems and preserving their natural processes. The main objective of this paper is to consider the validity of current harvesting techniques applied to the mixed forest of Quebec. The old-growth mixed forest naturally regenerates by gap dynamics. However, the harvesting technique most commonly used in the mixed forest is clearcutting, with the result that succession must start over from the beginning. A general forest succession model applicable after such large disturbances is proposed. The most positive estimate indicates that the mixed forest will not be re-established earlier than 250 years after clearcutting. To ensure sustainable development in the mixed forest, harvesting techniques should imitate natural regeneration processes.

AB In recent years there has been considerable emphasis placed upon the importance of understanding "forest values." This article has two interrelated objectives: 1) to provide a discussion of some of the methodological issues to be considered in conducting social survey research on forest values, opinions, and attitudes; 2) to provide an analysis that illustrates how values underlie opinions and attitudes about clearcutting and visual quality. In the first part of this paper a critical overview of using social science to investigate forest values is undertaken. For illustrative purposes, aesthetic values, clearcutting, and visual aspects of forest management are focussed upon. The concept of "values" is critically examined. The importance of understanding the connection between values and opinions/attitudes is discussed. Some problems with defining "the public" are described, and the need to explore intergroup differences with regard to environmental issues is stressed. In part two of the paper an analysis of empirical data is provided to demonstrate: 1) the relationship between abstract forest values (e.g., aesthetic values) and opinions about more specific forest practices (e.g., clearcutting, the creation of visual corridors); 2) the ways in which abstract forest values are associated with world views that structure opinions and attitudes about forest management (e.g., ecological, outdoor recreation experiences, and aesthetic values are part of a non-material forest values world view, while economic values are part of an economic values and community sustainability world view). It does this by providing a series of bivariate and multivariate analyses looking at the effects of abstract forest values, and world views upon opinions/attitudes about visual forest management (while controlling for other factors-such as socio-economic and demographic variables). Implications of these results for future research, and for forest managers, planners, and policy makers is also briefly discussed.

AB Nitrate inputs into aquifers may be attenuated by denitrification. This study aims to evaluate the relevance of dissolved organic matter (DOM) as a substrate for denitrifiers. Seepage water and groundwater were sampled using suction plates, suction cups and multilevel wells and were analyzed for dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and for NO3-. DOM was fractionated and subjected to batch incubations. The investigated soils were three well-drained Plaggic Anthrosols, one Gleyic Podzol and one Eutric Gleysol. Concentrations of DOM ranged from 9 to 32 mg C l(-1) at 90 cm depth. Fluxes of DOM at this depth were between 60 and 90 kg DOC ha(-1) year(-1). Concentrations decreased to 4-7 mg C l(-1) at depths of 3-5.6 m at the well-drained sites. Corresponding DOC fluxes at these depths were between 10 and 20 kg C ha(-1) year(-1). No change in DOC concentrations and fluxes with increasing depth was observed at the poorly drained sites. Because DOM fractions did not change along the flowpath, retention by sorption was probably negligible at these sites. Decreasing NO3- concentrations, which indicate denitrification, were observed at the poorly drained sites and 9-13 m below the groundwater table. During incubation studies, DOC and NO3- concentrations changed little (mean decrease: < 1 mg C l(-1), 0.9 mg N l(-1)). We conclude that DOM leached from soils does not contribute significantly to the natural attenuation of NO3- leached to aquifers because (a) the zones where DOM concentrations and NO3- concentrations decrease are separated spatially and (b) the bioavailability of leached DOM is low.

ID IMPACT; DRUGS
AB Canada's provincial governments have, until relatively recently, provided virtually all seniors with generous prescription drug coverage. Managers of these programs have implemented a variety of policies to contain spending while ensuring access to necessary medicines. Some of these policies have been successful in temporarily slowing cost growth. However, the lack of comprehensive utilization management tools has resulted in ongoing spending increases that now constitute a threat to the sustainability of a public drug subsidy for Canadian seniors. Sustainable and equitable pharmacare programs require the political willingness to confront opposition to policies that will, if successful, contain program costs without obstructing access.

AB Compared with nursing home care, community care, which is often viewed in Canada as care at home, is assumed to be best for older adults with chronic disease or disabilities since it is seen as client-focused and less costly. As the number of frail seniors living in the community increases, governments in Canada seek to provide alternate models of nursing home care. As part of a larger initiative meant to increase the scope of community programmes, a demonstration project was conducted in western Canada to evaluate the implementation of client-centred, community-based residential care with individuals requiring nursing-home-level care. The present authors explore two main implementation challenges: whether care that is responsive to individual preferences can be provided to people who cannot assume active decision-making roles; and whether care can be centred in the community if people are living in residential care settings rather than in their own homes. Focus groups were conducted with two key stakeholder groups with varying informal (family members) and formal (programme staff) relationships with residents living in three new programmes. From content analysis, the programmes appeared successful in conveying the importance of recognising residents as individuals and of keeping them connected to the community, but fell short of implementation expectations. Three themes illustrate the challenges: (1) engaging with others in a care partnership; (2) responding to residents' preferences and care needs with limited resources; and (3) maintaining residents' connections with the community. To improve the feasibility of these programmes, some changes could be pursued within existing financial resources. However moderating the funding to bring it somewhat closer to nursing home levels could support the sustainability of community-situated programmes for frail seniors.

AB The impact of research and development (R&D) on firm performance is generally agreed to be positive, but the nature and extent of this impact share little agreement in the previous research. Using an improved, time series, cross-sectional regression model that accounts for both contemporaneous and firm-specific serial correlation, as well as the feedback between firm profitability and investments, our study compares the rate of return from a dollar investment on R&D to a dollar investment on fixed assets in pharmaceutical and chemical industries.
   We find positive associations of R&D intensity and all variables of firm performance (net margin, operating margin, sales growth, and market value). We find that an investment in R&D earns an operating margin return much higher than the industry cost of capital. We also find that the effect of an investment in R&D on the firm's market value is about twice as much the effect of an investment in fixed assets. These findings have implications for corporate investment strategies, indicating that additional R&D investment is more likely to provide a firm with a unique and sustainable competitive advantage.

ID SUSTAINABILITY
AB The agricultural activity has been, through the times, bases fundamental on human development. Although at first the environmental impact of this activity agreed to the resilience of the environment, at present, as a result of the population growth and the increase in productivity, the irreversible effects caused on the environment are considerable, mainly on land, water and biodiversity. Different groups of researchers, farmers and individuals have proposed and developed styles of "non-conventional" agriculture, in which it is attempted to diminish the negative effects of this agriculture on the environment, and to implant diverse alternatives and strategies. The options are natural, biodynamic and organic biological agricultures, and perm, culture. The term "agroecology", includes the incorporation of these alternatives in the agricultural activities, the socioeconomic and cultural aspects of the affected population and the use of clean technologies. This work presents information of new approaches of agricultural processes on world-wide scale the main impacts caused by the agricultural activities in the environment and proposed clean technologies as palliative measures to correct the negative effects caused by man's activity.

ID INDICATORS
AB The measurement of sustainable development is a goal for better performance of any externality producer and indicators are one way to evaluate the implementation of practical policy decisions. The tourism industry, like many others, is an important source of income for many groups, but is also a serious potential source of environmental problems. Adoption of the sustainable tourism concept is a possible way to approach these problems. To measure the historical behaviour of the tourism industry in the state of Baja California Sur, Mexico we built a sustainable development tourism index based on multivariable analysis of a 34-indicator data set. The analysis covers the period 1990 to 2000. We found a positive trend in the index, derived from 27 indicators of sustainability and an additional 7 strategic tourist indicators. So far Baja California Sur has been able to absorb the migration and growth, mainly in Los Cabos area, and the index suggested that the. environment is apparently not seriously affected yet. However BCS society must carefully watch the growth of tourism in subsequent years to avoid negative impacts on nature and residents. The proposed index is a performance parameter for measuring sustainable development in tourism not only in Mexico, but also in other countries with an adequate data base of sustainability indicators.

TI On the HYway - sustainable assets in Germany's energy state's portfolio
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
LA English
DT Article
AB Historically, North Rhine-Westfalia (NRW), Germany's energy state with the heavily industrialized Ruhr area in its middle, provided coal and steel for the industrialization of the country in the late 18th and the 19th century, was key in the recovery process after WWs I and II, and stands today for the ongoing successfully pursued transformation process from carbonaceous energy raw materials to high-tech energy technologies. Step by step, prevailing energy policy has become energy technology policy!
   The state hosts Germany's partner in the development club for a hydrogen-based zero-CO2 coal fired power plant, as well as the biggest PV production capacity in the country; it operates a significant share of Germany's almost 9 GW(e) wind parks, and runs a remarkable co-operative fuel cell development network of academia and industry. So far, the youngest baby is the rapidly growing hydrogen energy economy structure, consisting of hydrogen technologies for more or less all the links of the hydrogen energy conversion chain, particularly clean hydrogen production from fossil fuels, including CO2 sequestration, or from renewable energy sources. Thus, the transformation process of NRW from coal and steel to solar- and hydrogen-based high-tech energy technologies seems exemplary for many historically similarly structured world regions.
   The paper tries to offer an insight into the build-up of hydrogen-based decarbonized, hydrogenated, and, thus, dematerialized energy markets. On the energy HYway, energy technologies have taken the lead. They provide more clean energy services at the back end of the energy conversion chain from less environmentally harmful and climate change risking carbonaceous energy raw material at its front end. They grant urgently needed exergetization (exergy = energy-anergy) of the nation's energy system, and, not least, they are preconditional for otherwise irrational energy sustainability: H-2 is the paving stone of the HYway's sustainable pavement!

AB This paper describes a quasi-experimental study of a musical exercise intervention to improve the physical, cognitive, behavioral status and life satisfaction of older residents in a long-term care facility in the United Kingdom. Twenty long-term care residents from three different units (n = 60) were recruited and assigned to one of three groups: a control (C) group (no intervention), an occupational therapy (OT) group (comparison group) and a music exercise group (intervention group). Assessments of physical and cognitive status were made pre-intervention and repeated at the end of the 10-week exercise program and again 10 weeks after the completion of the program. The results show that both OT and exercise participation is associated with improvement in physical and cognitive function. However, the exercise group showed significant improvement in more areas than the OT group. The functional benefits from OT and exercise were not sustainable after these activities ceased and showed significant decline 10 weeks after the end of the programs. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

ID MERCURY POLLUTION; BRAZIL
AB The increasing societal demand for actions and strategies towards sustainability of small-scale gold mining in developing countries has led experts to face the challenge of managing the harzards associated with mercury pollution from active and abandoned mine sites. Mercury pollution in drainage systems and its health effects are the most frequent subjects on environmental researchs dealing with small-scale gold mining worldwide. Also, filling of river beds with mineral matter originated from runoff of abandoned mining waste piles and tailings generally causes both silting of waterways and elevation of Hg concentrations in the environment. This paper summarizes the main results concerning the assessment of Hg pollution in Amazon drainage systems accomplished by the authors in the last decade in Brazil.

TI Contributions of an alley cropping system and arbuscular mycorrhizal
   fungi to maize productivity under cassava intercrop in the derived
   savannah zone
SO JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
AB Alley cropping is a prototype agro-forestry system practiced in many parts of the humid tropics. It is one of the established, promising and sustainable low-input soil management ventures. An improved understanding of the eco-physiological relationships between the arable and perennials in this system could contribute to solving issues of sustainability for nutrient use and system productivity. Field experiments were conducted in Alabata and Ajibode, located in the derived savannah zone of Nigeria, to evaluate the comparative effects of an alley cropping system, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi inoculation and cassava intercropping on maize yield. These on-farms trials (research managed and farmer managed) were conducted in the 1993/94 and 1995/96 growing seasons, in Rhodic Kandiustalf soil type with low nutrients. Each trial was a split-plot factorial arranged in randomized complete blocks with three replications. Biomass productions of maize and cassava tuber yield were determined. The results obtained at Alabata indicated that the maize plants were heavily infected with AM fungi whether inoculated or not. The hedgerow trees did not have a significant effect on maize yield. The increase in yield brought about by the alley cropping system was generally less than 15 %, except in one farm where increases of 34.6 and 46.5 %, were recorded in AM-inoculated and non-inoculated plots respectively. The introduced AM fungi did not significantly enhance maize yield at Alabata; the percentage increase was not more than 24 %. This trend was also observed at Ajibode. Cassava tuber yield was found to be suppressed by the alley cropping system irrespective of the cultivar. The decrease in yield ranged from 2.6 to 150.8 %. However, inoculation of the cassava with exotic AM fungi brought about an enhancement of its tuber production. The increase ranged from 20.7 to 189.8% depending on the treatment combination. It is therefore necessary to encourage adoption of the improved alley cropping system integrated with mycorrhizal technology.

AB Environmental factors and public perceptions already constrain growth at many airports-especially in Europe-and are likely to further constrain aviation in future. In this paper, the way in which these factors influence airport development is considered, together with methods of managing environmental capacity. Environmental limits are inherent to concepts of environmental capacity and sustainability. Although environmental efficiencies in aviation are the subject of considerable research effort, more attention needs to be given to defining and finding commercially viable ways of working within environmental limits.

AB As airport construction competes for land, more and more new developments involve major landform changes, from the channel modifications on the River Bollin at Manchester Airport to the seaward expansion of runways at Sydney and Beirut and the enlargement or total creation of islands at Chek Lap Kok Airport, Hong Kong and Kansai International Airport in Osaka Bay, Japan. The quantities of material involved are large, 307 Mm(3) of material being moved for Chep Lap Kok Airport and 13 Mm(3) will be needed to fill the area required for a new runway at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport. Both the landform changes and the excavation and filling of materials produce profound geomorphic changes. In some cases the new configurations are unstable and may need to be rectified by further engineering work. Greater sustainability is achieved when recycled material is used for filling, such as the use of some 2 Mm(3) of material dredged as a part of normal navigation channel maintenance from the Delaware River in the construction of a new commuter airline runway at Philadelphia International Airport.

AB We investigated the effect of distinct genotypes on growth performance, DM and N digestibilities, serum metabolite and hormonal profiles, and carcass and meat quality of pigs. Eight control-line and eight select-line pigs with an equal number of gilts and castrated males per genotype were chosen from the group of pigs subjected to selection for lean growth efficiency. Pigs were housed individually and allowed. ad libitum access to common grower, finisher 1, and finisher 2 diets when they reached approximately 0, 50, and 80 kg, respectively, and water throughout the study. Although genotype had no effect on growth performance during the nisher 2 phase and overall, select-line pigs grew faster and more efficiently (P < 0.05) during the grower and finisher 1 phases than did control-line pigs. Dry matter and N digestibilities during the grower phase were lower (P < 0.05) in select-line pigs compared with control-line pigs. Select-line pigs had less ultrasound backfat (P < 0.05) at the end of the grower and finisher 2 phases. Serum urea N (P < 0.05) and leptin concentrations were lower in select-line pigs than in control-line pigs, but the effect of genotype on serum glucose, triglyceride, or insulin concentration was rather inconsistent. Select-line pigs had heavier heart (P < 0.05), liver (P = 0.08), and kidneys (P < 0.01), implying a higher metabolic activity. Less 10th-rib carcass backfat (P < 0.01) and a trend for larger carcass lon,gissimus muscle area (P = 0.10) were reflected in the greater (P < 0.01) rate and efficiency of lean accretion in select-line pigs. Select-line pigs had lower subjective meat color (P < 0.01), marbling (P < 0.05), and firmness (P < 0.01) scores. Final serum leptin concent.ration'was correlated positively with carcass backfat thickness (r 0.73; P < 0.01) and negatively with overall feed intake (r = -0.77; P < 0.01). These results indicate that pigs with distinct genotypes exhibited differences in the growth rate, metabolite and hormonal profiles, and body composition. Further research is necessary to determine whether pigs with distinct genotypes respond differently to dietary manipulations, which would have an effect on developing optimal feeding strategies for efficient and sustainable pig production.

   degradation; ex-situ conservation; in-situ conservation; rangelands
AB Increasing attention is devoted at the national, regional and international levels to in-situ conservation as a dynamic form of preservation of biodiversity and related local knowledge. The significance of drylands biodiversity for agricultural production, other human needs, and environmental protection is emphasised with particular reference to the Central and West Asia and North Africa (CWANA) region. The detrimental activities and processes leading to the rapid erosion of aridland biodiversity and, finally, to desertification on a large-scale are identified and discussed in relation to human population growth, urbanisation and poverty. Examples of regional projects on plant biodiversity conservation, ecosystem rehabilitation and sustainable utilization, which are carried out by the International Centre for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas (ICARDA) with its National Agriculture Research Systems (NARS) partners in the region, are mentioned, and the contribution of farmers and herder communities through participation in these efforts is highlighted. A broad public awareness and education campaign at all levels, starting with the community members and school children and addressing other stake-holders, particularly national decision- and policy-makers and donor organisations, is essential for arresting and, hopefully, reversing the negative trends in the dryland's biodiversity degradation.

AB In the Arabian Peninsula, rangeland biodiversity and animal production exist in a delicate balance. Increases in the small ruminant population has meant that the palatable indigenous plant species have been severely overgrazed. Exotic species are now being grown for fodder, however these use large volumes of irrigation water, and the practice is not sustainable.
   One approach to the conservation of biological diversity and the promotion of sustainable animal production is the conservation and utilization of these indigenous plant species. Seeds of three priority grasses have been collected, multiplied and evaluations for their water use efficiency and nutritive values made. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB The Saint Katherine Protectorate is one of Egypt's largest protected areas and includes the country's highest mountains. This arid, mountain ecosystem supports a surprising biodiversity and a high proportion of plant endemics. The protectorate contains religious and culturally significant sites, including Mount Sinai and the Monastery of Saint Katherine. Seven thousand bedouin from six tribes live in or around the protectorate.
   Recent development pressure, catalysed by tourism, has resulted in the natural resource base of this fragile region being overexploited. An integrated management plan is under development to conserve the area's natural and cultural heritage, and ensure community participation while expanding opportunities for sustainable tourism. Local community guards now enforce a conservation ethic in one of Egypt's most spectacular and fragile regions. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB With conservation of biological diversity depending as much on socioeconomic as on biological processes, this paper stresses the importance of clear policy objectives to guide strategies for preserving biological diversity. The first requirement is to define the essential elements and socioeconomic importance of biological diversity, so that these can be accommodated adequately in a national programme for sustainable rural development.
   Efficient application of this programme requires that its goals be clearly enunciated in national policy. There should also be maximum political support for its effective sociopolitically, economically and ecologically rationalised implementation by an accountable authority through a conducive institutional framework. Experience suggests that proprietorship and price are prime elements that need to be reconciled in such a framework of positive and negative incentives to individuals, to mitigate the opportunity costs and encourage the conservation of biodiversity. The present paper considers how these institutional requirements may be met, with particular reference to the special characteristics found in and areas. (C) 2003 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB Past conservation policies have often foundered due to conflict between those seeking to defend resources and those excluded from their usage. The concept of sustainability was introduced in the 1980s with a world conservation strategy arguing that natural biological populations produce a surplus which can be harvested in a sustainable manner. This policy moved considerably in the 1990s with the recognition that most uses are detrimental and a sustainable harvest is difficult to calculate or achieve. Apart from problems in the determination of environmental and biological factors governing sustainability, it was also recognized that social and economic forces play a major role. Thus, the Convention on Biological Diversity in 1992 was founded upon conservation, sustainable use and an equitable sharing of the benefits from resources. Integrated Marine and Coastal Area Management (IMCAM) also known as Integrated Costal Zone Management has been suggested to be the most suitable strategy to manage human impacts on marine and coastal biodiversity and to promote conservation and sustainable use of biological resources. IMCAM involves all users or stakeholders including decision makers in the public and private sectors, resource owners, managers, users, non governmental organizations and the general public. The use of this approach to conservation is described by reference to the recent UNOPS/GEF/UNDP-sponsored marine zoning plan for the conservation and sustainable use of the biodiversity and natural resources of the Socotra Archipelago, Yemen.

AB Field observations of cases of biodiversity destruction and mankind's impact on desertification are discussed. Controversial cases of vegetation conservation and their effect on the reconstruction of ecosystems are also discussed. The importance of desert plants in the dry ecosystems of the Arab world are demonstrated, showing the importance of such indigenous genetical resources in stopping desertification and the necessity to support the sustainable use of natural resources. The study shows that in the Arab world's dry ecosystems, sufficient biodiversity and genetical resources exist to support natural vegetation, assure the stoppage of degradation and desertification and fix sands if sustainably used. Case studies from Bahrain are taken as examples. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB Arid and semi-arid regions are jeopardized by land degradation with serious consequences for the natural vegetation, plant biodiversity and sustainable use of the natural environment. This paper describes the major causes of land degradation in northern Kuwait and outlines factors that serve to maintain plant biodiversity in those affected areas that would normally be dominated by the perennial dwarf shrub Haloxylon salicornicum. A conceptual model is presented describing the four major stages of degradation in this community. It is emphasized that stringent conservation measures are needed to protect the landscape from further deterioration and to promote re-establishment of the natural vegetation.

AB Aim Anecdotal historical and photographic evidence suggests that woody vegetation is increasing dramatically in some northern Australian savanna habitats. Vegetation change in savannas has important implications for pastoral land-use, conservation management, and landscape-scale carbon storage, and informs theoretical debates about ecosystem function. This study seeks to determine the nature, extent and cause(s) of woody vegetation change in a seasonally flooded alluvial savanna habitat.
   Location The study area is located within the seasonally inundated alluvial zone of the tidal portion of the Victoria River, Northern Territory, Australia. The study area has been grazed by domestic stock since c. 1900, prior to which the area was inhabited and more likely regularly burnt by Aboriginal people for thousands of years.
   Methods Digital georeferenced aerial photographic coverages were used to examine and quantify woody vegetation change between 1948 and 1993. Transect surveys of woody and herbaceous vegetation were carried out to ground-truth air-photo results and determine the nature and causes of observed vegetation changes.
   Results There has been a dramatic increase in woody vegetation cover throughout the study area. Vegetation change patterns are roughly uniform across the full range of edaphic habitat variation and are unrelated to the depositional age of fluvial sediments. Two woody species, Eucalyptus microtheca and Excoecaria parvifolia, are predominantly responsible for observed increases. Demographic analyses reveal that woody invasions have been episodic and indicate that in most locations peak woody species establishment occurred in the mid-1970s. Grasses are almost absent in a majority of habitats within the study area. Instead, large areas are covered by scalded soil, dense invasive weed populations, and unpalatable forbs and sedges. What grasses do occur are predominantly of very low value for grazing. The condition of the herbaceous layer renders most of the study area almost completely non-flammable; what fires do burn are small and of low intensity.
   Main conclusions Multiple working hypotheses explaining observed patterns of woody vegetation increase were considered and rejected in turn. The only hypothesis consistent with the evidence is as follows: (1) observed changes are a direct consequence of extreme overgrazing by cattle, most likely when stocking rates peaked in the mid-1970s; (2) prolonged heavy grazing effected the complete transformation of much of the herbaceous vegetation to a new state that is not flammable; and (3) in the absence of regular fire mortality, woody vegetation increased rapidly. The relatively treeless system that existed in 1948 was apparently stable and resilient to moderate grazing levels, and perhaps also to episodic heavy grazing events. However, grazing intensity in excess of a sustainable threshold has forced a transition that is irreversible in the foreseeable future. Stable-state transitions such as this one inform debates at the heart of ecological theory, such as the nature of stability, resilience, equilibrium and carrying capacity in dynamic savanna ecosystems.

AB This paper provides an overview of the contemporary debate on the concepts and definitions of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) and Corporate Sustainability (CS). The conclusions, based on historical perspectives, philosophical analyses, impact of changing contexts and situations and practical considerations, show that "one solution fits all" - definition for CS(R) should be abandoned, accepting various and more specific definitions matching the development, awareness and ambition levels of organizations.

AB According to Dr. Clare Graves, mankind has developed eight core value systems, 1 as responses to prevailing circumstances. Given different contexts and value systems, a one-solution-fits-all concept of corporate sustainability is not reasonable. Therefore, this paper presents various definitions and forms of sustainability, each linked to specific (societal) circumstances and related value systems. A sustainability matrix - an essential element of the overall European Corporate Sustainability Framework - is described showing six types of organizations at different developmental stages, with different forms of corporate sustainability, each supported by specific institutional arrangements.

AB The European Corporate Sustainability Framework (ECSF) is a new generation management framework, aimed to meet increased corporate complexity and support corporate transformation towards more sustainable ways of doing business. It is a multilayer, integral business framework with an analytical, contextual, situational and dynamic dimension.
   Analytically, the framework is structured according to four focus points - the constitutional, conceptual, behavioural and evaluative perspective - providing integrative designs of complex and dynamic phenomena. The framework includes coherent sets of business philosophies, approaches, concepts and tools that structures corporate realities and generates sequences of steps in order to obtain adequate institutional structures, a road to corporate transformation and higher performance levels.

DE corporate sustainability indicators; key performance indicators (KPI's)
AB More and more businesses are aligning their activities with the principles of sustainable development. Therefore they need to adapt their ways of measuring corporate performance. However, it includes issues which may be outside the direct control of the organisation, that are difficult to characterise and often are based on value judgements rather than hard data. The difficulty in measuring performance is further complicated by the fact that many corporations have a complex organisational structure, with different business streams, functions and projects.
   This paper has used two case studies to explore how the appropriate use of indicators can be a powerful tool in addressing the sustainability of businesses both at a corporate wide level and at a project level.

AB As a number of high profile companies have found to their cost, corporate reputations can be significantly affected by firms' management of sustainability issue, including those that are outside their direct control, such as the environmental and social impacts of their supply networks. This paper begins by examining the relationship between corporate social responsibility, reputation, and supply network conditions. It then looks at the effectiveness of one tool for managing supply network sustainability issues, ethical sourcing codes of conduct, by examining how the characteristics of three supply networks branded clothes, DIY wood products and branded confectionary affects the implementation ethical sourcing codes of conduct. It ends by setting out conclusions on why implementation of such codes has been so much more successful in some sectors than others and recommendations on effective approaches to managing sustainability issues in supply networks.

DE corporate social responsibility; management systems; sustainability;
   total quality
AB At the start of the 21st century, Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) seems to have great potential for innovating business practices with a positive impact on People, Planet and Profit. In this article the differences between the management systems approach of the nineties, and Corporate Social Responsibility are analysed.
   An analysis is structured around three business principles that are relevant for CSR and management systems: (1) doing things right the first time, (2) doing the right things, and (3) continuous improvement and innovation. Basically CSR is focussing on the second principle, and management systems focus on the first. However, CSR is very likely to build on the management systems as well.
   From a CSR point of view, the existing generation of management systems with their focus on rational control (= doing things right) can only be of limited use in the development of CSR. However, the preventive rationalities of management systems are important. Values and the principle doing the right things is extremely relevant for CSR. This goes far beyond the present generation of ISO type management systems; opportunities stem from building on TQM approaches like the EFQM Business Excellence model. Continuous improvement and innovation is a permanent challenge underlying the two other business principles, and requires both individual and organisational learning processes. In the present generation of management systems, continuous improvement mainly addresses rational prevention, barely the value aspects of business.
   For the further development and implementation of CSR, each of the three business management principles are vital. There is a need for a new generation of management systems that addresses the values at stake in strategic decision-making, both at company level and in the behaviour of individuals, while the rationalities of prevention and anticipation are still relevant. In both directions more emphasis for continuous learning and innovation will be needed.
   CSR is likely to trigger the development of management systems in the directions mentioned. This will support companies to be credible and transparent in improving the performance with respect to people, planet and profit.

AB The corporate sustainability, and responsibility, movement has considerable implications for and impact on the discipline of brand management. It creates pressures to which the discipline must adjust, and new growth opportunities for it to enjoy.
   In Maio's view, "brand" permeates all aspects of the corporation and therefore the values of the brand can serve as an effective touchstone for all corporate behaviours: in the Boardroom, in financial markets, in negotiations with employees, in customer interactions, in dialogue with other stakeholders. Moreover, most corporations already have "plumbing" in place ( the organizational substructures and processes to manage their brand), that can serve as effective conduits for nurturing values-driven behaviours and measuring them.

AB Carbon tetrabromide (CBr4) has been used as a source of p-type dopant in GaAs (GaAs:C) grown by solid source molecular beam epitaxy (SSMBE). The stability and sustainability of the CBr4 flux were investigated in terms of the leak valve position and CBr4 cylinder temperature. It is found that stable and sustainable CBr4 flux ranging from similar to2.0 x 10(-8) to similar to1 x 10(-6) Torr can be obtained by regulating the leak valve opening position within cylinder temperature of 2-20degreesC. The hole concentration in GaAs increases linearly following increase in CBr4 flux UP to 2.6 x 10(-7) Torr, at which the hole concentration is the highest at 1.86 x 10(20) cm(-3). Thereafter, the hole concentration decreases due to formation of electrically inactive C-C pairs. The memory effect in GaAs from possible background carbon doping was found to be at an acceptably low level of similar to10(15) cm(-3) hole concentration, indicating the viability of CBr4 usage in SSMBE for p-type doping.

AB In northern Florida, year-round forage systems are used in dairy effluent sprayfields to reduce nitrate leaching. Our purpose was to quantify forage N removal and monitor nitrate N (NO3--N) concentration below the rooting zone for two perennial, sod-based, triple-cropping systems over four 12-mo cycles (1996-2000). The soil is an excessively drained Kershaw sand (thermic, uncoated Typic Quartzip-samment). Effluent N rates were 500, 690, and 910 kg ha(-1) per cycle. Differences in N removal between a corn (Zea mays L.)-bermudagrass (Cynodon spp.)-rye (Secale cereale L.) system (CBR) and corn-perennial peanut (Arachis glabrata Benth.)-rye system (CPR) were primarily related to the performance of the perennial forages. Nitrogen removal of corn (125-170 kg ha(-1)) and rye (62-90 kg ha(-1)) was relatively stable between systems and among cycles. The greatest N removal was measured for CBR in the first cycle (408 kg ha(-1)), with the bermudagrass removing an average of 191 kg N ha(-1). In later cycles, N removal for bermudagrass declined because dry matter (DM) yield declined. Yield and N removal of perennial peanut increased over the four cycles. Nitrate N concentrations below the rooting zone were lower for CBR than CPR in the first two cycles, but differences were inconsistent in the latter two. The CBR system maintained low NO3--N leaching in the first cycle when the bermudagrass was the most productive; however, it was not a sustainable system for longterm prevention of NO3--N leaching due to declining bermudagrass yield in subsequent cycles. For CPR, effluent N rates greater than or equal to 500 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) have the potential to negatively affect ground water quality.

AB Soils that receive large applications of animal wastes and sewage sludge are vulnerable to releasing environmentally significant concentrations of dissolved P available to subsurface flow owing to the gradual saturation of the soil's P sorption capacity. This study evaluated P sorption (calculated from Langmuir isotherms) and availability of P (as CaCl2-P and resin P) in soils incubated for 20 d with poultry litter, poultry manure, cattle slurry, municipal sewage sludge, or KH2PO4, added on a P-equivalent basis (100 mg P kg(-1)). All the P sources had a marked negative effect on P sorption and a positive effect on P availability in all soils. In the cattle slurry- and KH2PO4- treated soils, the decreases in P sorption maximum (19-66%) and binding energy (25-89%) were consistently larger than the corresponding decreases (7-41% and 11-30%) in poultry litter-, poultry manure-, and sewage sludge-treated soils. The effects of cattle slurry and KH2PO4 on P availability were, in most cases, larger than those of the other P sources. In the poultry litter, poultry manure, and sewage sludge treatments, the increase in soil solution P was inversely related (R-2 = 0.75) to the input of Ca from these relatively high Ca (13.5-42 g kg(-1)) sources. Correlation analyses implied that the magnitude of the changes in P sorption and availability was not related to the water-extractable P content of the P sources. Future research on the sustainable application of organic wastes to agricultural soils needs to consider the non-P- as well as P-containing components of the waste.

AB This paper presents the ethnomedical uses of wild species among nine rural communities managing local forest resources in the Bonch Village Development Committee (VDC), Dolakha district, Nepal. Local communities possess knowledge of 113 medical remedies derived from 58 species belonging to 40 families to treat a wide range of aliments. A review of literature indicated that 56 medical remedies reported in this paper are new. Most medicines were prepared in the form of juice and were administered orally. Roots and leaves were the most frequently used plant parts. Local people were familiar mostly with the species dealing with common ailments particularly cough/cold, digestive problems, fever, headache, and skin infections. Complex ailments were treated by traditional healers. Haphazard harvesting and over-exploitation of commercial species were also reported. Sustainable harvesting methods and domestication of potential commercial species require attention in the local forest operational plans.
   The present study indicates that the area harbors a high diversity of medicinal plants. Despite gradual socio-cultural transformation, local communities still possess substantial knowledge of plants and their uses. The reliance on folk medicines for health care is associated with the lack of modem medicines and medication, poverty and the traditional belief of its effectiveness. Since there is a lack of phyto-therapeutic evidence for many of the species, we recommend that phytochemical and pharmacological studies be carried out in order to confirm the validity of properties attributed to these species: this is particularly relevant for species with market potential beyond the district. With setting up management plans for their extraction, these medicinal resources can provide for both subsistence needs and income. This, however, requires detail assessment of resource quantities, productivity potential, sustainable harvesting methods, domestication possibilities, market value of potentially promising species, and importantly, equitable benefit sharing regimes.

AB The 'high-dose-refuge' (HDR) strategy is widely recommended by the biotechnology industry and regulatory authorities to delay pest adaptation to transgenic crops that produce Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) toxins. This involves cultivating nontoxic plants (refuges) in close proximity to crops producing a high dose of Bt toxin. The principal cost associated with this strategy is due to yield losses suffered by farmers growing unprotected, refuge plants. Using a population genetic model of selection in a spatially heterogeneous environment, we show the existence of an optimal spatial configuration of refuges that could prevent the evolution of resistance whilst reducing the use of costly refuges. In particular, the sustainable control of pests is achievable with the use of more aggregated distributions of nontransgenic plants and transgenic plants producing lower doses of toxin. The HDR strategy is thus suboptimal within the context of sustainable agricultural development.

AB Food and nutrition insecurity which affects an estimated 815 million households (the majority in developing countries), is in large part due to micronutrient deficiencies. The magnitude of the problem, causes, consequences and cost-effective solutions elucidated by scientists over the last few decades changed perceptions and. drew political commitments in the 1990s to alleviate micronutrient deficiencies. Prevalence was reduced for iodine and vitamin A deficiency disorders largely through mandated universal fortification of salt with iodine and wide distribution of vitamin A supplements associated with immunization campaigns. Less progress was achieved in the control of iron deficiency. The challenge now is to move forward with interventions that are sustainable within the context of vulnerable communities, which possibly include applied biotechnology to enhance yields and micronutrient contents of staple foods. Scientific progress and political commitment are key factors, but consumer and public acceptance is key to sustainable progress. Achieving public confidence requires increased partnerships among scientists, policymakers, community leaders and consumers in the decision-making processes.

AB More than 9 million neonatal deaths occur each year, 98% of them in developing countries. Neonatal deaths account for two-thirds of deaths in infancy and 40% of deaths before age 5 y. The major direct causes of neonatal death are infections, preterm delivery and asphyxia. Important indirect causes include low birth weight and hypothermia. The present body of work on multiple micronutrient interventions is not sufficient for us to draw conclusions on their effects on neonatal well-being. Because studies have generally concentrated on single micronutrients and a range of outcomes, this paper reviews the findings for individual nutrients and then summarizes the situation. The evidence for the contribution of micronutrient deficiencies to perinatal mortality and duration of gestation is limited, and the evidence base for individual micronutrient effects on neonatal mortality and morbidity is patchy. To translate knowledge into policy, community evaluations of effect and an expanded evidence base that includes affordability, acceptability and scalability are also required. A balance between supply-side and demand-side interventions must be struck, with an emphasis on effect and sustainability. Among the key requirements are randomized, controlled community effectiveness trials of the effect of micronutrient supplementation in pregnancy on perinatal mortality and neurodevelopment, studies on improving adherence and studies on the relation between micronutrient deficiencies and sepsis and neonatal encephalopathy. It would also be helpful to look at mechanisms for bringing the periconceptional period within the ambit of trials.

DE culture; heritage; conservation; tourism; sustainability
AB A conflict between the preservation of the character of existing historic towns and "change" has formed the central argument for conservation. More recently, heritage has superseded conservation, where marketing of heritage as a product according to the demands of the consumer, mainly tourists, has resulted in the commercialisation of heritage over conservation values. Today, the symbiosis of both tourism and heritage places has become a major objective in the management and planning of historic areas. This article examines the current conflicts among the ideas of conservation, heritage, and tourism and argues for a sustainable approach to the management and planning of heritage places based on a community and culture-led agenda.

DE green chemistry; environmental burden; risk management; human health;
   energy consumption; resource consumption
AB Green is a concept to express the degree of environmental burden caused by a product or service. Environmental burden is usually evaluated by 3 factors, i.e., by the bad effects on human health, by the bad effects on ecosystem and by the effects on depletion of energy and resources. This implies that it is necessary to have an integrated system with combined concept of life cycle assessment and risk assessment, but current methods/systems are far from perfect and new methods must be created by further efforts.
   Two kinds of criteria were used to evaluate technological/scientific values in Green & Sustainable Chemistry Awards in Japan; (1) an LCA like method to express lower burden on environment, (2) reduction of the use of highly hazardous substances.

AB There is a growing demand for the saving of fossil resources and the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions with the aim of promoting society that is capable of sustainable development. In the area of developing materials as well as in other areas of activities, various efforts are being made for that objective in the aspects of raw materials, manufacturing technology, and disposal of materials after use. Bio-based polymers are attracting attention because of its important role in switching the raw materials from exhaustible resources to annually renewable resources.
   Polylactic acid has two characteristics. One is that the raw material lactic acid is produced by fermenting starch and saccharides that are derived from various biomass. The other is polylactic acid is biodegradable slowly in the environment and rapidly in compost.
   This paper introduces polylactic acid as bio-based polymers from the perspective of its life cycle contributing to the saving of fossil resources and the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. This paper also describes a polylactic acid manufacturing process which is typified by ring opening polymerization and direct polycondensation and discusses the issues to be addressed for the growth of the market for the material.

AB A survey was mailed to a representative, randomly selected sample of Minnesota Dietetic Association members (n=300) to evaluate attitudes and intentions regarding the integration of issues pertaining to sustainably produced foods into professional practice. The United States Department of Agriculture describes sustainable agriculture as including goals of farm profitability, environmental stewardship, and improved rural quality of life. Data analysis included descriptive statistics, independent t tests, one-way ANOVA, correlations, and multiple regression analyses (Pless than or equal to.05). Forty-three percent had heard of sustainable agriculture, 13% had integrated issues of sustainably produced foods into their practice, and 20% stated that it was likely that they would incorporate these issues within the next six months. Perceived behavioral control, subjective norm, and rated importance of knowing about agricultural practices independently predicted intention. Dietitians surveyed were interested in learning more, but most were not integrating these issues into practice because of perceived barriers, including a lack of knowledge about this topic.

AB The treatment of pelts with aqueous solutions of alkali silicates, followed by neutralization, stabilizes them Sufficiently for shaving, and so (nearly) native shavings will be obtained. In addition, the application of these silicates improves the exhaustion of later added auxiliaries, especially of chrome tannins.
   The native shavings can be either composted or utilizable in various ways. This will help the tanners to cope with increasing (European) requirements on disposability of solid wastes. Based on the new experiences, general ideas for improved sustainability are given.

AB A comparative 'best practicable environmental option' assessment of fourteen potential sewage-sludge treatment processes and disposal options was undertaken to support the development of Thames Water sewage-sludge strategy. The assessment was generic in nature and designed to provide comparative performance data on a range of potential process options forming the basis for subsequent site-specific assessments. The study assessed: the relative technical practicability of each process option; the discounted costs of each option (including necessary environmental-mitigation measures); environmental sustainability; and environmental nuisance. The assessment was quantitative wherever possible.
   The paper (a) describes the evaluation process, (b) highlights some weaknesses and strengths of the technique, and (c) demonstrates that the technique should form an essential first step in the development of any sludge treatment and disposal strategy.

AB There is increasing interest in reclaiming tyres for use in bank-side and coastal-protection structures. However, concern has been expressed about the potential for tyres to release pollutants into the environment and to retain their long-term structural stability. This paper describes laboratory leaching tests for heavy metals from new used tyres and tyres which have been exposed to an aquatic environment for thirteen years. The results show that the limiting factor to their use could be cadmium release. Tests found evidence of the loss of ultraviolet screening agents such as carbon black, suggesting that chemical breakdown of the tyre through leaching of vulcanising chemicals is more significant in the physical breakdown of the tyre, than the reverse. Three case studies of tyre flood-protection and river-control structures are presented, which examine the ability of tyres to retain structural integrity over long periods. Based on this evidence, guidance on design principles is offered. It is concluded that tyres can be used sustainably in a river or coastal environment, subject to careful consideration of local site conditions.

AB Based on the Nash equilibrium evolving in an extensive-form, not a normal-form game, it is found that virulence reduction of ?, and skill improvement of lambda coli is a reasonable outcome of direct temperature induction of bacteriophage lambdaQ(-)-mutant in Escherichia coli. This cooperative situation evolved as the Nash equilibrium is basically considered as a long-term sustainable development strategy for species coexistence. A host demands a lambda-free environment by skill improvement for normal growth. Meanwhile, lambda chooses a less virulent strategy to maintain host viability for the sake of its survival. Virulence reduction of lambda enhances the coexistence of lambda and E coli; thus, moderate induction results. This strategic game obviously clarifies certain hypothesized results shown in previous works.

AB Let F : C-k --> Ck be a dynamical system and let {x(n)}(ngreater than or equal to0) denote an orbit of F We study the relation between {x(n)} and pseudoorbits {y(n)}, y(0) = x(0). Here y(n+1) = F(y(n)) + s(n). In general y(n) might diverge away from x.. Our main problem is whether there exists arbitrarily small t(n) so that if (y) over tilde (n+1) = F((y) over tilde (n)) + s(n) + t(n), then (y) over tilde (n) remains close to x(n). This leads naturally to the concept of sustainable orbits, and their existence seems to be closely related to the concept of hyperbolicity, although they are not in general equivalent.

AB In the Sudano-Sahelian zones of West Africa, cultivated land is degraded due to reduced fallow periods and Striga hermonthica (Del.) Benth. infestation, and poses a serious threat to sustainable food production. To provide options for addressing these problems, we investigated the possibility of replacing the short fallow periods with food legume cultivation. We tested this in two farming communities within the Sudan savannah zone of Ghana. In the 1997 and 1998 cropping seasons, selected farmers within each community planted soybean [Glycine max. (L.) Merr.] or bambara groundnuts [Vigna subterranea (L.) Verdc.] on continuously cropped, Striga-infested farmlands, whereas lands that were maintained under two or three years of bush fallowing were planted to millet [Pennisetum glaucum (L.) R. Br.] or sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench]. Analysis of soil sampled from 0-15 cm (plough layer) revealed that contents of major plant nutrients were inadequate to support long-term crop production. Within each fanning community, total nitrogen content at initial sampling showed significant negative correlation with the number of Striga seeds in the plough layer. Under legume cultivation, soil organic carbon content increased and the number of Striga seeds per square metre decreased in both communities from a mean value of 28 183 seeds m(-2) to 8 185 seeds m(-2). Under cereal cultivation Striga seed density increased from 9383 seeds m(-2) to 16 696 seeds m(-2). The study provides evidence that introduction of food legume cultivation on farmlands with high S. hermonthica infestation as an alternative to bush fallow system could help achieve sustainable crop production in the Sudan savannah zones of sub-Saharan Africa.

AB Chenopodium album L. plants grown in continuously cultivated and in nondisturbed soils were compared in terms of the compositions of nonpolar extracts of the corresponding aerial parts. Both light petroleum ether extracts of C., album L. were analyzed by high-performance thin-layer LC, capillary GC, and capillary GC-EI-MS. Further percolation and medium-pressure LC, along with EI-MS analysis, permitted the separation and identification of the chemical constituents. Differences were observed between mean contents of the chemical constituents of C. album L., with respect to nonpolar extracts, obtained from continuously cultivated and from nondisturbed soils, in particular in linear and branched long-chain hydrocarbons, FA and their esters, and long-chain linear alcohols and aldehydes. The most remarkable features of the disturbed soils were a pronounced increase in the amounts of linear hydrocarbons and a decrease in the relative proportions of FA. Paper no.

AB Genetic selection for resistance to Haemonchus contortus, an experimental vaccine and protein supplementation were compared with a strategic anthelmintic drenching program in a factorial grazing experiment to determine their effect on nematode faecal egg count (FEC) of young Merino sheep. Averaged over a 224-day period, FECs were reduced 69% by genetic selection (P < 0.001), 35% by protein supplementation (P < 0.001), 28% by drenching (P < 0.01) and were unaffected by vaccination. FECs in undrenched selected sheep were lower than strategically drenched unselected sheep. Liveweight gain was decreased by vaccination (13%, P < 0.05) and increased by supplementation (44%, P < 0.001). Fleece traits were significantly different (P < 0.01) between the two genotypes with the selected line having a lower fibre diameter (0.6 mum, P < 0.01) and producing 9% less clean wool than the random line (P < 0.001). Supplemented animals grew more clean wool (17%, P < 0.001) with a broader fibre diameter (1.1 mum, P < 0.001). No important interactions between the various treatments were detected. Monitor sheep, run in the plots after the termination of the experiment, had significantly lower FECs (P < 0.001) when run in plots previously grazed by supplemented sheep and selected sheep (on average 35% and 46% lower, respectively, compared to plots previously grazed by unsupplemented and random sheep). The results indicate that the largest and most persistent effect on FEC in the host, and worm contamination on pasture, was achieved by genetic selection. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Continuous cultures of Chaetoceros muelleri and Isochrysis galbana were grown outdoors in flat plate-glass reactors in which light-path length (LPL) varied from 5 to 30 cm. High daily productivity (13 to 16 g cell mass per square meter of irradiated reactor surface) for long periods of time was obtained in reactors in which the optical path as well as cell density were optimized. 'Twenty centimeters was the optimal LPL, yielding the highest areal productivity of cell mass (g m(-2) d(-1)), eicosapentaenoic acid, and docosahexaenoic acid, which was identical with that previously found for polysaccharide production of Porphyridium and not far from the optimal LPL affecting maximal productivity in Nannochloropsis species. Relating the energy impinging on a given reactor surface area to the appropriate number of cells showed that the most efficient light dose per cell, obtained with the 20-cm LPL reactor, was approximately 2.5 times lower than the light dose available per cell in the 5-cm LPL reactor, in which a significant decline in areal cell density accompanied the lowest areal output of cell mass. The most effective harvesting regimen was in the range of 10% to 15% of culture volume harvested daily and replaced with fresh growth medium, resulting in a sustainable culture density of 24 x 106 and 28 x 106 cells/ml of C. muelleri and L galbana, respectively.

AB The failure of modern fisheries management is blamed on myriad socio-economic and technical problems, but the most fundamental reason for failure might be the overwhelming dominance of extractive interests in participatory decision-making venues. In the United States, commercial fishing interests made up 49% of appointed voting members of the eight Regional Fishery Management Councils between 1990 and 2001; recreational fishing interests made up 33%, and all other interests combined made up 17%. Dominance of commercial fishing representation over the 'other' group was statistically significant, and this unequal apportionment 4 interests remained statistically stable throughout the 12 years of reporting. Contemporary economic sensibilities within this 'industry-captured' regulatory process generate perverse incentives for management decisions that conflict with, and can undermine, national sustainability goals and standards, even when those standards are logically sound and agreed to by consensus. Positive feedbacks in the system reinforce the unequal representation of interests. The relative dominance of these interests can be adjusted through an experiment that legally mandates an apportionment formula designed to optimize the welfare and interests of the general public, thus testing the notion,that increasing the relative representation of general public interests would improve the lacklustre performance of US federal fisheries management.

TI Ectopic expression of the spike protein of Rice Ragged Stunt Oryzavirus
   in transgenic rice plants inhibits transmission of the virus to insects
SO MOLECULAR BREEDING
LA English
DT Article
DE RRSV; transgenic rice; vector transmission; viral spike protein
ID GENES
AB Rice ragged stunt oryzavirus (RRSV) replicates in both its insect vector, Nilaparvata lugens, and its plant host, rice, and has a complex multi-component particle bearing spikes on its outer surface. Transgenic rice lines expressing the 39 kDa spike protein showed good resistance to infection by RRSV. Furthermore, N. lugens fed on these plants prior to feeding on RRSV-infected plants were significantly protected against RRSV infection. The viral titre in insects initially fed on transgenic plants and then on RRSV-infected plants was inversely proportional to the levels of the 39 kDa protein expressed in the transgenic plants. This suggests that the 39 kDa protein interferes with the interaction between the intact virus particles and insect cell receptors and that the spike protein of RRSV contributes to vector specificity. This approach would probably be a more environment-friendly and sustainable method of virus control than by actual eradication of insect vectors.

TI Conflicting innovations: A problem for sustainable development of New
   Zealand high-country grasslands
SO MOUNTAIN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB As elsewhere in the world, agencies of local and central government in New Zealand have renewed pressure on high-country pastoral farmers to ensure that their land use is sustainable. However, government policy innovations for conservation have often cut across the path along which farmers were innovating toward sustainable development (Figure 1). Sustained consultation in some parts of the world has revealed that highland people were not short of practical wisdom or ideals of conservation and sustainability. Such deep sharing of understanding and values affected an earlier New Zealand high-country crisis over soil erosion, but it is not yet evident in a current crisis over new policy for conservation of indigenous biodiversity and recreational access. As a result, progress toward sustainable development is retarded with polarized public debate between stereotypes of public conservation and private economic development. New Zealand needs to find new ways out of this impasse.

TI Managing and conserving Southern African grasslands with high endemism -
   The Maloti-Drakensberg Transfrontier Conservation Development Program
SO MOUNTAIN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB The Maloti-Drakensberg bioregion is the highest part of the southern African grassland biome shared by the Kingdom of Lesotho and South Africa. This bioregion is dominated by the Maloti-Drakensberg mountain range, which forms the eastern boundary between Lesotho and 3 of South Africa's provinces, namely, the Orange Free State, Kwa-Zulu/Natal, and the Eastern Cape. The combination of topographical, geological, altitudinal, and climatic variations has resulted in a dramatic landscape characterized by extraordinary natural beauty and rich biodiversity. Although the alpine and subalpine grassland vegetation types in the region are relatively well conserved in relation to other grassland types in the biome, they have been severely affected by a combination of injudicious range management regimes, the spread of alien plants, the establishment of agricultural monocultures, poor infrastructure development and maintenance and the political engineering of human demographics. Because these grasslands form the most important component of the bioregion's ecosystems and related services such as maintenance of water catchment integrity, it is critical to derive innovative strategies that ensure sustainable solutions to the problems affecting them. The Maloti-Drakensberg Transfrontier Conservation and Development Program seeks to find natural resource and conservation management solutions by integrating biodiversity conservation and socioeconomic growth strategies.

TI Sustainable pasture management in Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan: Development
   needs and recommendations
SO MOUNTAIN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB For many centuries, (semi-) nomadic pastoralists used pasture areas in the Tien Shan and Pamir mountains. Under Soviet rule, sedentarization began in the 1930s and collective farms replaced socioeconomic units based on kinship. Soviet land use was monofunctional and dependent on high levels of inputs such as chemical fertilizers, machinery, concentrated feed, and subsidies and was neither ecologically sustainable nor economically viable. In the process of political and economic transformation after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, state farms have been dismantled, land and livestock privatized, and specialized employees such as technicians have suddenly become independent farmers. Today, large farms and herds no longer exist, having been replaced by a multitude of small household enterprises. Each household's socioeconomic situation is unique, and so are household livelihood strategies. Activities focusing on sustainable development and sustainable pasture management must therefore take account of this new socioeconomic situation.

TI Grassland rehabilitation and social developement in the low mountain
   area of the Jinsha River Valley, China
SO MOUNTAIN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB Grassland degradation has become a serious environment problem in semiarid areas, where it is responsible for land degradation and declines in livestock production. China has about 4,000,000 km(2) of grassland (cao di, ie, any land that is not classified as "forest," "cultivated land," or "no vegetation"), accounting for 40% of its total area, mainly in the middle and western parts of the country, where the economy is relatively underdeveloped. One third of the grassland in China is degraded, and degradation continues at the dramatic rate of 6700 km(2) per year. This has hindered animal husbandry development and social development in pastoral areas. Grassland rehabilitation has now become an urgent risk of local economic development in western China. The Jinsha River valley (Yunnan Province), a main source of sediment for the Yangtze River, is characteristic of fragile ecosystems in western China. In this area, the primary development problems involve conflicts between ecological rehabilitation (especially restoration of grassland) and grazing. Serious degradation of soil and vegetation on account of the fragility is the result of both natural fluctuation and human intervention. To maintain social and economic sustainability, countermeasures are needed as quickly as possible.

TI Silvopastoralism in Turkey's mountainous Mediterranean Region
SO MOUNTAIN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB Grasslands and forests are degraded in Turkey's Mediterranean Region (TMR), the center of the widespread traditional Yoruk silvopastoral system. Government efforts to halt degradation focus on afforestation, a policy that reduces the amount of land available to the Yoruks for their traditional livelihood system, which is further endangered by socioeconomic dynamics subject to the pressures of globalization. This silvopastoral system is examined with respect to policies that affect it and its potential for sustainability, with a view to regional community development. Interaction between this regional system, a component of traditional culture in the TMR, and current trends in globalization are noted, and the need for harmony between silvopastoralism and forestry is examined.

DE grazing; vegetation; household livelihoods; Tarija altiplano; Bolivia
ID PERU; COMMUNITIES; DYNAMICS; STEPPE; EVENTS; ANDES
AB The state of the physical environment is reviewed and the importance of grazing in complex rural livelihoods is assessed in the hitherto little studied Tarija altiplano, Bolivia. Past and contemporary climatic fluctuations have dominated environmental change and are reflected in landforms, soils, vegetation, and land use. Broad fluctuations of dry and wet phases, 200-500 years long, occurred between BC 1500 and the 19th century. Warming has taken place during the 20th century, the final decades characterized by sharp climatic fluctuations (drought and floods) typical of the El Nino southern oscillation. Grazing by sheep and cattle-introduced by Europeans 500 years ago-has affected vegetation, but current grazing pressure alone does not explain the differences in biomass. In most of the areas grazed, present-day herds appear not to affect the quality of the vegetation any more than during the past 500 years. The term overgrazing is misleading, given the complexity of vegetation changes. Transhumance, shareherding, rotations, and the use of microenvironments (bofedales and marshland) ensure optimum recovery of pastures. Given access to other pastures at times of climatic stress, as well as seasonal migration, existing resource use appears ecologically sustainable. It is uncertain whether the security offered by pastoralism will meet the rising livelihood expectations of the young.

AB The consequences of tourist growth on extensive livestock farming were studied in a valley in the Spanish Central Pyrenees (Upper Esera), characterized by important growth in tourist activity during the last 3 decades. The municipalities with the greatest tourist development experienced the biggest drop in livestock farming (abandonment of cultivated land, decrease in livestock population and farms) because of the competition of tourism for labor and fertile land, which are essential to the maintenance of extensive livestock farming. Low use of pasture resources leads to their progressive loss, owing to the advance of plant succession (substitution of pastures by shrubs), decreasing landscape diversity, and increased fire hazard and soil erosion. We conclude that the current model of tourist development in the Spanish Pyrenees represents serious problems in terms of sustainable development.

   Himalayas; Nepal
AB As a follow-up to the International Year of Ecotourism (IYE 2002) and the International Year of Mountains (IYM 2002), scholars and practitioners need to continue to address the challenges inherent in building pilgrim tourism on principles of sustainable tourism that reconcile cultural, developmental, conservational, and commercial interests. This article begins by reasoning that the increasing use of mechanical transport to pilgrim sites in the Central Himalayas erodes the cultural notions that have underpinned the Himalayan pilgrimage for centuries. Then, it seeks to demonstrate in two respects the relevance of insights into how sacred journeying interconnects persons, places, and time. The first insight concerns the travel patterns of and income potential from pleasure and pilgrim tourists in Nepal in the current situation of unstable national and international security. The second insight relates to local perceptions of sociocultural, economic, and environmental risks involved in the opening of cable car service to a famed pilgrimage site in Nepal. Finally, the article reasons that the cultural dimension must be included as a crosscutting concern in environmental, social, and economic impact assessments of transport projects to heritage sites. The study uses a combination of qualitative ethnographic methods, traffic and sociodemographic surveys, as well as official tourism statistics.

AB Situations of water scarcity challenge sustainability and threaten small users' access to water. In response to this problem, there has been a search for a method of hydrological analysis that can better represent the needs of small water users. While this search is rooted in the debate favouring a more participatory and inclusive allocation of the resource, it also requires a new focus on smallholder hydrology that can confront the gaps and biases found in current hydrological practices in many countries. This article looks at past hydrological practices and also at results of recent studies, highlighting the perspective of smallholder irrigators in surface water planning in Zimbabwe, and groundwater planning in India. These case studies show that wider social forces, not always best science, drive hydrological practices. However, new frameworks focusing on the water user can emerge for more equitable and sustainable water management.

ID ETHIOPIA; IMPACTS; PEOPLE
AB Wetlands are critical natural resources in developing countries where they perform a range of environmental functions and provide numerous socio-economic benefits to local communities and a wider population. In recent years, however, many wetlands throughout eastern Africa have come under extreme pressure as government policies, socio-economic change and population pressure have stimulated a need for more agriculturally productive land. Although wetland drainage and cultivation can make a key contribution to food and livelihood security in the short term, in the long term there are concerns over the sustainability of this utilization and the maintenance of wetland benefits. This article draws upon recent research carried out in western Ethiopia, which addressed the sustainability of wetland agriculture in an area of increasing food insecurity and population pressure. It discusses the impacts of drainage and cultivation on wetland hydrology and draws attention to local wetland management strategies, particularly those characterized by multiple use of wetlands, where agriculture exists alongside other wetland uses. The article suggests that where multiple wetland uses exist, a range of benefits can be sustained with little evidence of environmental degradation. Ways of promoting and empowering such sustainable wetland management systems are discussed in the context of the wider need for water security throughout the region.

DT Article
AB In Kharga Oasis (Western Desert, Egypt),,the most extensively developed oasis since 1960, groundwater is extracted from the Nubian Sandstone Aquifer, one of the largest groundwater systems in Sahara Desert. To assess the sustainability of the present and future groundwater extraction for the large-scale development projects in southwestern Egypt, a regional-scale groundwater flow model with a telescoping mesh was accomplished. Based on the hydrogeological data of more than six hundred wells, the results of the steady-state simulation indicate that recent groundwater formation in the Nubian Sandstone Aquifer of Egypt is impossible. A refined grid and a groundwater flow simulation for the coming hundred years suggest that there is no real danger of groundwater depletion. However, the problem of the increasing depth to the water-table due to the drawdown in the potentiometric surfaces will become more serious in the future.

AB Sustainable forest production demands a continuous supply of high quality seeds for the production of seedlings in the nursery or for direct sowing. Here, we demonstrated the potential of near infrared spectroscopy as a rapid technique to discriminate viable and empty seeds of Pinus patula Schiede & Deppe. Near infrared spectra were collected from single seeds in transmittance and reflectance modes. To discriminate viable and empty seeds, multivariate classification models were developed with partial least squares (PLS) regression using the digitized spectra as a regressor and a y-vector of artificial values (1 for viable and 21 for empty seeds) as a regressand. Viable and empty seeds were perfectly distinguished by PLS models computed on full and selected transmittance spectroscopy data, while those derived from 'full' NIR reflectance spectra recognized 96 % of viable and 88 % of empty seeds. Analyses made on selected NIR reflectance spectra improved the classification rate of empty seeds to 100%. Difference spectra and PLS weights indicated that the origin of spectral differences between viable and empty seeds was attributed to differences in fatty acids and proteins that were totally absent in empty seeds. The result shows the prospect of developing rapid. filter-based sorting equipment that can easily be automated.

TI Targets and limits for management of fisheries: A simple
   probability-based approach
SO NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB Precautionary fishery management requires that a distinction be made between target and limit reference points. We present a simple probability framework for deriving a target reference point for the fishing mortality rate (F) or biomass (B) from the corresponding limit reference point. Our framework is a generalization of one devised previously by Caddy and McGarvey (1996). Both methods require an a priori management decision on the allowable probability of exceeding the limit reference point; our method removes a major assumption by accounting for the uncertainty in the limit reference point. We present the theory underlying the method, an algorithm for solution, and examples of its application. The new procedure, like the old, requires an estimate of the implementation uncertainty expected in the following year's management, an estimate that might be obtained by a review of the effectiveness of past management actions. Either method can be implemented easily on a modern desktop computer. Our generalized framework is more complete, and we believe that it has wide applicability in the use of fishery reference points or, for that matter, in other conservation applications that strive for resource sustainability.

SO NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT

ID RECRUITMENT; ENVIRONMENT; MODEL; YIELD; GULF
AB Penaeid shrimp culture in Iran depends on a supply of spawners from the sea for seed production. The inadequate stock of wild Indian white shrimp Penaeus indicus spawners for hatcheries is a bottleneck to the development of Iran's shrimp culture. The aim of this paper is to test the influence of rainfall on the spawner population and to determine the maximum sustainable and economic yields for the harvest of spawners. Surplus production bioeconomic models (Schaefer 1954 and Fox 1970) with and without rainfall effects were used and the parameters estimated from pooled time series and cross-sectional data on catch per unit effort (CPUE; spawners per day). It was found that the models with rainfall effects provided better fits to the data than those without that variable. Rainfall had significant and positive effects on CPUE and optimum catch. Based on econometric criteria, the Schaefer model with rainfall was preferred. With that model, the estimated maximum economic yield of wild Indian white shrimp spawners was 25,449 with rainfall and 15,963 without rainfall. These results mean that the allowable catch of such spawners may be adjusted annually based on the rainfall prior to the shrimping season.

AB The European Common Agricultural Policy is shifting on increasing part of the subsidies to eco-conditionality. Henceforth, it becomes essential to evaluate the environmental effect of agricultural practices, and more generally performances of cropping and forming systems, in order to design and to develop more sustainable systems. This assessment is being implemented for the main cropping systems of some French regions, using environmental indicators. Eleven exposure indicators were chosen in order to represent a wide range of specific sustainability objectives dealing with water, soil, air, non-renewable resources, biodiversity, and landscape, The results present the sustainability assessment for the crop rotations of Champagne Berrichonne region in the Centre of France.

AB Nitrogen (N) has been gradually depleted from West African soils and now poses serious threats to food production. Many ways of increasing N supply ( e. g. judicious use of inorganic fertilizers and nitrogen-fixing plants) have been tried in West African farming systems. Herbaceous and woody legumes commonly contribute 40 - 70 kg N ha(-1) season. This represents about 30% of the total N applied as residues. Nevertheless and despite repeated demonstrations of the usefulness of green manures in enhancing soil fertility, their practices and adoption are still limited. Promiscuous soyabeans are being used to develop sustainable cropping systems in the moist savannah. Reliable estimates of N-2 fixed by soyabeans and their residual N benefits to subsequent cereal crops in the savannah zone of southern Guinea have only infrequently been made. The actual amounts measured varied between 38 and 126 kg N ha(-1) assuming that only seeds of soyabeans are removed from the plots, the net N accrual of soil nitrogen ranges between minus 8 kg N ha(-1) and plus 47 kg N ha(-1) depending on the soyabean cultivar. Residual soyabean N values of 10 - 24 kg N ha(-1) (14 - 36% of the total N in maize) were obtained in a soyabean-maize rotation. Although cereal yields following legume cultivation have been attributed to greater N accumulation, our data show that the relative increase in maize N was smaller than the relative increase in dry-matter yield. Hence, the increased yields of maize following soybeans are not entirely due to the carry-over of N from soyabean residues ( as well as to conservation of soil N) but to other rotational effects as well. It is thus clear that the Nbenefit of grain legumes to non-legumes is small compared to the level of N fertilizer use in more intensive cereal production systems but is nevertheless significant in the context of the low amounts of input in subsistence farming.

AB Whether grown as pulses for grain, as green manure, as pastures or as the tree components of agro-forestry systems, the value of leguminous crops lies in their ability to fix atmospheric N-2, so reducing the use of expensive fertiliser-N and enhancing soil fertility. N-2 fixing legumes provide the basis for developing sustainable farming systems that incorporate integrated nutrient management. By exploiting the stable nitrogen isotope N-15, it has been possible to reliably measure rates of N-2 fixation in a wide range of agro-ecological field situations involving many leguminous species. The accumulated data demonstrate that there is a wealth of genetic diversity among legumes and their Rhizobium symbionts which can be used to enhance N-2 fixation. Practical agronomic and microbiological means to maximise N inputs by legumes have also been identified.

AB Asymbiotic, associative or symbiotic biological N-2 fixation (BNF), is a free and renewable resource, which should constitute an integral part of sustainable agro-ecosystems. Yet there has been a rapid increase in use of fertiliser N and a parallel decline in the cultivation of leguminous plants and BNF, especially in the developed world. Fertilisers have boosted crop yields, but intensive agricultural systems have increasingly negative effects on the atmospheric and aquatic environments. BNF, either alone or in combination with fertilisers and animal manures, may prove to be a better solution to supply nitrogen to the cropping systems of the future. This review focuses on the potential benefit of BNF on the environment especially on soil acidification, rhizosphere processes and plant CO2 fixation. As fertiliser N has supplanted BNF in agriculture the re-substitution of BNF is considered. What is the consequence of fertiliser N production on energy use? The effect of fertiliser use on the release of the greenhouse gas CO2 is estimated at approximately 1% of the global anthropogenic emission of CO2. The role of BNF on nitrogen cycling, ammonia volatilisation, N2O emission and NO3 leaching suggests that BNF is less likely than fertilisers to cause losses during pre-cropping and cropping. Sometimes however the post-harvest losses may be greater, due to the special qualities of legume residues. Nevertheless, legumes provide other 'ecological services' including improved soil structure, erosion protection and greater biological diversity.

AB Can commonly-eaten food staple crops be developed that fortify their seeds with essential minerals and vitamins? Can farmers be induced to grow such varieties? If so, would this result in a marked improvement in human nutrition at a lower cost than existing nutrition interventions? An interdisciplinary international effort is underway to breed for mineral- and vitamin-dense varieties of rice, wheat, maize, beans and cassava for release to farmers in developing countries. The biofortification strategy seeks to take advantage of the consistent daily consumption of large amounts of food staples by all family members, including women and children as they are most at risk for micronutrient malnutrition. As a consequence of the predominance of food staples in the diets of the poor, this strategy implicitly targets low-income households. After the one-time investment is made to develop seeds that fortify themselves, recurrent costs are low and germplasm may be shared internationally. It is this multiplier aspect of plant breeding across time and distance that makes it so cost-effective. Once in place, the biofortified crop system is highly sustainable. Nutritionally-improved varieties will continue to be grown and consumed year after year, even if government attention and international funding for micronutrient issues fades. Biofortification provides a truly feasible means of reaching malnourished populations in relatively remote rural areas, delivering naturally-fortified foods to population groups with limited access to commercially-marketed fortified foods that are more readily available in urban areas. Biofortification and commercial fortification are, therefore, highly complementary. Breeding for higher trace mineral density in seeds will not incur a yield penalty. Mineral-packed seeds sell themselves to farmers because, as recent research has shown, these trace minerals are essential in helping plants resist disease and other environmental stresses. More seedlings survive and initial growth is more rapid. Ultimately, yields are higher, particularly in trace mineral-'deficient' soils in arid regions.

AB Major problems facing modern society include the provision of energy and means for waste disposal with the minimum generation of pollution and secondary wastes. Sustainable cities require the recovery of energy from that fraction of waste that cannot be economically reused or recycled. With up to 28 million tonnes of municipal solid waste having an average energy value of 10,000 kJ kg(-1) being generated in the UK annually, incineration of with energy recovery is seen as the best available option for the safe disposal of municipal waste. Current efficient waste management strategies are also aimed at reducing the amount of waste from municipal solid waste incinerator plants by processing ash from new plants to approach the target of zero net waste material output and reducing the pollutants in flue gases by end-of-pipe treatment. Although pollutants in flue gases can be reduced to practically any desired level, the economic and environmental costs should be justified. Our research activities at Sheffield University Waste Incineration Centre are focussed on cutting down the amount of waste produced by these plants in the form of ash, slag and air pollutants. Our aim is to develop efficient yet cost-effective waste, energy and pollution management strategies to assist the incineration industries to control and operate future energy plants in the most efficient way possible.

ID HUMANITY; FUTURE
AB Reviewing the concept of sustainable development in social discourse. This study originated as an investigation into what people mean by Sustainable Development. It attempted to discover the dimensions underlying the concept and to find out how these are modified by political beliefs or by ways of relating to nature. To achieve this aim, a content analysis was carried out to analyse 132 definitions of Sustainable Development. Within these definitions, 10 dimensions were observed, among which development and nature and the environment stood out. The study showed that there was a loss of elements among the interviewees with regard to the WCED definition. This suggests that there are communication problems, which affect the expression of what exactly is meant by the concept. Attitudes towards nature affect the way in which this concept is understood, and not the political beliefs of the participants.

TI Aligning incentives in the treatment of depression in primary care with

AB Deficits in the quality of treatment of depression in the primary care sector have been documented in multiple studies. Several clinical models for improving primary care treatment of depression have been shown to be cost-effective in recent years but have not proved to be sustainable over time, partly because of barriers created by common organizational and financing arrangements such as managed behavioral health care carve-outs and risk-based provider payment mechanisms. These arrangements, which often distort relative costs that primary care physicians face when making treatment decisions for patients who have depression, can steer these decisions away from evidence-based practice. Various changes, such as in contractual relationships, payment methods for primary care physicians, and performance measurement, can be made in existing institutional arrangements to better align them with emerging clinical technologies and evidence-based practice.

TI Governance conditions, roles and capacity building needs in the
   rebel-held areas of Southern Sudan
SO PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION AND DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB An assessment is made of the state of sustainable human development (SHD) and the institutions of governance that are in the process of being established in the rebel-held areas of Southern Sudan. The development roles of the main governance actors-government, civil society and the private sector-are examined and capacity-building needs are described. The importance of good leadership. institutionalised partnerships between government and national and international NGOs, and capacity building for transparency and accountability is stressed. Most pointedly, the risks of allowing governance practices, suited to the management of a liberation struggle, to spill over into the civil administration of a peaceful state are emphasised. The conditions necessary for the institutionalisation of sound governance practices are discussed. Of particular importance are a genuine desire on the part of the leadership to establish such conditions and a willingness on the part of external donors to address issues of accountability and transparency openly in collaboration with the leadership. The data are also suggestive of broad development strategies that address the bases of SHD and empowerment. These broad strategies are designed to improve the very low levels of health and education that exist in the Southern Sudan, and thereby empower people to engage in economic activity and in governance decision-snaking. Rehabilitation and maintenance of the physical infrastructure underlies all development activity. The findings highlight the governance difficulties faced by war-torn societies, the challenges facing post-crisis administrations and (confirming Caplan 2002) the need for such administrations to possess sufficient executive authority to be able to perform effectively in situations of 'pre-state, post-imperial chaos'. Most critical of all, however, is the genuine interest of the major powers in doing more than-when it suits them-extinguishing the flames of conflict or establishing acquiescent political regimes following the military pacification of 'rogue' or anarchic states. Effective post-crisis administration and development calls for much greater commitment of resources from the major powers than has been forthcoming to date, reflecting a belief among them that equitable and sustainable global development is the preferred route to the prevention of such crises.

TI Nurturing knowledge: The UK Higher Education Links scheme
SO PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION AND DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
ID NETWORK; TRUST
AB This article examines the development of academic networks and expertise through the UK Higher Education Links scheme, which is funded by the UK Department for International Development, managed by the British Council and supported by the principals of UK higher education institutions. The links are established between UK and overseas universities primarily to enhance research and/or teaching capacity, with the ultimate aim of alleviating poverty and promoting sustainable development. This article draws on data gathered for a large-scale, multiple-method evaluation which endorsed the scheme's continuation. It is argued that a crucial factor helping to make individual links a success was good relationships between respective co-ordinators, although the nature of these relationships varied. The article discusses the extent to which the formation of fruitful academic networks and partnerships enabling knowledge transfer were encouraged. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

AB This paper focuses on the assessment of the sustainability of transport technologies in terms of resource productivity. It proposes a concept that presents a firm base for quantification of material input on the one hand and generated transport service on the other hand. The concept of material input per unit of service (MIPS) is quantified in terms of the second law of thermodynamics, allowing the calculation of both resource input and service output in exergy terms. This exergetic material input per unit of service (EMIPS) has been elaborated for transport technology. The service not only takes into account the total mass to be transported and the total distance, but also the mass per single transport and the delivery time. The applicability of the EMIPS methodology has been illustrated by a case study comparing railway, truck and passenger car transport. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Soil and water losses by erosion were measured in forest ecosystems and were related to the calculated maximum tolerable soil losses. Main soil classes in the Coastal Plains of the region of Aracruz (ES) were studied, with the aim of obtaining indicators of management adequacy for this production system. The experimental plots were set on loamy/clayey Yellow Argisol (PA1), Haplic Plinthosol (FX), and moderately rocky Yellow Argisol (PA8). The slopes ranged from 2-8 %, 1-12 %, and 29-36 %, for each soil class. Three soil covers were studied of each soil class: eucalyptus trees, native forest, and bare soil. Soil and water losses under eucalyptus followed the order. PA8 > PA1 > FX. Water losses ranged from 970 mm, equivalent to 1-6 % of the total annual rainfall. Soil losses in the eucalyptus plots lay well below the calculated maximum tolerable soil losses in all soil classes, which indicates adequacy of management in this production system regarding water erosion. The fact that soil losses in eucalyptus were relatively close to those in native forest indicates the sustainability of the former environment regarding erosion.

AB Soil management affects the soil physical quality, but the magnitude of the changes is dependent of use time and regional edaphoclimatic conditions. The objective of this study was to evaluate the long-term (21 yr) effect of conventional tillage (CT) and no-tillage (NT) systems on some physical properties in the 0.2 m top layer of an Oxisol from Parana, southern Brazil. In comparison with an adjacent forest soil used as reference, the use of CT system increased the soil bulk density, penetrometer resistance and soil temperature; and decreased the mean geometric diameter of soil aggregates The main changes in soil attributes by using NT in comparison with CT were: decrease in soil bulk density in subsurface layer (0.1 - 0.2 m) from 1.08 to 0.99 Mg m(-3); decrease in maximum soil temperature in the 0-0.05 m layer from 27.9 to 24.7 degreesC, increase in mean geometric diameter of soil aggregates from 1.6 to 3.7 mm at 0-0.05 m layer, and increase in volumetric soil water content in the 0-0.1 m layer from 0.38 to 0.48 m(3) m(-3). However, there were no differences between effects of tillage systems on soil porosity (total, macro and microporosity), saturated hydraulic conductivity, penetrometer resistance, and clay flocculation degree. The amelioration of physical properties in no-tilled soil may be related to increases of 42% in soybean and 22% in corn yields in this conservation tillage system, in comparison with CT system.

AB This paper summarizes assumptions made and results obtained in parts of the literature on welfare and sustainability accounting. I consider five different assumptions that can be imposed independently of each other, producing 32 different combinations. This taxonomy is used to organize results in welfare and sustainability accounting. The analysis illustrates how stronger results require stronger assumptions and thereby impose harder informational requirements.

AB Conservationists have increasingly turned to ecotourism to provide local economic benefits while maintaining ecosystem integrity. Research conducted in Costa Rica to examine models linking conservation and development indicates ecotourism's effectiveness as a conservation strategy has been mixed. Where ecotourism offers a viable economic alternative, tourism opportunities have induced people to abandon cultivated land, allowing forests to regenerate. Employmente in tourism, however, reveals minimal influence on conservation perspectives. Other factors, including indirect tourism benefits and education levels, show stronger associations with conservation behaviors and perspectives. Results also indicate ecotourism might be most effective as a component of a broader conservation strategy.

AB In most treatments of social justice, little consideration is given to spatial concerns. However, it is increasingly evident that spatial or territorial factors play a major role in determining life chances and in helping to deliver social inclusion. This paper considers the key theoretical issues that underpin the spatial dimension of social justice. From this, the paper progresses to examining the factors that have influenced the introduction of sociospatial development as a component part of the adoption of the sustainable development paradigm. Illustrations are provided of the outcome of this new model including the construction of the European Spatial Development Perspective and the introduction of Community Planning in Scotland. A final section looks forward to the wider adoption of a sociospatial approach to policy development and implementation.

ID MANAGEMENT
AB Multiobjective fuzzy linear programming (MOFLP) irrigation planning model is formulated for the evaluation of management strategy for the case study of Jayakwadi irrigation project, Maharashtra, India. Three conflicting objectives net benefits, agricultural production and labour employment are considered in the irrigation planning scenario. All three criteria are to be maximised and the last two are sustainability related. All three objective functions are quantified by linear membership functions in a fuzzy multi objective framework. It is observed from MOFLP solution that net benefits, agricultural production and labour employment are 2.031 x 10(9) Rupees, 2.1186 x 10(6) tons, 3.5858 x 10(7) man-days respectively with degree of truth (lambda) 0.5715. Analysis of results indicated that net benefits, agricultural production, labour employment have decreased by 4.13, 5.39 and 3.4% as compared to ideal values in the crisp linear programming (LP) model.

AB This research describes a framework and case study application that merges fuzzy set methods, pollution prevention, and sustainable production concepts. There is a direct linkage between industrial pollution prevention, sustainability, and the solution of large-scale environmental problems. This linkage stems from the inherent desire for economic production, while at the same time protecting the environment from further degradation. The methodology combines systems analysis under imprecise conditions with a life cycle assessment method that is able to accept imprecise data. Analysis of systems under imprecise conditions is accomplished through analysis of process flow diagrams using fuzzy set techniques. Introduction of imprecision into life cycle assessment is accomplished by integration of fuzzy set approaches into a decision support system utilizing multiple criteria decision making. The framework is described and a case study application of an industrial parts cleaning system using an open top vapor degreaser is presented. Results of applying the method show that: (1) It is well suited for analysis of complex systems in which input data is sparse and expensive to collect. (2) The proposed framework includes a decision support system that is able to consider life cycle assessment concepts, and is able to reconcile differing opinions on available options for modification of production systems, thereby leading to more sustainable solutions.

TI New Zealand fisheries management: Changes in property rights structure
   and implications for sustainability
SO SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB Participation in the New Zealand fishing industry exists on two levels: quota holding and quota ownership. This study is motivated by the desire to establish whether changes in the number and concentration of quota ownerships and quota holdings have had any impact on the sustainability of fishery in New Zealand.
   Of the 294 marine species commercially harvested in New Zealand the top 15 by volume and/or value are considered in this paper. Findings indicate that quota ownership and holding have become more concentrated since the inception of the individual transferable quota (ITQ) regime, with the concentration ratios CR4, CR10 and CR20 all increasing. This suggests that the introduction of the ITQ has not encouraged the entry of new market participants; rather the industry has moved toward a single ownership model.
   Second, this paper establishes trends in the level of total allocable commercial catch (TACC) over the study period (August 1986-june 2000). Findings suggest that, with one or two interesting exceptions, catch levels have remained remarkably constant. Prima facie, there appears to have been no adverse impact from structural change on the overall resource sustainability based on TACC. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.

TI Social consequences of mining and present day solutions - Region II in
   Chile highlighted
SO SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB Chile has been a highly successful mining country for over two centuries. Huge sums of money are generated but only a small proportion of the revenue is being directed back into the region whose natural resources are being depleted. Mining companies may not be in control of the way central government spends these funds but they have a responsibility towards the communities they impact. The environmental problems associated with mining practices have attracted most attention but the impact on the communities is proving to be a far greater challenge. This paper focuses on the social consequences and the evolving response of the mining companies to these problems and the future sustainability of the region.

TI Regulating traffic with land use planning
SO SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB This article deals with integrating land use planning and traffic planning to promote sustainable development: how land use planning may be used as one of the means to reduce problems caused by traffic. The growth in car-borne traffic has increased rapidly and consumes more and more land because of land-extensive structure of cities and the traffic demand between human activities (home, work, services). Planning solutions emphasizing the separation of urban functions, in order to avoid health problems, have, together with the availability of inexpensive land on the outskirts of urban areas, contributed to the current generation of environmental problems, primarily from increased dependency on private cars. The OECD and EU have developed principles of sustainable transport and sustainable traffic to tackle the growth of traffic. Urban form and location of activities together with economic incentives and well organized public transport has a significant impact on traffic flows. There is not yet a general political agreement on how the reduction of traffic demand should be legally regulated, but some criteria are suggested to measure sustainable mobility in land use planning.

AB The UK Sustainable Development Strategy requires that society strive to make prudent use of natural resources so as to protect the environment and maintain high and stable levels of economic growth and employment. The Waste Strategy for England and Wales emphasizes the need to reduce the amount of waste produced through the adoption of waste minimization methodology. Waste minimization clubs have been a key element in the UK programme to introduce more sustainable practice into industry and commerce. Northamptonshire, a county in the East Midlands of England, has benefited from 14 waste minimization/resource efficiency projects, within a county programme, that have run between 1998 and 2001. This is the largest number in any county in England. This has been possible because of the formation of a large and inclusive partnership that contains all the key local and regional players. Performance indicators have been developed to direct the county programme as it strives to introduce more sustainable waste management practice. The Northamptonshire model has led to a catalysed uptake of sustainable waste management practice and has resulted in greatly improved competitiveness in some 270 companies, thereby contributing to the maintenance of stable levels of economic activity.

DT Article
DE analog to digital TV broadcasting; diffusion orbit; predator-prey
   systems; Lotka-Volterra equations
AB Timely introduction of emerging new technologies that substitute for existing technologies is essential for enhancing a nation's international competitiveness in a globalizing economy. However, such substitution is generally slow because of a lack of information about new technologies, fear of substitution and a reluctance to pay the cost of switching to new technologies. While hasty substitution sometimes accomplishes nothing, delayed substitution can result in a loss of national competitiveness. Thus, policy options for the diffusion orbits of competitive innovations are crucial. This is particularly the case with respect to Japan's transition from analog to digital TV broadcasting, as the Japanese government, in order to minimize the impact of a transition delay, is urging a rapid shift from analog to digital TV broadcasting.
   In an ecosystem, in order to maintain sustainable development, predator-prey systems demonstrate a sophisticated balance. Given that an ecosystem can be used as a masterpiece system, this sophisticated balance provides suggestive ideas in deciding an optimal orbit of competitive innovations.
   This paper analyzes the optimal orbit for Japan's transition from analog to digital TV broadcasting, and on the basis of an application of Lotka-Volterra equations that analyze the sophisticated balance of predator-prey systems, it demonstrates the optimality of the Japanese government's scenario for shifting from analog to digital TV broadcasting.

TI The pursuit of sustainable business excellence: guiding transformation
   for effective organizational change
SO TOTAL QUALITY MANAGEMENT & BUSINESS EXCELLENCE
LA English
DT Article
AB Like normal people living a typical life, human organizations generally operate in such a way that they alternate between periods of stability and Periods of significant change in their environment. In periods of a dramatic change, brought about by advances in technology, the deregulation of their industry, or large social and economic restructuring, the objective of survival in the presence of a threatening challenge takes precedence over the improvement of performance based on best practices or other methods applicable in periods of stability. The first step in addressing such a challenge is to become aware of what is known as a strategic inflection point. This signals a big change in the environmental conditions and the emergence of new rules and priorities for becoming and staying successful It marks the end of a previously successful mindset and of strategies that are no longer effective. The next step requires close attention to a set of key attributes that are essential to develop organizational resilience and fitness, accompanied by an often difficult internal debate that will facilitate an organization's prompt and effective transformation to cope with new conditions. To achieve the key objectives in both stable and turbulent periods, an organization needs to develop the capability for sustainable business excellence (SBE). This requires a capacity to operate in a dual management mode, which accommodates both the familiar success criteria-i.e. profitability, customer satisfaction, etc, in stable conditions that lead to conventional business excellence (CBE)-and the criteria of resilience and competitive landscape fitness during periods of environmental turbulence. A dual management approach must be embedded in a conceptually expanded framework rather than a well-defined model of business excellence, drawing on insights from modern science suitable for living organizations rather than the currently dominant mindset rooted in a 'mechanical' metaphor of organizations as giant machines.

AB We evaluated the long-term impact of single-dose diethylcarbamazine plus albendazole combination therapy with that of diethylcarbamazine alone on the control of soil-transmitted helminths (STH) in 2 blocks (revenue units) of Villupuram district, south India, as part of an ongoing mass drug administration (MDA) campaign for the elimination of lymphatic filariasis in 2001. The prevalence and intensities of STHs were studied in 287 children, aged 9 and 10 years (136 in the combination therapy cohort and 151 in the diethylcarbamazine alone cohort), using the Kato-Katz technique to examine stool samples at 4 time-points (baseline, and 3 weeks, 6 months and 11 months after MDA). The combination therapy showed long-term efficacy against STHs and the magnitude of control remained at a moderate and significant level for 11 months after MDA compared with the moderate gains of diethylcarbamazine alone. Single-dose MDA with albendazole and diethylcarbamazine combination therapy may prove to be a good strategy in treating multiple parasitic infections in endemic communities.

TI Actual and potential salt-related soil degradation in an irrigated rice
   scheme in the Sahelian zone of Mauritania
SO AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
LA English

ID SENEGAL RIVER DELTA; SALINIZATION; ALKALINIZATION; VALLEY
AB Salt-related soil degradation due to irrigation activities is considered a major threat to the sustainability of rice cropping under semi-arid conditions in West Africa. Rice productivity problems related to soil salinity, alkalinity and topographic position were observed in an irrigated rice scheme in southern central Mauritania. Detailed study of soils in a toposequence revealed that highest topsoil salinity and alkalinity were found at the shallow soils (<1.2 m) of the middle and upper slopes. Here, soils have formed in situ from the schist parent rock, which releases carbonate rich salts upon weathering. Within these soils large differences in salinity and alkalinity level occur at short distances, indicating minimal groundwater flow and a strong variation in the geochemical composition of the vertically positioned bedrock. Further downslope, soils have a (partly) colluvio-alluvial origin. Here, sedimentation during annual floods increased soil depth (>2.5 m) and salinity levels remained low due to leaching. Foum Gleita's irrigation water used is amongst the most alkaline in the Sahel. However, no clear indications of secondary salinization or alkalinization due to irrigation activities were observed. A comparison of historical data revealed no significant changes of topsoil salinity and pH over the last 30 years. The PHREEQC 2.0 model was used to study actual and potential development of soil salinity and alkalinity problems, by simulating excessive concentration of the irrigation water through evaporation. The evolution into a strongly sodic-alkaline solution due to precipitation of Mg-calcite and -silicate minerals did not fit with current composition of ground and surface water, which showed geochemical control of alkalinity at high concentrations. Incorporation of cation exchange processes, using a small (1.0 mmol(c) per 100 g dry soil) but calcium saturated CEC, resulted in a better fit with field data. Results indicate that the soil's buffer capacity to counteract alkalinization processes is large. However, the soil water and salt balance needs to be quantified in order to determine development rate and equilibrium levels of soil salinity and alkalinity for different soil type x water management combinations. This study does neither reject the hypothesis that salt-related soil degradation jeopardizes the sustainability of rice cropping in the Sahel, nor does it provide evidence for its verification. However, our results are in line with other studies in west Africa, in that current salt-related production problems are inherited, rather than being induced by irrigated rice cropping.

AB Linear alkylbenzenes (LABs) comprising >80% 2-phenyl isomer content, have been prepared in sustainable high yields from detergent-range linear olefins via regioselective benzene alkylation using reactive distillation technology. Hydrofluoric acid (HF)-treated mordenites provide enhanced, shape-selective, alkylation performance when employed as heterogeneous catalysts in the subject syntheses. Both individual C-10-C-12 alpha-olefins, as well as mixed, commercial plant-derived, C-10-C-14 paraffin dehydrogenate feedstocks containing ca. 8.5% internal olefins, have been successfully alkylated for extended periods using the reactive distillation mode of operation.

AB Catalytic wet oxidation of different organic pollutant in an industrial process water treatment increases its importance with respect to sustainable chemical technologies R&D. Trickle-bed reactor can enable capacity demands, high pressure and temperature operation conditions using sufficiently active catalyst with a long term stability. The paper deals with phenol removal by wet oxidation on an active carbon extruded catalyst using high-pressure laboratory trickle-bed reactor. To suppress external mass transfer resistance both a diluted catalytic bed by inert fines and liquid feed rate modulation were applied. The forced pulsing flow regime was created by ON-OFF liquid feed flow modulation. Feed period length and split can influence both reactor throughput and its hydrodynamics, e.g., liquid holdup, wetting efficiency and pressure drop. If the period length was comparable with an effective liquid residence time, mean dynamic liquid holdup at periodic operation mode was found to be lower than the steady state one and thus phenol conversion was found to be 10% higher than that measured at steady state conditions.

DE urban sustainability assessment model (USAM); climate change and air
   pollution; South Korea
ID SYSTEMS
AB Beginning the late 1980s, major cities in a number of nations have been making efforts to realize the concept of "sustainable development". In South Korea, some theoretical studies, technology development and a case study on sustainable cities were also initiated. Such studies are believed to have made a significant contribution in enhancing the understanding of urban sustainability. Nevertheless, they were poor in presenting detailed methodologies on how to assess and create urban sustainability. This study aims at developing a model to assess urban sustainability. Given the vastness of data to be built as well as the time and financial constraints at hand, assessment indicators were chosen with a focus on elements affecting climate change and air pollution at an urban level. The developed model was applied to 57 case study cities out of 80 cities in South Korea in order to verify the applicability and feasibility of the model. Urban sustainability assessment model (USAM) is composed of three basic models: driving force, pressure, state, effect, response (DPSER) model, stage model, and the space size model. Unlike the past assessment system that was unclear in what and how to assess for assessing sustainability, the USAM presented in this study allows an organized and systematic analysis through the DPSER model. Furthermore, the stage model made it easy to formulate measures to create a sustainable city by understanding the development history and changes of a city as well as forecasting possible impacts. In addition, the space size model compares cities with different space sizes and also sets a relation between a nation and a city. It also offers a framework to define relations and to compare across nations or a nation with a city instead of simply viewing a city as a single unit.
   The USAM does not present the degree of urban sustainability as a final output. Instead, it generates and applies a series of processes and methods of assessment in an urban sustainability perspective. In the process, the development pattern of a city and its negative impact on environment will be understood and appropriate and effective countermeasures will be confirmed. Such a process establishes urban sustainability and may be used as a means for us to understand what specific actions we need to take in order to promote urban sustainability.

AB Globally, the estimated total area planted with transgenic plants producing Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) toxins was 12 million hectares in 2001. The risk of target pests becoming resistant to these toxins has led to the implementation of resistance-management strategies. The efficiency and sustainability of these strategies, including the high-dose plus refuge strategy currently recommended for North American maize, depend on the initial frequency of resistance alleles. In this study, we estimated the initial frequencies of alleles conferring resistance to transgenic Bt poplars producing Cry3A in a natural population of the poplar pest Chrysomela tremulae (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae). We used the F-2 screen method developed for detecting resistance alleles in natural pest populations. At least three parents of the 270 lines tested were heterozygous for a major Bt resistance allele. We estimated mean resistance-allele frequency for the period 19992001 at 0.0037 (95% confidence interval = 0.00045-0.0080) with a detection probability of 90%. These results demonstrate that (i) the F-2 screen method can be used to detect major alleles conferring resistance to Bt-producing plants in insects and (ii) the initial frequency of alleles conferring resistance to Bt toxin can be close to the highest theoretical values that are expected prior to the use of Bt plants if considering fitness costs and typical mutation rates.

AB The use of the activated carbon produced from rice hulls to control NO,, emissions for future deep space missions has been demonstrated. The optimal carbonization temperature range was found to be between 600 and 750 degreesC. A burnoff of 61.8% was found at 700 degreesC in pyrolysis and 750 degreesC in activation. The BET surface area of the activated carbon from rice hulls was determined to be 172 m(2)/g when prepared at 700 degreesC. The presence of oxygen in flue gas is essential for effective adsorption of NO by activated carbon. On the contrary, water vapor inhibits the adsorption efficiency of NO. Consequently, water vapor in flue gas should be removed by drying agents before adsorption to ensure high NO adsorption efficiency. All of the NO in the flue gas was removed for more than 1.5 h when 10% oxygen was present and the ratio of the carbon weight to the flue gas flow rate (W/F) was 15.4 g.min/L. Reduction of the adsorbed NO to form N-2 could be effectively accomplished under anaerobic conditions at 550 T. The adsorption capacity of NO on the activated carbon was found to be 5.02 mg of NO/g of carbon. The loss of carbon mass was determined to be about 0.16% of the activated carbon per cycle of regeneration if the regeneration occurred when the NO in the flue gas after the carbon bed reached 4.8 ppm, the space maximum allowable concentration. The reduction of the adsorbed NO also regenerated the activated carbon, and the regenerated activated carbon exhibited an improved NO adsorption efficiency.

ID SUSTAINABILITY
AB The metabolism of a city can be seen as the process of transforming all the materials and commodities for sustaining the city's economic activity. This paper attempts to incorporate resource and material flow analysis to investigate Taipei area's urban sustainability due to urban construction. The material flows (sand and gravel, cement, asphalt, and construction waste) during the past decade for constructing major urban engineering projects such as roads, bridge, MRT, flood prevention projects, storm drainage and sewerage pipes, and buildings are analyzed for Taipei metropolis. In order to evaluate the contributory value of material flows to the ecological economic system, emergy (spelled with an M; previously known as embodied energy) evaluation is incorporated in this research. A framework of indicators including categories of: (1) intensity of resource consumption; (2) inflow/outflow ratio; (3) urban livability; (4) efficiency of urban metabolism; and (5) emergy evaluation of urban metabolism is developed for measuring the effect of urban construction on Taipei's sustainability. The consumption of sand and gravel is approximately 90% of the total construction material used, and the generation of construction waste in Taipei exceeds 30 x 10(6) ton per annum. The emergy value of construction materials in Taipei is equivalent to 46% of total emergy use. Although the livability in Taipei has improved, the significant amount of construction waste remains an important environmental issue. The recycling and reuse of construction waste can not only create circular pattern of urban metabolism but is also vital to the sustainable development of Taipei. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

ID PERSPECTIVES
AB This paper explores how the quality of environmental assessment could be improved by using the concept of natural capital. The issues are examined by reference to golf course developments in the area between Freiburg, Germany and Basel, Switzerland. The paper evaluates the site-level environmental impact assessments statements that were undertaken prior to these developments and the related decision-making processes. The case study illustrates many of the shortcomings apparent in the EIA process when undertaken at local scales. However, it is also evident that even if such exercises had been more rigorous at the outset, they would still have been of limited value for assessing consequences in relation to policies for sustainable development. On the one hand, the nature and scale of impacts is highly dependent on subsequent management, which is often not considered during the EIA process and subsequently lies outside the regulation process. A further limitation of the assessment is that it does not take account of the consequences of the economic failure of the project, and the implications this may have for the long-term sustainable development of the area. In order to find ways to remedy these deficiencies in planning for sustainable development this paper considers how the concept of natural capital might be used to develop a more strategic focus when assessing proposals. The paper explores a particular formulation of the natural capital concept, namely the UKs Quality of Life Capital (QoLC) approach, and concludes by considering these ideas in relation to the 'Leitbild' concept, which is now being widely debated in the German-speaking literature. It is argued that these concepts taken together offer the basis for a more integrated and strategic assessment of development proposals. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

ID CHINA; SUSTAINABILITY
AB Growing consumption can cause major environmental damage. This is becoming specially significant through the emergence of over 1 billion new consumers, people in 17 developing and three transition countries with an aggregate spending capacity, in purchasing power parity terms, to match that of the U.S. Two of their consumption activities have sizeable environmental impacts. First is a diet based strongly on meat, which, because it is increasingly raised in part on grain, puts pressure on limited irrigation water and international grain supplies. Second, these new consumers possess over one-fifth of the world's cars, a proportion that is rising rapidly. Global CO2 emissions from motor vehicles, of which cars make up 74%, increased during 1990-1997 by 26% and at a rate four times greater than the growth of CO2 emissions overall. It is in the self-interest of new consumer countries, and of the global community, to restrict the environmental impacts of consumption; this restriction is achievable through a number of policy initiatives.

AB This contribution aims at the assessment of the sustainability of a management plan for Lessonia nigrescens in Chilean coastal ecosystems, specially when the harvest pressure could be increased due to that this macroalgae is considered as a food source for the abalon (Haliotis discus hannoi) farming along the Chilean coast. Three qualitative conceptual models were developed and compared; the first and second ones assuming homogeneous and heterogeneous environmental conditions, respectively, and the third expanded one considering eco-social components under the assumption of environmental heterogeneity. For all these models, the factors described by Vasquez [Bot. Mar. 38 (1995) 251] were included in the management plan for the harvesting of brown macroalgae. Based on Levins's Loop Analysis, the system will have a just weakly unstable moving equilibrium if the harvesting activities do not negatively affect the macrophyta's reproduction and recruitment processes. Therefore, coincidence of reproduction and/or recruitment with harvesting must be avoided in a putative management plan. Regarding the qualitative predictions of the system's behaviour after negatively affecting reproduction and recruitment, only an ecological model assuming a heterogeneous environment shows realistic responses in comparison to experimental studies on the same species. This contribution is the first approach considering the dynamical behaviour of L. nigrescens and its surroundings. Nevertheless, further models, based on the same modelling theory, may integrate more variables from social and economical fields in order to improve the scope of this complex system. Further comparative studies should focus on the assessment of the significance of the structural functions of L. nigrescens and other macroalgae for the conservation of this benthic system.

AB A great concern in forestry today is whether whole-tree harvesting influences site productivity and whether it is consistent with the principle of sustainable use of forest resources. To evaluate this a randomised field experiment established 24 years ago in Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) in southern Sweden was used. Treatments were conventional stem harvest (CH), whole-tree harvest (WTH), and branch and stem harvest (BSH). Seedling survival was unaffected by treatments. The total basal area over bark at breast height (1.3 m, m(2) ha(-1)) was significantly reduced following WTH from the 15th year after planting. Sample trees on CH plots produced 20% more wood biomass than WTH and BSH plots, while biomass produced within the crown was unaffected by treatment. Height growth was greater for sample trees on CH plots during the last year of measurement, while basal area and volume under bark were larger from the 12th year onwards when compared with the WTH treatment. BSH showed a decreased basal area growth under bark during the two 4-year-periods, 13-16 and 17-20 years after planting, and a decreased volume growth under bark from year 9 onwards in comparison with CH.
   Radial growth was increased for CH up to 3 m of the stems during the 9-12-year period and at 3 m during the 13-16-year period in comparison with the other two treatments. The implications of the results are discussed in terms of long-term site productivity and overall silvicultural outcome. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Garcinia lucida Vesque (Clusiaceae) is a highly valued non-timber forest tree. The bark and the seeds are exploited and commercialised for medicinal purposes and palm wine processing in Cameroon, Gabon and Equatorial Guinea. The bark is often removed over almost the entire circumference of the stem, leading to high mortality. To identify the processes or the life stages that influence the population dynamics and to forecast the potential effects of harvesting, a demography study was carried and a matrix model was constructed to characterise the population dynamics of G. lucida in the South Cameroonian Atlantic humid forests. The study revealed that height and diameter growth values were very low and may constitute biological disadvantages for the dynamics of the species. The flowering and fruiting model, the absence of seed dormancy, and the high germination and seedling survival rates constituted advantages for the population dynamics, which is characterised by effective regeneration strategies. Rates of growth, survival and fecundity allowed calculations of transition probabilities of the matrix model. The value of the dominant eigenvalue (lambda) was 1.063, slightly higher than the value expected for stable populations. The sensitivities of lambda to changes showed that the population growth was most sensitive to changes in tree growth, particularly in the seedling stage. Elasticity analysis showed that growth and fecundity elements had much lower contributions to lambda, indicating that the harvesting of seeds may have a low impact on population growth. However, the population growth was highly sensitive to changes in survival probability, particularly among trees of 5-10 cm, diameter at breast height (dbh). The last stages, containing the large reproductive individuals over 10 cm dhb, which are interesting for the bark extraction, accounted for lowest elasticity, indicating that the extraction of bark may have at least a low impact on population growth. Thus, there maybe a good scope for sustainable extraction of G. lucida bark in these stages. The size-class 5-10 cm dbh proved by loop analysis to be the most important reproductive stage for population maintenance. However, individuals in this size-class are also exploited by forest gatherers, and increased exploitation pressure on trees in this size-class is likely to have a considerable impact on the population growth and to compromise the scope for sustainable exploitation of this resource.

DE CELOS; uneven-aged Terra Firme Forest management; reduced impact logging
   (RIL); cash flow analysis; net present value; sensitivity analysis
AB Sustained management of the Terra Firme Forest in Amazonia is financially analysed for an integrated forest management and timber processing industry. Two scenarios are studied, one with reduced impact logging (RIL) and sparing of reserves without silvicultural follow-up in a 100-year harvesting cycle, and another one inclusive of silviculture after RIL, liberating reserves in a 25-year cycle. Cycle lengths are based on CELOS research in Suriname. Acquisition of land is assumed to be complete at the beginning, the 100-year cycle option needing four times as much land as the 25-year cycle option. A cash flow analysis over a 100-year period for both options with a 8% discount rate shows that the total costs in the land-intensive option (25 years) with silviculture are considerably less than in the land-extensive option; the lower cost of infrastructure, log transportation and land acquisition offset the cost of silviculture. Because the annual revenues from timber sale are the same in both options, the NPV of the intensive option is also much higher. A sensitivity analysis shows that the land-intensive option is expected to give still a positive NPV in less favourable situations. The relatively small forest area in the land-intensive option together with the organisational setting, which includes integration with the processing industry, favours a sustainable development. More intensive management gives signals to settlers that helps prevent their encroachment. In addition, the higher annual increment in this option facilitates a contribution to regional development and makes a larger area available for strict nature reserves. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Establishing salt tolerant tree plantations utilising the saline ground waters may provide for an economic use of abandoned and lands but issues related to long-term sustainability of such plantations are unknown. Thus a field trial with 31 tree species was conducted over 9 years (1991-2000) on a calcareous soil in a semi-arid part (annual rainfall about 350 mm) of northwest India. Tree saplings were planted at the sill of furrows and irrigated with saline water (EC 8.5-10.0 dS/m) for initial 3 years (4-6 times/year) and there after, plantations were irrigated once during the winter only. Measurements were made on tree growth, water use and biomass production. Ranking in order of survival, growth and biomass yield showed that preferred choice for tree species in order of persistence and performance should be: Tamarix articulata, Acacia nilotica, Prosopis juliflora, Eucalyptus tereticornis, Acacia tortilis, and Cassia siamea. Water use efficiency in these tree species ranged between 21 and 99 kg/cm of water. The other species can be A. tortilis (hybrid), Melia azedarach and Acacia farnesiana. Tree species like Acacia auriculiformis, Albizzia lebbeck, Bauhinia variegata, Cassia glauca, Syzygium cuminii, Crescentia alata, Samanea saman, and Terminalia arjuna showed satisfactory early growth and survival when these were supplied with supplemental saline irrigation but proved to be sensitive after the cessation of irrigation, thus emphasising the need for long-term evaluation trials. Cassia javanica and C. alata were observed to be very sensitive to frost whereas Casuarina equisetifolia could not survive drought due to the prevailing and conditions at the site. Salt storage in soil profile increased substantially during irrigation period (5.6-10.4 dS/m) but the added salts got distributed in soil profile as a consequence of seasonal concentration of rainfall during monsoons and some episodic events of rainfall during the following years. The soil was enriched with organic carbon (>0.4% in upper 30 cm) under the promising tree species. Total ionic composition of leaves ranged between 2.8 and 6.8%. Thus, rehabilitation of arid soils with the above recommended tree species using the available saline waters, would not only render these abandoned soils to be productive but would also ensure conservation and improvement in environment for long range ecological security on these lands.

TI HUMAN CAPITAL, TECHNICAL CHANGE, AND THE WELFARE STATE
SO JOURNAL OF THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC ASSOCIATION
LA English
DT Article
AB I study the interactions between the distribution of human capital, technological choice, and redistributive institutions. I first ask what makes alternative social contracts such as a European-style "welfare state" and U.S.-style "laissez-faire" sustainable, and in particular how each is affected by skill-biased technical change. I then endogenize technological or organizational choice, and show that firms respond to greater human capital heterogeneity with more flexible technologies that further exacerbate wage equality. I then analyze the simultaneous determination of technology, income distribution, and redistributive institutions, and as well as spillovers between the social contracts of different countries.

AB A multi-species model for shellfish polyculture in coastal embayments is presented, and an application of the model to a test site (Sanggou Bay, Northern China) used for large-scale longline cultivation of the Chinese scallop Chlamys farreri, the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas and the kelp Laminaria japonica is described.
   The model integrates a bay-scale ecological simulation with individual-based modelling of scallops and oysters, and upscales the individual processes for the target species (scallops and oysters) by means of a multi-cohort population dynamics model. Human interaction with the target cohorts over a number of years is explicitly simulated. The model has been used to estimate the exploitation carrying capacity for scallops and oysters in the system, the harvest potential for different seeding and harvesting scenarios, and the impacts on the ecosystem of different polyculture management strategies.
   Although an increase in seeding to 2 X and 15 x standard seeding for scallops and oysters respectively optimizes the yield of both, thus corresponding to the exploitation carrying capacity, the ratio of harvest/seed is lowered, which may make the fishery less attractive from an economic point of view.
   Progressive increases in seeding lead to a collapse of the fishery: this occurs at >15 x standard seeding for scallops, and at >30 x for oysters. In parallel, there are profound modifications at the ecosystem level, which were studied by means of a mass balance carried out on the model. Under standard conditions, there is a net export of primary production from the bay to the Yellow Sea, but at 15-20 x increase in seeding, the bay becomes a net phytoplankton importer, due to phytoplankton clearance by cultivated shellfish.
   The model simulates a period of 6 years in about 2 min, and was shown to be a useful tool for polyculture management over multiannual periods; a development of the socioeconomic component will allow feedbacks between economic consequences of different cultivation scenarios and ecosystem responses to be explicitly considered. The application of this type of model may be of use in promoting a more holistic approach to shellfish aquaculture management. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Members of the rural communities living around the edges of the Kosi Lake system in northern KwaZulu-Natal have been subsistence users of the resources of the lakes, estuary and surrounding swamp forest for many generations. Women and children dig up a variety of crabs in the mangrove ecosystem, and in the late 1980s collected as many as 638 000 crabs a year. The red mangrove crab Neosarmatium meinerti de Man, 1884 (Crustacea: Decapoda: Grapsidae: Sesarminae) constituted the major proportion of these catches, while Scylla serrata and Cardisoma carnifex made up the rest. However, subsistence fishing effort and catches have been reduced steadily, declining from about 5000 outings p.a. and between 2 and 4 x 10, crabs p.a. in the 1980s, to about 1000 outings and 1.3 x 10(5) crabs in the late 1990s. CPUE has increased from 66 to 145 crabs/person/outing during this period. Crab densities ranged between 0.35/m(2) on the high shore and 11.4/m(2) on a densely vegetated island, but it was not clear what factors most affected crab density. Densities inside and outside a 'sanctuary area' were not significantly different, although there were significant differences in densities among sites within the 'sanctuary area'. Stock size within the entire mangrove area of Kosi was estimated as 728 514 N. meinerti, but this is almost certainly an underestimate of the total stock size. Sex ratios in the N. meinerti population were not significantly different from 1:1 but above 38 mm carapace width (CW) male crabs considerably outnumbered females. Females matured at 24.9 mm CW and mean sizes of crabs captured by subsistence harvesters were 33.4 mm and 31.3 mm CW for males and females, respectively. Instantaneous natural mortality was estimated at M = 2.27 and fishing mortality F = 0.83. The N. meinerti population in the Kosi mangrove system appears to be sustainably exploited.

AB Understanding agro-ecosystems implies acknowledging its complexity and its heterogeneity. Complexity refers to different hierarchical levels at which agriculture can be described; heterogeneity refers to the variability recorded within each hierarchical level considered. When dealing with valuation aimed at sustainability it is essential to assess multi-criteria and multi-scale descriptions and to find a way to bridge them. For this reason and to support the decision processes, it is fundamental to understand the role of households in this system. Here we suggest a multivariate statistical approach to the definition of household types with a case study of five rural villages in Hubei province, China. In each village, 50 random households were sampled and interviewed. Results show five distinct household types, differing in size and composition, economic activities, technical development, cereal productivity, food sufficiency, education and overall income. However, the analysis pointed out a recent and still on-going process of polarisation as equality seems still the main feature of Chinese society. Severe constraints existing in the socio-economic boundary conditions could provide very limited possibilities for rural farmers to emerge from poverty. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB Policy making, to enhance sustainable agricultural development, requires insight in the complex dynamics of agricultural systems at the farm and regional level. These include the way farmers take management decisions, the effects of these decisions on soil fertility and crop and animal production and the consequences of these production levels for prices at regional level, which in turn influence decisions at the farm level. Moreover, interactions between farms should be taken into account in an environment were an expanding agriculture is facing the limitations of space. This paper discusses a number of modelling approaches that are used to support decision-making on these issues. The paper argues that the study of such systems requires the use of non-linear dynamic models that allow simulation of the system in a qualitative way, based on a description of the underlying processes. The approach is illustrated with a regional model that has been developed to simulate agricultural development in the Koutiala region in the south-western part of Mali. The paper shows how the approach helps to better understand the dynamics of this system and how it may help to explore the effect of policies on sustainability. Finally the strong and weak points of the approach are discussed. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Public concern nowadays is an important frame of reference for the development of agricultural production systems. The development of such systems, therefore, involves both society level and production system level. Following Zadeh's 'principle of incompatibility', information obtained at production system level is interpreted at society level in linguistic terms. Fuzzy models promise to be a valuable tool as they link measurable information to linguistic interpretation using membership functions (MFs). The objective of this paper is to outline a procedure which deals with criticism regarding the inherent subjectivity in the construction of MFs when using expert knowledge. The procedure guarantees the selection of appropriate expert knowledge, and provides a guideline supporting the selection of methods to elicit expert knowledge and construct MFs. Also on the basis of the results in an illustrative example, it is concluded that the procedure outlined in this paper suitably deals with criticism regarding MFs and, therefore, enables a practical implementation of fuzzy evaluation of agricultural production systems. Current research implements the procedure to build a fuzzy model which evaluates egg production systems in relation to public concern about the welfare of laying hens. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Commercial farms were examined in western Canada to assess the impact of two cropping systems (annual-grain and diversified grain-forage) and two input systems (high level and organic) on carabid beetles.
   Pitfall traps were used to sample beetles over 3 years (1994-1996). Results showed that five species of Carabidae dominated the 51 species captured (Bembidion quadrimaculatum (LeConte), Bembidion obscurellum (Motschulsky), Agonum placidum (Say), Amara littoralis (Mannerheim), Bembidion nitidum (Kirby)). The annual-grain system was found to support greater species diversity than the diversified grain-forage system but there was no significant difference in the mean abundance. There were no significant differences between species diversity or mean abundance in high input versus organic systems.
   An inventory of carabids associated with specific agricultural production systems in Saskatchewan was developed, based on data collection and evaluation by crop, pest, economic and soil scientists, which are intended to monitor long-term sustainable agricultural production systems.

AB A combination of perennial grass species and selected crop rotation can help prevent soil erosion in upland regions. Research data were obtained on sandy loam Dystric Albeluvisols at the Kaltinenai Research Station of the Lithuanian Institute of Agriculture on the undulating hilly topography of the Zemaiciai Uplands of Western Lithuania to identity crop and crop rotations that would minimise soil erosion. Measured water erosion rates during long-term field experiments were: 5.4-17.0 Mg ha(-1) under winter rye, 18.0-62.8 Mg ha(-1) under spring barley and 44.4-186.2 Mg ha(-1) under potatoes. Perennial grasses completely prevented water erosion. The erosion-preventive grass-grain crop rotations (>50% grass) decreased soil losses on arable slopes of 2-5degrees, 5-10degrees and 10-14degrees by 77-81%, while the grain-grass crop rotation (<50% grass) decreased rates by 21-24%, compared with the field crop rotation. The mean annual metabolisable energy accumulated by the erosion-preventive grass-grain crop rotations under optimum ground and fertiliser treatments on slopes of varying gradient was 96.7 GJ ha(-1). This was 24.8% higher than under the field crop rotation and 20.2% higher than under the grain-grass crop rotation. The mean digestible protein productivity of sod-forming perennial grasses was 13.1% higher than the mean productivity of grass-grain crop rotations and 53.7% higher than the grain-grass crop rotation on slopes of 10-14degrees. The erosion-preventive capability of crop rotations depends on their structure and composition. The grass-grain crop rotations and sod-forming perennial grasses significantly increased soil aggregate stability compared with grain-grass crop rotations on 10-14degrees slopes, thus both these systems decrease soil erodibility. The main attributes of the proposed land conservation and sustainable land-use system were the careful selection of optimum erosion-preventive ecosystems (sod-forming perennial grasses or erosion-preventive crop rotations) with high erosion-resisting capabilities. These systems must vary in response to slope conditions. Such ecosystems assist erosion control and thus the ecological stability of the undulating topography of Lithuania. These results may have wider applicability on the undulating landscapes of the Temperate Zone. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We examined the extent to which farmers have improved food production in recent years with low cost, locally available and environmentally sensitive practices and technologies. We analysed by survey during 1999-2000 208 projects in 52 developing countries, in which 8.98 million farmers have adopted these practices and technologies on 28.92 million hectares, representing 3.0% of the 960 million hectares of arable and permanent crops in Africa, Asia and Latin America. We found improvements in food production occurring through one or more of four mechanisms: (i) intensification of a single component of farm system; (ii) addition of a new productive element to a farm system; (iii) better use of water and land, so increasing cropping intensity; (iv) improvements in per hectare yields of staples through introduction of new regenerative elements into farm systems and new locally appropriate crop varieties and animal breeds. The 89 projects with reliable yield data show an average per project increase in per hectare food production of 93%. The weighted average increases across these projects were 37% per farm and 48% per hectare. In the 80 projects with small (<5 ha) farms where cereals were the main staples, the 4.42 million farms on 3.58 million hectares increased household food production by 1.71 t per year. We report on the practices and technologies that have led to these increases: increased water use efficiency, improvements to soil health and fertility, and pest control with minimal or zero-pesticide use. This research reveals promising advances in the adoption of practices and technologies that are likely to be more sustainable, with substantial benefits for the rural poor. With further explicit support, particularly through national policy reforms and better markets, these improvements in food security could spread to much larger numbers of farmers and rural people in the coming decades.

AB Agricultural researchers widely recognise the importance of sustainable agricultural production systems and the need to develop appropriate methods to measure sustainability. The principal purpose of this paper is to evaluate the financial and environmental aspects of sustainability of organic, integrated and conventional farming systems (OFS, IFS and CFS, respectively) at farm level and on more detailed spatial scales. This was achieved by applying an integrated economic-environmental accounting framework to three case study farms in Tuscany (Italy) covering different farming systems (FSs) and different spatial scales. The environmental performances of the FSs were measured through the application of an environmental accounting information system (EAIS) at field, site and farm level. The EAIS indicators were then integrated with: (1) a set of financial indicators to evaluate the economic and environmental trade-offs between different FSs and (2) with information on the regional and site-specific soil and climate conditions to study the impact of different pedo-climates on the environmental performances of the FSs. The gross margins of steady-state OFSs were found to be higher than the corresponding CFS gross margins. The OFSs perform better than IFSs and CFSs with respect to nitrogen losses, pesticide risk, herbaceous plant biodiversity and most of the other environmental indicators. However, on hilly soils, erosion was found to be higher in OFSs than in CFSs. The pesticide and the nitrogen indicators in this study showed a similar environmental impact caused by integrated and conventional farming practices. Regional pedo-climatic factors were found to have a considerable impact on nutrient losses, soil erosion, pesticide risk and herbaceous plant biodiversity, site-specific: factors on nutrient losses and soil erosion. Results at field level suggest that herbaceous plant biodiversity and crop production are not always conflicting variables. Results of the case study farms are discussed and compared with environmental sustainability thresholds reported from EU Directives on nitrate and pesticides in groundwater and the literature.

AB This study quantifies the agronomic benefits of foraging waterfowl in winter flooded rice fields in the Sacramento Valley of California (US). Fifteen winter flooded rice fields along a 105 km long transect, each with five pairs of waterfowl exclosures and control plots were used to measure residue decomposition in spring, and weed biomass and grain yield at harvest. Experimental exclusion of waterfowl resulted in a significant increase in remaining residue from 1014 to 1233 kg ha(-1) across the transect. At seven sites with high waterfowl activity, remaining residue increased from 836 to 1549 kg ha(-1) when waterfowl were excluded from the plot. Grassy weed biomass increased from 44 to 91 kg ha(-1) over the whole transect in absence of waterfowl. At seven sites with high waterfowl activity the grassy weed biomass more than doubled in the absence of waterfowl from 89 to 204 kg ha(-1). No significant yield effect could be detected. Winter flooding rice fields resulted in mutual benefits for waterfowl and agriculture that could be of particular significance in organic fanning systems. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Adaptation of land use to the potentialities and constraints of local agroecologies is a key principle of sustainable land management. Farmers and land resource professionals assess the options that optimise the productivity and sustainable land use through different knowledge systems. Both systems have advantages and drawbacks. Through a case study in a village of northwestern Syria, an approach was developed to integrate the knowledge of both farmers and land resource experts in order to promote adoption of new land use systems. This was done by comparing a farmer-led land suitability assessment (FLSA) with the results of an expert-led land suitability assessment (ELSA) so as to evaluate respective comparative advantages and complementarities. The results of FLSA and ELSA were integrated in a geographical information system (GIS). The farmers compared the results of FLSA and ELSA and their input ELSA was upgraded to suit local circumstances. Some striking differences came out between FLSA and ELSA, which could be explained by a participatory land evaluation. The farmers' knowledge provided a better understanding of the impact of microclimatic variations on crop productivity. This is an important bonus of the participatory approach because detailed climatic data for long periods are rarely available in most rural communities. The FLSA procedure explained adequately the overriding weight of socio-economic constraints over biophysical opportunities. A constraint in the participatory approach is that useful and interesting indigenous knowledge is often scarce. GIS was instrumental in the correlation of indigenous and expert land units and in the farmers' validation of land suitability. The benefits of this approach to the researchers were clear. The farmers on the other hand highly appreciated the improved communication with the scientists. The better interaction with the farmers will eventually pay off when it comes to adoption of improved management recommendations. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Mixed tree cropping systems have been proposed for sustainable nutrient management in the humid tropics. Yet, the nutrient interactions between intercropped trees have not been addressed sufficiently. In the present study we compare the temporal and spatial patterns of the uptake of applied N-15 by four different tree crops in a mixed tree cropping system on a Xanthic Ferralsol in central Amazonia, Brazil, during one year. Most of the N uptake occurred during the first two weeks. Very little N was recovered by peach palm (Bactris gasipaes), more by cupuassu (Theobroma grandiflorum) and annatto (Bixa orellana) and most by Brazil nut (Bertholletia excelsa). Due to tree pruning the total accumulation of applied N-15 in the above-ground biomass of annatto decreased throughout the year. It remained constant in cupuassu and peach palm and increased in Brazil nut. Brazil nut showed an extensive root activity and took up more fertilizer N applied to neighboring trees than from the one applied under its own canopy in contrast to the other three tree crops. Therefore, trees with wide-spread root systems may not need to receive N fertilizer directly but can take up N applied to other trees in the mixed cropping system. This means that such trees may effectively decrease N leaching when intercropped with trees that have dormant periods or places with low N uptake, but also exert considerable resource competition.

AB Background: Studies have shown that the psychosocial determinants attitude, self-efficacy, subjective norm, and health threat are important in predicting intention to change fat consumption. However, the role of habit in relation to these determinants is still largely unknown.
   Objective: We aimed to assess whether and how habit influences intention in relation to attitude, self-efficacy, subjective norm, and health threat.
   Design: Cross-sectionally, we studied the self-reported psychosocial determinants and intention of 105 (52 intervention, 53 control) patients who participated in a family practice-based tailored nutrition counseling intervention study for lowering cardiovascular risk. Fat intake 15 mo before the assessment of psychosocial determinants was used as a measure of habit. We used logistic regression analyses to develop a model predicting intention to change fat consumption.
   Results: Our regression model explained 43% of the variance in intention. Patients who perceived higher subjective norm or more social support had a higher intention. Habit was a significant predictor of intention in interaction with self-efficacy and health threat. Attitude, health threat, age, and group membership (ie, whether patients had been in the intervention group or the control group of the intervention study) were also included in the regression model.
   Conclusions: The results suggest that habit in addition to subjective norm and the other more frequently investigated psychosocial determinants are important in predicting intention to change fat consumption. To achieve sustainable health improvement through nutrition education programs, these programs should therefore start focusing more on subjective norm and habit.

ID CULTIVATION
AB Environmental certification is becoming the main toot for applications of sustainable development principles. The European Regulation Emas and the international standard ISO 14001 both require for certification, to perform environmental management system to prevent environmental impacts and to continuously improve environmental performance. For a good environmental performance evaluation (EPE), certification needs to use scientific methodologies and to interface with scientific research; here we proposed emergy analysis as a valid method for EPE and emergetic environmental performance and condition indicators (EPIs, ECIs) to monitor a territorial system: Ravenna province (Italy). Together with emergy indicators were selected other indicators for a deeper EPE: emitted/adsorbed CO2, energy consumptions, air and water pollution measures. The paper showed that Ravenna system has a good environmental performance and demonstrated how different indicators from the most advanced chemical research (chemical-physical, analytical, etc.) contribute to a complete EPE of a complex territorial system and are useful for environmental certification and sustainable development.

AB This article summarizes the results obtained during the laboratory and pilot development of integrated biologic and physicochemical treatment and reuse of diluted pig manure streams. The application of a straw filter was an effective means to separate the solid and liquid fractions of raw wastewater and resulted in the removal of a significant part of the dry matter, total nitrogen, and phosphorus (65, 27, and 32%, respectively). From the filtrate generated, 60-80% of the total chemical oxygen demand (COD) was removed in an upflow anaerobic sludge bed reactor operating at 15-30degreesC. Ammonia was efficiently eliminated (>99%) from the anaerobic effluents using Ural laumantite as an ion exchanger. However, the nitrogen-content of the zeolite was too low to consider this method of ammonia removal economically feasible. The phosphate precipitation block, consisting of stripper of CO 2 and fluidized-bed crystallizator, was able to decrease the concentration of soluble phosphate in the anaerobic effluents up to 7-15 mg of phosphate/L. The application of aerobic/anoxic biofilter as a sole polishing step was acceptable from an aesthetic point of view (the effluents were transparent and almost colorless and odorless) and elimination of biochemical oxygen demand (the resting COD was hardly biodegradable). However, the effluent nutrient concentrations (especially nitrogen) were far from the current standards for direct discharge of treated wastewater. We discuss the approaches for further improvement of effluent quality. Finally, we provide an outline of a full-scale system that partially implements the laboratory- and pilotscale results obtained.

AB Waste stabilization ponds (WSP) have been used extensively all over Europe over the last 50 yr for the treatment of municipal and industrial wastewaters. Models presented in manuals should be used only for guidance, and local experience from pilot and full-scale plants of a particular pond type is extremely valuable. Anaerobic WSP are single-stage, continuous-flow, anaerobic reactors operating at ambient temperatures and low volumetric organic loading as a pretreatment method. This article presents a literature review on the different available operational parameters of anaerobic ponds and examples from full-scale plant performance worldwide. On a wastewater management scheme, involving reuse for agriculture, the zero-energy demand of a waste stabilization pond series for the effective removal of organic and microbiological loading under existing legislation and guidelines will remain a valuable tool for sustainable development.

ID BURKINA-FASO
AB This paper discusses the meaning of a land-use type called agricultural parkland typical of the savannah landscape in sub-Saharan Africa. It focuses on particular parklands located in south western Burkina-Faso where fodder trees are preserved by Fulsse pastoralists and lopped to feed their cattle. This resource use pattern challenges the conventional view of pastoralists in respect to mobility, environment and tree uses on the one hand, and to agriculture on the other hand. Indeed, this land use type challenges the idea of ethnic specialisation of agriculture and pastoral production systems in West Africa. In addition, these parklands represent an integration of cattle raising and agriculture and an intensification of the production systems in a context of increasing population and competition to access to land. The creation of the parklands is recent and several factors could be retained to explain its origin, such as the Fulsse sedentarity, the restricted access to resources for outsiders Fulsse in southern villages of Burkina-Faso, their skill in agricultural practices. The parkland sustainability and the adoption of this innovation by other agropastoralists need to be further investigated. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Fire is a significant feature of Australia's savannas. Its use is being encouraged for cattle rangeland management, but there is little knowledge of the ecological effects of prescribed fire regimes on native biodiversity. The responses of ant communities to five experimental fire regimes over 2 years are reported from the Victoria River District in the semi-arid tropics of northern Australia. The experiment was stratified at two levels: soil type (red and black) and fire treatment (unburnt; burnt twice in successive years in early (May) or late (October) dry season and unburnt thereafter; and burnt twice, 3 years apart, in early or late dry season). Ants were sampled twice in April, corresponding with the end of the 1997 and 1998 wet seasons. Ant species richness was not responsive to fire treatment, but reduced with time since fire on black soil. Total ant abundance also reduced with time since fire on the black soil, with significant different abundances in burnt versus unburnt plots in the 1998 sample. Soil type and sampling time had the greatest influence on ant community composition in multivariate analysis than did fire regime, although there were moderate gradients of time since fire with the black soil plots. The abundance of 19 species were significantly different between fire regimes in anova, 13 on red soil and six on black soil. The abundance of eight species (four each on red and black soil) changed significantly with time since fire, with seven promoted by burning. Ant functional group profiles changed little with fire. Total ant abundance and richness had significant relationships with key pasture species and vegetative variables. The responses of ants largely recapitulated those of plants, birds and reptiles on the same plots. It is envisaged that ants will have an important role to play in the sustainable management of Australia's rangelands aiding the off-reserve conservation of biodiversity.

ID SPECTRUM
AB During antifungal screening of the essential oils of some angiospermic plants, oil of Cymbopogon flexuosus showed potent bioactivity against dominant post harvest fungal pathogens. The minimum bioactive concentrations with fungicidal action of the oil was found to be 0.2 mul ml(-1) for Alternaria alternata, 0.4 mul ml(-1) for Aspergillus flavus, A. fumigatus, A. niger, A. parasiticus, Cladosporium cladosporioides, Colletotrichum capsici, C. falcatum, Curvularia lunata, Fusarium cerealis, F. culmorum, F. oxysporum, F. udum, Gloeosporium fructigenum, Penicillium expansum, P. italicum, P. implicatum, P. digitatum, P. minio-luteum, P. variable, and 0.5 mul ml(-1) for Botrytis cinerea, Helminthosporium oryzae, H. maydis, Phoma violacea, Rhizopus nigricans. The oil exhibited potency against heavy doses (30 mycelial disc, each of 5 mm in diameter) of inoculum at 1.0 mul ml(-1) concentrations. The bioactivity of the oil was thermostable up to 100degreesC and lasted up to 48 months. The oil preparation did not exhibit any phytotoxic effect on the fruit skins of Malus pumilo up to 50 mul ml(-1) concentrations. In vivo trials of the oil as a fungicidal spray on Malus pumilo for checking the rotting of fruits, it showed that 20 mul ml(-1) concentration controls 100% infection by pre-inoculation treatment, while in post-inoculation treatment, 30 mul ml(-1) concentration of fungicidal spray was required for the 100% control of rotting. The fungicidal spray was found to be cost effective (INR 15/1), has long shelf life (48 month) and was devoid of any adverse effects. Therefore, it can be used as a potential source of sustainable eco-friendly botanical pesticide, after successful completion of wide range trials.

AB Two in vitro conservation methods have been developed for the ex situ conservation of germplasm from Cedrela fissilis, an economically important tree of the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. The first method involves the medium-term storage, at 25 degreesC, of artificial seeds comprising alginate encapsulated vegetative propagules (shoot tips, cotyledonary and epicotyl nodal segments). Maximum post-storage (3 months) viabilities of 96-100% were achieved for encapsulated shoot tips and cotyledonary nodal segments stored on water-solidified agar (at 0.4-0.7% w/v). Encapsulated shoot tips stored for 6 months on 0.4% (w/v) agar showed the highest survival rates (44%). Seeds of C. fissilis were successfully cryopreserved (100%) after direct immersion in liquid nitrogen. Ex situ storage procedures are now available for the medium- to long-term conservation of C. fissilis. These approaches offer new opportunities for the conservation, sustainable management and utilization of this valuable fast growing timber tree.

AB Non-toxic foul-release provides an environmentally friendly and sustainable technical solution to control micro- and/or macrofouling on ships' hulls. Silicone-based coatings have been used for foul-release at high or moderate ship speeds (> 15 knots). To remove the fouling from slower ships (< 15 knots), the macrofoulers in particular, biodegradable polymers may be used to make the coating surface self-renewable. Synthesized by microorganisms for carbon and energy storage under controlled conditions, polyhydroxyalkanclates (PHAs) are hydrophobic biopolymers that are gradually decomposed into CO2 and water in the environment. Because of their hydrophobic property and lack of hydrolysis in sterile aqueous solution, PHAs do not dissolve in water, but erode at the polymer surface (2-5 &mu;m in depth) catalyzed exclusively by microbial enzymes (depolymerases) that are attached on the solid surface. The thin-layer surface erosion behaves like a self-renewable surface coating, which approaches a constant renewal rate at a relative hydraulic speed as low as 3 knots. A turbulence eddy model is used to describe the effect of energy consumption per mass of liquid on the turbulent shear stress and the surface renewal rate. Furthermore, the polymer biodegradation or surface renewal rate can be controlled within a broad range by blending the material with polymers such as poly (F-caprolactone) (PCL). The biodegradation of binary blends of PHA/PCL of different compositions was quantitatively monitored by means of weight loss and Raman spectroscopy.

AB For each tonne of cement used, the cement industry emits an average of 0.9 t of CO2, which contributes to the greenhouse effect. To satisfy the demands of the concrete industry for cementing materials, new environmental requirements, and the implementation of a sustainable development policy, the use of supplementary cementitious material as a replacement of part of the Portland cement has proven to be an interesting avenue that has not yet been fully explored. Granulated blast-furnace slag has been and is being used as a supplementary cementitious material in replacement of cement in many countries. In Canada, its proportion is usually limited to 20-25% of cement replacement owing to a significant decrease in early age compressive strength as well as a lower scaling resistance. In this study, we have tried to show that by reducing the water:cement ratio we can increase cement replacement by slag up to 50% without harming its short-term compressive strength and scaling resistance. The concretes that were prepared had a workability comparable to that of the reference concrete without slag, sufficient compressive strength to allow demoulding after 24 h, very low chloride ion permeability even at 28 d, as well as very good freeze-thaw and scaling resistance, as long as it is water-cured for a slightly longer period.

AB An urban metabolism analysis is a means of quantifying the overall fluxes of energy, water, material, and wastes into and out of an urban region. Analysis of urban metabolism can provide important information about energy efficiency, material cycling, waste management, and infrastructure in urban systems. This paper presents the first urban metabolism of a Canadian urban region, and possibly the first for a North American city. It also makes a first attempt at comparing the urban metabolisms of a few cities worldwide. The most noticeable feature of the Greater Toronto Area metabolism is that inputs have generally increased at higher rates than outputs over the study years (1987 and 1999). The inputs of water and electricity have increased marginally less than the rate of population growth (25.6%), and estimated inputs for food and gasoline have increased by marginally greater percentages than the population. With the exception of CO2 emissions, the measured output parameters are growing slower than the population; residential solid wastes and wastewater loadings have actually decreased in absolute terms over the 12 year period from 1987 to 1999.

AB Ni-Pt/H-Y zeolite catalysts with different Ni contents were prepared and applied to the hydroisomerization of n-hexane and n-heptane in the temperature range 225-375 degreesC. ESCA studies show the complete reduction of Ni species up to 0.3 wt% Ni addition over 0.1 wt% Pt/H-Y and further addition leads to the occurrence of unreduced nickel species as NiAl2O4. A TEM study shows the formation of bimetallic ( Ni - Pt) particles of nanoscale size and the average particle size is found to increase with increasing Ni loading. Acidity measurements by NH3-TPD and pyridine-adsorbed FTIR spectroscopy show the increasing occupation of acid sites by the added nickel when increasing the nickel loading. The catalytic activity of Ni - Pt/H-Y zeolite and Pt/H-Y catalysts was compared and it was found that addition of Ni up to 0.3 wt% increases the n-hexane and n-heptane conversion, multibranched isomer selectivity and sustainability of the catalysts due to better metal-acid synergism, complete reduction of Ni species and the formation of catalytically active Ni - Pt bimetallic particles. Further Ni addition leads to a decrease in conversion and multibranched isomer selectivity and an increase in the cracked products, which may be due to the presence of unreduced Ni species and pore blockage by larger-sized bimetallic particles formed.

AB Trees in greenspaces are an indicator of a city's livability and sustainability. Roadside trees furnish linear greenery that can permeate neighborhoods and serve landscape and amenity functions. They are subject to high-intensity stresses and often perform poorly. Trenching to reach or install utilities along pavements is a major cause of tree damage and subsequent decline. Erroneously, it has been believed that roots grow mainly downwards and hence trenching near a tree is relatively harmless to roots. Although modern research confirms the shallow but wide distribution of tree roots that can be seriously damaged by trenching, old trenching practice still persists in many cities. Installing cable television and optical-fiber networks, and the need to overhaul dilapidated utility lines in old cities, could bring massive damage to roadside trees and significantly degrade cityscape quality. Recent advances in trenchless technology could merge with the new understanding of root distribution to protect this valuable municipal asset. Utility pipes or cables could be inserted below or around the root envelope in a drilled or bored channel, while extant pipe channels could be used to rehabilitate an old line. The procedures and precautions for the application of trenchless methods on narrow pavements are proposed. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

DE European Union; ICZM; participation
AB A study on the role of participation in integrated coastal zone management (ICZM) was undertaken as part of the European Demonstration Programme in Integrated Coastal Zone Management. The study recommends that projects adopt the following criteria: a clear process, representativeness, openness, relevant techniques, sufficient resources, and shared learning. Participation procedures should be integrated with the technical process and mechanisms clearly related to the style and purpose of the project. A main conclusion is that although participation is important, it is not a panacea. While many of the risks involved may be common to consensus building, the study highlights those peculiar to coastal management, such as the historic autonomy of many ports, the fragmented nature of the tourism industry, and suspicion of experts among the maritime community. Finally, it is suggested that ICZM may be considered a suitable paradigm for sustainable development generally.

AB Technologies are considered tools to increase the number of "available options" and to "enlarge the freedom of action" of society to achieve specific objectives. One such objective is sustainable development of the coastal zones. One way to achieve this is via integrated coastal zone management (ICZM): the integration of otherwise sectoral management activities. ICZM is not yet a widespread practice. Even in situations where integrated management is attempted, the role of technologies that might be deployed on the coastal zone to satisfy other societal needs or to provide a solution to specific problem, is not always adequately considered. True integration requires an understanding of how a technology is influenced by or impacts the surrounding natural, economic, and social environment. The present article describes an analysis of the role and use of technologies in the European Union Demonstration Programme on ICZM.

DE environmental management systems; ICZM; information; Italy
AB A river basin-oriented approach was developed to support the sustainable management of human activities in a coastal area of Regione Abruzzo, Italy. Consensus and collaboration between the public, different sectoral and territorial administrations, and the economic actors was identified as a crucial prerequisite for the long-term achievement of sustainable coastal development for this region and to make existing developments sustainable. The RICAMA (Rationale for Integrated Coastal Area Management) Project was set up on a regional scale to integrate the natural and economic information in a comprehensive integrated coastal planning, management, and development framework. To achieve this objective, 19 coastal municipalities, three provinces, and one regional government, each with their sectoral services (and their sectoral management activities), needed to be "networked" to promote effective sharing of information and a coordinated approach to management. A "wide area network" was developed that includes other authorities, stakeholders, and the general public. The methodology used to support the network is based on (i) suitable and updated information about the coastal state, (ii) use of informed maintenance strategies, (iii) use of Environmental Impact Assessment and Strategic Environmental Assessment for the assessment of goodness of projects/plans, (iv) adoption of an Environmental Management System for structuring the management actions at various (administrative) levels, and (v) adoption of soft intervention technologies.

AB The ICZM project of Magnesia in Greece, funded under the EU LIFE Programme, has provided a first chance for experimentation on procedures for integrated coastal planning at the local level. In a country where the mechanisms and the procedures of planning have failed repetitively and been replaced by market mechanisms, the main objective was to set the appropriate conditions for sustainable coastal management. A first intervention was the creation of a strong database, a Geographical Information System (GIS), which aimed at the improvement of decision making. The second intervention was the experimentation with consultation and participation pro-cedures. At the end of this project we have the information tools that are necessary for the management of Magnesia's coastal zone and are wiser about consultation and participation procedures.

AB The Strymonikos project was part of the EU Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM) Demonstration Programme aiming at promoting concerted actions for the sustainable development of the Strymonikos coastal zone. There were three main problems that we had to face: (a) lack of data regarding the natural environment and human impacts, (b) complex jurisdictions of the bodies involved in the management of the area, and (c) the insufficient level of environmental awareness. These problems were tackled mainly through the following actions: (a) description and monitoring of the project zone, a necessary step for management planning, (b) establishment of a coordination scheme, a step toward integrated management, (c) establishment of an Information Centre for coastal zones in the Strymonikos area, a step to support environmental awareness and to promote cooperation. This step-by-step process and the problems that we have encountered are discussed.

AB Peru under Fujimori was a most likely candidate to deepen economic reforms because it had a dominant chief executive with a lengthy tenure, a rubber stamp legislature, and close collaboration between business and government. Nevertheless, its record of reform was mixed. Social interests play an important role in such market transitions. The move from crisis-induced reforms to the consolidation of reform is affected by shifting governing coalitions and changes in the interactions between state and business. The dominance of different groups across different phases of the economic restructuring process helps account for the slowdown of the market agenda.

TI Unmet expectations: The cycle of convertibility
SO DESARROLLO ECONOMICO-REVISTA DE CIENCIAS SOCIALES
LA Spanish
DT Article
ID CREDIBILITY
AB This paper studies the process that led to the Argentine crisis. The analysis concentrates on the sequence of public and private decisions, and the varying perceptions and incentives that motivated them. In the nineties Argentina searched for a new growth trend. During much of the period of convertibility, the behavior of agents (internal and external) seemed to be based on the anticipation that current and future incomes could sustain a value of domestic spending much higher than in the past. The government was motivated to reinforce those expectations, for political economy reasons and to "signal" its optimism about growth prospects. The convertibility monetary regime not only provided a very visible nominal anchor, but also operated as a basic framework for financial contracts, mostly denominated in dollars. Dollar contracting implicitly presumed that the dollar value of incomes would support the servicing of debts. Despite precautionary measures, overtime, more and more promises came to be predicated on the sustainability of the real exchange rate. In the late nineties exports stopped rising and the foreign supply of credit tightened. Facing these constraints, the economy contracted and the solvency of the government was put into question. The financial system was vulnerable both in the event of devaluation and that of a (large) deflation-cum-adjustment. As was implicit in its design and management, convertibility proved to have very large exit costs.

AB Using 1990 conditions, we modeled carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) biogeochemical cycles in croplands of China (and, for comparison, the United States) to estimate the annual soil organic-carbon (SOC) balance for all cropland. Overall, we estimate that China's croplands lost 1,.6% of their SOC (to a depth of 0.3 in) in 1990, and that U.S. cropland lost 0.1%. A key element in this difference was that similar to25% of aboveground crop residue in China was returned to the soil, compared to similar to90% in the United States. In China, SOC losses were greatest in the northeast (similar to10(3) kg C.ha(-1).yr(-1)), and were generally smaller (<0.5 X 10(3) kg C.ha(-1).yr(-1)) in regions with a longer cultivation history. Some regions showed SOC gains, generally <10(3) kg C.ha(-1).yr(-1). Reduced organic-matter input to China's cropland soils, and lower overall SOC levels in those soils, led to lower levels of N mineralization in the simulations, consistent with higher rates of synthetic-fertilizer application in China. C and N cycles are closely linked to soil fertility, crop yield, and non-point-source environmental pollution.

AB Since many renewable resource systems such as tropical and temperate forests, coral reefs, and wild fisheries are often exploited at unsustainable rates, studies aimed at reducing these trends have focused on the market failures associated with over-exploitation. Within this framework, the literature devised what we term supply-side policies to correct these market failures. Here we introduce demand-side policies into the mix of renewable resource and environmental management policies. These policies are designed to increase the demand for goods produced in a sustainable fashion by: (1) promoting the long-term conservation of natural capital assets, (2) promoting the attainment of economic efficiency, and (3) providing greater political acceptability relative to supply-side policies.

AB The flux of energy and materials constrains all organisms, and allometric relationships between rates of energy consumption and other biological rates are manifest at many levels of biological organization. Although human ecology is unusual in many respects, human populations also face energetic constraints. Here we present a model relating fertility rates to per capita energy consumption rates in contemporary human nations. Fertility declines as energy consumption increases with a scaling exponent of -1/3 as predicted by allometric theory. The decline may be explained by parental trade-offs between the number of children and the energetic investment in each child. We hypothesize that the -1/3 exponent results from the scaling properties of the networked infrastructure that delivers energy to consumers. This allometric analysis of human fertility offers a framework for understanding the demographic transition to smaller family sizes, with implications for human population growth, resource use and sustainability.

AB The steam-gasification of coal (peat, lignite, bituminous, and anthracite) into syngas is investigated using concentrated solar energy as the source of high-temperature process heat. The advantages of the solar-driven process are threefold: (1) the discharge of pollutants is avoided; (2) the gaseous products are not contaminated by combustion byproducts; and (3) the calorific value of the fuel is upgraded. A second-law analysis is carried out for a blackbody solar cavity-receiver/reactor operated at 1350 K and subjected to a mean solar flux concentration ratio of 2000. Two technically viable routes for generating electricity using the gasification products are examined: (1) syngas is used to fuel a 55%-efficient combined Brayton-Rankine cycle; and (2) syngas is further processed to H-2 (by water-gas shift reaction followed by H-2/CO2 separation) which is used to fuel a 65%-efficient fuel cell. The maximum exergy efficiency, defined as the ratio of electric power output to the thermal power input (solar power+heating value of reactants), reaches 50% for the combined cycle route and 46% for the fuel cell route. Both of these routes offer a net gain in the electrical output by a factor varying in the range 1.7-1.9, depending on the coal type and the power generation route, vis-a-vis the direct use of coal for fueling a 35%-efficient Rankine cycle. Specific CO2 emissions amounts to 0.49-0.56 kg CO2/kWh(e), about half as much as the specific emissions discharged by conventional coal-fired power plants. Solar/coal hybrid processes, such as the one examined in this paper, offer important intermediate solutions towards a sustainable energy supply system. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB Diesel engines are the prime movers for heavy duty vehicles used in the transportation and agricultural sectors. Diesel engines meet their energy requirement from stored fuels, i.e. petroleum products. The twin problems of both depletion of scarce resources and atmospheric pollution caused by vehicles run on petro-products are enticing researchers to find a viable and immediate alternative to fossil fuels.
   The physical and combustion properties of vegetable oils are close to those of petro-Diesel fuel, and in this context, vegetable oils can stand as an immediate candidate to substitute for stored fuels. Vegetable oils are produced from processing the seeds of various plants and, thus, are renewable in nature. Sustainable development of a country depends on the extent that it is managing and generating its own resources. This also helps in conservation of depleting non-renewable petro-products.
   However, due to inherent high viscosity and low volatility, vegetable oils would pose problems, such as fuel flow and poor atomization, and constrain their direct use in engines without any modifications.
   In the present investigation, the effect of supercharging is studied on the performance of a direct injection Diesel engine with the use of untreated cotton seed oil under varying injection pressures (IP's).
   The performance of the engine is evaluated in terms of brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC), exhaust gas temperature and smoke density. It is observed that when cotton seed oil is used as a fuel, there is a reduction in BSFC of about 15% when the engine is run at the recommended IP and supercharging pressure of 0.4 bar (g) in comparison with the engine operation run under naturally operated conditions.
   The investigation revealed that cotton seed oil, in general vegetable oils, can best be utilized if supercharging is employed at the recommended IP of the engine. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Urban development without more mobility by car? Lessons from Amsterdam,
   a multimodal urban region
SO ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING A
LA English
DT Article
AB The fundamental dilemma in attempts to make urban development less dependent upon mobility by car is the inability of alternatives to match the quality of accessibility provided by private motorized transport. Failure to recognize this means that bringing about environmentally more sustainable urban mobility patterns is only possible at economic, social, and political costs that are unacceptable in most societies. In this paper we identify and discuss ways out of this dilemma, in the form of solutions that pursue the goal of increasing both sustainability and accessibility. We start by contending that what people ask is not a generic mobility, but rather opportunities to participate in spatially disjointed activities. Accordingly, accessibility should be defined as the amount and the diversity of 'spatial opportunities' that can be reached within a certain amount of time. Solutions to the accessibility-sustainability dilemma building upon this perspective (that is, planning concepts, policy measures) have been the object of recent research at the Universiteit van Amsterdam and are discussed and we look for, and find, evidence of the feasibility of these solutions in the actual trends in the Amsterdam urban region. Some policy implications of the findings are discussed.

AB The new regional governance arrangements for England are raising profound challenges for the integration of planning, sustainable-development, and economic-development strategies. The authors examine how tensions are emerging in respect of efforts to provide employment sites for large-scale inward investments, using the contrasting experiences of the South East and North East of England during the period 1997-2001. Some major ideological faultlines between national control over plan making and regional aspirations to devise distinctive approaches to planning for regional development are revealed.

AB In peri-urban areas in low-income countries, conventional centralized approaches to wastewater management have generally failed to address the needs of communities for the collection and disposal of domestic wastewater and faecal sludges from on-site sanitation. There are opportunities for implementing wastewater management systems based on a decentralized approach that may offer opportunities for wastewater re-use and resource recovery as well as improvements in local environmental health conditions. Decentralized approaches may also offer increased opportunities for local stakeholder participation in planning and decision-making, and the paper emphasizes the importance of building the capacity of local organizations in all aspects of decentralized wastewater management. Using examples of functioning systems, the paper discusses the operational sustainability of decentralized technologies for wastewater management in peri-urban areas and their associated management requirements, The paper concludes that a concerted capacity-building effort is required to overcome the constraints that hinder the implementation and sustainability of decentralized wastewater systems, and proposes a framework for achieving this goal.

AB A careful selection of waste dumpsites, particularly hazardous ones, is very important for sustainable water resources management. Several laboratory experiments were carried out on the field samples to study adsorption capacity using p-dichlorobenzene (a solvent used in various industrial processes) as the test contaminant. The effect of parameters such as organic matter, clay, and iron and aluminium. oxides, which are known to influence the soil adsorption capacity, are studied in the present work. Several soil samples from the Patancheru Industrial Area (Hyderabad, India) were collected and characterized. Only three soils, which had a comparatively high percentage of organic matter, clay, iron and aluminium oxide contents were used for the adsorption studies. The results clearly indicated a decrease in the adsorption capacity of the soils by as much as 75% when organic matter was removed. The other parameters such as clay and iron and aluminium oxides also play an important role in adsorption (57 and 39.8% reduction respectively). It was observed that out of the selected factors organic matter in the soils has the maximum effect regarding the adsorption of p-dichlorobenzene. Since the selected soils contain comparatively more organic matter, clay and iron and aluminium oxides in the selected industrial area, these can be used as sites for dumping hazardous waste, which can be further treated by methods like bioremediation.

ID MANAGEMENT
AB Fuzzy cognitive mapping was used to develop a participatory ecosystem management plan for Uluabat Lake, Turkey. Interviews were conducted with stakeholders belonging to six different groups. Lake pollution was the most central and most mentioned variable for stakeholders. Stakeholder groups agree that lake pollution is negatively affecting ecosystem health and thereby local economies. Thus, reducing lake pollution was chosen as the overall goal for the management plan. Possible ways to reduce lake pollution and increase ecosystem health were seen differently by the different groups. Hunters, factory managers, NGO personnel, and local people thought industry was the main cause of lake pollution, while officials from the government and local municipalities thought roads and urban development contributed the most to lake pollution. Generally the stakeholder groups did not perceive their own actions as affecting the lake as strongly as other groups thought. For example, factory managers viewed factory pollution as negatively affecting the lake but less strongly than the other groups did. According to policy option simulations, reducing lake pollution had positive effects on all variables, especially fish, birds, animal husbandry, irrigation, agriculture, and the ecological balance of the lake. Results of this analysis were used to facilitate meetings among stakeholder groups and to develop a participatory ecosystem management plan. The analysis was useful for pointing out the similarities as well as the differences among the groups. It also helped the facilitators understand the focus of each stakeholder group and enabled them to suggest activities in which each group would want to participate.

ID DENITRIFICATION
AB Biological wastewater treatment is not typically used for wastewater with high nitrate and carbonaceous content. Hence, facilities demonstrating effective treatment are of interest to the worldwide environmental community. DuPont's Nylon Intermediates manufacturing plant at Victoria, Texas. started operating such a wastewater facility approximately three years ago. The new wastewater management facility features an innovative anoxic/oxic (A/O) biological treatment plant, a constructed wetland, and land application pilot area for demonstrating beneficial reuse of the biosolids. The wastewater treatment process is working well, with Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) removal above 99%,, complete removal of nitrate and nitrite, and 100% permit compliance, since start-up. The wetland has exceeded expectations for polishing, buffering, and community value. Land application has demonstrated beneficial reuse of biosolids by producing excellent quality hay, which is being fed to animals in a non-human food chain pathway. The waste treatment facility has won numerous awards including the 2001 Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission (TNRCC) Award for Wetland Education, the 2000 Water Environmental Federation (WEF) Industrial Water Quality Award, the 2001 WEF Award for Education, and the 2002 DuPont Sustainable Growth Award.

AB The components of social costs included in the supply analysis are cash outlays and opportunity costs associated with harvest and alternative residue uses, potential environmental damage that is avoided by excluding unsuitable land, and costs in moving residues from farms to processing plants. Regional estimates account for the growing conditions and crops of the main agricultural areas of the United States. Estimates include the main U. S. field crops with potential for residue harvest: corn, wheat, sorghum, oats, barley, rice and cane sugar. The potential contribution of residues to U. S. energy needs is discussed.

AB The transition to an implicitly solar-based energy system can make use of various specific biomass energy systems. This paper provides economic and environmental indicators for evaluating alternative options. The paper proceeds in three empirical steps. First, an expert survey supplies the primary biomass potentials available for non-food use in Austria and their respective costs. Second, an inquiry into investment, operating and financing costs of 30 different biomass energy use systems allows a standardized comparison among them and their relationship to fossil reference technologies. Third, a computable general equilibrium model of the Austrian economy is employed to quantify the impacts of fostering the use of distinct biomass energy technologies. The results allow us to distinguish between those technologies that tend to lead to an increase in both GDP and employment (e.g., combined heat and power production from sewage sludge biogas), to an increase only in employment, while GDP tends to diminish (e.g., district heating based on agricultural pellets) or to a decline in both (e.g., co-firing based on wood-chips, bark or industrial pellets). Individual technologies could account for up to one third of Austrias Kyoto obligation, while combinations of technologies, triggered by a combined CO2 tax and biomass energy subsidy for example, could almost fully lead to Austrian Kyoto-compliance.

AB Intestinal schistosomiasis is undergoing a rapid increase in magnitude in Finchaa Sugar Estate in Ethiopia. A pilot control trial of intestinal schistosomiasis was instituted in 1995 to reduce the magnitude of the disease and introduce sustainable schistosomiasis control approaches in the Sugar Estate. Following initial parasitological survey of all the camps in the Sugar Project area in 1995 using Kato method, mass chemotherapy of the heavily infected residents of Camp 7 and selective treatment of lightly infected residents of other camps were made using praziquantel. Endod (type 44) was applied to transmission sites along Fekerie stream in Camp 7 on quarterly basis whenever Biomphalaria pfeifferi was detected Other inputs to the project as parts of capacity building included transplantation of Endod cuttings (type 44), training and health education. Cross sectional parasitological surveys were made in 1998 to assess the impact of the pilot control trial. The results of stool examination showed that the prevalence of schistosomiasis was reduced from 30% in 1995 to 26% in 1998 among residents of Camp 7 and the intensity of infection from 198 eggs per gram of feces (EPG) in 1995 to 85 EPG in 1998. Similarly, the prevalence of infection among children in Finchaa Valley Elementary School was reduced from 78% in 1994 to 56% in 1998 and the reduction in respective intensity of infection was from 283 EPG to 114 EPG. Although significant reduction in the magnitude of the disease was not achieved, the control activities were taken over by the Sugar Project Polyclinic to ensure sustainability. In addition to chemotherapy and snail control using Endod, other disease non-specific methods such as health education should be used to get maximum benefit from such facilities as latrines, and ensure participation of the community in order to sustain the control activities.

TI Sustainable water management policy: Lessons from Amsterdam
SO EUROPEAN PLANNING STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
AB This article focuses on the identification of critical water policy instruments, and opportunities and barriers to transforming urban water use in a sustainable and efficient direction in Amsterdam (The Netherlands). The main lessons that can be inferred from past and current water policies and management practices in Amsterdam show (1) the relevance of common action for increasing the quality of or general control over water resources when shared interests of different actors using the same water resource are present, (2) that the effectiveness and applicability of water policy instruments are strongly conditional upon receiving the support of both water users and suppliers; (3) that the governance structure of water provision plays a crucial role in increasing the efficiency of water use.

TI London: Structural continuities and institutional change in water
   management
SO EUROPEAN PLANNING STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
AB This article provides a synthetic account of the historical development of London's water supply system within its wider national context, and addresses the current organizational setting of the water sector. Particular attention is paid to the post-Second World War period, which marked a transition towards integrated water management in England and Wales, a trend that has been consolidated since the 1970s. The article emphasizes the continuities and contradictions arising from the different combinations of public and private management strategies characterizing the UK water sector, and their implications for the sustainable management of water resources. It argues that there exists an in-built contradiction in the current institutional framework between the profit-oriented rationale of the private operators and the goals of efficiency, equity, and environmental sustainability pursued by the water regulators. Within this framework, it highlights the key policy issues facing the metropolitan water systems, and suggests what their most likely trajectories might be in the foreseeable future.

   spatial storylines for Pan-European transport investments
SO EUROPEAN PLANNING STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
ID SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT; DISCOURSE; POLICY; RATIONALITY; ENVIRONMENT;
   IDENTITY
AB This article undertakes a discourse-centred investigation of the underlying rationales of European Union (EU) transport-sector investments. Its central contribution is the 'Conflicting-Storylines Proposition', stating that EU transport investments lack consistence and sustainability due to the existence of partially complementary, partially competing EU development objectives which are in turn expressed through four key storylines: 'cohesion" 'poylcentricity, 'missing links' and, most recently, 'bottlenecks'. EU decision-making remains deeply conflicted and contested. Transport sector investments have to satisfy different aims related to growth, competitiveness, cohesion and sustainability. The Trans-European Network priority projects violate cohesion and sustainable development goals by concentrating investments in already privileged areas.

SO EXPERIMENTAL AGRICULTURE
LA English
DT Article
ID ETHYLENE
AB The effect of Ethrel on the yield and sugar content of coconut (Cocos nucfiera) inflorescence sap and sustainability of productivity was investigated on forty-year-old tall coconut palms (var. typica) at Bandirippuwa Estate, Lunuwila, Sri Lanka. Ethrel was applied at a concentration of 2.5% and the volume and sugar content of the sap were measured. Application of Ethrel consistently increased the yield per day, yield per spadix, yield per palm per annum and sugar content in the sap for a period of four years. The removal of carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium and magnesium with the sap was greater from Ethrel-treated than from untreated palms, and this was attributed mainly to the enhanced sap yields and sugar concentrations.

ID FISHERIES
AB Regional differentiation in fleet characteristics and economic efficiency, as well as the total elasticity of scale in the commercial fishing fleets of the Brazilian Amazon were analysed. Data were collected in 893 interviews with boat operators in four major ports on the River Amazon. Boats operating from the largest cities (Belem and Manaus) are mostly operated by hired skippers and non-permanent crews, while boats from smaller cities (Santarem and Tefe) are mostly owner-operated and use permanent crews. In the lower Amazon, a large proportion of fishermen (89% in Santarem and 53% in Belem) are based in rural areas, while in the upper Amazon commercial fishermen are predominantly urban-based. A production function analysis identified boat length, gear type used (gill net/purse seine), number of fishermen employed, quantities of fuel and ice used, and education level of the skipper as significant factors determining the catch. The analysis provided no evidence of regional differences in stock levels. The use of purse seines was associated with significantly higher catches (by 32%), all other factors being equal. Purse seines are banned in the lower Amazon (Santarem and Belem), and this results in overall lower levels of technical efficiency in this region. No significant total scale effect on efficiency was detected. These results are discussed with respect to the institutional sustainability of current fisheries co-management initiatives.

AB The life history and population dynamics of the finetooth shark (Carcharhinus isodon) in the northeastern Gulf of Mexico were studied by determining age, growth, size-at-maturity, natural mortality, productivity, and elasticity of vital rates of the population. The von Bertalanffy growth model was estimated as L-t=1559 min TL (1-e(-0.24 (t+2.07))) for females and L-t=1337 min TL (1-e(-0.41 (t+1.39))) for males. For comparison, the Fabens growth equation was also fitted separately to observed size-at-age data, and the fits to the data were found to be similar. The oldest aged specimens were 8.0 and 8.1 yr, and theoretical longevity estimates were 14.4 and 8.5 yr for females and males, respectively. Median length at maturity was 1187 and 1230 min TL, equivalent to 3.9 and 4.3 yr for males and females, respectively. Two scenarios, based on the results of the two equations used to describe growth, were considered for population modeling and the results were similar. Annual rates of survivorship estimated through five methods ranged from 0.850/yr to 0.607/yr for scenario 1 and from 0.840/yr to 0.590/yr for scenario 2. Productivities were 0.041/yr for scenario 1 and 0.038/yr for scenario 2 when the population level that produces maximum sustainable yield is assumed to occur at an instantaneous total mortality rate (Z) equaling 1.5 M, and were 0.071/yr and 0.067/yr, when Z=2 M for scenario 1 and 2, respectively. Mean generation time was 6.96 yr and 6.34 yr for scenarios 1 and 2, respectively. Elasticities calculated through simulation of Leslie matrices averaged 12.6% (12.1% for scenario 2) for fertility, 47.7% (46.2% for scenario 2) for juvenile survival, and 39.7% (41.6% for scenario 2) for adult survival. In all, the finetooth shark exhibits life-history and population characteristics intermediate to those of sharks in the small coastal complex and those from some large coastal species, such as the blacktip shark (Carcharhinus limbatus).

SO FISHERY BULLETIN

ID BANK
AB An intensive commercial hook-and-line fishing operation targeted the demersal fisheries resources at Saya de Malha Bank in the Southwest Indian Ocean. Fishing was conducted with 12 dories that were equipped with echo sounders and electric fishing reels and supported by a refrigerated mothership. Over a 13-day period in the 55-130 m depth range, a total of 74.3 metric tons (t) of fish were caught, of which the crimson jobfish(Pristipomoides filamen-tosus) represented 80%. Catch rates decreased with time and could not be attributed to changes in location, climatic conditions,fishing depth, fishing method, or bait type. The initial virgin biomass of P. filamentosus available to a line fishery at the North Western promontory of Saya de Malha Bank was estimated at 72.6 t through application of the Leslie model to daily catch and effort data. Biomass densities of 2364 kg/km(2) and 1206 kg/km were obtained by applying the initial biomass estimates to the surface area and to the length of the dropoff that was fished. The potential sustainable yield prior to exploitation was estimated at 567 kg/km(2) per year. The quantity of P. filamentosus caught by the mothership-dory fishing operation represented 82% of the initial biomass available to a hook-and-line fishery, equivalent to more that three times the estimated maximum sustainable yield. The results of the study are important to fisheries managers because they demonstrate that intensive line fishing operations have the potential to rapidly deplete demersal fisheries resources.

AB The natural disturbance model of forest management is the basis of many of the, sustainable forest management systems being proposed for the boreal forest of Canada. Wildfire is the dominant natural agent of disturbance in the boreal mixed-wood forest. The natural disturbance model assumes that timber harvesting systems emulating the annual area burned by natural fire, its spatial distribution, and the amount of,residual material can be developed. It is further assumed that natural processes can be emulated closely enough to maintain forest biota at natural or near-natural population levels. This is a coarse filter approach to ecosystem management.
   In order to emulate the natural rate of disturbance, one needs to quantify it. The annual area burned in the study area, under natural conditions, is characterized as a random draw from a lognormal distribution. A modeling system comprised of an aspatial Monte Carlo simulation model and a linear programming based forest activity scheduling model was developed. The simulation model is used to develop 200 yr forecasts of probability distributions for habitat area of five vertebrate species under a stochastic wildfire regime. These probability distributions are Used to construct habitat area constraints for use in an optimization model to help quantify the trade-offs between timber values and maintenance of the range of natural variability in the forest.
   The model is used to identify the trade-offs between forest harvesting, wildlife habitat, and the degree of similarity between the managed forest structure and the distribution of structures that could be generated by natural disturbance.

AB The impact of arable and forest land use on soil pH, carbon and nitrogen concentrations and storages, and vegetation was investigated 27 years after a first survey in the loess region of lower Frankonia, Germany (sites Rodheim and Essfeld). At the two experimental sites, 8 luvisols and stagnic luvisols were described in the field, classified, sampled and analyzed. The pH values (KCl) increased in the arable soils after 27 years down to 120 cm depth by about one unit to 7.2. The development of the soil reaction under forest was more heterogeneous and did not show any temporal trend. In the forest soils the storage of both soil organic carbon and total nitrogen (1 m depth) clearly increased within 27 years. C-org storage in Rodheim and Essfeld was 103.4 and 104.4 t ha(-1) (1969: 90.9 and 92,7 t ha(-1)), respectively, while the N-t-stocks amounted to 12.4 and 13.0 t ha(-1) (1969: 9.6 and 11.4 t ha). The largest difference was found in the top soil horizons, where in the Ah-horizon under forest the organic carbon and total nitrogen increased to about 80%. In the arable soils the carbon stocks decreased in Rodheim from 98.1 to 91.1 t ha(-1) and in Essfeld from 85.3 to 83.7 t ha(-1), respectively. However; the N stocks increased in a way similar to the forest soils from 12.0 to 14.6 t ha(-1) (Rodheim), and from 11.0 t to 13.1 t ha(-1) (Essfeld), respectively. Again, as in the forest sites, the largest changes in the arable soils occurred in the humic A horizons.
   The intensively used Rodheim forest (Galio - Carpinetum asaretosum) is patched and highly influenced by forest management. The high site heterogeneity causes a mosaicly; small-scaled ground vegetation pattern. In the Essfeld community forest (Galio - Carpinetum asaretosum) a sustainable forest management dominates with selective harvesting and results in a close-tonature structure. The species structure in both forests strongly changed during the 28 (32) years since the first survey towards plants indicating eutrophication and ruderal environment. At both arable sites the percentage cover of typical weeds and the number of accompanying species decreased. The species spectrum increased in favor of persistent weeds such as Cirsium arvense, Elytrigia repens and Poa annua at the expense of more sensitive species such as Papaver rhoeas, Myosotis arvensi, Aethusa cynapium, Anagallis arvenris, Viola arvensis and Cerastium glomeratum.

TI Towards community engagement: six steps to expert learning for future

SO FUTURES
LA English
DT Article
ID ENVIRONMENTAL VALUES
AB This paper describes a variety of facilitated exercises for use in collaborative workshops where experts are brought together to create archetypes that feed into the design of alternative scenarios for the future of their area of expertise (e.g., forestry, housing, transportation, food systems and waste). In this case, these workshops were designed to aid in the development of a computer-based sustainability tool (GB-Quest) that supports a larger process of community engagement and dialogue focused on sustainability in the southwestern portion of British Columbia, Canada. Value-focused thinking and a narrative-based structure provided the framework for this dialogue and a template for asking hard questions about the assumptions and biases related to the alternatives. Using examples, this paper outlines and details this process and then suggests possible next steps in this ongoing process. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Climate protection and newly industrialized countries: dilemmas and

SO GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS
LA English
DT Article
DE climate change; sustainable development; energy policy; integrated
   assessment
AB Global climate policy currently is making efforts to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions of industrialized countries through implementation of the Kyoto Protocol. Yet, the development of greenhouse gas emissions in newly industrialized and developing countries is deeply influencing the perspectives of stabilizing the global climate system. This study takes a closer look at the challenges facing Taiwan as an illustrative example to analyze the trends of greenhouse gas emissions, to assess current strategies and their controversies, and to explore strategies for mobilizing national climate policies. Analyzing the aspects of emission caps, carbon taxes, and clean development mechanisms may shed light on the necessity of involving newly industrialized countries and joint reduction into global climate protection schemes. Hopefully, this analysis may provide inspiring insights about the international climate regime and to other newly industrialized and developing countries which can then adopt effective policies for stabilizing the global climate system.

TI After the public interest prevails: The political sustainability of
   policy reform
SO GOVERNANCE-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION
LA English
DT Article
ID PATH DEPENDENCE; INSTITUTIONS
AB The prevailing political science wisdom is that narrow interests regularly triumph over the general public. Yet the stunning passage of broad-based policy reforms in the face of intense clientele opposition suggests that the U.S. political system has a greater capacity to serve diffuse interests than has often been thought. Some of the most provocative policy-oriented political-science research during the 1980s and 1990s examined how these surprising reform victories occurred. Unfortunately, general-interest reforms do not always stick; reforms may be corrupted or reversed after their enactment. The long-term sustainability of any given policy reform hinges on the successful reworking of political institutions and on the generation of positive policy-feedback effects, especially the empowerment of social groups with a stake in the reform's maintenance. This paper explores the postenactment dynamics of three canonical instances Of general-interest reform legislation: tax reform, agricultural subsidy reform, and airline deregulation. Only in the airline-deregulation case has the self-reinforcing dynamic required for political sustainability been unmistakably evident. For analysts and advocates of general-interest reform measures alike, the clear lesson is to attend far more closely to what happens after reforms become law.

AB New vaccines and drug treatments are needed for tackling the neglected diseases (NDs) of poor countries. These diseases are associated with high levels of mortality and/or morbidity, but lack appropriate vaccines and drug treatments because of bacterial resistance, toxicity, long-treatment protocols, problems with administration or because none are available. Current initiatives directed at research and development (R&D) of NDs are being led predominantly by the governmental, inter-governmental and private not-for-profit sectors implemented by way of public-private partnerships. Push and pull mechanisms targeted at the pharmaceutical industry have also been proposed as another way to stimulate RD of NDs; however, these should be viewed with some caution. Stimulating R&D for NDs is important as part of a wider long-term public health strategy and must be addressed simultaneously with resolving more immediate problems of access to medicines and health system sustainability in less developed countries.

ID IMPACT; AFRICA
AB The paper examines health sector reforms in Kenya at the district level based on the Government of Kenya's Health Policy Framework of 1994. The authors present the context of and historical perspective to health sector reforms in Kenya and discuss the major reform policies including decentralization to the district level. The authors then review intended policy outcomes, investigating assumptions on which the implementation and effectiveness of the reform agenda at the local level are based. The authors argue that emphasis on outcomes rather than process have not supported sustainable reforms or achieved the government's goal of improving health and ensuring equity for the citizens of the country.

DE Vaccinium corymbosum; dry weight; growth; partitioning; canopy;
   harvesting
AB The following pruning treatments were studied in mature 'Bluecrop' (1996-2000) and 'Berkeley' (1996-98) plants: 1) "conventional" pruning with removal of unproductive canes, thinning of 1-year-old shoots at the base of the bush, and removal of any unproductive wood or thinning of excessive fruiting wood near the top of the bush, as required; 2) "speed" pruning involving removal of one or two of the most unproductive canes at the base of the bush; and 3) "un-pruned" where no pruning was done for the length of this study. Conventional pruning took an average of 6.4 min/plot, while speed pruning saved 88.8% time. There was no pruning treatment effect on the percentage of fruit buds in 'Berkeley' (42%) or 'Bluecrop' (34%) or percent fruit set (70% to 90%, depending on cultivar and year) in any year. Un-pruned plants of both cultivars had significantly greater yield than conventionally pruned plants, depending on the year, while speed pruning generally resulted in intermediate yields. Un-pruned and, speed-pruned plants produced berries that were 19% to 27% smaller than conventionally pruned plants, depending on year. The fruit harvest season of un-pruned plants began 3 to 5 days later and lasted a week longer than that of conventionally pruned plants. The harvest efficiency of un-pruned plants was reduced as much as 51% in the later years of this study and was most closely correlated with berry weight. Conventionally pruned plants had a significantly higher percentage of the above-ground dry weight allocated to 1-year-old wood and crown than un-pruned plants. In 'Bluecrop', N concentration tended to be higher in the crown of conventionally pruned plants than in un-pruned or speed-pruned plants. Conventionally pruned 'Bluecrop' plants had significantly higher concentrations of K and P and lower N than un-pruned plants and 'Berkeley' had lower concentrations of N, than un-pruned plants. Results indicate that not pruning mature plants may be an option in the short-term, but may have undesirable effects for long-term sustainability.

AB This study evaluates the applicability and sensitivity of fish population dynamics modeling in assessing the potential effects of individual chemicals on population sustainability and recovery. Fish reproductive health is all increasingly important issue for ecological risk assessment following international concern over endocrine disruption. Life-history data from natural brook trout and fathead minnow populations were combined with effects data from laboratory-based studies, mainly concerning species other than brook trout and fathead minnows, to assess the likely impact of nonylphenol (NP) and methoxychlor (MXC) on brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) and fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas) population size. A delay differential equation (DDE) model with a 1-day timestep was used to predict the population dynamics of the brook trout and fathead minnows. The model predicts that NP, could enhance populations by tip to 17% at a concentration of 30 mug l(-1) based oil the results of reduction in survival and increased fecundity from life-cycle toxicity tests, however attempting to allow for growth reduction and its effect on fecundity results in a prediction of a 28% reduction in population numbers. For fathead minnows the DDE model predicts that the same concentration of NP could cause a population reduction of 21%. The differences in these predictions are related to these two species having different life history strategies, which are considered in the parameterization of the model. Post-application concentrations of MXC may peak around 300 mug l(-1) and then decline rapidly with time. Predictions show that such applications could cause a reduction of up to 30% in brook trout populations if the application occurs at the peak of the spawning season on successive years but that the effect would be less than 1% if the spawning season is avoided. Effects on the fathead minnow population size are predicted to be smaller (<4%) even if application occurs during the spawning period. Risk based statistics generated by the population dynamics models, Such as interval decline risk or quasiextinction risk and predicted time to recovery complement traditional effects parameters such as LC50 and LOEC and may ultimately prove to be more useful in risk assessment.

AB Suzhou City, located at the lower reaches of the Yangtze River in southeastern Jiangsu Province, is one of the few cities in China which suffer from severe ground settlement. A research project was carried out to investigate this problem. Geological and hydrogeological studies show that there is a multi-layered aquifer system with three distinct, soft mud layers of marine and lagoonal origins. An examination of historical records of groundwater extraction, water levels, and ground settlement shows that the ground subsidence is associated with the continuously increasing groundwater extraction in the deep, confined aquifer. It is believed that the consolidation of the soft mud layers, especially the third layer which is thick and close to the main pumped aquifer, contributes to the ground settlement. A three-dimensional finite difference numerical model representing the multi-layered aquifer system was developed to study the ground settlement in response to groundwater extraction. By calibrating the model with both the measured groundwater level and ground settlement, the aquifer parameters were estimated. The model outputs fit reasonably well with the observed results, which indicates that the numerical model can reproduce the dynamic processes of both groundwater flow and soil consolidation. The hydraulic conductivity of the third mud layer near the center of the ground settlement has been reduced by over 30% in the last 14 years. The gradual deterioration in the hydraulic conductivity of the mud may have significant adverse effect on the sustainable groundwater resource of the deep confined aquifer, since the recharge from the shallow aquifers through the mud layer is the only source of water to the deep aquifer. An analysis of the spatial distributions of groundwater drawdown and ground settlement shows that the area with maximum drawdown is not necessarily the area with maximum ground settlement due to the occurrence of the soft mud layer. A simple reallocation in pumping rates on the basis of the spatial distribution of the thick mud layer could significantly reduce the ground settlement.

AB There has been a fishery for the great scallop, Pecten maximus, around the Isle of Man, since 1937. Research up to the end of the 1980s suggested that these scallop stocks were in continuous decline. The fishery is now largely dependent on the strength of each recruiting year-class, placing it at considerable risk from recruitment failure. This study utilised data on the spat settlement, age structure, abundance and commercial catch rates of scallops, collected between 1987 and 2001, to examine recent population dynamics and the potential for predicting future catch rates. Spat settlement was generally low, but there were two exceptionally strong year-classes. Surveys of the stock revealed high exploitation rates during each fishing season (November to May inclusive) with variable recovery due to recruitment by the following October. In 1997/1998, scallop catch rates reached a 20-year high on several grounds and have generally remained high since. The strong spat settlements in 1989 and particularly 1994 were largely responsible for recent rises in catch rates, although the maintenance of high catch rates between 1999 and 2001 has occurred despite poor spat settlement between 1995 and 2000. Within stock surveys, the density of 2-year-old scallops was generally an accurate predictor of the density of 3- and 4-year-old scallops, 1-2 years later. The nature and strength of these relationships varied considerably between fishing grounds due to spatial variation in both scallop biology and patterns of exploitation. Results from fishery independent surveys did not always correlate well with commercial catch rates, however, suggesting the need for an expansion of the survey on some grounds. Overall, our study indicated that current levels of exploitation appear to be sustainable in the Isle of Man scallop fishery. Our results also demonstrated that monitoring of both spat settlement and the abundance of juveniles has considerable potential for predicting future catch rates of commercial sized scallops.

AB This paper explores the impact that recent structural reforms have had upon macro-to-micro linkages, as well as upon the pattern of production specialization, the entry and exit of firms during the adjustment process, and the 'sources' of technical change in the present more open and deregulated Latin American macroeconomic scenarios. From this exploration a major question emerges: is the new 'market-oriented' development paradigm sustainable in the long run? The interpretation presented in this paper suggests that the present pattern of production specialization-strongly biased in favour of industries featuring low domestic knowledge generation and value-added content-and the inhibition of local R&D and engineering activities resulting from the rapid expansion of internationally integrated production systems are pushing Latin American economies into a 'low development trap' from which it might prove extremely difficult to escape on the basis exclusively of free market principles.

AB The Internet fosters the integration of business processes across the supply chain by facilitating the information flows necessary for coordinating business activities. However, the Internet also supports the use of market mechanisms, such as auctions, that foster price competition. Using market mechanisms is less likely to generate a sustainable competitive advantage, but they might offer the opportunity to purchase some items at a lower price. Managers have the challenge of selecting the Internet-enabled coordination mechanism that best fits the needs of a variety of business situations in the supply chain. The authors present a framework to assist managers with this decision. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

AB In recent years, much has been written and debated about the multi-lay market and the concept of having single dedicated service providers that design, project manage and install all the utilities necessary to serve new developments. With the southern Scotland and northern England multi-lay markets well established, attention is now focusing on the future of the market elsewhere in the UK, and especially within London and across the South East.
   What is becoming increasingly clear in the South East is the scale and depth of business growth opportunities available, driven primarily by recent and forthcoming legislative changes, the ever-increasing housing demand, the trend towards sustainable communities endorsed by Planning and Policy Guidelines 25 (PPG25), and the emergence of the 'build to contract' housing market.
   Thames Water is one of several companies that has anticipated these market changes and has, since 2000, proactively worked with national housebuilders to develop a value-for-money, hassle-free multi-lay service. Working within a geographical area that has previously seemed resistant to the multi-lay concept, Thames Water is rapidly growing and transforming its own water and wastewater connections business into one that is well-placed to be a multi-utility connections business. Whilst still relatively modest in the scale of its multi-lay operations, it has nonetheless secured thirty large-scale multi-lay installation contracts since the beginning of 2002 across the south east, equating to approximately 4,000 genuine multi-lay connections.

AB The study examines condensation as a microclimate process. It focuses first on finding a reliable method for measuring condensation and then on testing a numerical model for predicting condensation rates. The study site is the Glowworm Cave, a heavily used tourist cave in New Zealand. Preservation of the cave and its management as a Sustainable tourist resource are high priorities. Here, as in other caves, condensation in carbon dioxide enriched air can lead to corrosion of calcite features. Specially constructed electronic sensors for measuring on-going condensation, as well as evaporation of the condensate, are tested. Measurements of condensation made over a year are used to test a physical model of condensation in the cave defined as a function of the vapour gradient between the cave air and condensation surface and a convection transfer coefficient. The results show that the amount and rate of condensation can be accurately measured and predicted. Air exchange with the outside can increase or decrease condensation rates, but the results show that the convection transfer coefficient remains constant. Temporal patterns of condensation in the cave are identified, as well as factors that influence these. Short-term and longer-term temporal variations of condensation rates are observed and patterns explained. Seasonal changes are large, with higher condensation rates occurring in the warmer months and lower rates during the cooler months. It is shown that controlling air exchange between the cave and the outside can influence condensation. This and other aspects of cave management are discussed.

AB Sugarcane (interspecific hybrids of Saccharum spp.) farmers throughout the world face constant challenges to sustain production and profitability while growing their crop in an ecologically sound manner. An agricultural system that successfully meets these challenges is defined as a system of integrated crop management. The purpose of this article is to review recent research that contributes to improved applications of integrated crop management in sugarcane. Agronomic research topics reviewed included improved yields in continuous sugarcane rotations, geographic information systems, modeling, and optimization of fertilizers. Contributions of both traditional and molecular genetics were reviewed as well as recent research advances in sugarcane pathology, entomology, and weed control. The sustainable relationship between sugarcane fields and factories was also described. The review demonstrated that specific challenges facing sugarcane growers differ among regions and countries. However, a research approach that is widely used to resolve these issues is to incorporate the principles of integrated crop management-productivity, profitability, and ecological soundness.

AB The paper develops a general equilibrium framework to examine the economic implications of population aging in Japan. Particular attention is paid to aggregate saving behavior, which is modeled on the basis of empirical age-earnings profiles using a life-cycle approach. The paper estimates the output loss caused by demographic changes and assesses the impact of aging on Japan's government finances. Key fiscal policy options to address the consequences of aging are also compared with respect to their effects on growth and welfare. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Enhancing the indigenous ability of biological N-2 fixation (BNF) in paddy soils to increase N fertility is important to develop Sustainable rice cultivation systems. This study aimed at evaluating the effect of light conditions and long-term soil management on the seasonal changes in the BNF activity of paddy soils associated with the decomposition of rice straw and cellulose, by determining the acetylene reduction activity (ARA) and N enrichment in the Tohoku region of Japan Under cool temperate conditions. ARA of the straw applied on the soil surface showed a peak in the mid-cropping season in the summer. The ARA of the straw applied in autumn was 30% of that in spring application. Carbon use efficiency for N enrichment with cellulose was about 3 times higher under light than dark conditions. Among the long-term soil management practices, continuous application of fresh organic materials such as rice straw and manure considerably enhanced N enrichment and ARA. In the soil without P, the inhibition of N enrichment by the low P availability appeared in the early cropping season. Soils from paddy fields converted to upland fields (hereafter referred to as "converted upland soils") showed the highest level of N enrichment when the soils were amended with cellulose. The highest level of N enrichment with and without cellulose amendment was estimated to be 1.6-2.0 g m(-2) in one cropping season. The results indicated the important contribution of BNF even under cool temperate conditions and the significant effect of soil management related to organic matter application and the water regime on the magnitude of BNF and, therefore, possibly on the N cycling of the paddy soil systems.

AB Effective utilization of the biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) activity is important for enhancing the N fertility of paddy soils and for developing sustainable rice cultivation systems. To analyze the soil factors that affect BNF in paddy soils, in this study, the effects of the temperature, water regime, and long-term soil management on N-15(2) fixation were examined in relation to the decomposition of organic matter in incubation experiments. Within the range of 15-30degreesC, heterotrophic N-15(2) fixation under dark conditions changed almost proportionally to the fori-nation of CO2+CH4 With glucose and straw as C sources by increasing the temperature, while the C use efficiency (N-2 fixed/(CO2+CH4)) was relatively higher at low temperatures in the presence of cellulose. The examination of the effect of the water regime on heterotrophic N-15(2) fixation indicated that flooding after aerobic conditions promoted heterotrophic N-15(2) fixation as well as the decomposition of cellulose. Among the soils with different types of management, the soils amended with manure and rice straw showed the largest photodependent N-15(2) fixation. On the other hand, the soils with a lower content of mineralizable-N tended to depend more on heterotrophic N-15(2) fixation. Soils from paddy fields converted into upland fields (hereafter referred to as "converted upland soils"), particularly showed a high heterotrophic N-15(2) fixation. Overall, it appeared that the management of organic matter application and the water regime may result in significant variations in BNF in paddy soils. The results obtained suggested that further studies should be conducted on the C and N metabolism involved in BNF during the decomposition processes of organic matter along with the changes in the soil redox status to identify methods for efficient soil management to promote BNF.

AB 1. Concepts of ecosystem stability, resilience and resistance have been discussed theoretically for nearly three decades. Understanding the effects of habitat disturbance and mechanisms of recovery in practice are vital for successful conservation management and restoration, particularly of subseral communities with high conservation interest and sites subject to unavoidable disturbances. Chalk grasslands are one such habitat, with high European conservation importance, and the greatest remaining extent in north-west Europe lies within the Salisbury Plain Training Area (SPTA), the largest UK military training area. In order to understand the resistance and recovery of this habitat type, we undertook an experimental approach using imposed disturbance treatments.
   2. An experiment was designed to compare the disturbance effects of a Land Rover, a truck and a Challenger II tank on a tall Bromopsis erecta -dominated chalk grassland community on the SPTA. Permanent quadrats were established on a site experimentally disturbed by single and multiple passes of the three vehicles and a tank turn (slew). Post-disturbance changes were recorded in the vegetation and soils in permanent quadrats.
   3. One year after the disturbance, all the treatments still had significant soil compaction effects and all treatments except the single Land Rover pass resulted in a significant reduction in sward height. The grassland community sampled was significantly less resistant to disturbance by tracked vehicles than wheeled vehicle disturbance, with tracked vehicles creating the greatest recorded soil compaction and exposure of bare soil and longer-term changes in sward composition.
   4. Ordination techniques were used to characterize post-disturbance successional trajectories. These suggest that chalk grassland is significantly less resistant to disturbance caused by multiple passes of tracked vehicles and tracked vehicle turns. Chalk grassland recovery from these types of disturbance is less predictable.
   5. Identifying vegetation community resistance assists understanding of the ecosystem response to long-term and cumulative stress and facilitates strategic management of habitats where disturbance events are commonplace, especially in areas of high nature conservation interest. These data demonstrate that small-scale but acute disturbance events can have significant effects on plant community composition, and can have wider reaching impacts on other aspects of site management. There are important implications for the management of off-road vehicles in recreational and agricultural contexts, and for the formulation of a strategic sustainable management plan for the SPTA that incorporates both military and conservation objectives.
   6. Synthesis and applications. Resistance to disturbance is not necessarily an additive function. Managers of chalk grasslands should limit activities that create high intensity disturbance events because the succession trajectory following such events may be less direct and with less predictable outcomes than that following lower intensity disturbances. Increased predictability of succession trajectories following medium to low disturbance events means these types of disturbance might be used deliberately to create short-term and small-scale heterogeneity in both species composition and sward structure. Site managers should be aware that certain activities not previously considered to be potentially damaging might be creating significant habitat disturbance effects, as changes to soil structure, functioning and fauna can occur in the absence of changes in plant community composition.

AB Background Prospective cohort studies have made enormous contributions to our understanding of coronary heart disease (CHD) epidemiology in the UK. However, identification of cohorts and dissemination of key characteristics and results can be haphazard, and it is difficult to identify studies which are at the planning stage.
   Methods We carried out a systematic review of cohort studies by searching MEDLINE and relevant websites and consulting key individuals. We included all large prospective UK cohort studies that focused on the development of CHD in predominantly healthy subjects.
   Results The MEDLINE search retrieved 1558 hits and we identified 39 cohorts that met inclusion criteria. 'Early' cohorts were important in defining the major risk factors for CHD, particularly smoking, cholesterol, blood pressure, physical activity and body mass index. Prospective cohort studies have subsequently appraised potentially important novel risk factors including nutritional status, genetic determinants, haemostatic factors, lipid sub-fractions, psychosocial factors and the 'life course' perspective. Psychosocial factors have been relatively neglected, as have women, ethnic minorities and the elderly. Key methodological issues include minimizing losses to follow up, standardized measurements, quality assurance systems, change in risk factors over time, residual confounding, regression dilution bias, detection of non-fatal events, measurement of quality of life, and generalizability.
   Conclusions The current and proposed prospective UK cohorts have sufficient power potentially to determine the importance of many traditional and newer CHD risk factors on cardiovascular risk in men, women and even ethnic minorities. However, secure financial support and hence sustainability will remain essential to maximize long-term benefits. (C) 2003 Lippincott Williams Wilkins.

AB Empirical studies show that the relationship between social capital and economic performance is ambiguous. The paper points to the potential trade-off between the sustainability of self-enforcement and the magnitude of gains from trade in social networks as an explanation. Based on an infinitely repeated multi-player prisoners' dilemma it is shown how self-enforcement of cooperation within a network is influenced by its inclusiveness, its communication capacity, and the complexity of the exchange setting. The paper shows that inclusive social capital can combine both low enforcement costs and high gains from trade even in a complex exchange setting. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Modeling the initial growth of the plasma and flame kernel in SI engines
SO JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING FOR GAS TURBINES AND POWER-TRANSACTIONS OF THE
   ASME
LA English
DT Article
ID IGNITION
AB The initial size and growth of the plasma and flame kernel just after spark discharge in S.L engines determines if the flame becomes self-sustainable or extinguishes. On the other hand, the development of the kernel during the initial phases has non-negligible influences on the further combustion. For example, cyclic variations often find their origin in the beginning of combustion and determine the working limits of the engine and the driving behavior of the vehicle. These factors demonstrate the crucial importance of the knowledge of the initial growth of the plasma and flame kernel in S.L engines. A complete model is developed for the growth of the initial plasma and flame kernel in S.I. engines, which takes into account the fundamental properties of the ignition system (electrical energy and power geometry of the spark plug, heat losses to the electrodes and the cylinder wall), the combustible mixture (pressure, temperature, equivalence ratio, fraction of residual gasses, kind of fuel), and the flow (average flow velocity, turbulence intensity, stretch, characteristic time and length scales). The proposed model distinguishes three phases: the pre-breakdown, the plasma, and the initial combustion phase. The model of the first two phases is proposed in a previous article of the same authors [1], the latter is exposed in this article. A thermodynamic model based on flamelet models and which takes stretch into account, is used to describe the initial combustion phase. The difference between heat losses to the electrodes and the cylinder wall is considered. The burning velocity varies from the order of the laminar velocity to the fully developed burning velocity. The evolution is determined as well by the life time as by the size of the kernel. The stretch (caused by turbulence and by the growth of the kernel), the nonadiabatic character of the flame, and instabilities have influence on the laminar burning velocity. Validation of this model is done using measurements of the expansion in a propane-air mixture executed by Pischinger [2] at M.I.T. The agreement seems very good.

ID GROUNDWATER CONTAMINATION
AB This study focuses on the problem of most efficiently fulfilling the water requirements of society for sustainable water resources management. The goal is to coordinate effectively the social needs of the resident population with operational water resources management planning.
   The proposed approach consists of a pyramidal hierarchy of water resource management needs, similar to that suggested by psychologist Abraham Maslow for human social needs. The two pyramidal hierarchies can be simultaneously employed to delineate guidelines to synchronize planning for sustainable water resources development with the concerns and expectations of the resident population. In both hierarchies, higher level needs remain irrelevant and difficult to attain until lower level needs of the resident population have been fulfilled.
   Management planning measures employed with regard to Israel's coastal aquifer have been used to illustrate this approach. Observation of Israel's experience indicates markedly reduced effectiveness where such measures have failed to be properly synchronised with societal needs. Conversely, where hydrological management measures were successfully synchronized with societal concerns, increased efficiency towards attaining sustainable groundwater management was evident.

TI Application of hydrolyzed carrot pomace as a functional food ingredient

ID QUANTITATIVE-DETERMINATION; CAROTENE
AB Utilization of a carotene-rich functional food ingredient recovered through mechanical and enzymatic breakdown of the tissue of carrot pomace was evaluated by its application to model beverages based on cloudy apple juice, aiming at sustainable carrot juice production. Contrary to synthetic beta-carotene supplements, the stability of the natural alpha-and beta-carotene in the beverages proved to be excellent after 20 and 24 weeks storage under moderate and even intense illumination at 23 and 19 degrees C, respectively. Neither degradation nor isomerization were observed, thus confirming the extraordinary stability of carotenes in their natural matrix. Furthermore, cloud stabilities as determined by centrifugation and real time sedimentation tests were satisfactory. Although increasing proportions of pectin only slightly delayed sedimentation of coarse cloud particles, the positive effect of pectin was more pronounced with respect to improved serum turbidity of the beverages which might be ascribed to higher serum viscosity.

AB Sustainable agriculture will rely increasingly on alternatives to conventional chemical insecticides for pest management that are environmentally friendly and reduce the amount of human contact with pesticides. Microbial control agents, i.e. insect pathogens, can provide effective control, conserve biodiversity, and serve as alternatives to chemical insecticides under several conditions. Due to their specificity for insects, insect pathogens including viruses, bacteria, fungi and nematodes are ideal candidates for incorporation into integrated pest management strategies in orchards where their effects on other natural enemies will be minimal. There is also excellent potential for combining microbial control with other soft technologies such as mating disruption. Increased use of microbial control will depend on a variety of factors including improvements in the pathogens (virulence, formulation, delivery, etc.) and an increased awareness of their attributes by growers and the general public. In this review we provide an overview of microbial control of the key insect pests of citrus, pome fruits, stone fruits and nuts.

AB Vegetables are the major constituents of Indian diet. However, there are several factors that limits its productively, mainly insect pests and diseases. Biointensive pest management (BIPM) is essentially a component of integrated pest management. It will help to reduce the dependence on chemical pesticides and ecological deterioration. BIPM includes biopesticides derived from microbials, parasitoids, predators, botanicals and all conventional non-chemical methods of pest control. Indian farming, which is going through a transition phase, is slowly but surely adopting the ways and means of pest management for sustainable agriculture.

   California agricultural students
SO JOURNAL OF FOOD AGRICULTURE & ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
DE Agroecology; sustainable agriculture; farm crisis; ecological
   degradation; low-input farming; organic agriculture
AB In its transformation towards industrialized, monoculture-based production, modern agriculture has brought a staggering number of negative ecological, social, cultural and economic side effects. Throughout the entire food system, it is possible to trace this crisis as it manifests itself in soil erosion, pesticide pollution, loss of biodiversity, inequitable social consequences, farm foreclosures and a myriad other environmental and social problems. Concerned about this reality, a number of students from seven California agricultural universities, engaged in a series of discussions about the dimensions and severity of the problems affecting modern industrial agriculture. Students were not only informed about the crisis but more importantly they discussed real sustainable alternatives to the current dominant systems. Proposed solutions range from the promotion of more agroecological research and education, to creation of conducive policies, local markets and better labor conditions for farmworkers. This important contribution depicts the reflection of young people concerned about the current status of agriculture and their commitment to building a more sustainable and equitable food system, a vision rarely considered by older agricultural scientitsts and policy makers, but that should be taken seriously as it brings new and fresh ideas usually lacking in academic and development circles.

ID SUPPORT
AB The Ecosystem Management (EM) process belongs to the category of Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) problems. It requires appropriate decision support systems (DSS) where "all interested people" would be involved in the decision making process. Environmental values critical to EM, such as the biological diversity, health, productivity and sustainability, have to be studied, and play an important role in modeling the ecosystem functions; human values and preferences also influence decision making. Public participation in decision and policy making is one of the elements that differentiate EM-from the traditional methods of management. Here, a methodology is presented on how to quantify human preferences in EM decision making. The case study of the National Park of River Nestos Delta and Lakes Vistonida and Ismarida in Greece, presented as an application of this methodology, shows that the direct involvement of the public, the quantification of its preferences and the decision maker's attitude provide a strong tool to the EM decision making process. Public preferences have been given certain weights and three MCDM methods, namely, the Expected Utility Method, Compromise Programming and the Analytic Hierarchy Process, have been used to select alternative management solutions that lead to the best configuration of the ecosystem and are also socially acceptable.

ID ESTUARY MANAGEMENT; FORUM; UK
AB In countries where integrated coastal zone management (ICZM) is not enshrined in statute, a voluntary approach has often been taken. This review examines issues relating to funding in ICZM partnerships, particularly the local coastal fora (LCF) network in the UK. It highlights the lack of sustainable long-term funding mechanisms for organisations with the core aim of sustainable management of coastal resources. The relative difficulty of raising funds for core costs as opposed to projects is addressed, as is the lack of business/industry involvement. The 'hamster wheel syndrome' of fundraising is noted, where staff spend too much time trying to raise money, as opposed to developing ICZM. The resultant impact on the staff and the operation of the LCF is considered. Examples beyond the UK are considered, as are the problems associated with 'pump-prime' funding and implementation. Is the lack of formality in ICZM the crux of the funding problem? (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB An environmentally sound process for the extraction of neodymium (Nd) from magnet scrap was devised and its feasibility was demonstrated. The developed Nd extraction apparatus circulates the magnesium (Mg) as an extraction medium by maintaining a temperature difference within the reaction vessel, thus achieving continuous extraction of metal Nd from scrap, re-extraction of Mg from a Mg-Nd alloy, and finally, pure Nd metal with 97.7% purity was directly recovered from magnet scrap without oxidation. The concept of "scrap combination" for recycling variable materials, that is demonstrated in this study, is an important technology that can be instrumental in creating a highly developed self-sustainable society.

AB This paper examines the concepts of "cleaner production (CP)" and "pollution prevention" in the mining context. These terms, which have become the subject of important international conferences in recent years, are increasingly being misconstrued. It has become particularly challenging to apply these environmental management concepts to mining and allied industries because of the nature of their operations. Specifically, as prospective deposits are geologically fixed, management cannot randomly select the locations of mine sites, and as a result, is commonly scrutinized for conducting operations in ecologically sensitive areas. Furthermore, unlike most industrial activity, mines, quarries and smelting complexes have the ability to cause widespread environmental damages on numerous fronts. To avoid being interpreted generically and therefore misused, CP, pollution prevention, and related environmental management concepts (e.g. waste minimization, toxic waste reduction etc.) must be defined specifically for the mining industry before being incorporated into important policies and legislation.

AB Protected areas in Latin America have increased significantly in area and number in the last decade. Due in part to lack of personnel trained in the planning and management of these areas, many are threatened or unable to provide their potential goods and services. To remedy this situation, several initiatives are underway to share methodological approaches to planning protected areas in Latin America. We analyze the concepts, methods, and experiences in protected areas planning in Latin America during the last three decades. We conclude that the basic elements and procedures of protected area planning initiated in the 1970s have been maintained, but an important evolution occur-red in the strategy of the planning process. More and varied information is now available to planners and valuable tools have been developed for land use planning. In addition, there has been an important effort to develop a participatory planning process recognizing the potential role of protected areas in the sustainable development of rural, high poverty communities. Participatory planning ensures that protected areas contribute to the ecological, economic, and social environment of adjacent communities.

ID CONSERVATION; BIODIVERSITY
AB The idea of a Southern Appalachian Ecosystem is now so much a part of our everyday language that many of the people who talk, write, and make decisions about the place are unaware of the long and complicated history behind the idea. One primary purpose of this case study was to demonstrate how the Southern Appalachian Ecosystem has been socially constructed and reified as a scientific fact in contemporary environmental discourse. In addition, we discuss the implications of this particular sense of place for biodiversity, land use, and community development. Ultimately, our goal is to help establish a common ground between the infinite number of competing visions that are possible and plausible for this one unique place. We do so primarily by advocating a more biocultural worldview-a view of the world that seeks to transcend the dichotomous categories of nature and culture perpetuated by modem, western thought. Our intention is to contribute to the creation of not merely a sustainable but a truly desirable postmodern future of human ecosystems rich in biocultural diversity.

TI Sea-water desalination with nuclear and other energy sources: the
   EURODESAL project
SO NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN
LA English
DT Article; Proceedings Paper
CT Mid-Term Symposium on Shared-Cost and Concerted Actions (FISA-2001)
CY DEC, 2001
CL LUXEMBOURG
AB This paper summarises our recent investigations undertaken as part of the EURODESAL project on nuclear desalination, currently being carried out by a consortium of four European, and one Canadian, industrials and two leading EU R&D organisations.
   Major achievements of the project, as discussed in this paper are:
   Coherent demonstration of the technical feasibility of nuclear desalination through the elaboration of coupling schemes for optimum cogeneration of electricity and water and by exploring the unique capabilities of the innovative nuclear reactors and desalination technologies.
   Verification that the integrated system design does not adversely affect nuclear reactor safety.
   Development of codes and methods for an objective economic assessment of the competitiveness and sustainability of proposed options through comparison, in European conditions, with fossil energy based systems.
   Results obtained so far seem to be quite encouraging as regards the economical viability of nuclear desalination options. Thus, for example, specific desalination costs ($/m(3) of desalted water) for nuclear systems, such as the AP-600 and the French PWR-900 (reference base case), coupled to multiple effect distillation (MED) or the reverse osmosis (RO) processes, are 30-60% lower than the desalination costs for fossil energy based systems, using pulverised coal and natural gas with combined cycle, at low discount rates and recommended fossil fuel prices. Even in the most unfavourable scenarios for nuclear energy (discount rate = 10%, low fossil fuel costs) desalination costs with the nuclear reactors are 7-20% lower, depending upon the desalination capacities. Furthermore, with the advanced coupling schemes, utilising waste heat from nuclear reactors, the gains in specific desalination costs of nuclear systems are increased by another 2-15%, even without system and design optimisation. A preliminary evaluation shows that desalination costs with the GT-MHR, coupled to a MED process, could still be much lower than the above nuclear options for desalting capacities less than or equal to 43 000 m(3) per day. This is because its design intrinsically provides 11 virtually free" heat at ideal temperatures for desalination (80-100 degreesC). (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

DE equilibrium exchange rate; macroeconomic balance approach; current
   account sustainability
AB This paper presents an extension of the macroeconomic exchange rate balance approach. This extension comprises two new aspects. Firstly, it is based on a multinational framework which allows for macroeconomic linkages between countries. Secondly, it uses a procedure that does not require a full modeling of the world economy to derive a consistent set of equilibrium exchange rates. The findings reveal that, in 2001, the dollar was overvalued against the euro and the yen. The paper also shows that this result depends heavily on the chosen notion of current account sustainability.

ID IMPACTS
AB Forest certification provides a means by which producers who meet stringent sustainable forestry standards can identify their products in the marketplace, allowing them to potentially receive greater market access and higher prices for their products. An examination of the ways in which certification may contribute to biodiversity conservation leads to the following conclusions: 1) the process of Forest Stewardship Council (FSC)-certification generates improvements to management with respect to the value of managed forests for biodiversity. 2) Current incentives are not sufficient to attract the majority of producers to seek certification, particularly in tropical countries where the costs of improving management to meet FSC guidelines are significantly greater than any market benefits they may receive, available incentives are even less capable of convincing forest owners to retain forest cover and produce certified timber on a sustainable basis, rather than deforesting their lands for timber and agriculture. 3) At present, current volumes of certified forest products are insufficient to reduce demand to log high conservation value forests. If FSC certification is to make greater inroads, particularly in tropical countries, significant investments will be needed both to increase the benefits and reduce the costs of certification. Conservation investors will need to carefully consider the biodiversity benefits that will be generated from such investments, versus the benefits generated from investing in more traditional approaches to biodiversity conservation.

DE biophilia; ecological literacy; environmental connection; extinction of
   experience; globalism; land ethic; nature study; sustainability
AB Many individuals and societies are no longer connected to the more-than-human world in such a way as to ensure a sustainable future. As such connection has diminished, environmental challenges have multiplied and influences for estrangement intensified. I review the importance of direct, intimate encounter with places and organisms on the attitudes of the young, as well as the significance of biophilia. The result of the loss of contact and subsequent alienation is the Extinction of Experience: an inexorable cycle of disconnection, apathy, and progressive depletion. I describe an effort to demonstrate this effect. Small, humble habitats, especially in urban settings, can be as important as big reserves in awakening biophilia. Biophobia, abetted by the loss of such habitats, the rise of the virtual in place of actual experience, economic inequalities, and overpopulation, further feeds the downward spiral of extinction and disaffection. The climate of global corporate growth that now prevails is inimical to sustainability, as is the current state of ecological illiteracy. Radical change is therefore necessary to address both economic disparity, in the direction of minimal ownership rather than maximum consumerism, and educational reform that places nature at the centre rather than the margin of the curriculum. I present a six-point programme, called Nature Matrix, for an alternative social and ethical paradigm. Rather than a pragmatic plan for the near future, Nature Matrix is a model for essential, incremental change, a dream whose eventual adoption may enhance chances for reconnection and for ecological survival itself: at present, a deeply uncertain prospect.

TI Sustainable use and incentive-driven conservation: realigning human and
   conservation interests
SO ORYX
LA English
DT Article
DE adaptive management; ecosystem services; incentive-driven conservation;
   incentives; sustainable use
AB Discussions of sustainable use have become polarized. Welfarists oppose all use that involves killing animals. Among conservationists polarization arises in part from failure to distinguish between different ideas nestled under the umbrella term of 'sustainable use'. These include direct use as an imperative or choice, the ideal of keeping any use within biologically sustainable limits, and use as a possible conservation strategy that can create positive incentives, which are key where land could otherwise be converted to biodiversity-unfriendly practices. People will continue to use wild living resources, which increasing human populations could further deplete. In response the conservation community can follow one of two approaches. On the one hand, it can try to stop use through the establishment of strictly protected areas and by enforcing legislation, although many would question the ethical position of imposing such an approach. On the other hand, it can work to introduce the wider management systems needed to deliver sustainable use and, if possible, incentive-driven conservation. Because most rural populations will continue using wild living resources in human-dominated landscapes, sustainable use and incentive-driven conservation should both be at the centre of the conservation agenda this century. Both species- and ecosystem-based management are likely to have a role in sustainable use. However, current enthusiasm for the ecosystem approach may throw up unexpected consequences, making the search for sustainability even more polarized. Nevertheless, direct use of species cannot provide sufficient incentives to ensure the continued delivery of ecosystem services, which need to be fully incorporated in the global accounting system.

DE environmental governance; global governance; international institutions;
   MEA; multilateral environmental agreement; sustainable development
AB The role of multilateral environmental agreements (MEAs) such as the Convention on Biological Diversity, the Ramsar Wetlands Convention, and the Barcelona Convention on the Mediterranean has grown increasingly important, in the context of conservation management, during the last decade as human impacts intensify and cross national boundaries more often. In resorting to MEAs it is important to maintain a clear focus on their opportunities and limitations. They are a means to resolve transboundary problems with neighbouring states and adopt harmonized approaches, they increasingly offer access to worldwide knowledge, tools and financial resources, and they can give conservation agencies a stronger mandate domestically. But they are specialized instruments focused on particular problems or sectors. The threats they address and the solutions they outline have to be evaluated in relation to overall environmental and socio-economic priorities. This entails linkages among different problems and sectors at various scales. Regional and ecosystem-level approaches are most appropriate for sorting out linkages and priorities. Extensive capacity building is needed at these levels to foster the requisite skills for integrated approaches. In addition, new mechanisms may be required at these levels to coordinate diverse specialized regimes. This does not require a monolithic, top-down approach but rather ongoing flexibility and responsiveness informed from the bottom up. We should take advantage of the new directions highlighted by the World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg, in 2002 and other recent international conferences to build these abilities into international governance. Conservation managers have an important role to play. By working nationally and internationally they can inform and influence the shift towards integrated and coordinated efforts, suggesting ways to accomplish this on a larger, international scale based on concrete experience in situ.

AB The 10 ML/d South Caboolture Water Reclamation Plant was designed to reduce riverine pollution and to provide water to industry and community consumers for non-potable uses. Whilst the plant will provide water for non-potable uses it has been designed to meet drinking water standards.
   The unique physical-chemical/biological treatment process incorporates biological denitrification, preozonation, coagulation/flocculation, dissolved air flotation/sand filtration, ozonation and biological activated carbon treatment. The Caboolture process, with its unique integrated physical-chemical/biological treatment ensures continuous sustainable production with low operational and chemical cost. Some demineralization (denitrification) is achieved biologically and expensive activated carbon life is prolonged almost indefinitely also by biological means, encouraged by prior ozonolysis of retractable compounds. Water can be supplied well below the cost of water from conventional sources. Minor operational problems have been overcome and the experience will be valuable for further implementation of this approach to water reclamation. Once again, the value of a combination of ozonation and activated carbon has proved its value in this World's first production application. This paper compares the Caboolture plant with some other well-known water reclamation plants in the US and southern Africa.

AB The objective of this paper was to present the Environmental Impact Assessment System. of New Rural Activities (APOIA-NovoRural),, which consists of a set of electronic spreadsheets (MS-Excel platform) that integrate 62 indicators of environmental performance of an economic activity at the farmstead le vel. Five assessment dimensions were considered: landscape ecology,environmental quality (atmosphere, water and soil), sociocultural values, economic values and management. Each indicator was constructed. into a weighing matrix in which field- and laboratory-obtained data with the appropriate measurement units were automatically transformed into impact indices. The impact:index for each indicator was translated into a utility value by multi-coefficient functions specifically derived: for each indicator. The utility values for all indicators were aggregated to. compose the Environmental Impact Index for the activity under consideration. The indicator level output offers a diagnostic tool for. farmers, pointing out-specific attributes of the activity that may be failing to comply with defined benchmarks., The dimension-wise output shows decision makers the major contributions of the activity towards local sustainable development, facilitating the definition of control actions' and promotion. measures. Finally, the aggregated Environmental Impact Index is a yardstick of environmental performance, serving as a straightforward certification tool for rural activities.

DT Article
DE stigma; housing estates; regeneration initiatives; image management
AB Neighbourhood regeneration initiatives in stigmatised estates have tended not to address the problem of stigma directly, but have largely assumed that an estate's reputation will improve as material conditions on the estate improve. This article demonstrates the tenacity of stigma even in estates where large-scale regeneration initiatives are underway. It then accounts for the persistence of stigma by providing evidence of how a problem image creates barriers to the spread of knowledge of change. The article concludes by exploring how area-based initiatives could build on this insight in order to develop effective approaches to challenging stigma, thus contributing to sustainable regeneration.

AB Between 1999 and 2001, the Channel Tunnel Rail Link (CTRL) and the A2/M2 widening scheme between Cobham and junction 4 of the existing M2 motorway were both under construction in central Kent. The activity was particularly intense immediately to the east of the River Medway, where the earthworks for the two projects were immediately adjacent. Nearly 300 000 m(3) of surplus chalk was exported from the CTRL works to the A2/M2 widening project in a fill transfer agreement that represented the successful culmination of about three years of negotiations between the two project teams and the local planning authorities. It was a good example of waste minimisation, sustainable design and construction, and cooperative working, and involved the resolution of several planning, technical and construction management issues. The ways in which these were successfully overcome are addressed in this paper.

AB A structure is suggested and discussed for the assessment of hazard and risk of chemicals of commerce, starting from a knowledge of molecular structure and proceeding to estimation of chemical properties, environmental fate and presence in organisms. Two metrics of risk are described, the external risk ratio which is based on concentrations external to the organism and the internal risk ratio based on concentrations internal to the organism. Where possible, the latter is preferred. Aspects of this multi-stage strategy are discussed in more detail including the need for more experimental data in support of QSARs, the need for consistency in QSARs describing related properties and the complementary roles of fate models and QSARs. Whereas most screening-level regulatory assessments of large numbers of chemicals focus on hazard, it is argued that the public concern is primarily with risk. Since risk assessment depends on the availability of data on rates of emission and such data are often very uncertain, this stage is often delayed and may only be done for relatively few substances. This is unfortunate because many hazardous substances are used under conditions such that there is minimal risk of exposure and effects. It is suggested that risk assessment can be facilitated by "backtracking" from an arbitrarily assumed risk ratio to calculate a hypothetical "critical" emission rate which would support that ratio. This rate can then be compared with likely emission to give an indication of proximity to levels of concern and thus the sustainability of present chemical emission practices.

AB Emergy (spelled with an m) is the energy required to make a service or product expressed in energy of one form. The emergy used in the life cycles of major building materials as well as the emergy inputs to waste disposal and recycle systems were evaluated. Emergy per mass (expressed as solar emergy per gram [sej/g]) for building materials varied from a low of 0.88 E9 sej/g for wood to a high of 12.53 E9 sej/g for aluminum. Generally, emergy per mass is a good indicator of recycle-ability, where materials with high emergy per mass are more recyclable. Recycling added between 1 (cement) and 234% (wood) to the emergy inputs per gram of building materials. The analysis of materials suggested that recycle of wood may not be advantages on a large scale, but metals, plastic, and glass have very positive benefits. Two types of solid waste disposal systems were evaluated: municipal solid wastes (MSW), and construction and demolition wastes (C&D wastes). Expressed as emergy, the costs of collecting, sorting and landfilling (for 25 years) MSW were 251.0 E6, 8.2 E6 and 37.9 E6 sej/g, respectively. The costs of demolition, collection, sorting and landfilling C&D wastes were 49.0 E6, 21.7 E6, 6.7 E6, and 11.7 E6 sej/g, respectively. Three different recycle trajectories were identified and analyzed: (1) material recycle (the 'standard' recycle of a material where it is used again as the same material [i.e. glass bottles recycled and made again into glass bottles]); (2) by-product use (where a by-product from some process is used to make something entirely different [i.e. flay ash in concrete]); and (3) adaptive reuse (where a material after recycle is reused for an entirely different purpose [i.e. plastic milk cartons are converted into plastic lumber]). Three recycle indices measuring the benefits of various recycle systems suggested that materials that have large refining costs have greatest potential for high recycle benefits and that highest benefits appear to accrue from material recycle systems, followed by adaptive reuse systems and then by byproduct reuse systems.

AB The different activities described by the generic word "recycling" arepresented along with an evaluation of the benefits of recycling in terms of natural resources or energy savings and reduction of Green House Gas emissions. The detailed analysis is presented of steel recycling, by-product recycling and end of life consumer good recycling.
   The GHG emissions avoided because of sustainable steel recycling are evaluated from a long-term perspective. By-product recycling is also a major issue that has already been addressed with satisfactory results, as blast furnace slag is re-used in the cement industry. This exemplifies the cross-business recycling of by-products which has strong implications in terms of GHG emissions mitigation. Metal recovery is not yet as fully developed although a fairly satisfying solution is being implemented on the basis of the Rotary Hearth Furnace which separates iron from zinc with production of a DRI and concentration of zinc to a high enough level for direct use by zinc smelters.
   The future European regulations for consumer goods will require a high level of recyclability that will favour the design with metals instead of other materials such as plastics.
   Recycling is a complex, rich and fruitful concept that is popular today and will remain powerful in the future. It functions both in the market economy and in the regulatory world, with by-products being exchanged between production units within a business or between businesses of different crafts.
   Sustainable recycling generates a significant resource of iron units for the steel industry which, along with its partners in the recycling loop, has been a pioneer in the world of recycling.

AB By coupling the biogeochemical model With plant ecological model, a model Was established to reveal the principle of the composite global warming potential transformation in the paddy ecosystem. Validation of the model with the observed data indicated that,the model can simulate both the crop growth processes and emissions of CH4, and N2O accurately. Some numerical analyses were made to identify the impacts of different fertilizer application on assimilation Of CO2 and emissions of CH4 and N2O, and the transformation principle of the composite global warming potential. Based on the results of the numerical analysis, the source-sink alternation of composite global warming potential in the paddy ecosystem was discovered, and some new conceptions of fertilizer index such as maximum-sink fertilizer, zero-emission fertilizer are put forward in this paper. The fertilizer scheme for Yangtze Delta was proposed to provide the important scientific basis for a sustainable agriculture in this region.

AB One of the key tasks in current fisheries research is to improve the performance, in terms of accuracy and utility, of projections of recruitment-driven population dynamics in the medium-term. Reliable indications of the median level and variability of recruitment over a five- to ten-year time-scale would be invaluable in the determination of appropriate levels of fishing mortality, in order to attempt to maintain sustainable fish stocks. Building upon the stochastic simulation approach currently adopted within ICES stock assessment working groups, this paper investigates the use of time-series models to characterise the historical development of residuals to fitted stock-recruitment models. We use the probability of SSB (spawning stock biomass) falling below B-pa (precautionary value of spawning stock biomass) over a range of multipliers on imposed fishing mortality as a diagnostic statistic to compare projections. Case studies of commercially-important fish stocks are presented (North Sea cod, haddock and whiting), and the potential implications of the new approaches for fisheries management are discussed.

AB International agreements for the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) convention area imply that Atlantic tuna stocks should be managed by strategies based on maximum sustainable yield (MSY); however, there is concern whether this will actually ensure sustainability with sufficiently high probability consistent with the principals of the precautionary approach. Therefore, the performance of MSY management strategies based on current assessment procedures was evaluated using a computer simulation framework. The framework includes the data collection, assessment, prediction, and management processes, as well as the implementation of management regulations. It therefore provides an integrated way to evaluate the relative importance of and the interactions between each component of the system with regard to the overall success of the management strategy. The study elucidates guidelines about assessment and management that are general enough to be applied to all tunas in the Atlantic Ocean. It does so by comparing different hypotheses about management and assessment for three stocks (North Atlantic albacore, Atlantic bigeye and East Atlantic skipjack), which are representative of the variety encountered (i.e. from data rich to poor and tropical to temperate waters) in ICCAT stocks. Management performance was especially sensitive to the carrying capacity of the stock. The type of proxy used for MSY was more important to the success of the procedure than the frequency of assessment or the number of indices used in the assessment. Whilst the procedure was successful at achieving the management objectives for albacore, it was only partially successful for bigeye and was too conservative for skipjack.

TI Suburbanisation and its social consequences
SO SOCIOLOGICKY CASOPIS-CZECH SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW
LA Czech
DT Article
ID URBAN; SPRAWL
AB The article argues that suburbanisation is going to become an important part of research and the social agenda. First, suburbanisation is the most important process of urban change in the metropolitan regions of post-communist cities. Second, some forms of suburbanisation, specifically, sprawl-like developments, introduce certain negative economic, social, and environmental consequences. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate this process from the start, anticipate its long-term impacts, and attempt to influence it in the direction of attaining more sustainable metropolitan development. The paper defines suburbanisation and outlines its main conditions and consequences as evident from the examples of North America and Western Europe. Finally, it suggests some issues that should come to form a part of the research agenda on suburbanisation.

AB We investigated the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of plant parasitic nematodes, namely the root-knot nematode, Meloidogyne incognita and root-lesion nematode, Pratylenchus coffeae that hamper the development of sustainable cropping systems in the southern region of Kyushu, Japan. In the current study, we attempted to detect M. incognita and P. coffeae using multiplex PCR using specific primer sets. M. incognita specific primer set (Mi1-Mi2) was designed based on the sequence of the ITS region of M. incognita. P. coffeae specific primer set (Pc1-Pc2) was designed according to both the report of Uehara et al. (Nematologica, 44: 357-368, 1998) and the sequence of P. coffeae obtained in this study. The use of multiplex PCR enable to detect two distinctive bands derived from the two kinds of plant parasitic nematodes. Furthermore, these two specific bands were detectable, when the genome of other nematodes was mixed in the template, with at least one nematode of the plant parasitic nematodes, M. incognita and P. coffeae being present with hundreds of other soil nematodes.

AB A pride of lions (Panthera leo) was studied on a 15 km(2) reserve using radio-telemetry. Kills were recorded from direct observations, as well as reserve management records. The prey base was enumerated by an aerial and road count and the standing biomass crop was calculated. The daily food intake per lioness was calculated to range from 4.1 +/- 1.3 (S.E.) to 4.6 +/- 2.4 (S.E.) kg/day. Two approaches for determining the sustainability of lions were evaluated: a) Large Herbivore Biomass (LHB) and b) Maximum Sustained Yield (MSY) of the main prey. The term Lion Feeding Unit (LFU) was introduced to depict the feeding requirements of an adult lioness. It was calculated that the LHB could support 185 LFUs/100 km(2), which was clearly not sustainable in the context of prey declines at an LFU density of 50 LFUs/100 km(2). The MSY of prey could sustain 6.7 LFUs/100 km(2), which would reverse prey declines if prey populations were initially maintained at (1)/(2) K. This capacity was recommended for savannas receiving between 500 and 700 mm rainfall per annum, and where no other carnivores were present. This capacity was, however, too low for small reserves (<20 km(2)) where a large group of lions is needed for aesthetic and economic purposes. A trade-off is suggested where a normal pride size (4-10) is prescribed, but with the understanding that prey declines are inevitable and that prey will need to be replenished on an annual basis.

AB This paper focuses on the emergence and growth of sustainable industries, specifically analyzing the rise of the wind energy industry in California. Based on a favorable institutional environment and the presence of abundant natural capital, the wind energy industry took root and flourished in California during the last two decades. This paper analyzes this phenomenon by exploring the determinants of where and when wind energy projects would be established. Findings suggest that in locations where natural, social, and economic influences converged, greater wind energy activity followed. The paper advances a simple framework that uses natural capital, site specificity, and institutional environments to predict which sustainable industries will enjoy growth in coming decades.

AB Suppression of CO2 and slag discharged from iron- and steelmaking processes are some of the typical biggest issues for the protection of global environment and sustainable growth of steelmaking industry. Utilization of active phytoplankton propagation will be one of the best options, to stabilize and reduce carbon dioxide with great efficiency.
   Inorganic minerals such as C, N, Si, P, and Fe are necessary, for phytoplankton to grow. It is crucial for effective supply of nutrition to understand the dissolution mechanism of elements from steelmaking slags into seawater. At first, the morphology of the precipitated phases in steelmaking slags during cooling period was investigated in the present work. It was continued to compare the dissolution behavior of some elements from steelmaking slags and pure substances such as 4CaO . P2O5, 3CaO . P2O5 and 2CaO . SiO2-3CaO . P2O5 (2.8 mass% P) solid solution phase into artificial seawater for understanding their dissolution possibility.
   The dissolution behavior of elements such as phosphorus are strongly dependent of phase present in steelmaking slag. It was confirmed that the dissolution of component in steelmaking slag was observed such that enough amount of nutrition for phytoplankton multiplication can be supplied from steelmaking slag.

AB Several problems concerning the relationship between the demand and supply of fishery products in Japan are outlined in this study. Interactions between ecological functions of the coastal areas known as fishing grounds, and four fishery production processes (the cultivation fishery, the resource management type fishery, the coastal fishing ground development practice, mariculture) are summarized. In addition, this study describes the framework of the technical combination surrounding fishery researches. From views of fisheries that are responsible for the stable supply of safe fishery products, the ecologically compatibility production method is structured into three types (the symbiosis type, the compatible type, the conservation type). Ecological explanations are also provided to describe each type of the method. Further, management objectives and standards are proposed for the sustainable fishery production by effectively utilizing structural characteristics of an ecosystem, and notable issues raised at production settings are outlined. Lastly, a functional evaluation model necessary as a guideline for the protection of fishing environments and for the sustainable production is classified and roles of the model are summarized.

AB This paper advances the argument that moves towards regional integration need to be understood as 'regional governance projects' undertaken by domestic actors and coalitions. Regional political projects - such as open regionalism - have roots in domestic structures, and it is this which defines the broad configuration of the regional political economy. On the basis of this framework the paper suggests, first, that the strategy of open regionalism was contingent on a particular configuration of power and interests in the domestic and external economy ( embedded mercantilism). Second, this system of embedded mercantilism depended on a set of domestic coalitions between tradeable and non-tradeable sectors of the economy. The non-tradeable sector in Southeast Asia was entrenched within a particular system of political patronage. Third, the Asian crisis and other structural changes in the international economy have made these domestic coalitions less sustainable, thereby creating opportunities for new forms of regional governance projects.

ID ORGANIZATION
AB Organisational learning and the learning organisation are concepts that have attracted a considerable amount of attention over the last two decades. This paper provides an analysis and evaluation of the main perspectives on organisational learning, particularly in relation to hotels as service sector organisations. The issues involved are an evaluation of the transformation process of a hospitality organisation and the key success factors to becoming a learning organisation in order to develop and maintain a competitive advantage within the global challenge. It identifies the issues which appear to be of prime importance when introducing organisational learning into hotels.
   The focus of this paper will be on the key points of the Turkish tourism sector's strengths and weaknesses in the adventure of becoming a learning organisation. Following of a literature review within which different characteristics of the service sector will be summarised learning organisation issues pertaining to Turkey will be discussed. This paper aims to discover future opportunities for the sustainable development of Turkish Tourism. However, this paper also maintains that, although organisational learning may be an important factor in building an organisation's competitiveness, by itself, it cannot guarantee success in today's fiercely competitive markets.

SO TOURISM MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
ID RESORT CYCLE; TOURISM
AB Since the emergence of mass tourism, destinations are constantly faced with the challenge of providing an adequate supply of suitable accommodation. The introduction of condominium style accommodation seemed to be the answer to the problem of meeting the increasing tourism demand at some popular destinations, although in some destinations investment in property development has increasingly become a supply driven activity. However, the resulting complexities brought about by the many stakeholders involved in managing the condominiums (including strata title legislation, investment incentives, and long-term maintenance of condominium developments) have introduced previously unforeseen problems to destinations reaching maturity. This study investigates the impacts of the growth of condominium developments and their potential for inhibiting destination rejuvenation. The study was conducted on Australia's Gold Coast, a classic example of a mass tourism resort where ironically, the growth of condominium style accommodation was a major factor in attracting large numbers of tourists, but may, in fact,prevent successful rejuvenation in the future.

AB The new German Lander have been practically invisible in discourses on tourism in post-socialist states. This case-study presents an exploratory examination of major tourism trends in the former German Democratic Republic since 1990. The purpose is to provoke further debate on the critical issues surrounding tourism transition, not least the wisdom and consequences of the general desire to eliminate disparities in production and consumption between cast and west. Special emphasis is placed on the deployment of urban heritage tourism as a mechanism to realise these ambitions. Far from a less harsh experience of change, eastern destinations have had to compete with established western resorts and regions for domestic and inbound visitors. Several indices point towards convergence but concurrently raise concerns about uneven development and the limits to, and sustainability of, growth. A reading of product development and the settings of consumption suggests that important unexpected de facto constraints to tourism development may result from continued, unchallenged, widespread adherence to western paradigms in the east.

DE coal industry; regional policy; local crisis
AB The crisis in coal mining has not been as deep as in many other industries. It was even possible to consider normal reorganisation of the coal industry in the 1990s. In the reorganisation, greater attention was given to social-cultural-political considerations than to purely economic factors. The weight of the coal industry in the economy was not great enough to be considered a national problem of primary importance (as, one can propose, is the Ukrainian case, where the industry accounts for more than 5% of GDP). Moreover, there is no region (from 89) in Russia, where a crisis in the coal industry would predetermine all major economic and social problems (even in the Kemerovo region). In all the above mentioned regions, one can find other industries more important for the general health of the economy and society. At the same time, the industry is characterised by a high level of spatial concentration, i.e. it is highly localised, and as a result local areas of severe depression have emerged, especially in relatively isolated locations and/or near exhausted deposits. Some areas of the industry suffered greatly, while a few others were more or less stable. As a result, further localisation of the industry and migration eastward took place. In areas of crisis, the financial and organisational capacities of local (and even regional) authorities were not nearly sufficient to solve social and economic problems. Political lobbying was also intensive. As a result, coal mining areas became the most important goals of new Russian regional policy (still not institutionally and legally fixed). Huge loans front the World Bank were also used for the development of these areas (and can be regarded as part of state regional policy). In short, the prospective future of the surviving and reorganised coal industry is not bad (as in some other traditional industries in Russia), but sustainable development can be achieved only through further diversification of the economy.

AB With the rising cost of inorganic fertilizers, the current low price of coffee on the international market, and subsequent reduction in coffee farmers' income, there is the need to search for low-input farming strategies in order to reduce cost and improve the income of coffee farmers. One such emerging strategy in the management of nutrients from organic matter in relation to sustainability is the use of mulch. Chromolaena odorata (Siam weed), coffee husk, banana trash, and Tripsacum laxum (Guatemala grass) that are readily available in and around coffee farms in Ghana were compared for their efficacy as mulch materials and their ability to improve soil fertility and increase coffee yield. Changes in soil characteristics such as total P, available P (using 0.2 N H2SO4 and 0.5 m NaHCO3 extractants), per cent C. Na, Mg, K. and cation exchange capacity of the experimental plots were measured in addition to coffee yield. With the exception of the K and N levels of the soil which were significantly (P < 0.01) influenced by the mulch materials, the changes in the other soil properties were not significant. The mulch materials significantly (P < 0.05) increased coffee yield by 4-158% over the control during the three-year period of the study. However, T. laxum and C. odorata were found to be better mulch materials than coffee husk and banana trash in terms of coffee yield improvement. Mulching in coffee plantations is therefore recommended as one of the low-input management strategies to bring about sustainable production in Ghana.

AB BACKGROUND Innovative low-cost sustainable strategies are required to reduce the high prevalence of iron-deficiency anaemia in developing countries.
   METHODS We undertook a community-based randomized controlled intervention trial to assess the effects of cooking in iron or aluminium cooking pots in Malawian households in an area with high malaria prevalence. Analysis was by intention to treat and consistency of use. The primary outcomes were change in haemoglobin and iron status.
   FINDINGS The study population comprised 164 participants eating from aluminium cooking pots and 158 from iron cooking pots. The mean haemoglobin change was significantly increased after 6 weeks in adults who consistently ate from an iron cooking pot (+3.6 g/l compared to -3.2 g/l, mean difference between groups 6.8 g/l, 95% CI +0.86, +12.74). In children, no significant haemoglobin change was observed in consistent pot users, although they showed a significant reduction in iron deficiency (iron 8.6 ZP/g and aluminium 10.8 ZP/g, mean difference 2.2 ZP/g, 95% CI +1.08, +3.32).
   INTERPRETATION Rural Malawian adults in a high malaria transmission area who consistently consume food prepared in iron cooking pots show a significant rise in haemoglobin after 6 weeks use. Children showed a reduction in iron deficiency, but no significant improvement in haemoglobin, possibly because of their high malaria parasite prevalence. Using iron cooking pots in developing countries could provide an innovative way to prevent iron deficiency and anaemia in malarious areas where regular iron supplementation is problematic.

AB Plastics are making a growing contribution to sustainable development. For example, over an expected lifetime of 50 years, the use of window frames and insulating materials made of plastic in buildings save many times the energy required to manufacture them. Plastics for packaging purposes provide protection against damage and dirt contamination, thereby saving considerable amounts of material and energy. Choosing appropriate disposal strategies for plastic waste also helps to protect the environment (Mark 2000).

AB Sage-grouse (Centrocercus spp.) were abundant in all of Utah's 29 counties at the time of European settlement wherever sagebrush (Artemisia spp.) occurred. Greater Sage-Grouse (C. urophasianus) inhabited areas north and west of the Colorado River, and Gunnison Sage-Grouse (C. minimus) occupied suitable habitat south and east of the Colorado River. The largest Greater Sage-Grouse populations in Utah are currently restricted to suitable habitats in Box Elder, Garfield, Rich, Uintah, and Wayne Counties. A remnant breeding population of Gunnison Sage-Grouse occurs in eastern San Juan County. We stratified Greater Sage-Grouse populations (1971-2000) by counties where the 1996 to 2000 moving average for estimated spring breeding populations was >500 (GT500) or <500 (LT500). Males per lek declined in all populations from 1971 to 2000; however, there were consistently more males observed on GT500 than on LT500 leks. Juveniles per adult lien (including yearling hens) Greater Sage-Grouse in the 1973-2000 fall harvest in Box Elder, Rich, and Wayne Counties did not differ from 2.25, a ratio suggesting sustainable or increasing sage-grouse populations. Declines are attributed to loss, fragmentation, and degradation of sagebrush habitat. Sage-grouse conservation ultimately depends on management and enhancement of remaining sagebrush rangelnads in Utah.

AB Many developing and transitioning countries have difficulty sticking to sound macroeconomic policy. International donors are pushing recipient countries to forge a public consensus on macroeconomic policy as a means to enhance sustainability and impacts on the poor. Finance and budget officials, central bank staff, and economic policymakers, however, often assume that citizens cannot understand or contribute to macroeconomic policy. Yet the poor often do not trust the government to make the right decisions for them. How can citizen participation help bridge this gap? Based on a review of international experience, the paper explores this question, and identifies how development administrators can employ civic participation in macroeconomic policy. The discussion highlights where citizens have the greatest options for participation, and notes the impacts participation can have on fostering policies and outcomes that target poverty reduction.

AB "Population" is regarded, as a self-dependent unit of species inhabited a certain area. The integrity of population results from the movement of nonresidents within the "population" area. This provides for the sustainability of the whole "population" under destruction of some subpopulation units. The share of nonresidents in the "population" and the number of different demographic groups in its nonresident portion are determined by specific functioning. Four various modes of functioning are characteristic of small mammals. They result in different shares of nonresidents, different composition of nonresident population, and different terms of repopulating of depopulated sites. Biological signal field, according to N.P. Naumov, might structure movements of nonresidents. The reestablishment of destroyed local populations goes due to the sufficient number of nonresidents, currently moving within the "population" area. Asynchronous dynamic characteristics may be revealed in neighboring "populations". The processes, proceeding within a "population", are unimportant for the neighboring ones. The independent subsistence of population may contribute to different behavioral traits - traditions. The number of animals leaving the "population" area, may be sufficient to support the genetic integrity with neighboring populations and insufficient for integral functioning of them. So, "population" may be treated as an ecological cell of species, but it is not equivalent of genetic population.

AB Using insights from studies on social and cultural aspects of immunization in Africa and Asia the paper discusses the introduction of a HIV vaccine from three perspectives. Firstly, it shows how at the side of public health programs local differences will impact on the introduction of a new vaccine. Secondly, it elaborates how at the side of the users of vaccinations acceptance, non-acceptance and demand of and for a new vaccine are related to local vaccination cultures, images of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, and perceptions of vaccine potency and efficacy. Thirdly, it points out socio-cultural aspects of the introductory process. Tailoring health education and social marketing to local conditions and local interpretations of globally provided information will be decisive for a successful introduction. Strong public health programs with highly motivated and appropriately supported staff are another necessary condition. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The ability of high potency emergency foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) vaccines to promote sustainable immune responses in sheep and pigs following a single application was examined. All vaccine formulations induced a rapid seroconversion in both species, as expected, which was maintained at near peak titres for up to 6 months in sheep and 7 months in pigs. The Montanide ISA 206 formulation gave the best results in sheep. Vaccinated pigs challenged with homologous FMDV were protected from disease at 7 months post vaccination. Systemic levels of cytokines IL-6, IL-8, and in some pigs IL-12, increased following vaccination and were often maintained at an increased level for the duration of the trials. These initial results suggest that high potency vaccines may promote longer lasting immunity than the conventional lower potency vaccines in ruminants and a comparable response in plus. Results indicate that in an outbreak situation, should emergency vaccination be done with these high potency vaccines, protection should be conferred for a long enough period for the outbreak to be brought under control without the need to revaccinate. Given the increased interval for re-vaccination the use of high potency vaccines for routine prophylactic campaigns could provide a more cost-effective and efficient means of maintaining herd immunity and is an area thus worthy of further examination.

AB The growing interest in bioactive compounds for new drugs resulted in a notable research boom on secondary metabolites from marine invertebrates, especially from sponges. Some sponge species display promising antibiotic and antitumour activities. Natural stocks, however, are not capable to satisfy the potential demand by pharmaceutical industries without being heavily degraded. Within the scope of the European Commission (EC)-funded NOvel MArine TEChnologies (NOMATEC) project, a new method for fanning sponges has been developed and tested in order to ensure the sustainable supply of sponge raw material without harming the marine ecosystem. Various Mediterranean sponge species with promising bioactive metabolites are tested for their suitability for aquaculture. Special trays were designed as mariculture units using metal/net grids. In total, 708 cuttings from four different species were farmed in mesh on various installations exposed off the marine biological station, Station de recherches sous marine et oceanographique (STARESO), in the Bay of Calvi, Corsica. All sponges were regularly mapped using a digital UW camera to monitor survival and health. Growth rates were determined by weighing the sponge samples (drip-wet weight, DWW) as well as by calculating their projected body area using digital imaging software. Within the first 12 months, species taken in aquaculture exhibited promising survival rates of up to 98%, indicating the general suitability of the applied fanning design. In contrast to former findings, Ircinia variabilis exhibits high survival rates (75% in 12 months) and reveals remarkable growth rates (up to 200% in 12 months). A correlation between the drip-wet weight and the projected body area of cuttings from two species was detected and discussed.

TI An IHS-based change detection approach for assessment of urban expansion

ID REMOTELY-SENSED DATA; IMAGE FUSION
AB China is experiencing a drastic loss of arable land as a result of the continuing process of rapid urbanization. This loss could have an adverse impact not only on China's sustainable development but also on the world food market. To provide a robust and economical tool for evaluating the impact of this process, we developed an IHS (Intensity, Hue, Saturation)-based approach for detecting the change from arable land to urban land by using Landsat TM and SPOT Pan images in different years. This approach takes full advantage of the colour distortion related to the changes in objects after IHS and reverse IHS transformation. Based on case studies in Guangzhou city and Nanyang city, choosing Landsat TM bands 7, 4, and 3 as the input RGB component and employing an exponential contrast stretch and a high-pass filter in SPOT Pan pre-processing led to the greatest change in detection accuracy.

TI Pulmonary function in primary pulmonary hypertension
SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF CARDIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID CONGESTIVE-HEART-FAILURE; EXERCISE PERFORMANCE; CAPACITY; ABNORMALITIES;
   VALUES; SAMPLE; LUNG
AB OBJECTIVES The study was done to ascertain the degree to which abnormalities in resting lung function correlate with the disease severity of patients with primary pulmonary hypertension (PPH).
   BACKGROUND Patients with PPH are often difficult to diagnose until several years after the onset of symptoms. Despite the seriousness of the disorder, the diagnosis of PPH is often delayed because it is unsuspected and requires invasive measurements. Although PPH often causes abnormalities in resting lung function, these abnormalities have not been shown to be statistically significant when correlated with other measures of PPH severity.
   METHODS Resting lung mechanics and diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide DLCO were assessed in 79 patients whose findings conformed to the classical diagnostic criteria of PPH and who had no evidence of secondary causes of pulmonary hypertension. These findings were correlated with severity of disease as assessed by cardiac catheterization, New York Heart Association (NYHA) class, and cardiopulmonary exercise testing.
   RESULTS When PPH patients were first evaluated at our referral clinic, the DLCO and lung volumes were decreased in approximately three-quarters and one-half, respectively. The decreases in DLCO, and to a lesser extent lung volumes, correlated significantly with decreases in peak oxygen uptake (reflecting maximum cardiac output), peak oxygen pulse (reflecting maximum stroke volume), and anaerobic threshold (reflecting sustainable exercise capacity) and higher NYHA class.
   CONCLUSIONS Patients with PPH commonly have abnormalities in lung mechanics and DLc:c, levels that correlate significantly with disease severity. These measurements can be useful in evaluating patients with unexplained dyspnea and fatigue. (C) 2003 by the American College of Cardiology Foundation.

AB Survival, biomass production, nutrient use and fertility of soil were examined in experimental stands of 10-year-old N-fixing indigenous Acacia nilotica (L.) Del. (eight provenances), A. senegal (L.) Willd. (one provenance), Acacia tortilis (Forsskal) Hayne (six provenances), Acacia raddiana syn A. tortilis (Forssk.) Hayne ssp. raddiana (Savi) Brenan (three provenances) and exotic N-fixing A. holosericea A. Cunn. ex. G. Don (one provenance), A. cowleana Tate (one provenance), Acacia aneura F. Muell. ex Benth. (twelve provenances), Prosopis juliflora (Sw.) DC. (one naturalised provenance), Prosopis cineraria (L.) Druce (five provenances) and P. chilensis (Molina) Stuntz (two provenances) growing on a coastal site in semi-arid Senegal. Similar data were obtained for the non-N-fixing fast-growing exotic species Azadirachta indica Adr. Juss. and Eucalyptus camaldulensis Dehnh. of the same age that were growing on adjacent plots.
   P. juliflora produced more biomass than the other species and showed the greatest potential for use as a multipurpose tree. A. aneura showed the greatest potential for fodder production and despite its small stature, it ranked second for biomass among the N-fixing species. Of the indigenous species, A. nilotica was the most efficient user of non-renewable elements in biomass production. A. raddiana seemed profligate in its consumption of both N and P in wood production. E. camaldulensis was efficient in its use of N in wood but its wood contained large concentrations of P and K. A. aneura, R juliflora and A. nilotica had the smallest concentrations of P in wood. A. raddiana and A. indica contained large concentrations of K in their wood in contrast to A. aneura and A. nilotica which were the most efficient users of K in wood production.
   There were few significant differences in fertility in soils beneath the differing tree species. Nevertheless, plots containing P. juliflora and P. cineraria tended to be the most fertile. Soil beneath A. indica was more fertile than soil beneath some N-fixing species.
   The extent of removal of plant nutrients in biomass suggests that without inputs of nutrient elements, harvest of wood and foliage is unlikely to be sustainable at the measured rate of production for more than two tree rotations of 10 years duration.

AB We studied post-dispersive losses of holm-oak acorns (Quercus ilex subsp. ballota) due to wild and domestic ungulates and to small mammals in two types of Mediterranean ecosystems in south-western Spain, savannah-like forests, locally named dehesa, and shrublands. Savannah-like forests which are used for sheep and cattle grazing and for acorn fattening of Iberian pig show a lack of oak regeneration. However, these ecosystems are considered as a model of sustainable resource use in all the fragile area of the Mediterranean region. During the 2 years, 1999 and 2000, we carried out a field experiment in three savannah-like forest and three shrubland sites. At each site, we added marked acorns and studied their loss from plots that were either accessible to any animal (no exclosure), protected against ungulates but accessible to small mammals (partial exclosure), or protected against big and small mammals and other vertebrates (complete exclosure). Results indicated that in the no exclosure treatment (i.e., the normal environment) acorn recovery was very low at any site (0-2.4%) without significant differences between savannah-like forests and shrublands. In the partial exclosure treatment, with small mammals having access to the plots only, acorn recovery varied from 0 to 42%. In this treatment, acorn recovery tended to be higher in the savannah-like forests (0.5-42%) when compared to the shrubland sites (0-2.5%). However, the three savannah-like forest sites, in different years, experienced >92% of acorn loss due to small mammals. In addition, many complete exclosures were disrupted, presumably by rodents, and lost 60% of the acorns. These results indicate that loss of acorns due to small mammals is very important in the two type of ecosystems, suggesting that proper management of oak self-regeneration in Mediterranean savannah-like forests should take into account the effect of small mammals, as well as livestock, especially during the seeding stage.

AB The German steel industry made a good, though not perfect, start this year. By contrast, other sectors, upon whose steel requirements the industry depends, were very slow in taking off. Given the general political framework there can be no question of the German steel industry looking forward to a trouble-free future in any case. The national and European energy policies are hiking up energy costs, while regulations on regenerative energy and emissions trading restrict the international competitiveness of steel companies. The industry cannot comprehend this political harassment, since. sustainability has long been an integral feature of corporate policy among German steel producers.

AB Wind erosion and rising water tables are serious threats to the ecological sustaitiability of annual plant-based fanning systems on deep, infertile sandplain soils in southwestern Australia. In this study, an annual cropping system was compared with two, novel perennial plant-based systems designed to address these threats in terms of their use of renewable indigenous resource, their use of non-renewable indigenous resources, their purchased inputs of energy and materials, and profitability. The fanning systems were an annual lupin/wheat (Lupinus angustifolius L./Triticum aestivum L.) crop rotation, a plantation of the fodder tree tagasaste (Chamaecytisus proliferus L.) and an alley cropping system in which the lupin/wheat rotation was grown between spaced rows of tagasaste trees. Flows of energy and materials between the environment and the economy were identified for each farming system and the natural and human activity involved in generating inputs as goods or services then valued in terms of the equivalent amount of solar energy required for their production using the emergy method of Odum [Ecological and General Systems: An Introduction to Systems Ecology. University Press of Colorado, revised edition of Systems Ecology, 1983, Wiley, New York, 644 pp.; Environmental Accounting: Emergy and. Environmental Decision Making. Wiley, New York, 370 pp.]. The results showed that the two largest energy flows in the conventional lupin/wheat cropping system were wind erosion and purchased inputs of phosphate. The renewable component of-production was 15% of total flows in the lupin/wheat system, 30% in the alley cropping system and 53% in the tagasaste plantation. The annual net income from the plantation system was nearly four times higher, and from alley cropping 45% higher, than from the lupin/wheat rotation. This analysis suggested that once the two agroforestry systems were fully established, the tagasaste plantation was the most efficient at transforming natural resources into goods and services and the most profitable, while the lupin/wheat system was the least energy efficient and the least profitable.

AB The impact of enhanced UV-B radiation on marine ecosystems due to ozone depletion has caused growing global concern. Barnacle larvae have evolved complex photoreceptors and elaborate phototactic behaviors, which enable them to identify suitable habitats for feeding and settlement. For the first time, we demonstrate that environmentally realistic levels of UV-B radiation can induce ocular damage in barnacle larvae, thereby impairing the phototactic behavior of naupliar larvae and reducing settlement success of cypris larvae. Significant disruptions of rhabdomeres (the photosensitive structures in which phototransduction takes place) occurred in the retinular cells of naupliar eyes when naupliar larvae were exposed to a UV-B dose of 7.2 kJ m(-2), and impairment was dependent upon dose rather than irradiance. Our experimental data also showed that phototaxis of nauplii was ca. 4 times more sensitive to UV-B than settlement of cyprids. Since barnacles play an important role in the function and structure of coastal systems worldwide, any impairment of phototactic and settlement behavior of the larvae would pose a significant threat to the sustainability of this ecologically important species. The fact that enhanced UV-B radiation can induce ocular damage and subsequent phototactic impairment in barnacle larvae suggests that UV-B may also cause similar damage to other zooplankton species.

AB There is increasing concern that certain chemicals in the aquatic environment can disrupt endocrine systems, leading to reproductive impairment and threatening survival of wild populations of invertebrates, fish, bird, reptiles, and wildlife. For the first time, we report that hypoxia is also an endocrine disruptor and poses a significant threat to the reproduction and hence sustainability of fish populations. Serum levels of testosterone, estradiol, and triiodothyronine significantly decreased in carp (Cyprinus carpio) upon chronic exposure to hypoxia. These hormonal changes were associated with retarded gonadal development in both male and female carp, reduced spawning success, sperm motility, fertilization success, hatching rate, and larval survival, indicating that adverse effects of hypoxia on reproductive performance resulted from endocrine disruption. Since aquatic hypoxia commonly occurs over thousands of square kilometers in aquatic systems worldwide, our results imply that endocrine disruption and reproductive impairment in fish may be a widespread environmental problem.

AB The catalytic properties of Ti-MWW in the epoxidation of allyl alcohol (AAL) with hydrogen peroxide to glycidol (GLY) have been studied in detail by a comparison with those of TS-1 and pure silica Ti-Beta, and mechanical considerations have been given to the relation between the catalytic performance and the structural, acidic, and hydrophilic/hydrophobic nature of titanosilicates. Ti-MWW catalyzed the AAL epoxidation more actively and selectively than TS-1 and Ti-Beta in the presence of H2O or MeCN, and exhibited a conversion of 95% for AAL and a selectivity of 99% for GLY when the AAL epoxidation was carried out at 333 K for 30 min and at 12 wt% of catalyst to substrate. Ti-MWW proved to be a reusable and sustainable catalyst as it stood up to Ti leaching and maintained the catalytic activity and the product selectivity in the reaction-regeneration cycles. The acidic character due to the boron framework was very weak, and thus contributed negligibly to the solvolysis of GLY. The AAL epoxidation proceeded mainly within the intralayer sinusoid 10-MR channels which supplied more steric fitness to the substrate molecules than the tunnel-like channels of TS-1 ad Ti-Beta. Ti-MWW was more hydrophilic than TS-1, but much more hydrophobic than Ti-Beta. The hydrophilicity of Ti-MWW was presumed to derive mainly from the defect sites due to the incomplete dehydroxylation between the layers and partially as a result of deboronation. The sinusoidal 10-MR channels serving as the reaction space for the AAL epoxidation were considered to be hydrophobic, thus rendering the Ti-MWW catalyst applicable to the substrates and solvents, both of a polar nature.

AB Urban growth is a terrific issue for the next centuries. Monitoring the urban development in order to assure sustainable cities in the future is an absolute necessity. Decision support in this domain needs some spatial information enabling to forecast the urban development trends. Satellite imagery may provide reliable information assessing the different states of urban growth, but it is necessary to anticipate where future built areas might be located. This paper presents the interest of interaction models, more precisely the potential model, to define future development zones. This model is applied to the Strasbourg area (France) using remotely sensed data. Two images are used, one to initiate the model processing and the other to validate the results. GIS capabilities are applied to refine the results, adding traffic network in the study. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB [1] A sound understanding of the sustainability of terrestrial carbon ( C) sequestration is critical for the success of any policies geared toward stabilizing atmospheric greenhouse concentrations. This includes the Kyoto Protocol and/or other greenhouse strategies implemented by individual countries. However, the sustainability of C sinks and pools has not been carefully studied with either empirical or theoretical approaches. This study was intended to develop a conceptual framework to define the sustainability based on C influx and residence time (tau). The latter tau quantifies the capacity for C storage in various plant and soil pools. We estimated t via inverse analysis of multiple data sets from a Free-Air CO2 Enrichment (FACE) experiment in Duke Forest, North Carolina, United States. This study suggested that estimated residence times at elevated CO2 decreased for plant C pools and increased for litter and soil pools in comparison to those at ambient CO2. The ensemble of the residence times from all the pools at elevated CO2, however, was well correlated with that at ambient CO2. We then used the estimated residence times, combined with C influx, to simulate C sequestration rates in response to a gradual increase in atmospheric CO2 concentration (C-a). The simulated C sequestration rate gradually increased from 69 g m(-2) yr(-1) in 2000 when Ca was 378 ppm to 201 g m(-2) yr(-1) in 2100 when C-a was at 710 ppm. Thus, the current evidence from both experimental observations and inverse analysis suggested that C sequestration in the forest ecosystem was likely to increase gradually as Ca gradually increases. The model projection of the C sequestration will improve as more data on long-term processes become available in coming years. In addition, such a modeled increase in terrestrial C sequestration is too small to balance the anthropogenic C emission.

   The oxovanadium(IV) sandwich-type POM catalyzes the chemo-, regio-, and stereoselective epoxidation of allylic alcohols by chiral hydroperoxides with very high catalytic efficiency (up to 42 000 TON), a potentially valuable oxidation for the development of sustainable processes. By using the sterically demanding, TADDOL-derived hydroperoxide TADOOH as the chiral oxygen source, enantiomeric ratios (er) of up to 95:5 have been achieved.

AB The authors compared tropical rain forest canopy structure and tree species composition in two forests southeast of Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia: a primary forest and a regenerating forest that was selectively logged in 1958. For each of the forests, the study plots were set out and all trees of greater than or equal to 1 cm in DBH (diameter at breast height) were mapped and measured. Canopy heights were measured in the two study plots based upon aerial triangulation using aerial photographs taken over the forests in 1997. Using this data, digital elevation models of the canopy were then constructed. The mean canopy height was greater in the primary forest (27.4 m versus 24.8 m), as was the variance in height and the number of emergent canopy trees > 40 m height. The mean canopy surface area in the primary forest was nearly 1.5 times the value in the regenerating forest, and the mean crown size of canopy layer trees in the primary forest was more than twice that in the regenerating forest. The species diversity index (Fisher's a) differed for the two forests, indicating that tree species diversity had been affected by the logging. Both forests had the same five families with the greatest stem density (stems ha(-1)), but the 50 most abundant species, in terms of both stem density and basal area, differed greatly between the two forests. Stem densities and basal areas were similar, but the number of stems per hectare and the basal areas of medium-sized trees (10-30 cm in DBH) were distinctly higher in the regenerating forest. These results suggest that average basal area and stem density in the regenerating forest that had been selectively logged 41 years earlier had recovered to levels similar to those in the primary forest; however, the regenerating forest had a more monotonic canopy structure comprised of medium-sized trees growing at high density. These findings also imply that structural development takes a long time to manifest in a regenerating forest as a result of the time taken for the development of emergent and canopy trees and the formation of gaps; structural development might also be delayed by the high density of medium-sized trees in the canopy layer.

AB We investigate the patterns of variation of plant community diversity along a silvicultural cycle in a managed beech forest. A statistical model of the silvicultural cycle is constructed in order to identify: (i) the relationships between species and environmental factors, and (ii) species assemblages occurring along the successional gradient. We measure six diversity indices accounting for the structural (species richness (SR), Shannon index, evenness index), the functional (factorial diversity, FD) and the compositional dimension (similarity index within and between records) of biodiversity. We compare their patterns of variation along the succession in order to understand the different information provided by each index.
   The model reveals that species assemblages occurring in regeneration stands have the highest SR along the cycle. Species coexistence in these assemblages appears to be based on non-equilibrium mechanisms. On the other hand, mature stands with closed canopy seem to host the more organised communities reflecting true coexistence based on equilibrium mechanisms.
   We discuss the indicative values of the different diversity measures and their interest for the development of sustainable forest management. We advocate that conservation priorities should thus be defined in reference to the processes controlling biodiversity and to the taxonomic groups responding to these processes.

AB Refractory ventricular fibrillation (VF) is a complication of severe hypothermia. Despite mixed experimental data, some authors view bretylium as the drug of choice in hypothermic VF. Bretylium was removed from Advanced Cardiac Life Support guidelines, and, to date, efficacy of amiodarone in hypothermia is unknown. Objectives: To compare defibrillation rates from hypothermic VF after drug therapy with amiodarone, bretylium, and placebo. Methods: This was a randomized, blinded, and placebo-controlled laboratory experiment. Thirty anesthetized dogs were mechanically ventilated and instrumented to monitor coronary perfusion pressure (CPP), rectal core temperature, and electrocardiogram (ECG). Animals were cooled to 22degreesC or the onset of spontaneous VE Ventricular fibrillation was induced as needed with a transthoracic AC current. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) was initiated and animals were randomized (n = 10 each group) to receive amiodarone 10 mg/kg (A), bretylium 5 mg/kg (B), or placebo (P) intravenously. CPR was continued while monitoring for chemical defibrillation. Rewarming was limited to removal from the cold environment. After 10 minutes, up to three escalating defibrillatory shocks were administered. Hemodynamic monitoring continued after resuscitation. Return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) was defined as a sustainable ECG rhythm generating a corresponding arterial pressure tracing lasting a minimum of 15 minutes. Sample size permitted 80% power to detect a 60% difference in conversion rate between groups. Results: CPR was adequate based on CPP > 15 mm Hg in all animals. Mean (+/-SD) CPP was 35.3 +/- 18.8 mm Hg with an overall lower trend in the amiodarone group (p = 0.06). Baseline variables were similar between groups. No instance of chemical defibrillation was noted. There was no significant difference in ROSC rates between groups. Resuscitation rates were: amiodarone = 1/10, bretylium = 4/ 10, and placebo = 3/10 (p = 0.45). Conclusions: In this model of severe hypothermic VF, neither arniodarone nor bretylium was significantly better than placebo in improving the resuscitation rate.
