AB During the last decade, in many European countries and cities, area-based Urban Development Programmes have been initiated, in response to major problems of poverty and social exclusion. Urban Development Programmes are usually developed in a complex interplay between different governmental levels, and implemented by a wide variety of public and non-public parties. This paper addresses the organisation of these programmes, concentrating in particular on the form and extent of `public-public partnership', i.e. on the role that the different levels of the public administration play, both through the administrative system and through policy-making. The `empirical' basis for the paper consists of case studies, derived from the UGIS project (`Urban Governance, Social Inclusion and Sustainability,' a research project financed by the European Commission, DG RTD). The short analysis makes clear that both the model of public administration, in terms of the extent and form of decentralisation, and the presence (or lack) of a national policy framework determine the extent to which UDPs can be planned, approved and implemented at the local level. One of the main findings is that the central influence over UDPs depends more on the urban policy framework of the central government than on the model of public administration of a country. Countries with strong national (regional) urban policies, sufficient decentralisation of public administration to the municipal level and the use of governance methods at the local level open up possibilities for successful UDPs. Without upper-level urban policy frameworks UDPs might be successful as well, but their replicability and the control over their external effects will not be ensured.

DE transition economics; institutions; social capital
AB For over a decade, many states of Central and Eastern Europe have been undergoing a transformation of their political, social and economic systems. The author of this paper concedes that the transition process has not come to a close. These position stems largely from recognising the vital importance of institutional reforms. Such reforms have been relatively slow-paced, especially in the field of informal rules and principles. While little doubt remains that economic transition will be completed and key principles of the market economy will be adopt, it is not equally clear what place these economies will assume on the economic map of the world. The future of transition countries hinges not as much on the effectiveness of external solutions as on the ability to embrace formal and informal institutions needed to promote innovation and ensure sustainable growth.

AB Marketing and production often are treated as different and separate functions of economy. However, reviewing tire concepts of well-known researches and authors in marketing and economics, demonstrated that in many cases there are some affinity in performing these functions. In this article, we aimed at using systems theory to prove how marketing, production, and consumption of natural resources are functioning as the subsystems of the upscale system and are providing sustainable development of the quality of life. We arrived to the conclusion that marketing is the subsystem, which plays the driving role in the system of sustainable development of the quality of life.

AB On February 1, 2004, a 12.9-km (8-mi) bus rapid transit (BRT) line began revenue operation in Jakarta, Indonesia. The BRT line has incorporated most of the characteristics of BRT systems. The line was implemented in only 9 months at a cost of less than US$1 million/km ($1.6 million/mi). Two additional lines are scheduled to begin operation in 2005 and triple the size of the BRT. While design shortcomings for the road surface and terminals have impaired performance of the system, public reaction has been positive. Travel time over the whole corridor has been reduced by 59 min at peak hour. Average ridership is about 49,000/day at a flat fare of 30 cents. Furthermore, 20% of BRT riders have switched from private motorized modes, and private bus operators have been supportive of expanding Jakarta's BRT. Immediate improvements are needed in the areas of fiscal handling of revenues and reconfiguring of other bus routes. The TransJakarta BRT is reducing transport emissions for Jakarta and providing an alternative to congested streets. The BRT provides a tangible vision for an effective, viable, and sustainable public transportation system in Jakarta and elsewhere.

AB The technological and institutional innovation process in public transport is slow and difficult to control. Because many forces work on this process, predicting its outcomes is difficult. This was demonstrated in a project in Eindhoven, the Netherlands, where a pilot was prepared to demonstrate the potential of personal rapid transit. The pilot was part of an innovation process to lead to a more sustainable urban transport system. The guidelines of the bureau for sustainable technological development were followed to guarantee the long-term feasibility and effectiveness of the process. Although the process was designed carefully with concern for the predictable risks, the pilot had to be stopped because of unforeseen political problems. A change of policy priorities and key people caused the project's failure. In addition, strict regulations for tendering bids slowed the process and favored bidders without project knowledge. This paper analyzes the different risk factors and gives conclusions for improving chances for success in future similar innovation projects. Checklists provide a tool to make an ex ante analysis of an innovation project's feasibility and to give guidance for optimal conditions for success.

AB Within the context of Malta's EU accession and rapid increase in car dependence, this paper deals with the future of land transport policy for the islands. Furthermore, this paper has the objectives to identify the present transport trends and organisational structure in the islands, propose transport policy objectives for the future and identify barriers to their implementation. It is concluded that there are similarities in the transport problems experienced by island states, like Malta and other countries around the world and that no matter the size or location, consistent integrate policy is the key to successful implementation of sustainable transport policy.

AB Implementing the road transport directive for heavy goods vehicle drivers in March 2005 could jeopardise sustainable road delivery systems if less productive drivers and rolling equipment ensue. An investigation of the impact perceived by the Dutch road haulage industry tested eight hypotheses in an instrument distributed electronically. The current driver shortage was expected to worsen, and additional drivers will incur additional operating costs. Where few customers will fund cost increases, historically low returns on investment will demand fundamental changes in transport operating systems. Small firms, international operators and the physical environment are at risk. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB BACKGROUND The 55th World Health Assembly declared dengue prevention and control a priority and urged Member States to develop sustainable intersectoral strategies to this end. To provide evidence for the reorientation of the dengue prevention policy in Cuba, we launched an intervention study to document the effectiveness of a local-level interscctoral approach.
   METHODS We used a quasi-experimental design. Social scientists introduced participatory methods to facilitate dialogue in the biweekly meetings of the intersectoral Health Council of the intervention area. This council subsequently developed an intersectoral plan for dengue prevention, of which the core objective was to design and implement activities for communication and social mobilization. In the control area, routine dengue control activities continued without additional input. Knowledge, attitudes and perceptions of dengue, and entomological indices were compared inside and between the areas before and after the 1-year intervention period.
   RESULTS In the intervention area the Health Council elaborated an intersectoral plan for dengue prevention focused on source reduction. The Aedes aegypti control methods consisted in eliminating useless containers in the houses and surroundings, covering tanks, and cleaning public and inhabited areas. It was implemented through communication and social mobilization. The Health Council in the control area occasionally discussed dengue issues but did not develop a coordinated action plan. Good knowledge about breeding sites and disease symptoms increased significantly (by 49.7% and 17.1% respectively) in the intervention area as well as the proportion of respondents eliminating containers in and around their houses (by 44%). No changes were observed in the control area. The House Index in the intervention area was 3.72% at baseline and decreased to 0.61% after 1 year. In the control area it remained stable throughout the study period (1.31% and 1.65% respectively).
   CONCLUSION The introduction of a participatory approach by social scientists promotes changes in intersectoral management. This facilitates social mobilization which, in its turn, leads to significant changes in knowledge, attitudes and dengue-related practices in the population and eventually to more effective control of Ae. aegypti.

DE Carp (Cyprinus carpio); Seyhan Dam Lake; gill net selectivity; fishing
AB Selectivity studies are very important for sustainable fisheries. Therefore, in this study, selectivity parameters for the carp in Seyhan Dam Lake were estimated using gill nets having a mesh size of 28, 32, 40 and 45 mm. Gill nets used in pikeperch fishing of mesh size of 28, 30 and 32 mm could cause growth in the overfishing of carp. Therefore, it is recommended that longline fishing should be commonly used instead of gill nets on pikeperch fishing. Consequently gill nets having minimum 50 mm mesh size can be used for carp fishing in Seyhan Dam Lake.

ID NET SELECTIVITY
AB Annular sea bream (Diplodus annularis L., 1758) is one of the most abundant species among demersal fishes in the Aegean Sea. The object of this study was to determine the selectivity parameters of 52-54-56 mm stretched mesh size monofilament gillnets used for catching the annular sea bream in the lzmir Bay in the Eastern Aegean Sea. Selectivity curves were determined using Sechin method, which estimates probability of fish retention as a function of morphometric features of the body between head and maximum girth of fish. The estimated selectivity curves corresponded well with size frequencies obtained from each mesh size. The optimum catch length of the monofilament gillnets with 52-54-56 mm mesh size were calculated as 12.5 cm - 13.5 cm and 14 cm, respectively. The result of the study showed that using monofilament gillnets with 52 mm mesh size could have increasing fishing pressure on the D. annularis population in lzmir Bay, but monofilament gillnets with 54 and 56 mm mesh sizes would have not such an effect. For sustainable D. annularis fisheries, it can be suggested that monofilament gillnet with greater than 52 mm stretched mesh size should be used in Izmir Bay.

AB Poor selectivity of conventional trawl codends has recently been a serious concern in Turkish fisheries. Modification of the codends to reduce the capture of juvenile fish has been one of the management tools for sustainable fisheries. This study investigates effect of square mesh escape window installation on selectivity of bottom trawl codends for red mullet (Mullus barbatus), annular sea bream (Diplodus annularis) and common pandora (Pagellus erythrinus) in the Aegean Sea. Codend mesh selectivity experiments were carried out using 40 mm nominal diamond mesh PE codend with a square mesh escape window inserted in the forward part of the top panel. The experiments were carried out in lzmir Bay in the eastern Aegean Sea between 24(th) June and 31(st) July 2002 on board RN "Egesuf". A total of 9 valid hauls were made by using hooped covered codend method. Selectivity parameters were obtained by using logistic equation with the maximum likelihood method.
   Mean L(50)s and selection ranges of the window installed codend were found as 12.55 (se 0.18) and 2.27 (se 0.06) cm for red mullet, 9.49 (se. 0.27) and 1.26 (se. 0.05) cm for annular sea bream and 12.18 (se 0.31) and 2.00 (se 0.07) cm for common pandora, respectively. Comparison of the results with those obtained in other studies carried out in the same area by using conventional codends show that the use of square mesh escape window in the forward part of the top panel increases the escape of juvenile red mullet, annular sea bream and common pandora.

ID GROWTH
AB Some biological characteristics and the stock size of the pike (Esox lucius L., 1758) population in Lake Karamik were investigated between March 2002 and February 2003.
   The percentages of males and females in the population were 67.2% and 32.8%, respectively. Although fish samples ranged in age group from I to VII and from 15 to 66 cm in fork length, most of them were in age groups I-II and had fork lengths of 20-29 cm. The mean condition factor of the pike population was 0.812. In the population, the condition factors of females were higher than those of males. The condition factors of both sex groups increased with age. The total mortality, natural mortality and fishing mortality rates and the exploitation rate were Z = 1.28 year(-1), M = 0.19 year(-1), F = 1.09 year(-1), and E = 0.85 year(-1), respectively. The mean fish number over 15 cm in length in the population and their mean biomass were 295,836 individuals and 49,729 kg, respectively. It was determined that the present fishing effort should be decreased by 60% for, maximum sustainable yield (42,273 kg).

AB We introduce a new formal computational model designed for studying the information transfer among the generations of offspring-producing machines - so-called autopoietic automata. These can be seen as finite state transducers whose "program" can become a subject of their own processing. An autopoietic automaton can algorithmically generate an offspring controlled by a program which is a modification of its parent's program. We show that the computational power of lineages of autopoietic automata is equal to that of an interactive nondeterministic Turing machine. We also prove that there exists an autopoietic automaton giving rise to an unlimited evolution, providing suitable inputs are delivered to individual automata. However, the problem of a sustainable evolution, asking for an arbitrary autopoietic automaton and arbitrary inputs whether there is an infinite lineage of its offspring is undecidable.

AB Sexually selected infanticide (SSI) has been documented in some species with a mating system in which males have almost exclusive breeding rights with 1 or more females. When the dominant male is removed, the new male kills the offspring sired by the previous male to enable the mother to be bred earlier. It has been suggested that this immigrant male hypothesis of SSI operates in grizzly bears (Ursus arctos) and that removing dominant males by hunting results in high cub mortality due to killing by immigrant males, or in low reproductive rates because of a female counterstrategy of using suboptimal habitat to avoid potentially infanticidal immigrant males. I tested 2 predictions of the immigrant male hypothesis in a hunted area adjacent to protected areas with high densities of grizzly bears that could supply immigrant males. These predictions were not supported. Over 25 years, 134 grizzly bears were captured: most of the 77 male and 57 female grizzly bears were <= 3 years of age when first captured (54.5% and 52.6%, respectively), and 22.1% of the males and 19.3% of the females were 4-6 years of age when first captured. Similarities of these sex ratios suggest that there was not a substantially greater influx of subadult males than females into the hunted area. Cub survival to the end of the breeding season was high (0.93 or 0.95; n = 87), as was annual cub survival (0.85, n = 81); 15% of the 39 litters monitored for an entire year were completely lost. Yearling survival was 0.95 to the end of the breeding season, when SSI should cease. These results do not support the immigrant male hypothesis of SSI but suggest that grizzly bears either do not exhibit SSI, or that SSI exists in a different form. I propose a second hypothesis of how SSI may operate in bears. This mate recognition hypothesis of SSI is that males of any age may, if they are able, kill cubs that they believe they did not sire the previous year and try to mate with the mother. I use a simulation model to evaluate factors that may influence the existence and likely form of SSI in bears. Results of this study suggest that killing some adult males under a sustainable management regime does not decrease cub survival.

AB Abundance of user contributions does not necessarily indicate sustainability of an online community. On the contrary, excessive contributions in the systems may result in "information overload" and user withdrawal. We propose an adaptive rewards mechanism aiming to restrict the quantity of the contributions, elicit contributions with higher quality and simultaneously inhibit inferior ones. The mechanism adapts to the users preferences with respect to types of contributions and to the current needs of the community depending on the time and the number of existing contributions.

AB The reuse of debris from building demolition is of increasing public interest because it decreases the volume of material to be disposed to landfill. This research is focused on the evaluation of the possibility of reusing recycled aggregate from construction or demolition waste (C&D) as a substitute for natural aggregate in concrete production.
   In most applications, cement based materials are used for building construction due to their cost effectiveness and performance; however their impact on the surrounding environment should be monitored. The interstitial pore fluid in contact with hydrated cententitious materials is characterized by persistent alkaline pH values buffered by the presence of hydrate calcium silicate, port-landite and alkaline ions. An experimental plan was carried out to investigate concrete structural properties in relation to alkali release in aqueous solution. Results indicate that the presence of recycled aggregate increases the leachability of unreactive ions (Na, K, Cl), while for calcium the substitution resulted in a lower net leaching. In spite of the lower mechanical resistance (40% less), such a waste concrete may be suggested as more environmentally sustainable. (c) 2005 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB This paper outlines the key factors involved in adopting energy from waste incineration (EfWI) as part of a waste management strategy. Incineration means all forms of controlled direct combustion of waste. 'Emerging' technologies, such as gasification, are, in the author's view, 5 to 10 years from proven commercial application. The strict combustion regimen employed and the emissions therefrom are detailed. It is shown that EfWI merits consideration as an integral part of an environmentally responsible and sustainable waste management strategy, where suitable quantities of waste are available.

TI Healthcare waste management: a case study from the National Health
   Service in Cornwall, United Kingdom
SO WASTE MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
ID CAPACITY
AB This paper looks at steps taken towards the development of a 10-year strategy for the management of healthcare waste from the National Health Service (NHS) in Cornwall, United Kingdom. The major issues and challenges that affect the management of waste by the NHS, including its organisational structure and collection infrastructure, are outlined. The waste flows of the main acute medical site are detailed, using waste audits of domestic and clinical bags, redundant equipment, bulky waste, and special waste. Some of the common barriers to change, such as staff habits and public perceptions, are also identified. Recommendations are made with respect to improvements in the overall organisational infrastructure and increased localised control. The recommendations also centre around the formation of strategic partnerships, within the site, between sites and at the broader level between the NHS and its surrounding community. An important challenge to be overcome is the need to progress from the concept of 'waste management', to one of sustainable decision making regarding resource use, including methods of waste minimisation at the source and recycling. Staff training and awareness underpin several of the short and medium/long term solutions suggested to reduce the waste at the source and recover value from that produced. These measures could potentially reduce disposal quantities by as much as 20-30% (wt.) and costs by around 25-35%. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Forecasting municipal solid waste generation in a fast-growing urban
   region with system dynamics modeling
SO WASTE MANAGEMENT
LA English

ID MANAGEMENT
AB Both planning and design of municipal solid waste management systems require accurate prediction of solid waste generation. Yet achieving the anticipated prediction accuracy-with regard to the generation trends facing many fast-growing regions is quite challenging. The lack of complete historical records of solid waste quantity and quality due to insufficient budget and unavailable management capacity has resulted in a situation that makes the long-term system planning and/or short-term expansion programs intangible. To effectively handle these problems based on limited data samples, a new analytical approach capable of addressing socioeconomic and environmental situations must be developed and applied for fulfilling the prediction analysis of solid waste generation with reasonable accuracy. This study presents a new approach - system dynamics modeling for the prediction of solid waste generation in a fast-growing urban area based on a set of limited samples. To address the impact on sustainable development city wide, the practical implementation was assessed by a case study in the city of San Antonio, Texas (USA). This area is becoming one of the fastest-growing regions. in North America due to the economic impact of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). The analysis presents various trends of solid waste generation associated with five different solid waste generation models using a system dynamics simulation tool - Stella(R). Research findings, clearly, indicate that such a new forecasting approach may cover a variety of possible causative models and track inevitable uncertainties down when traditional statistical least-squares regression methods are unable to handle such issues.

AB Installing material recovery facilities (MRFs) in a solid waste management system could be a feasible alternative to achieve sustainable development goals in urban areas if current household and curbside recycling cannot prove successful in the long run. This paper addresses the optimal site selection and capacity planning for a MRF in conjunction with an optimal shipping strategy of solid waste streams in a multi-district urban region. Screening of material recovery and disposal capacity alternatives can be achieved in terms of economic feasibility, technology limitation, recycling potential, and site availability. The optimization objectives include economic impacts characterized by recycling income and cost components for waste management, while the constraint set consists of mass balance, capacity limitation, recycling limitation, scale economy, conditionality, and relevant screening constraints. A case study for the City of San Antonio, Texas (USA) presents a vivid example where scenario planning demonstrates the robustness and flexibility of this modeling analysis. It proves especially useful when determining MRF ownership structure. Each scenario experiences two case settings: (1) two MRF sites are proposed for selection and (2) a single MRF site is sought. Cost analysis confirms processing fees are not the driving force in the City's operation, but rather shipping cost. Sensitivity analysis solidifies the notion that significant public participation plays the most important role in minimizing solid waste management expenses. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

AB There is a large variety of options available for the effective treatment of odorous emissions. The most important physical, chemical and biological treatment processes are shortly described and their favourable applications, as well as their limits, are highlighted. But for a sustainable solution of an industrial odour problem, there is more involved than just the installation of a waste gas treatment system. This article focuses on a general and systematic approach towards extensive odour management. First of all, an odour assessment should be worked out where all actual and potential odour emission sources are recorded and characterised. A special focus should be set on fugitive emissions, which may have an enormous impact on the overall odour problem. They need to be captured before they can be supplied to a treatment system. According to the composition and condition of the waste gases, an appropriate treatment system must be selected. For this purpose, test systems have been developed and are presented in this article.

AB Biofiltration is a cost-effective and environmentally sustainable technology for the treatment of exhaust gases from a variety of sources. Although the process setup is relative simple, many physical, chemical, and microbiological processes are involved. Microkinetic models attempting to cover all of these processes are often more complex than reliable; on the other hand, many macrokinetic approaches have a tendency to oversimplification.
   In order to develop a simple and accurate protocol to derive biofilter design criteria from experimental trials, a macrokinetic model based on chemical engineering fundamentals was developed. The model covers first-order kinetics as well as kinetics shifting from first-order at low substrate concentrations to zero-order at elevated concentrations and can be applied to single VOCs and odours as measured by olfactometry.

AB This economics literature review attempts to address important developments in the literature during calendar year 2004. It will not be a list or detailed documentation of papers that were published during the year. Instead, the discussion will be focused on two broad categories. The first is the literature either directly or indirectly related to the management and economics of public works projects, including the following; demand forecasting because the development of infrastructure depends, in part, on forecasted demands; the public health benefits associated with public works projects; land value; irrigation; the development of public works projects; water resource management; privatization. The second category, environmental economics, addresses the following; economics of nonpoint source pollution control and water quality; watershed conservation strategies and the analysis of water quality; land planning and sustainable development.

ID WATER-QUALITY MANAGEMENT; RESOURCES; MODEL
AB An interactive fuzzy approach is applied to develop a water quality management plan in a river basin for solving multi-objective optimization problems involving vague and imprecise information related to data, model formulation, and the decision maker's preferences. This approach, originally proposed by Sakawa in 1983, is modified and presented as a sustainable water quality management strategy in which the decision makers and the environmental analysts put forward their views on three major economic and environmental factors: river water quality, assimilative capacity, and treatment cost of wastewater. This methodology is illustrated in a case study of multi-objective water quality management in the Tou-Chen River Basin in northern Taiwan. The incorporation of these three economic and environmental factors demonstrates the capability of the fuzzy interactive multi-objective optimization approach and also works suitably in water quality management in a river basin by the trade-off procedures.

ID RECHARGE; FLOW
AB Judicious management of a groundwater system requires an understanding of its hydrogeology and response to various recharge and pumping stresses. However, in developing countries, groundwater resource evaluations are hampered by a lack of adequate data that will allow for its complete characterisation. Under such circumstances it is not uncommon for ad hoc groundwater management measures to be embarked upon, especially during drought conditions. These were the conditions that existed during the 1991/92 drought when the CSIR Stellenbosch evaluated the groundwater resources of an urban aquifer in Bulawayo, Zimbabwe. Their recommendations revealed that about 3.5x10(6) m(3)/a could be safely abstracted from the aquifer. In this work, a more comprehensive hydrogeological investigation was carried out which included pumping tests, estimation of abstraction rates and recharges, and numerical modelling of the aquifer. The investigations indicate that the aquifer is unconfined with hydraulic conductivity and specific yield ranging from 0.1 m/d to 2.09 m/d and 0.02 to 0.11, respectively. Recharge estimates indicate an annual recharge of 105.5 mm with 38.4%, 52.1% and 9.5% accounting respectively for direct recharge, water mains and sewer leakages. Furthermore, a long-term sustainable annual abstraction of 6.1x10(6) m(3) or 15% of current city water demand can be obtained from the aquifer.

TI A 3-step strategic approach to sustainable wastewater management

DE cleaner production; nutrients reuse; 3-step strategic approach;
   sustainable approaches; urban water cycle; wastewater management
ID BALANCE; HARARE
AB Many cities in developing countries are facing surface water and groundwater pollution problems. This deterioration of water resources needs to be controlled through effective and feasible concepts of urban water management. The Dublin Principles, Agenda21, Vision21, and the Millennium Development Goals provide the basis for the development of innovative, holistic, and sustainable approaches. Whilst highly efficient technologies are available, the infusion of these into a well-thought out and systematic approach is critical for the sustainable management of nutrient flows and other pollutants into and out of cities. Based on cleaner production principles, three intervention steps are proposed in this paper. The first step is to minimise wastewater generation by drastically reducing water consumption and waste generation. The second step is the treatment and optimal reuse of nutrients and water at the smallest possible level, like at the on-plot and community levels. Treatment technologies recommended make the best use of side products via reuse. Once the first two intervention steps have been employed to the maximum, the remaining waste flows could be safely discharged into the environment. The third step involves enhancing the self-purification capacity of receiving water-bodies (lakes, rivers, etc.), through intervention. The success of this so-called 3-step strategic approach requires systematic implementation, providing specific solutions to specific situations. This, in turn, requires appropriate planning, legal and institutional responses. In fact, the 3-step approach could be applied as an overall approach for waste management, although here the focus is on sewage. This paper offers examples under each step, showing that the systematic application of this approach could lead to cost savings and sustainability.

AB Anaerobic biological degradation processes (AnDe), when properly integrated with complementary biological and physical methods, constitute the ideal route to a sustainable protection of the life environment. However unfortunately for a smooth implementation of AnDe-processes drastic conceptual innovations are urgently needed in the field of environment protection; the present highly centralized approach in the public sanitation sector (CENSA) need to be substituted by a concept that focuses on optimal decentralization, problem prevention, self-sufficiency, resource recovery and reuse, with coupling to agriculture practices at or nearby the location (DESAR). Although a variety of excellent DESAR-based systems already are available and anaerobic digestion and treatment methods have found successful full-scale application for waste and wastewater treatment, there still is potential to improve these systems. Interesting questions to be elucidated are the effect of trace elements and macro-nutrients, the sludge immobilization phenomenon and the effect of environmental factors like temperature, pressure, mixing. Therefore tentatively a lot of challenging interdisciplinary research is waiting to attain further profitable innovations.

AB This paper describes a modelling approach for evaluating the efficiency of different non-structural best management practices for stormwater management. A scenario with a set of source reduction practices was simulated using the substance flow model SEWSYS for an urban catchment in the city of Goteborg, Sweden. The scenario is based on a hypothetical control program that includes prevention, education and regulations. The simulation shows relatively high reductions of copper and PAH, 77% and 50%, respectively. The reduction in copper is mainly due to less copper roof corrosion and brake wear, while reduced road wear has the greatest effect for PAH. An important result from this study is that the nonstructural BMPs applied did not give a sufficient reduction in pollution to meet the desirable environmental quality criteria, To meet these criteria, additional BMPs must be implemented, preferably a combination of both non-structural and structural measures.

AB Sydney Water selected life cycle assessment (LCA) to inform a review of its overall strategic planning document: WaterPlan 21. This assessment covered the entire business and has enabled ecological sustainability to be assessed in terms of quantitative indicators. The LCA was performed by firstly examining a base case which would eventuate if Sydney Water maintained its current operations with only the modifications, augmentations and upgrades planned for implementation between now and 2021. We then performed a number of scenario analyses to examine the benefits of additional demand management, energy efficiency, energy generation, supply augmentation and effluent quality initiatives. The results indicated significant improvements are available and that some of these measures are more desirable than others. We also examined a scenario for the alternative delivery of water and wastewater services in new urban areas. This showed quantitatively that, since connecting new fringe suburbs to the existing system requires significant expenditure on energy for pumping, major improvements in the sustainability of water and wastewater systems can be achieved by using localised, water-saving alternatives.

   destruction
AB Existing inadequate sewerage systems and direct disposal of household waste into water courses has tremendously increased water pollution. Dry toilets are feasible in rural and peri-urban areas to reduce the consumption of costlier water that is required for flushing. As conventional treatment technologies require high investment, and operation and maintenance costs, dry toilets are the only suitable option left for sanitation in the 21st century when working with limited financial resources. To reduce environmental degradation and overcome this problem, the dry toilet is only the realistic option in Nepal. Two reactors, one exposed to sunrays and the other without sunrays, were constructed. In the model with sunrays, it was found that in 48 days of observation faecal coliform presence depleted to 610 cells per gm from the initial value of 7 x 10(10) and volatile organic matter came down from 98.09% to 70.18%. Similarly, in the other model, the destruction of faecal coliform in 65 days was found to be 920 cells/gm while the destruction of organic matter took 75 days. Also, observing from 313 people in a cluster on the pilot project, the annually recovered value of N, P and K was found to be 1565 kg, 125 kg, 344 kg, respectively. This paper deals with the different types of dry ecological toilet, their performance and feasibility study in Nepal, with the full involvement of local people, based on complete laboratory analysis and regular monitoring. Using dry toilets will save 14 LPCD, which is equivalent to 14 MLD and the resulting demand will become only 80 MILD for the urban area of Kathmandu. The result advocates the implementation of ecological dry toilets to save valuable water wasted in flushing, as well as saving the resources needed to treat the waste.

DE constructed wetlands; sustainability indicators; sustainable solutions;
   wastewater treatment
AB In a significant number of European countries, the need for providing appropriate treatment for the effluents of small rural communities is still especially relevant. In fact, in countries like Portugal, Spain, and many others, significant amounts of investment will be addressed in the next few years to the construction of small Wastewater Treatment Plants (WWTP).
   The problems faced when constructing and operating WWTP serving small communities may be relevant when energy and labour costs are relatively high, or when the visual impact on the surrounding areas is especially negative. Sustainable treatment solutions require the selection of appropriate technologies using fewer resources. In this paper, information is presented about sustainability indicators of twenty-one small secondary wastewater treatment plants, including conventional (trickling filters and extended aeration plants) and non-conventional treatment systems (constructed wetlands). The data refer to allocated areas per inhabitant, amounts of concrete per inhabitant, power per inhabitant, and construction and installation costs per inhabitant. The data seem to show that for different reasons, constructed wetlands are promising treatment solutions for application to rural areas in particular because of the relatively low power requirements and relatively low construction costs for served populations below 500 inhabitants.

DE cost recovery; subsidies; sustainability; tariff structure
AB Given the high level of capital investment and the history of government subsidized services, full cost pricing of water services has yet to take hold in India. As a result, it remains broadly underpriced leading to public perception that water is "free"
   The current tariff levels in India are too low to cover even operating costs. This paper examines the existing Indian urban water tariff models (fixed tariff, volumetric tariff, increasing block tariff etc.), their relevance and problems. It was found that none of the tariff structures could satisfy all the design objectives (cost recovery, economic efficiency, equity, affordability etc.). Also subsidies are not explicit and well targeted for poor population. There are several studies and issues that do demonstrate the opportunities for tariff increase and improved cost recovery. This paper highlights the results of such studies and brings out issues needing consideration. Improved cost recovery would lead to improved financial status of the water utilities. Also, subsidies, if designed suitably and well targeted, would serve the concerns of the economically weaker sections. Such reform process would eventually lead to socio-economic sustainability.

AB The paper reports on the methodology and findings of a recent project on behalf of the Austrian Federal Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, Environment and Water Management. The Ministry is seeking procedures for combining ecological and economic criteria to assess which technical urban water alternatives shall receive funding. To this end the current decision making process (DMP) for implementing urban water alternatives in Austria has been analyzed and compared with the situation elsewhere, e.g. in Sweden. The DMP entails specific requirements on assessment, whence the most common decision aid methodologies, ranging from LCA-based to multi-criteria methods, have been described and evaluated from an environmental, economic, legal and practical point of view, turning out recommendations to the Ministry. Their main points are: First the DMP should be kept as simple as possible in order to make it transparent. Second the aggregation of different criteria groups should and can be avoided. Therefore the stakeholders should not be allowed to make trade-offs. Finally clear objectives need to be stated.

AB New stricter nitrogen effluent standards and increasing influent loads require existing wastewater treatment plans (WWTPs) to extend or optimize. At WWTPs with limited aeration capacity, limited denitrification capacity or shortage of aerobic sludge age, implementation of SHARON to improve nitrogen effluent quality can be a solution. SHARON is a compact, sustainable and cost-effective biological process for treatment of nitrogen-rich rejection waters. At WWTP Rotterdam-Dokhaven and WWTP Utrecht a SHARON has been in operation for several years. For both WWTPs the effect of SHARON on the nitrogen effluent quality has been evaluated. WWTP Rotterdam-Dokhaven has limited aeration capacity. By implementation of SHARON, the ammonia load of the effluent was reduced by 50%. WWTP Utrecht had limited denitrification capacity. The implementation of SHARON improved the effluent nitrate load by 40%. The overall TN removal efficiency increased from 65% to over 75% and strict nitrogen effluents standards (TN = 10 mg N/l) could be reached. Through modelling and supported by full scale practice it has been shown that by implementation of SHARON in combination with enhanced influent pre-treatment, the aerobic sludge age can be extended to maintain total nitrogen removal at lower temperatures.

AB In the past decades, anaerobic digestion (AD) has steadily gained importance. However, the technology is not regarded as a top priority in science policy and in industrial development at present. In order for AD to further develop, it is crucial that AD profits from the current fuel issues emerging in the international arena. AD can provide low-cost treatment of sewage and solid domestic wastes, which represents a vast application potential that should be promoted in the developing world. Furthermore, the developments in the last decades in the domain of anaerobic microbiology and technology have generated some interesting niches for the application of AD, such as anaerobic nitrogen removal and the treatment of chlorinated organics. Recently, AD has also generated some serendipities, such as the use of AD in processes for sulphur and calcium removal and the coupling of AD with microbial fuel cells. The international developments in terms of bio-refineries and CO2-emission abatement are of crucial importance with respect to the impetus that AD will receive in the coming decade. There should be little doubt that by placing the focus of AD on the production of green energy and clean nutrients, the future of AD will be assured.

AB The current human use of global natural resources exceeds the long-term sustainable capacity of the planet. New and more sustainable ways of building cities and providing urban water services are needed. The Australian city of Sydney is expected to grow by more than 1 million people over the next 30 years. Water use from the Hawkesbury-Nepean River system already exceeds system capacity. Current proposals to allocate a greater proportion of low flows to meet environmental flow needs will limit urban water allocations and require the development of more efficient water and sewerage systems for new and existing urban development. This paper presents a hypothetical case study of how water supply and sewerage services might be provided for an additional 1 million people over a 25-year period. It compares traditional service provision with alternative scenarios incorporating water conservation measures, rainwater harvesting and water reuse. The paper presents both economic and environmental comparisons. The economic comparisons include valuations of environmental externalities in the form of environmental levies. It shows that the extra capital costs of water conservation, alternative water sources and water reuse scenarios are offset by operating savings and environmental benefits. Ecological footprints are reduced because of lower water diversions, discharges, energy use and CO2 emissions. The paper also discusses the implication of alternative infrastructure ownership and water pricing arrangements, and the opportunities to create incentives for additional investment in water conservation and reuse projects.

ID NITROGEN REMOVAL; DENITRIFICATION
AB Simultaneous increases in wastewater loads and effluent quality demand improved nutrient removal techniques. A simple technique for nitrogen removal is post-denitrification with methanol. The trade-off between better effluent vs. methanol consumption is debatable. Methanol dosing is not only un-sustainable in the long term, but the cost of methanol is also becoming increasingly important. Urine contains 80% of the total nitrogen (N) and 50% of the phosphate in wastewater. Separate collection and treatment of urine could improve existing treatment works and diminish the need for post-denitrification. In this paper, a nitritation-denitrification process is proposed where 20-30% of the N in urine is removed with the COD available in urine. The treated urine consists of ammonium-nitrite, which is to be introduced to the anoxic zone of a conventional treatment plant. Optimal denitrification via nitrite is possible with COD from other wastewater sources. The case study presented here shows that 40-50% urine separation and improvement of the flow scheme would improve effluent quality from 19 to 10 g N/m(3), which would eliminate the need for post-denitrification.

AB According to the central aim of the European Water Framework Directive, the protection and sustained management of the aquatic ecological system, the ecological condition of a specific type of water, will be the primary parameter in future. Aiming at good ecological status in surface water bodies, population diversity and abundance of fish and macroinvertebrates is decisive. Free passage in river systems, to allow the natural migration of fish and all other aquatic organisms, is a prerequisite. To achieve this for the Ruhr River Basin a study has been commissioned in order to develop a master plan for river continuum restoration. Sustainable development aimed at promoting biodiversity in the surface water body system is a key objective. This project is complemented by investigations of the sediment - which is the nursery of the fish - in the rivers to identify river sections or tributaries which obviously provide a suitable habitat for the successful reproduction of big Salmonidae. The master plan illustrates the inherent problems of projects aimed at the restoration of fish passage in water bodies which are strongly affected by anthropogenic modifications. The results obtained may as well be transferred to other catchments with similar use patterns.

DE Burkina Faso; participative management; Sourou; Walloon region; water
AB Inspired by the experience of a river contract in Wallonia (Belgium) since 1990, the implementation of a first river contract has been initiated in a West African country, Burkina Faso. This application is not limited to a simple transposition of the Walloon model. The Burkina context calls for adaptation to the local environmental and socio-economical realities with an adequate partnership management. The importance of the mobilization around this project of institutional partners, as well as local collectivities, agricultural producers and water users in general reveals the great expectations of the actors concerning this new tool of water participative management. But will the latter be equal to the task? A first assessment has been drawn up one year after the launch. During the first year of the project, a participative diagnostic was implemented but the understanding of basic notions of water management such as 'river' (not translatable in the local language), 'watershed', 'contract' were not obvious. After the identification of functions and uses of water in the basin, an environmental survey was started. This approach allows study with the river committees of the priority actions to be developed as a first project of restoration of the gallery forest alongside the stream to fight against desertification. This project of integrated and participative management of water at sub-basin level is a concrete example of solidarity and exchange know-how between North and South in the context of a sustainable development.

DE integrated modelling; real time control; receiving water objectives
AB Today's planning standards deal with the individual urban drainage components (sewer system, wastewater treatment plant and receiving water) separately, i.e. they are often designed and operated as single components. As opposed to this, an integral handling considers the drainage components jointly. This novel approach allows a holistic and more sustainable planning of urban drainage systems. This paper presents an integrated modelling concept. The aim is to analyse fluxes through the total wastewater system and to integrate pollution-based control in the upstream direction, that is, e.g., managing the combined water retention tanks as a function of state variables in the WWTP or the receiving water. All models of the different subsystems are based on the Activated Sludge Model (ASM) concept of IWA, including River Water Quality Model No. 1 (RWQM). Simulations can be done in truly parallel mode using the simulation environment SIMBA. The integrated modelling concept is applied to the river Dhuenn and the urban, wastewater system of the municipality of Odenthal (Germany). An optimised operation of the system using RTC proves to be a very effective measure.

   systems thinking; Water Framework Directive
AB The European Union Water Framework Directive (WFD) offers an unparalleled opportunity for improving river basin management. Active participation is essential for its delivery. "End-of-pipe" solutions will not deliver the improvements needed to achieve its ambitious goals. This research tested DesignWays, a toolkit for participatory planning, as a mechanism for maximizing the long-term social and environmental benefits of such stakeholder and community participation. It examined the emerging role of "planning for sustainability" in the context of river catchments. Sustainable management of water requires integration, and recognition of interconnections between systems at different levels of scale. This is an endeavour in which systems thinking provides useful tools. The development of DesignWays was a conscious attempt to embed 'new paradigm' living systems metaphors into a practical planning tool. This paper begins with a description of DesignWays and its development in Southern Africa. An outline of the context of the action research in North-West England is followed by a description of the stages of the process, with highlights of the outcomes. This research had two major outcomes: a contribution to theory through an in-depth exploration of the theoretical basis of participatory, ecologically informed design; and a contribution to practice through investigating DesignWays' potential to meet key challenges of the WFD. This research points to the importance of understanding participatory planning as a societal process, aiming to make the process engaging and meaningful. It has pointed to the need to see participatory planning and education for sustainability as an integrated process. It demonstrated the benefits of an iterative process in which planning at the landscape level of scale informs, and is informed by, work at the site level. It has shown that an approach consistent with a living systems paradigm can contribute to the development of more integrated, ecologically sound plans.

AB Methods of computational intelligence (CI), especially fuzzy control and neuronal networks, are used for controlling and optimising of wastewater treatment plants. Areas of application are the control of sludge water dosage, of phosphate elimination by optimal precipitant dosage as well as an optimal aeration in the nitrification zone. In two municipal wastewater treatment plants with 60,000 and 12,600 person equivalents the controllers have been installed and optimised and they have been in operation for several years. Results of operation of the plants are presented in comparison to previously used classical control. Performance increased significantly and the outflow values could be kept securely below the government requirements without increase of the energy consumption. Peak loads in the inflow were eliminated in the plant and did not increase outflow concentrations. Results of operation for more than three years clearly show that the CI controller is a cost-efficient method for a sustainable rise of performance in municipal wastewater treatment plants.

AB Hydrogen produced from anaerobic fermentation of organic matter is a sustainable energy source. Anaerobic hydrogen-producing systems have been typically seeded with heat-treated inocula to eliminate hydrogen-consuming methanogens. This can be both energy- and economically-intensive. In this work, operational parameters were modified to determine if operating a reactor at low pH (5.5) and low SRT (10 hours) would result in a hydrogen-producing system free of methanogens using anaerobic digester sludge with no heat treatment as an inoculum. Initially, the reactor exhibited a hydrogen productivity of approximately 7.9% when fed glucose, After purging was begun with 10% CO2/90% N-2, the hydrogen productivity increased to > 20% for the first day. Hydrogenotrophic methanogens then established themselves in the reactor, reducing the hydrogen productivity in the second non-purged phase by 80%. The operational controls examined were not sufficient to eliminate hydrogen-consuming methanogens for longer than approximately one week, and thus further methods must be developed.

AB Greywater is all domestic wastewater excluding toilet effluents. Detergents contain surfactants, which account for the highest concentration of organic chemicals in average domestic wastewater. Accumulation of surfactants in greywater-irrigated soils was determined in three household gardens. The effect of surfactants on capillary rise in loess and sand was then tested in the range of concentrations found in the garden soils. The capillary rise of freshwater in sieved oven-dried soil mixed with different concentrations of laundry detergent solution (10% w/w moisture content) was determined. In a second setup, the soil was mixed with freshwater and the rising solution contained different concentrations of detergent solution. The introduction of laundry solution to the soils caused a significant decrease in the capillary rise over the range of concentrations that is found in greywater-irrigated soils. The effect was more noticeable in the sand than in the loess. Interestingly, in the second setup, the capillary rise of the laundry solutions in the sand was almost similar to that of freshwater, whereas in the loess the capillary rise was significantly reduced. It is suggested that accumulation of surfactants in the soil might form water repellent soils that have a significant effect on agricultural productivity and environmental sustainability.

AB In order to meet increasingly stringent discharge standards, new applications and control strategies for the sustainable removal of nitrogen from wastewater have to be implemented. In the past years, numerous studies have been carried out dealing with the application of fuzzy logic to improve the control of the activated sludge process. In this paper, fuzzy control strategies of predenitrification systems are presented that could lead to better effluent quality and, in parallel, to a reduction of chemicals consumption. Extensive experimental investigations on lab scale plant studies have shown that there was excellent correlation between nitrate concentration and ORP value at the end of the anoxic zone. Results indicated that ORP could be used as an on-line fuzzy control parameter of nitrate recirculation and external carbon addition. The optimal value of ORP to control nitrate recirculation and external carbon addition was - 86 +/- 2 mV and - 90 +/- 2 mV, respectively. The results obtained with real wastewater also showed the good performance and stability of the fuzzy controllers independently from external disturbances. The integrated control structure of nitrate recirculation and external carbon addition in the predenitrification system is also presented.

AB Distribution pipe biofilms can provide sites for the concentration of a wide range of microbial pathogens, thereby acting as a potential source of continual microbial exposure and furthermore can affect the aesthetic quality of water. In a joint project between Stockholm Water, the MISTRA "Sustainable Urban Water" program, the Swedish Institute for Infectious Disease Control and the Royal Technical University, Stockholm, the aim of the current study was to investigate biofilms formed in an urban water distribution system, and quantify the impact of such biofilms on potential pathogen accumulation and persistence within the Greater Stockholm Area, Sweden. When used for primary disinfection, ultra-violet (UV) treatment had no measurable influence on biofilm formation within the distribution system when compared to conventional chlorination. Biofilms produced within a model pilot-plant were found to be representative to those that had formed within the larger municipal water distribution system, demonstrating the applicability of the novel pilot-plant for future studies. Polystyrene microspheres (1.0 mu m) and Salmonella bacteriophages demonstrated their ability to accumulate and persist within the model pilot-plant system, where the means of primary disinfection (UV-treatment, chlorination) had no influence on such phenomena. With the exception of aeromonads, potential pathogens and faecal indicators could not be detected within biofilms from the Stockholm water distribution system. Results from this investigation may provide information for water treatment and distribution management strategies, and fill key data gaps that presently hinder the refinement of microbial risk models.

ID SEWER SYSTEMS
AB Wastewater pipeline leakage is an emerging concern in Europe, especially with regards to the potential effect of leaking effluent on groundwater contamination and the effects infiltration has on the management of sewer reticulation systems. This paper describes efforts by Australia, in association with several European partners, towards the development of decision support tools to prioritize proactive rehabilitation of wastewater pipe networks to account for leakage. In the fundamental models for the decision support system, leakage is viewed as a function of pipeline system deterioration. The models rely on soil type identification across the service area to determine the aggressiveness of the pipe environment and for division of the area into zones based on pipe properties and operational conditions. By understanding the interaction between pipe materials, operating conditions, and the pipe environment in the mechanisms leading to pipe deterioration, the models allow the prediction of leakage rates in different zones across a network. The decision support system utilizes these models to predict the condition of pipes in individual zones, and to optimize the utilization of rehabilitation resources by targeting the areas with the highest leakage rates.

AB The main current trends in final disposal of sludge from Wastewater Treatment Plants (WTP) include: safe use of nutrients and organic matter in agriculture, sludge disinfection and restricted use in landfill. As to sludge hygienization, helminth eggs have been used as a major parameter to determine the effectiveness of such process, and its inactivation can be reached by means of thermal treatment, under varying temperature and other conditions. In such context, the objective of this research was to determine how effectively biogas produced in UASB reactors could be used as a source of calorific energy for the thermal hygienization of excess anaerobic sludge, with Ascaris lumbricoides eggs being used as indicator microorganisms, and whether the system can operate on a self-sustained basis. The experiments were conducted in a pilot-scale plant comprising one UASB reactor, two biogas holders and one thermal reactor. The investigation proved to be of extreme importance to developing countries, since it leads to a simplified and fully self-sustainable solution for sludge hygienization, while making it possible to reuse such material for agricultural purposes. It should be also noted that using biogas from UASB reactors is more than sufficient to accomplish the thermal hygienization of all excess sludge produced by this system, when used for treating domestic sewage.

   development of a comprehensive and sustainable sewage sludge disposal
   concept
ID RIVER-BASIN; RUHR
AB The Ruhrverband, acting as a water association responsible for integrated water resources management within the entire natural river basin of the Ruhr, operates a network of 83 wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and connected sludge disposal facilities.
   According to German regulations, the disposal of sewage sludge containing more than 5% of organic dry solids will be prohibited as of 1 June 2005. In Germany, the only future alternative to incineration will be the agricultural utilization of sludge. However, this way of sludge disposal is presently the subject of critical discussions in Germany because of the organic and inorganic toxic substances, which may be contained in sewage sludge, despite the fact that very stringent standards are to be met by agricultural uses. On the other hand, application of sewage sludge to agricultural land is explicitly supported by the European Sewage Sludge Directive 86/278/EEC.
   In the face of this controversial situation the Ruhrverband has initiated, in 2000, the development of a comprehensive and sustainable sludge and waste disposal concept for all wastewater facilities it operates in the entire Ruhr River Basin. The concept includes de-central sludge digestion and dewatering and subsequent transport to two central sludge incineration plants. It is expected that in future not more than 5% of all sludges produced in Ruhrverband's WWTPs will be used in agriculture. That means, the major part of 95% will have to be incinerated.

AB This paper presents the results of water balance study and aquifer simulation modeling for preliminary estimation of the recharge rate and sustainable yield for the semi and Barind Tract region of Bangladesh. The outcomes of the study are likely to be useful for planning purposes. It is found from detailed water balance study for the area that natural recharge rates in the Barind Tract vary widely year to year. It may have resulted from the method used for the calculation. If the considered time interval had been smaller than the monthly rainfall, the results could have been different. Aquifer Simulation Modeling (ASM) for the Barind aquifer is used to estimate long-term sustainable yield of the groundwater considering limiting drawdown from the standpoint of economic pumping cost. In managing a groundwater basin efficiently and effectively, evaluation of the maximum annual groundwater yield of the basin that can be withdrawn and used without producing any undesirable effect is one of the most important issues. In investigating such recharge rate, introduction of certain terms such as sustainable yield and safe yield has been accompanied. Development of this area involves proper utilization of this vast land, which is possible only through ensured irrigation for agriculture. The Government of Bangladesh has a plan to develop irrigation facilities by optimum utilization of available ground and surface water. It is believed that the groundwater table is lowering rapidly and the whole region is in an acute state of deforestation. Indiscriminate groundwater development may accelerate deforestation trend. In this context estimation of actual natural recharge rate to the aquifer and determination of sustainable yield will assist in proper management and planning of environmentally viable abstraction schemes. It is revealed from the study that the sustainable yield of ground water (204 mmly) is somewhat higher than the long-term annual average recharge (152.7 mm) to the groundwater reservoir. The reason behind this is that the rivers within and around the Barind Tract might have played the role of influent rivers.

   AMMONIA
AB Nitrified leachate recirculation represents a promising strategy for a more sustainable landfill management. Our objective was to determine the reactions involved in nitrate reduction in municipal solid waste batch biodegradation tests. Anaerobic digestion of waste in the three control reactors showed a good reproducibility. In two test reactors, nitrate was added at various moments of the waste degradation process. We observed that: (1) H2S concentration controlled the nitrate reduction pathway: above a certain threshold of H2S, dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA) replaced denitrification. (2) N2O/N-2 ratio varied with the organic carbon concentration: the lower the easily biodegradable carbon concentration, the higher the N2O/N-2 ratio. (3) N-2 was consumed after denitrification. The possibility of a nitrogen fixation reaction in the presence of NH4+ is discussed. Nitrified leachate recirculation during acidogenesis should be avoided because of higher H2S production which could induce DNRA.

AB The Quebec Waste Management Policy (1998-2008) is requesting that the municipalities prepare a waste management plan, including a global objective of 60% of these wastes to be diverted from landfill sites by reduction, re-usage, recycling and valorization. Around 5.8 million tons of wastes were generated on the territory of the Montreal Metropolitan Community in 2001 for a population of about 3.5 millions citizens. In this paper, we present different management scenarios in which anaerobic digestion was used as a valorization step, focusing on the energetic value of the methane produced and the reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The four scenarios prepared cover the valorization of the organic fraction of municipal solid wastes, green wastes and excess sludge and showed potential methane generation of 17-140 Mm(3) with a GHG reduction of 62,000-500,000 tons of CO2-equivalents.

AB Field trials were established at four vineyards in January 1999 to evaluate the effects of four mulch mixtures on different soil and plant parameters. Mulches were made from wine industry and other commercially available plant and animal wastes. Soil, grape petioles, grape leaves and grape juice were analysed over three seasons. The mulches applied released considerable quantities of nutrients, which were available for use by the grapevines, Generally, the type of mulch used had little impact on the parameters that were measured and the greatest differences occurred between non-mulched and mulch treatments. Soil pH showed an increase at three of the four sites after application of mulch. Soil phosphorus increased moderately at one site and substantially at the other three sites in the first year and soil potassium levels increased dramatically at all sites in the first year. After the application of mulches in 1999 the petiole nitrate levels increased dramatically at all sites, however there were no differences in the second year. In the third year petiole nitrate levels were again high indicating that the differences between years was probably largely attributable to differences in rainfall received among the three seasons. Petiole potassium levels also increased after the application of mulch, however the increase was nowhere near as large as the increase in soil potassium. The use of mulch increased leaf nitrogen and potassium levels but not phosphorus levels. The use of mulch did increase juice potassium, however there was greater seasonal and site variation than variation due to the effect of mulch.

AB In order to characterize soil pollution in stormwater infiltration basins, four basins of the Lyon area were selected and sampled. Altogether, 66 soil samples were collected. Each sample was analyzed for pH, cationic exchange capacity, particle size distribution, total organic carbon, total nitrogen, total phosphorus, metals, total hydrocarbons and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Data was explored in a classic way (soil profiles) and using multivariate analysis techniques. Two methods were applied: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Cluster Analysis (CA). Main results are presented in this paper. Pollutant concentrations decrease rapidly with depth while pH and grain size increase. Sustainable concentrations are reached at a 50-cm depth, even after 21 years of operation. Multivariate analysis shows how pollution affects each sampling depth.

Because world wide application of traditional water supply, sewerage and wastewater treatment technology requires financial resources which are basically not available within a reasonable short time frame novel solutions must be found, developed and implemented. The combination of high-tech on-site treatment of the various waste streams generated in households, enterprises and industrial sites, and reuse of the valuable materials obtained from the treatment plants, including the purified water, is one of the options which is investigated by various groups of researchers and technology developers, nowadays. This concept may help meeting the UN Millennium Development Goals, provided people are ready to accept this new way of dealing with household wastes. Education is necessary to build up the foundation which modern water technology can be based upon. In parallel, tailored modifications are to be considered to satisfy the specific demands of local communities. In this context, female participation appears to be extremely important in the decision making process.

   sanitation
AB The basic concept of collecting domestic liquid waste in water-borne sewer systems goes back more than 100 years and became in the last century the conventional approach to sanitation in urban areas. Over the years, these sewage disposal systems had to be successively upgraded by additional sewage treatment plants increasing investment, operating and maintenance costs. Although these conventional sanitation systems could improve significantly the public health situation in those countries who could afford to install and operate them, it is highly questionable, if they are economically and ecologically sustainable. The large number of people in the developing world who still do not have access to adequate sanitation is a clear indication that the conventional approach to sanitation is not adapted to the socio-economic condition prevailing in most countries of Africa, Asia and Latin America. Advanced environmental sanitation is aiming not only to protect public health and the integrity of aquatic ecosystems but also to conserve precious freshwater and non-renewable resources. The Bellagio Principles and the Household Centred Environmental Sanitation Approach (HCES) are suggested as guiding principles and a new approach for planing and designing advanced (sustainable) environmental sanitation systems.

AB With a fast change of land use in Marlborough from extensive pastoral farming to intensive irrigated viticulture, a need has risen to investigate the sustainable use of the available water. In 2001 a 5 ha irrigation research project was installed in a Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc vineyard. Irrigation treatments installed were control (compensate 100% for crop evapotranspiration (ETO)), 80%, 70% and 60% of ETO. During the two years that the Regulated Deficit Irrigation (RDI) trial has run so far, very different climatic conditions created much greater differences in yield and vegetative growth, than up to 40% reduction in irrigation, none of which were significant. The use of sap flow in the vines has been fine-tuned and is now giving reliable results on which to base vine water need.

AB An overview of available onsite, small and community scale wastewater treatment technology shows that it is diverse compared to current technology for centralised collection and treatment of wastewater. An analysis of the onsite, small and community scale technology for achieving sustainability shows that it more conducive to achieving sustainability than the centralised technology. It is likely, however, that its application is in remote and rural areas, where the technology should be improved and integrated with other technology sectors (energy, food production) for improved sustainability. Opportunities exist in new urban developments to achieve similar outcomes, but concerted efforts are required to demonstrate or showcase sustainability benefits in real situations. A huge potential also exists for the use of onsite, small and community scale technology in developing countries for achieving the same sustainability outcomes. It is likely to succeed if the technology is modified to be of lower cost but based on the same science, and that research, development and demonstrations in developed countries are shown to be successful.

ID GEOGRAPHIC ORIGIN
AB This study aimed to establish if there is any evidence that soil mineralogical and/or chemical composition influence the composition and quality of wine grapes. In the initial phase of the study, soils and grapes were sampled in two riesling vineyards in South Australia. Soils were analysed for a wide range of total major and trace elements; soil cation extracts and grape juices were analysed for 27 trace elements by ICP-MS and ICP-AES. The results show that grape juice properties such as Baume and titratable acidity (TA) are clearly correlated with several plant-available trace elements in the soil. Most notable of these are Ca, Sr, Ba, Pb and Si. Soil clay content also plays a (lesser) role. The cations Ca, Sr, Ba and Pb are closely similar to one another in their relationships to Baume and TA, strongly indicating that the correlations are real, It is evident from our results that soil cation chemistry does indeed have an influence on wine grape composition. Such knowledge has the potential to be used in better tailoring grape varieties to soils, and in managing - or modifying - soils for optimum viticultural results and better wines in a more sustainable way.

AB At less than 1,000 km(3)/year, the world's annual use of groundwater is 1.5% of renewable water resource but contributes a lion's share of water-induced human welfare. Global groundwater use however has increased manifold in the past 50 years; and the human race has never had to manage groundwater use on such a large scale. Sustaining the massive welfare gains groundwater development has created without ruining the resource is a key water challenge facing the world today. In exploring this challenge, we have focused a good deal on conditions of resource occurrence but less so on resource use. I offer a typology of V five groundwater demand systems as Groundwater Socio-ecologies (GwSE), each embodying a unique pattern of interactions between socio-economic and ecological variables, and each facing a distinct groundwater governance challenge. During the past century, a growing corpus of experiential knowledge has accumulated in the industrialized world on managing groundwater in various uses and contexts. A daunting global groundwater issue today is to apply this knowledge intelligently to by far the more formidable challenge that has arisen in developing regions of Asia and Africa, where groundwater irrigation has evolved into a colossal anarchy supporting billions of livelihoods but threatening the resource itself.

AB Small scale systems can improve the sustainability of sanitation systems as they more easily close the water and nutrient loops. They also provide alternate solutions to centrally managed large scale infrastructures. Appropriate sanitation provision can improve the lives of people with inadequate sanitation through health benefits, reuse products as well as reduce ecological impacts. In the literature there seems to be no compilation of a wide range of available onsite sanitation systems around the world that encompasses black and greywater treatment plus stand-alone dry and urine separation toilet systems. Seventy technologies have been identified and classified according to the different waste source streams. Sub-classification based on major treatment methods included aerobic digestion, composting and vermicomposting, anaerobic digestion, sand/soil/peat filtration and constructed wetlands. Potential users or suppliers of sanitation systems can choose from wide range of technologies available and examine the different treatment principles used in the technologies. Sanitation systems need to be selected according to the local social, economic and environmental conditions and should aim to be sustainable.

DE constructed wetlands; design guidelines; urban runoff
AB This paper presents the outcome of an inventory of planted wetland systems in the UK which are classified according to land use type and are all examples of sustainable drainage systems. The introduction of constructed wetlands to treat surface runoff essentially followed a 1997 Environment Agency for England and Wales report advocating the use of "soft engineered" facilities including wetlands in the context of sustainable development and Agenda 21. Subsequently published reports by the UK Construction Industry Research and Information Association (CIRIA) have promoted the potential benefits to both developer and the community of adopting constructed wetlands and other vegetated systems as a sustainable drainage approach. In addition, the UK Environment Agency and Highways Agency (HA) have recently published their own design criteria and requirements for vegetative control and treatment of road runoff. A case study of the design and performance of a constructed wetland system for the treatment of road runoff is discussed. The performance of these systems will be assessed in terms of their design criteria, runoff loadings as well as vegetation and structure maintenance procedures. The differing design approaches in guidance documents published in the UK by the Environment Agency, CIRIA and HA will also be evaluated.

AB The Swedish research programme Urban Water has developed a concept of a multi-criteria basis intended to support decision-making for urban water and wastewater systems. Five criteria groups were established for sustainability assessment of urban water systems: Health and Hygiene, Environment, Economy, Socio-culture, and Technology. Each criterion requires a set of indicators corresponding to quantifiable facts and figures, or qualitative data to comparatively assess the different alternatives in the decision process. The decision support process starts as a baseline study where the existing conditions are addressed. Alternative strategies of the future urban water system are developed and analysed by different tools and methodologies in assessing the five criteria groups. Eventually, the results and conclusions are integrated and synthesised into a basis for decision-making.
   As an example of a decision support basis for chemical safety, a barrier perspective was introduced to find out if and to what extent hazardous substances can be stopped, diverged, or transformed at various points in the wastewater system. A set of barriers was suggested, i.e. behaviour, systems design, process design, optional recipients, and organisational. The barrier approach was applied to two alternative municipal wastewater system designs - a combined wastewater system vs. a source separated system - analysing the fate of phosphorus, cadmium, and triclosan. The study showed that the combined system caused a higher substance flow to the receiving waterbody than the separated system. The combined system also brought more phosphorus and cadmium to the farmland than the separated system, but only half the amount of triclosan.

AB Assessment of chemical hazards is a critical issue, which have to be dealt with when evaluating different strategies for sustainable handling of stormwater. In the present study, a methodology for identifying the most critical and representative chemical pollutants was developed. A list of selected stormwater priority pollutants (SSPP-list) is the out-put from the procedure. Two different strategies for handling of stormwater were considered; discharge into a surface water recipient and infiltration. However, the same methodology can be used for other types of wastewater and other strategies for handling and treatment. A literature survey revealed that at least 656 xenobiotic organic compounds (XOCs) could be present in stormwater. In the next step, 233 XOCs were evaluated with respect to the potential for being hazardous towards either aquatic living organisms or humans, or causing technical or aesthetical problems. 121 XOCs were found have at least one of these negative effects, while 26 XOCs could not be assessed due to the lack of data, The hazard assessment showed that 40 XOCs had a PEC/PNEC ratio above one., e.g. they should be considered as priority pollutants. The final step is the expert judgement, which resulted in a final SSPP-list containing 16 selected priority pollutants.

AB EC member states and candidate countries are in the process of implementing the requirements of the EC Water Framework Directive 2000/60, which came into force on 22 December 2000. At the core of the Directive is an integrated approach for sustainable water management in river basin districts. The overall objective is to reach good water status for all waters by the year 2015. The challenges for countries implementing the Directive are substantial not least for the River Basin Management Authorities who will be the implementing unit at the regional level. The Black Sea River Basin Directorate in Varna is one of four Directorates established in Bulgaria in 2002 in accordance with the Bulgarian Water Act and is the regional operational unit under the Ministry of Environment and Water for the Black Sea Basin catchment area. The catchment area covers 20% of Bulgaria and 100% of the Bulgarian Black Sea-coast. Current implementation activities in the Black Sea Basin Directorate and also at the national level are supported by the Danish EPA through its DANCEE programme in collaboration with the Ministry of Environment and Water. This paper highlights the main activities and outputs of the technical and institutional undertakings in the Black Sea Basin Directorate focusing on the preparation of the River Basin Overview by Dec. 2004.

AB To achieve the Millennium Development Goals, all partners (public, private, NGOs) must be engaged for improving and expanding the water supply and sanitation services. Yet, high transaction costs, unclear role allocation and lack of trust and commitment put Private Sector Participation (PSP) at risk. The initiative "Policy Principles and Implementation Guidelines for Private Sector Participation in Sustainable Water Supply and Sanitation" contributes to equitable, effective, ecological and efficient PSP projects. Based on a multi stakeholder process, the Policy Principles are offering an open and transparent framework for the negotiation of valid, widely accepted and action-oriented solutions, while the Implementation Guidelines focus on success factors for building partnerships on the operational level.

AB Nine wineries and a water bottling plant situated in the Franschhoek Valley, South Africa, have decided to lead the way towards creating a safer and more sustainable environment in the Valley. As part of the Vignerons de Franschhoek ECO Association (VFEA), they adopted a multi-site approach and obtained, in December 2003, the first ISO 14001 multi-site certification in South Africa. This proactive approach allows them better overall environmental performances through mutual motivation, information sharing and comparison of practices by the different participating organisations of Franschhoek Valley. At the initiation of the project, the major concerns were associated with a lack of sound environmental management and training of employees. Of particular concern was also the lack of monitoring and measurement of environmental performance key indicators, especially in water consumption and wastewater disposal areas. Although the system is still in its juvenile stage, it already showed some effluent quality improvements through better wastewater management, better control over chemical stores as well as definite improvement in water management and increase in solid wastes recycling. The latter improvements will definitely entail long-term cost savings should the system be continually and properly maintained. It is the intention of the VFEA to create a more environmentally friendly and sustainable Valley by convincing others to be more environmentally responsive and expanding the ISO 14001 principles to other areas of the organisations including the farms, to other wineries and ultimately to the whole Franschhoek Valley.

AB "Dirty water", a wastewater produced on dairy farms, is typically disposed of by application to land 0 with no prior treatment. Pollution can occur if the dirty water reaches a watercourse following an inadequate period of retention in the soil. This paper describes experiments using a novel, soil-based batch recirculation system for pre-treating dirty water prior to land application. Three polythene-lined, vegetated soil-based treatment planes (23 m long, 1 m wide, 0.25 m deep) were constructed, Each treatment plane was supplied with approximately 1 m(3) of dirty water which was recirculated until a clear treatment pattern had emerged. Five batches were treated over a six-month period. The soil-based treatment system could typically be expected to achieve a 90% removal of key pollutants in approximately two weeks for BOD5 and NH4-N, and three weeks for MRP and total solids, An exponential trendline gave a good fit to the treatment curves for BOD5, NH4-N and MRP after the first day or two of batch treatment. The data for total solids removal were more variable. Treatment rates were sustained throughout the five runs for BOD5 and NH4-N, indicating no apparent effect of seasonal weather on the treatment process. The apparent progressive slowing of the MRP removal rate throughout the treatment of the five batches may have implications for the sustainable use C of this technology for phosphorus control.

AB Increasing urbanization has resulted in an uneven distribution of population, industries, and water in urban areas; thus, imposing unprecedented pressures on water supplies and water pollution control. These pressures are exacerbated during the periods of drought and climatic uncertainties. The purpose of this paper is to summarize emergence of water reclamation, recycling and reuse as a vital component IF of sustainable water resources in the context of integrated water resources management in urban and rural CA areas. Water quality requirements and health and public acceptance issues related to water reuse are also M discussed.
   Reclaimed water is a locally controllable water resource that exists right at the doorstep of the urban environment, where water is needed the most and priced the highest. Closing the water cycle loop not only is technically feasible in agriculture, industries, and municipalities but also makes economic sense. Society no longer has the luxury of using water only once.

AB There is evidence of the increasing economic losses from extreme natural events during the last decades. These facts, thought to be triggered by environmental changes coupled with inefficient management and policies, highlight particularly exposed and vulnerable regions worldwide. Argentina faces several challenges associated with global environmental change and climate variability, especially related to water resources management including extreme floods and droughts. At the same time, the country's production capacity (i.e. natural resource-based commodities) and future development opportunities are closely tied to the sustainable development of its natural resource endowments. Given that vulnerability is registered not only by exposure to hazards (perturbations and stresses), but also resides in the sensitivity and resilience of the system experiencing such hazards, Argentina will need to improve its water management capacities to reduce its vulnerability to climate variability and change.

ID MANAGEMENT
AB In the year 2000, the UN General Assembly resolved the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), and all the Member States of the UN pledged to take any measures to get the MDGs achieved. Concerning water supply and sanitation, a rough calculation clearly tells that it is impossible to meet the MDGs by just T copying and pasting the traditional technology as it has been developed in the industrialized countries. Novel concepts and technologies have to be developed, tested and made available which allow fast cc implementation for a reasonable price, and which provide high treatment efficiency, reliability and V robustness. Based on the latest estimates on population growth and migration rates it appears that top priority should be given to investments in the water infrastructure of municipalities. Introduction of water 4 re-use systems should be favoured to avoid over-exploitation of local water resources. Suggested are step changes of the infrastructural system components with emphasis on technology innovation. Many small steps are often more effective than a single big one. In the attempt to quickly improve local situations specific attention should be paid to modern physico-chemical methods based on membrane technology. Decentralized wastewater treatment and re-use methods should be installed simultaneously to the construction of new houses. Further development of methods for separate collection and treatment of particularly composed waste streams should be encouraged. Wastewater should be rated as a source of valuable materials rather than a nuisance. Technology development should proceed hand-in-hand with the CD development of the societal, economical and political framework. Concerted actions are necessary to make novel technology function. Otherwise, meeting of the MDGs will remain an illusion.

AB The objective of this paper is to review the global trends in urbanization with respect to availability of adequate sanitation and water supply services. Urbanization is unrelenting and rapid increase in the urban population in the less developed countries is of major global concern regarding this topic of sustainable sanitation and water. Most global urban growth is in the smaller cities and in the developing world. Half the urban developing world lacks adequate water and sanitation. Global urban access to waterborne sanitation is not affordable and thus is not a realistic option so alternative approaches are necessary. The treatment of drinking water cannot be a substitute for sanitation. In order to achieve sustainable sanitation, a change in attitude about human excreta and use of water is required. Essential features of a sustainable sanitation V system are: containment, sanitisation and recycling. To improve water supply, we need to improve management practices, use full-cost pricing, introduce watershed approaches to protection and provide improved sanitation. Small urban initiatives need to go beyond the traditional sectors and new initiatives are required like on-site urban ecostations, source-separation of urine and faeces, decentralised greywater treatment and integration of sanitation into the cost of housing.

AB This paper compares the conceptual design of anaerobic treatment alternatives for brandy distillery process water from the production of wine, brandy, high proof alcohol, and cleanup activities that will be land applied. The results of process water characterization and treatability testing are included. The wine industry's sustainable practices movement and recent tightening of the State of California requirements for land application of food and beverage processing wastewater, have forced facilities to reevaluate the characteristics, segregation options, and treatability requirements for recycling, reuse, or discharge of effluent to land treatment facilities. The treatment alternatives, results of characterization, and bench- and pilot-scale treatability testing for solids, organics, and nutrient removal using anaerobic and aerobic biological and physical-chemical treatment methods are presented. Based on test results and evaluation, we developed a conceptual design and cost estimates for process water treatment systems to remove solids, organics and nutrients that include energy recovery and produce effluent of improved quality for land application.

AB The Central Queensland University (COU) has championed a self-contained concrete lined evapotranspiration channel. Any non-transpired effluent returns to a holding tank and is recirculated through the evapotranspiration channel until it is used. This paper examines the results from the Rockhampton trial site. Nutrient ions in the effluent were quantified over time and found not to accumulate in solution. Microbial analysis of the treated effluent was performed and was found to be within the ranges required by the relevant legislative codes. Citrus fruit grown in the evapotranspiration channel were sampled and no elevated levels of faecal coliforms were recorded. Macronutrients and micronutrients of the soil in the channels were measured over a 5-year period. No toxic accumulations or nutrient deficiencies in the soil occurred. Levels of salinity and sodicity in the evapotranspiration channel soil were quantified. Salinity rose slightly, as did sodium. Concentrations of salts and sodium did not reach unsustainable levels. The aim of the trial was to develop an on-site treatment and reuse system that is sustainable and protects public and environmental health.

AB Membrane science and technology are recognized today as powerful tools in resolving some important global problems, and developing newer industrial processes, needed from the imperative of sustainable industrial growth. In seawater desalination, for resolving the dramatic increase of freshwater demand in many regions of the world, membrane unitary operations or the combination of some of them in integrated systems are already a real means for producing water from the sea, at lower costs and minimum environmental impact, with a very interesting prospective in particular for poor economy countries. However, membranes are used or are becoming used in some important industrial fields, for developing more efficient productive cycles, with reduced waste of raw-material, reducing the polluting charge by controlling byproduct generation, and reducing overall costs. In the present paper, other than for seawater desalination applications, some industrial applications where membrane technology has led already to match the goal of process intensification are discussed.

AB Decentralized wastewater treatment has the potential to provide sanitation that meets criteria for sustainable urban water management in a manner that is less resource intensive and more cost effective than centralized approaches. It can facilitate water reuse and nutrient recovery and can potentially reduce the ecological risks of wastewater system failure and the community health risk in a wastewater reuse scheme. This paper examines the potential role of membrane technology in sustainable decentralized sanitation. It is argued that the combination of membrane technology within decentralized systems can satisfy many of the criteria for sustainable urban water management. In particular, the role of membranes as a dependable barrier in the wastewater treatment process can increase system reliability as well as lowering the latent risks due to wastewater reuse. The modular nature of membranes will allow plant size to range from single dwellings, through clusters to suburb size. It is concluded that realization of the potential for membrane-based technologies in decentralized wastewater treatment will require some progress both technically and institutionally. The areas where advances are necessary are outlined.

AB The awareness for quality of Web information systems is increasing. Utility is a quality aspect that is of particular importance with respect to the economical sustainability of Web information systems. Like other quality aspects, utility can be focused at a priori, at run-time, or a posteriori. A priori and runtime considerations of utility appear as not really appropriate with respect to utility. An a posteriori focus on utility however is dangerous, as maintaining an already deployed system is particularly expensive. We therefore suggest using simulation as a quasi a posteriori approach for utility enhancement. In the paper, we discuss a generic model of Web information system use. We furthermore discuss an algorithm for generating a simulation model out of that usage model. We also discuss the foundations of a heuristic for analysing the respective simulation model.

AB Sustainable invasive weed management must address treatment effects on desired vegetation. Our objective was to determine the influence of clopyralid plus 2,4-D, glyphosate, and fosamine, at various application rates and timing, on the density and biomass of Russian knapweed and desired plant groups growing in association with this invasive weed. In a randomized complete block design with four replications, three herbicides by three herbicide rates by three herbicide application timings and a nontreated control were factorially applied to two sites located along the Missouri River riparian corridor in Montana. Clopyralid plus 2,4-D, glyphosate, and fosamine were applied during the spring rosette stage of Russian knapweed (June), the bud to bloom stage of Russian knapweed (July), or the flowering stage of Russian knapweed (August). Herbicide rates were considered low, medium, and high based on label rates of clopyralid plus 2,4-D, glyphosate, or fosamine. Density and biomass of all species were sampled 3 yr after treatment. Russian knapweed biomass decreased from 125 to about 25 g/m(2) using clopyralid plus 2,4-D, irrespective of rate or timing of application. Russian knapweed density was reduced by about half by this mixture of herbicides. Normative grass density and biomass were maintained, whereas native grasses increased using clopyralid plus 2,4-D at medium or high rates. Neither glyphosate nor fosamine provided substantial Russian knapweed control or increases in grasses. Too few forbs were present to analyze their response to the treatments. We believe that herbicides must be combined with revegetation in areas lacking a diverse mixture of desired species capable of capturing resources made available by controlling Russian knapweed.

AB Research is needed to develop more comprehensive integrated weed management systems that would facilitate greater adoption by farmers. A field study was conducted to determine the combined effects of seed date (April or May), seed rate (recommended or 150% of recommended), fertilizer timing (fall or spring applied), and in-crop herbicide rate (50 or 100% of recommended) on weed growth and crop yield. This factorial set of treatments was applied in four consecutive years within a barley-field pea-barley-field pea rotation in a zero-till production system. Both barley and field pea phases of the rotation were grown each year to account for variable environmental conditions over years. Weed biomass was often lower with May than with April seeding because of more weeds being controlled with preplant glyphosate. However, despite fewer weeds being present with May seeding, barley yield was only greater in 1 of 4 yr and field pea yield was actually lower with May than with April seeding in 3 of 4 yr, indicating that optimum seed date is highly dependent on crop species and environmental conditions. Higher crop seed rates reduced weed biomass and increased crop yield in 2 of 4 yr in each of barley and field pea.. Fertilizer timing had little effect on weed competition in barley, but spring- compared with fall-applied fertilizer reduced weed biomass and increased field pea yield in 2 of 4 yr. In-crop herbicides applied at 50% compared with 100% rates sometimes resulted in greater weed biomass and lower crop yields with recommended crop seed rates, but few differences were noted at high crop seed rates. Indeed, the weed seed bank at the conclusion of the 4-yr study was not greater with the 50% compared with 100% herbicide rate when high crop seed rates were used. This study demonstrates the combined merits of early seeding (April), higher crop seed rates, and spring-applied fertilizer in conjunction with timely but limited herbicide use to manage weeds and maintain high yields in rotations containing barley and field pea.

AB We developed a population model of magpie geese in the Northern Territory that considered spatial and temporal variation and related sources of uncertainty, building on previous analyses of the plausible rates of increase for this species. The model was used to explore realistic limits to recreational and indigenous harvest and to examine productive, yet risk-averse, management regimes for long-term sustainability. Harvest strategies based on a proportional off-take provided similar yields to a fixed quota system, but resulted in a reduced risk of substantial population decline. Moreover, higher harvests could be supported in model systems that incorporated dispersal phenomena consistent with patterns suggested by the observed distributional and abundance patterns. However, irrespective of harvest strategy and spatial structure, off-take at the levels implied in previously published analyses are clearly unsustainable. These results illustrate the desirability of matching the design of management systems to the heterogeneity of population processes. Management regimes that fail to take account of spatial and temporal heterogeneity could damage the interests of important stakeholder groups and potentially imperil the future viability of the species. However, the costs of disaggregated management systems may be substantial and benefits of investment in them need to be clearly demonstrated. Gaining better appreciation of spatial variation in harvests should be given high priority.

AB We used improved information on fecundity and credible estimates of survival to define the plausible bounds of maximum intrinsic rate of population increase (r(m)) in magpie geese and explored the management and conservation implications, given current estimates of off-take. We considered previous estimates of r(m) (0.78, based on time-series analysis of aerial count data) and the corresponding predicted maximum sustainable harvest rates (30-39% per annum) to be excessive, thereby risking poor management decisions. In contrast, our estimate of the maximum plausible range of r(m) (0.11-0.28) is substantially lower than the previous estimate, and suggests maximum harvest rates of no more than 5-14% of total population size per annum. We consider that it would be unwise to adopt the prior estimate of r(m) for management policy because it would risk over-exploitation. Our results embody a more precautionary approach to assessing maximum sustainable yield for magpie geese in northern Australia, and are not confounded by migration. The move from a simple empirical model to a partially mechanistic one reflects a significant improvement in understanding, but must nevertheless be viewed as part of an ongoing process of model refinement and testing.

AB This study examines a particular form of cooperative wildlife management on Aboriginal land in the tropical savanna of the Northern Territory of Australia, in the context of broader questions about governance. It asks how governance at the local or community level can be designed to ensure sustainable development and real economic benefit for the region's long-term indigenous residents. It is argued here that sustainable development will require hybrid institutions that accommodate and value the principles and practices of indigenous resource management, while also recognising the benefits of broader regional resource governance. Emerging best practice in wildlife harvesting that is founded on careful scientific assessments of sustainability is identified, and an approach to northern development based on sustainability and locally controlled commercialisation is canvassed. Future challenges to the proposed approach include convincing governments and state agencies of its national as well as regional benefits. Reform of governance to facilitate its rapid implementation is desirable, in the context of the relative poverty currently experienced by many indigenous people in tropical north Australia.

AB There is widespread concern about population decline in a number of woodland-dependent birds in southern Australia. Of all declining species, approximately half forage on the ground. This study examined the avifaunal assemblages of temperate woodlands of the Northern Plains, Victoria, to investigate the importance of woodland habitats for ground-foraging species. Four main types of woodland were surveyed ( white cypress-pine, black box, grey box and river red gum) and, in total, 89 bird species were detected. All four woodland types differed in habitat structure and, in turn, supported significantly different avifaunal assemblages. Forty of the 89 species (45%) foraged, at least in part, on the ground. Species richness and abundance of ground-foragers differed significantly between woodland types, being highest in white cypress-pine and black box. There was a greater richness of ground-foragers during the breeding than non-breeding season, but abundance did not vary seasonally. Overall, ground-foraging birds comprised a greater proportion of species (> 55%) and individuals (> 60%) in white cypress-pine and black box woodland than in grey box and river red gum ( 42 - 48% of species, < 50% individuals). Those ground-foragers regarded as declining also occurred in greatest richness in white cypress-pine woodlands, one of the most depleted habitats in the region. The lowest richness of 'declining' ground- foraging species was in river red gum woodland, the most widespread woodland type. Throughout Australia, the proportion of ground-foraging species in bird assemblages tends to be greater in temperate, semi-arid or arid woodlands than in moist forests and rainforests. However, in many regions woodland habitats are severely depleted and their open ground layer is particularly vulnerable to degradation. The extent of suitable habitat for ground- foraging birds in temperate woodlands may be much less than is apparent from current measures of tree cover. Sustainable management of drier (non-riverine) temperate woodlands is required to conserve this important element of the Australian avifauna.

AB E-government benchmarking reports are characterized by their multitude as well as by the dissimilarity of the approaches applied to assessing development. This article will present and compare the research methods and the main results of four selected e-government benchmarking series. Built in this remarks the authors raise the question whether these reports are able to contribute to the realization of benefits inherent in the benchmarking of e-government. it will be demonstrated, that depending on the specification of different system parameters benchmarking series show varying relevance for governments seeking to exercise certain functions. Subsequent to this functional analysis the authors will discuss whether these reports represent an appropriate foundation for governments striving for the implementation of e-government designed in a comprehensive and sustainable manner. For this purpose key elements of e-government are brought together into a holistic evaluation model. Based on this comprehensive approach it is argued that the functionality of the presented benchmarking reports remains confined to certain elements of e-government as well as to certain stakeholders' views.

AB The in situ production and containment of aggressive and hazardous reagents (as well as the avoidance of the use of ecologically harmful ones) has been much assisted by the design of appropriate open-structure single-site heterogeneous catalysts, such as those consisting of metal-ion-framework-substituted aluminophosphates, MAlPOs. A range of nanoporous solids, that meet most of the stringent demands of sustainable development and responsible (clean) technology is described. Specific examples that are highlighted include: (a) the in situ production of peracetic acid from a solid oxidant, acetylperoxyborate (APB), employing MnAlPO-5 or FeAlPO-5 as the catalysts, for the catalytic oxidation of styrene to styrene oxide, and for the oxidation reactions of alpha-pinene and (+)-limonene to produce the corresponding epoxides in high yields and high selectivities; (b) the in situ generation of peracids using a sacrificial aldehyde and air for the catalytic epoxidation of alkenes and Baeyer-Villiger oxidations of cyclic ketones to lactones using Mn-III (or Co-III)-framework-substituted MAlPO-catalysts and (c) the in situ catalytic generation of hydroxylamine using a mixture of air and ammonia for the production of oximes and epsilon-caprolactam employing carefully designed bifunctional nanoporous catalysts.

AB Management systems are very popular. In addition to quality, safety, and health management systems, ecological management systems are being implemented to meet demands from society, politics, and even company guidelines for ecologically oriented company policies. However, particularly in regard to ecological policy there is a large discrepancy between aspirations, intentions, and behavior, which is proving hard to bridge even when legally binding standards are set. This poses the question of the degree to which ecological management systems can influence the ecological behavior of companies effectively. The results of our cross-sectional study in 196 companies show that they can indeed influence ecological behavior effectively, independently of the ecological intentions of companies' decision makers. Besides this main effect which is not consistent however, there is a significant and consistent interaction effect between eco-audits and the intentions of companies' decision makers. In other words, if companies' decision makers are willing to support ecological behavior, eco-audits can help ensure that these intentions are actually transformed into ecological behavior within the companies.

DT Article
AB The article presents evaluation results of the implementation of project oriented management systems and related project management standards at Deutsche Telekom Group. By its outcome related approach this evaluation had the function of quality assurance whereas the conception and operationalization was linked with its function as an active element of organizational development.
   Based on qualitative and quantitative analysis the evaluation of PM Excellence Standards related to process, organizational and personnel factors verified positive impact on the success of projects. The effects of the standards are developing in several steps: At first there is a connection between quality of implementation and practical application of PME Standards in projects; a consequent application of the standards is correlated with a high performance of so called success factors (context and participants of project, process and interaction in project); finally these factors have positive impact on the success of projects in general and on specific dimensions of success as effectiveness, efficiency and social quality. In short this means that in the new organizational context application of PM Excellence Standards has positive influence on the success of the evaluated projects. The objective of evaluation as an active element of the organizational development process was to support transfer of experiences and learning processes necessary for cooperation of central and local units involved, and for a sustainable development of the new structures.

   SHI; healthcare reform; contribution development review
AB Balance of the law for the modernisation of the statutory health insurance (SHI) (GKV-Modernisierungsgesetz-GMG) is contradictory as measured by the original objectives. Although the legislators curtailed benefits and raised the co-payments, those insured could not profit from lower contributions. The anticipated lowering of the ancillary wage costs was missing thereby. However, many SHI funds could settle debts, but the expenditures rose again in 2005. The financial situation of most SHI funds is still strained. The new federal government will have to tackle a further and sustainable reform of the statutory health insurance soon.

AB This study examines the effectiveness of a 1.2-ha created/restored emergent marsh at reducing nutrients from a 17.0 ha agricultural and forested watershed in the Ohio River Basin in west central Ohio, USA, during base flow and storm flow conditions. The primary source of water to the wetland was surface inflow, estimated in water year 2000 (October 1999-September 2000) to be 646cm/year. The wetland also received a significant amount of groundwater discharge at multiple locations within the site that was almost the same in quantity as the surface flow. The surface inflow had 2-year averages concentrations of 0.79, 0.033. and 0.16 mg L-1 for nitrate + nitfite (as N), soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP), and total phosphorus (TP), respectively. Concentrations of nitrate-nitrite, SRP, and TP were 40, 56, and 59% lower, respectively, at the outflow than at the inflow to the wetland over the 2 years of the study. Concentrations of SRP and TP exported from the wetland increased significantly (alpha = 0.05) during precipitation events in 2000 compared to dry weather flows, but concentrations of nitrate-nitrite did not increase significantly. During these precipitation events the wetland retained 41% of the nitrate-nitrite, 74% of the SRP and 28% of the TP (by mass). The wetland received an average of 50 g N m(-2) per year of nitrate-nitrite and 7.1 g m(-2) per year of TP in 2000. Retention rates for the wetland were 39 g N m(-2) per year of nitrates and 6.2 g P m(-2) per year. These are close to rates suggested in the literature for sustainable non-point source retention by wetlands. The design of this wetland appears to be suitable as it retained a significant portion of the influent nutrient load and did not lose much of its retention capacity during heavy precipitation events. Some suggestions are given for further design improvements. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Photocatalytic conversion of nitric oxide (NO) in ambient air was studied in a continuous-flow photoreactor system at room temperature using different TiO2 catalysts prepared with different titanium precursors of Ti(SO4)(2), TiOSO4, and Ti(O-BU)(4) by either a moderate-temperature hydrothermal process or a hydrothermal reflux process. The physicochemical properties of the prepared catalysts were characterized by XRD, BET, FTIR, and SEM. Analytical results showed that the crystallinity, morphology, nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms, specific surface area, and pore size distribution of catalysts were significantly affected by the precursors and hydrothermal processes. but the crystal structure and crystal size of catalysts were not significantly influenced. The NO conversion experiments demonstrated that the TiO2 catalysts prepared by the moderate-temperature hydrothermal process without ammonia pretreatment could effectively reduce NO to different low levels, in which the catalysts with longer aging time of more than 12 It performed better than the catalysts with shorter aging time. However, it was found that the NO2 concentration in outlet gas was gradually increased with extension of an experimental period. Two TiO2 catalysts (TOSO-NH3 and TOB-NH3) prepared by the hydrothermal reflux process with ammonia pretreatment demonstrated a very good performance in NO conversion and also maintained a low level of NO2 concentration in outlet gas. This study indicated that using the TiO2 catalysts modified with ammonia pretreatment in photocatalytic reaction could provide a good approach to effectively eliminate the accumulation of NO2 product from NO oxidation in the system and to achieve a sustainable process, which may be applicable for NO elimination in ambient air environment.

AB Understanding the effects of logging activity on genetic diversity is an important aspect of establishing the sustainability of selective logging management operations in tropical forests. Genetic variation is affected by selective logging directly, through the removal of and damage to trees within the population, and indirectly, through a change in the forest structure and environment in which the remaining population lives.
   Eco-Gene is a population genetics model applied to tropical forests over a scale of hundreds of hectares. SYMFOR is a modelling framework for individual-based spatially explicit ecological and management models applied to tropical forests over a scale of 0.25 4 ha. We have linked the models to enable simulations using processes involved in both models. To overcome problems of scale, the spatially explicit competition index calculated in SYMFOR simulations has been modelled such that it can be applied at scales representing much larger areas for which the data are not available, as required by Eco-Gene.
   The competition index is modelled as a distribution on a grid-square basis, and implemented in the linked Eco-Gene/SYMFOR system. Each tree within a grid-square is given a "relative competition" within the distribution, biased according to species. A competition index value is obtained for the tree by transforming the grid-square distribution to be relevant to the size of the tree, and extracting a value according to the tree's relative competition within the distribution. The distribution and each tree's relative competition within it change according to the effects of growth, mortality and logging activity.
   The model was calibrated using data from the Tapajos region of the Eastern Amazon forest. This paper describes the model, its calibration and validation and the implications of scaling up from an explicit representation to a modelled quantity. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A bioeconomic study of periphyton-based aquaculture in Bangladesh was carried out through comparison of on-farm and on-station trials. Five treatments. three on-farm and two on-station. each with four replications, were tried in a completely randomized design: on-farm control without substrate or feed (control), on-farm bamboo substrate only (treatment B-farm), on-farm substrate plus feed (BF-farm), on-station substrate only (B-station) and on-station substrate plus feed (BF-station). All ponds were stocked with three native major carps, rohu (Labeo rohita), catla (Catla catla) and mrigal (Cirrhinus mrigala) at a ratio of 60:40:15 and a stocking density of 11.500 juveniles ha(-1). All ponds were fertilized fortnightly with urea and triple super phosphate (TSP) at the same rate of 50 kg ha(-1). In substrate treatments, ponds were provided with bamboo poles as periphyton substrates. In fed treatments, rice bran and mustard oil cake (ratio 2:1 by weight) were applied.
   The environmental conditions of on-station ponds were better than on-farm ponds. Under on-farm condition, substrate plus feed (BF-farm) and substrate only (B-farm). respectively, resulted in 59% and 28% higher production over control. Under on-station condition. supplemental feed did not contribute significantly to the total fish production. However. on-substation trial resulted in 77% higher combined net yield than on-farm trial. The cost-benefit analysis indicated that well-managed periphyton-based aquaculture practices might be a profitable business. The sustainability issues of this novel technology needs to be carefully assessed during the design and planning of aquacultural developmental efforts. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The optimizing and controlling for polymerase chain reactions (PCRs) requires standard target sequences to measure reaction specificity and to obtain accurate gene quantification. However, defined target sequences are often not readily available. This situation is particularly evident in the study of rare splice variant transcripts. For gains in efficiency and reaction speed, a small size of PCR amplicon typifies real-time PCR formats, including hydrolysis probes. This study demonstrates the use of oligonucleoticles resembling one strand of complete amplicon sequences used in real-time PCR to provide sustainable and precise amounts of the target sequence without the necessity of enlisting nucleic acid cloning procedures. The application of template oligonucleotides is modeled using all of the splice variant forms of human vascular endothelial growth factor. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

   conditions: A simulation study
SO RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS

AB Increasing multi-sectoral demands on water resources have led to water abstraction and transfer activities, and the construction of dams and embankments that have significantly altered the flood regimes of rivers throughout the world resulting in the loss of fish production and biodiversity. The current emphasis on sustainable development and biodiversity conservation is leading efforts to mitigate these impacts by means of interventions such as the release of artificial floods downstream of dams and the manipulation of water levels within impounded floodplains.
   Whilst much work has been done to determine the hydrological requirements for the maintenance of salmonid populations, few equivalent studies are available from which to develop criteria for the management of hydrological regimes for fishes and fisheries in large floodplain-river systems such as the Mekong. The population dynamics of fish in such rivers are believed to respond to hydrological conditions in a density-dependent manner. An age-structured population dynamics model incorporating sub-models describing density-dependent growth, mortality and recruitment was used to explore how hydrological conditions within a theoretical floodplain-river system affect the dynamics of a common floodplain-river fish species.
   Graphical summaries of the response of exploitable biomass to a range of different drawdown rates, dry and flood season areas and volumes, and flood season durations are presented under five different model assumptions concerning density-dependent processes. Optimal flooding patterns are also described for the model species and theoretical river system.
   The patterns of predictions that emerge from the simulations provide guidelines for managing or manipulating hydrological conditions in river systems for both fixed and variable volume hydrological scenarios. As a general rule of thumb, exploitable biomass is maximized by minimizing the rate of drawdown and maximizing the flood duration and flood and dry season areas or volumes. However, experiences from dam and other hydraulic engineering projects suggest that these predictions should be treated with caution until we better understand the influence of hydrology on spawning behaviour, system primary production, and critical habitat availability.

TI A comparative perspective on self-assessment of local agenda 21 in

DT Article
AB The aim of this article is to describe a model for evaluating Local Agenda 21 processes. The local level extension of Agenda 21, Local Agenda 21 (LA21), is a typical instrument for extensive governance. It is primarily a voluntary sustainability policy tool with a goal of activating existing local government and other local stakeholder organisations in order to meet the local level challenges for the local and global environment, and social and local economic conditions. It also aims to create new governance structures among political and non-political actors. In a European perspective, the introduction of LA21 to cities can be considered as a success-story, but these activities are not distributed equally in Europe. To compare these differences we use a quantitative database from 146 European cities, all of them active in a LA21 or similar policy process. The data presented here is collected within an international research project entitled "LASALA -- Local authorities' self-assessment of local Agenda", funded by European Commission, DG Research, 5th Framework Programme, 2000-2001.

AB Export of nutrients after whole-tree harvest (WTH), i.e. harvesting nearly all of the aboveground parts of the trees, may affect the long-term sustainability of forest production. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects on planted Picea abies (L.) Karst. seedlings (in terms of survival, growth, and elemental concentrations in needles) of brash removal at final felling on unfertilized control plots, and others that had been fertilized with 4 x 120-600 = 480-2400 kg N ha(-1) in the form of urea, prior to harvest.
   During the first six growing seasons after planting, the survival rate of originally planted seedlings was not affected by the brash removal. For replacement seedlings, the survival rate during the first 5 years after planting tended to be somewhat higher on plots where the brash was removed compared with plots where the brash was left on site, as in a conventional harvest (CH). The survival was not affected by the pre-harvest N fertilization. The height development of the seedlings was not influenced by either of the two treatments. However, the mean volume per seedling tended to be larger in the WTH than in the CH-plots for replacement seedlings, but not for originally planted seedlings. Needles from seedlings in the CH-plots showed significantly higher concentrations of N, S, B and Cu compared with needles from seedlings in the WTH-plots. The previous N fertilization did not influence the element concentrations.
   The results indicate that survival and early growth of planted P. abies seedlings were marginally affected after WTH compared with CH on the studied site, where the supply of plant-available N was indicated to not be limiting for tree growth. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.

AB We investigated the effects of immediate, short-term (2-5 years after logging) and long-term (about 50 years after logging) logging on tree species from different diameter size classes in three forest reserves in Peninsular Malaysia. Demographic data on number of trees, species and diameter of all trees above I cm diameter at breast height (dbh) were measured from three ecological plots (20 in x 50 in) established at different elevations in each study site. The total reduction in mean basal area for trees greater than or equal to1 cm dbh for both logged stands was significantly different (P < 0.05), i.e. 50.9% in Compartment 118 and 51.8% in Compartment 48. All trees more than 60 cm dbh in Compartment 118 and 75 cm dbh in Compartment 48 were felled in a single selective cutting under selective management system (SMS). The removal of these genetically superior adult trees will affect the genetic quality of the remaining and subsequent regenerating gene pools. The mean basal area and tree density for seedling and sapling class (<5 cm dbh) were reduced to one-half of the original stand in Compartment 118 after logging, meanwhile an increment of 24.3% was observed in Compartment 48; 2.5 years after logging. This implies that the logging operation favoured the growth of seedlings and saplings. The net loss in trees was offset by incremental growth in surviving trees. Good regeneration was observed in the regenerated stand of Compartment 69 (RS-C69) with 28.5% and 20.5% more, respectively, in basal area and tree density for seedling and sapling class compared to Compartment 118 before logging. There were no distinct changes in species composition before and after logging in this study. The high negative correlation of basal area with relative disturbance index was observed in Compartments H 8 and 48 based on botanical name or native name, indicating that the degree of disturbance was affected by the type and magnitude of disturbances in each of the localities in the compartment. This further implies that a logging operation in the compartment is not a homogeneous activity. The current harvesting system (i.e. SMS) in Peninsular Malaysia should consider the abundance of young regenerants and the genetic quality of the residuals left behind in the postharvest stands. The current mechanized logging techniques also need to be improved by adopting the reduced impact logging (RIL) techniques, so as to promote regeneration of desired commercial timber species and as a consequence, sustainability of the forests.

Hack.) as soil and water conservation (SWC) measures, the sole application of an organic (compost-N) or mineral (urea-N) nitrogen and the combined use of SWC and compost-N or urea-N on N flows and balances. The trial was conducted on a Ferric Lixisol with 1.5% slope and comprised nine treatments in two replications. The SWC measures were put along contours lines. During the three consecutive years, all treatments induced negative annual N balances (-75 to -24 kg N ha(-1)). The main factors explaining these negative balances were N exports by sorghum biomass and soil erosion-induced N losses. Large amounts of N (7 kg N ha(-1) per year in 2000 and 44 kg N ha(-1) per year in 2002) were lost in the control treatment through runoff and eroded sediments, which corresponds respectively to about 10 and 43% of the total outflow of N. Sole stone rows and grass strips reduced erosion N losses to 8 and 12%, respectively, of the total annual loss. The combined application of SWC measures and nutrients inputs reduced erosion N losses to only 2-7% of the annual N loss. The application of urea-N or compost-N led to the lowest soil N mining over the 3 years, whereas the highest N mining was observed in plots without added N. We conclude that N mining in poor fertile soils of West Africa can be mitigated through an integration of local water and nutrient management practices. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The continuous increase of consumer interest in quality, convenience and food quality has encouraged further research into edible films and coatings from natural polymers, such as polysaccharides. Ecoefficient products are the new generation of biobased products prepared with sustainable materials, that agree with ecological and economic requirements including environmentally acceptable disposal of post-user waste. The numerous potential applications of natural polymers such as polysaccharides stimulated the study with edible films based on cassava starch. Blends of glycerol (GLY) and polyethylene glycol (PEG) as plasticizers, and glutaraldehyde (GLU) as crosslinking agent were prepared in order to determine the mechanical properties and water vapor transmission of those films. A response surface methodology was applied on the results to identify the blend with the best mechanical properties and lowest water vapor transmission. The crosslinking effect of glutaraldehyde in the films can be observed. The plasticizing action of polyethylene glycol was restrained by more than 0.5 g of glutataraldehyde. The use of glycerol was less evident for this property even after 284 h of contact time with water vapor. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

DE attenuated-total-reflection; infrared; poly(lactic) acid
AB Infrared (IR) spectra were collected on a series of blends of poly(lactic acid) (PLA) and poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hxdroxyhexanoate) (P(3HB-co-3HHx) (3HHx = 13.4 mol%)) using a single-bounce temperature-control led attenuated-total-reflection (ATR) accessory with a diamond internal reflection element (IRE). Different approaches were used to analyze the raw spectral data, including peak positions. widths and intensities, principal components. and 2D correlation spectra. Differences in the interactions between the functional groups of the components become apparent as a function of temperature and composition. This study provides insights into the submolecular-level interactions and miscibility of this polymer blend system. In particular for the 40/60 PLA/P(3HB-co-3HHx) blend, two types of crystalline P(3HB-co-3HHx) C=O bands were observed. The band representing a more-ordered local C=O environment had a peak absorbance at a lower wavenumber than the second, less-ordered C=O species. The 2D IR correlation analysis also revealed that the more-ordered material disappeared first upon heating of the sample and the amorphous P(3HB-co-3HHx) C=O band formed before. the less-ordered P(3HB-co-3HHx) C=O band disappeared. This observation is likely the result of the less-ordered crystalline form being replenished by thermally induced disordering of the more-ordered crystalline form. Thus, the less-order crystalline material may be viewed as an intermediate form during the melting process. In the 80/20 PLA/P(3HB-co-3HHx) blend, it was observed that the lower wavenumber peak in the PLA C=O doublet preferentially interacts with amorphous P(3HB-co-3HHx). When 10-20% P(3HB-co-3HHx) is added to PLA. the crystallinity of P(3HB-co-3HHx) is restricted, probably due. to domain size restriction and inherent low nucleation density. These IR results suggest that P(3HB-co-3HHx) has the potential to increase the toughness of PLA dramatically. thereby enlarging the design space of sustainable materials achievable by blending.

AB The quasi-steady-states, marked by small fluctuations of residual glucose, ethanol, and biomass concentrations, and sustainable oscillations marked by big fluctuations of these monitored fermentation parameters were observed during the continuous ethanol fermentation of Saccharomyces cerevisiae when very high gravity media were fed and correspondingly high ethanol concentrations reached. A high ethanol concentration was shown to be one of the main factors that incited these oscillations, although the residual glucose level affected the patterns of these oscillations to some extent. The lag response of S. cerevisiae to high ethanol stress that causes the shifts of morphology, viability loss, and death of yeast cells is assumed to be one of the probable mechanisms behind these oscillations. It was predicted that the longer the delay of this response was, the longer the oscillation periods would be, which was validated by the experimental data and the comparison with the oscillatory behaviors reported for the ethanologen bacterium, Zymomonas mobilis. Furthermore, three tubular bioreactors in series were arranged to follow a stirred tank bioreactor to attenuate these oscillations. However, exaggerated oscillations were observed for the residual glucose, ethanol, and biomass concentrations measured in the broth from these tubular bioreactors. After the tubular reactors were packed with Intalox ceramic saddle packing, these oscillations were effectively attenuated and quasi-steady-states were observed during which there were very small fluctuations of residual glucose, ethanol, and biomass within the entire experimental run.

AB Since the adoption of the Rio-Declaration in 1992 the concept of sustainable development is raising more and more awareness in public perception. The concept requires the integration of economic, environment and social considerations into all decision-making, fostering intra-generational equity through the alleviation of poverty by concentrating the benefits of development in lesser developed areas and considering the needs of future generations to ensure that inter-generated equity exists. The implementation of sustainable development concept requires certain means. One major instrument is forecasting of development by using sustainable development indicators. In this article the problems of methodological basis of forecasting of sustainable development of economic system are considered. The authors investigate these problems on an example of Republic of Kazakhstan. (C) 2004 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB There is paucity of information on the effects of exploitation on reproductive characteristics of blackspot snapper, Lutjanus fulviflamma (Forsskal 1775) in Tanzanian coastal waters. We compared size at first sexual maturity (L-M50), sex ratio, fecundity, and breeding season of L. fulviflamma in least fished Mafia Island Marine Park (MIMP) and intensively fished areas (IFA) between May 1999 and April 2001. Fish in MIMP matured at significantly smaller size (female: L-M50 = 206.3 mm; male: L-M50 = 195.5 mm) than in IFA (female: L-M50 = 216.7 mm; male: L-M50 =212.1 mm) total body length. Sex ratio was balanced at 1.03 : 1 (female : male) in MIMP, but it was skewed 0.9 : 1 (female : male) in IFA. Size-related differences in sex ratio were observed with males predominating in the smaller sizes and females in the larger sizes. Total fecundity of fish in MIMP was determined at 45,200-430,200 oocytes in females of between 207 and 293 mm total length. Lutjanus fulviflamma in MIMP has a prolonged spawning season lasting from September to March peaking in December. None of the fish from IFA were in breeding state, suggesting recruitment overfishing is an added matter of concern for the long-term sustainability of the fishery at the current exploitation level.

AB This paper estimates a structural econometric model of household decisions regarding income strategies, participation in programs and organisations, crop choices, land management, and labour use, and their implications for agricultural production and soil erosion: based upon a survey of over 450 households and their farm plots in Uganda. Many factors have context-specific impacts and involve trade-offs between increasing production and reducing land degradation. Government agricultural extension and training programs contribute to higher value of crop production in the lowlands, but to soil erosion in the highlands. By contrast, non-governmental organization (NGO) programs focusing on agriculture and environment help to reduce erosion, but have less favourable impacts on production in the lowlands. Education increases household incomes, but also reduces crop production in the lowlands. Poverty has mixed impacts on agricultural production, depending on the nature of poverty: smaller farms obtain higher crop production per hectare, while households with fewer livestock have lower crop production. Population pressure contributes to agricultural intensification, but also to erosion in the densely populated highlands. Several household income strategies contribute to increased value of crop production, without significant impacts on soil erosion. We find little evidence of impact of access to markets, roads and credit, land tenure or title on agricultural intensification and crop production and land degradation. In general, the results imply that the strategies to increase agricultural production and reduce land degradation must be location-specific, and that there are few 'win-win' opportunities to simultaneously increase production and reduce land degradation.

AB Communal grazing lands are important sources of livestock feed in developing countries. The uncontrolled and free grazing system in many of these countries has caused severe degradation of these resources. This paper examines the nature and determinants of collective action for grazing land management in the highlands of Tigray, northern Ethiopia. We find that community grazing land management contributes to more sustainable use of the resource and alleviation of feed shortage. Most collective action is locally initiated and is organized at village level. Collective action for grazing land management may be more beneficial and more effective in areas with intermediate population, higher social capital, and lower heterogeneity in oxen ownership that are far from market places.

ID CROPPING SYSTEMS
AB During times of economic uncertainty, such as the current period, all costs of agricultural production become important and worthy of close scrutiny if the threat of farm foreclosures is to be minimized. This concern particularly applies to the cost of plant nutrients, which, under conventional approaches, typically represents 24%30% (or more) of the total variable costs of production [Lu et al. (2000) Food Reviews International 16(2): 121157; Bullen and Brown (2001) Economic Evaluation of UNR Cotton, NC State University, Raleigh, North Carolina]. The purpose of this paper is to examine, via a review of the literature, the economics and profitability of various plant nutrient management strategies - both conventional and alternative ones - in an attempt to identify those strategies that can lead to financial resource optimization and, ultimately, maximum profits for farm enterprises. The results of this analysis are as follows: In a meta-analysis of 120 studies, conventional nutrient management systems, using commercial fertilizers, showed higher profit for most grain crops (with the exception of corn and sorghum), than organic nutrient management systems. Both cover crop and animal manure-based systems show considerable promise as alternative nutrient management strategies for increasing farm profitability. A cover crop system produced the highest average corn yield and gross margin per hectare with the smallest coefficient of variation compared to no-tillage conventional, manure-based, or crownvetch systems. Manure-based systems that do not require purchase or transport of the manure (as in combined animal and crop production systems) can be considerably more profitable than conventional systems. Both manure-based and cover crop systems that do not include the use of commercial fertilizers (i.e., organic systems), hold particular promise due to the output price premiums typically garnered by the organic crops grown under such conditions.

AB Animal feeding operations have come under increased scrutiny as sources of water pollution. Due to the concentration of animals at individual locations and in certain regions, the local environment may not be able to use all of the nutrients contained in the manure. Particularly, problematic are waters being impaired by nitrogen and phosphorus from animal manure. Since federal and state regulations have not been totally successful in precluding water contamination from manure nutrients, scientists and policymakers might seek ways to encourage the use of manure as a resource for crop production. By analyzing diverse state regulations, this paper identifies several strategies that would treat animal waste as a recyclable production input rather than a production byproduct. Citizens and regulators can encourage more sustainable livestock production by proffering regulations that mandate selected production requirements or practices. Agronomic rate regulations, limitations on manure application and timing, lagoon safety requirements, closure mandates, and alternative uses of manure constitute possibilities to remedy some pollution problems.

AB A major reason for the low adoption of modem varieties of seed among small-scale farmers in developing countries is the inability of formal, centralized seed production systems to meet their complex and diverse seed requirements. Drawing on experiences in Uganda with the common bean, the paper proposes seed production by fanner seed enterprises (FSEs) as a strategy for meeting dual objectives: to sustainably distribute and promote modem crop varieties and to establish a regular source of "clean" seed of either local or modem varieties. It reports on lessons learned from the Ugandan experience and offers a conceptual framework and guidelines for establishing economically and institutionally sustainable FSEs. While FSEs offer a potentially sustainable solution to the problem of seed supply, the challenge of implementing and scaling up this approach in eastern and southern Africa remains formidable. Collaborative linkages need to be fostered between farmers, researchers, agro-enterprise specialists, NGOs, and the formal seed industry. Seed policy reforms need to be implemented and more client-oriented research systems must be institutionalized.

AB Striga hermonthica remains one of the greatest biological threats to cereal production in the savannahs of sub-Saharan Africa. Control efforts at the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA). Nigeria, focus on developing integrated S. hermonthica management (ISM) options such as legume-cereal rotation, use of host-plant resistance. soil-based biological control exploiting enhancement of naturally occurring biotic soil suppressiveness. and use of acetolactate synthase (ALS)-inhibiting herbicides as host-crop seed treatments. We investigated, in pots, if soybean crops with or without fertilizer (N, P, or NPK) and preceding a maize crop used as a bioassay enhanced biotic soil suppressiveness to S. hermonthica. and if the ALS-inhibitor herbicides, imazaquin and nicosulfuron, used to control weeds in preceding crops constitute any risk to this biotic system. Factors tested included: (1) crop preceding bioassay maize (soybean [EMGOPA] versuss maize [8338-1]); (2) herbicide weed control in preceding crop (imazaquin in soybean and nicosulfuron in maize versus hand weeding); (3) fertilizer application to preceding crop (90 kg N ha(-1), 40 kg P ha(-1); 90 kg NPK: versus no fertilizer): (4) soil treatment before planting bioassay maize (pasteurized soil versus non-pasteurized soil). Effects of treatments on biotic suppressiveness were evaluated by comparing effects of treatments in non-pasteurized soil with those of the same treatments in pasteurized soil. Results indicated that biotic soil suppressiveness to S. hermonthica existed naturally in the soil used and was enhanced by a preceding soybean crop and application of N, P or NPK fertilizers. Weed control using ALS-inhibiting herbicides in the preceding crops, particularly imazaquin applied in soybean, had a negative effect on natural soil suppressiveness to S. hermonthica parasitism in maize. Results of this study further confirm the biotic nature of soil suppressiveness to S. hermonthica, and stress its important role in ISM. Land-based management strategies for S. hermonthica control. such as legume crops in rotation to enhance soil N and fertilizer application appear to directly enhance soil suppressiveness to S. hermonthica.
   Because ALS-inhibiting herbicides pose a risk to biotic soil suppressiveness, their use as a primary control measure for S. hermonthica control in Africa may not be a sustainable approach. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB New Zealand operated two soil quality-monitoring programmes between 1995 and 2001 to test methods and provide data about sustainable land use for state of the environment reporting. The objective of this paper is to report on the strengths and weaknesses in the programmes to assist others wishing to set up monitoring programmes. The New Zealand programmes required the voluntary participation of the 16 autonomous regional authorities that have the legal responsibility for environmental monitoring at a regional scale, the support from the Ministry for the Environment, which has responsibility for reporting at the national scale, and agreement between participants and science providers on design. funding. data interpretation and reporting. Emphasis was towards the chemical, biological and physical characteristics of the soil. rather than contamination or erosion. The initiative was partially successful in that 10 of the 16 regional authorities participated in the project: a sampling strategy and minimum dataset were defined; an interpretive framework for assessing soil quality was established based on land use and soil order categories, and soil quality assessed at over 500 sites. Recommendations to establish small-scale national soil quality monitoring schemes include having a small number of low-cost indicators, a strong interpretive framework, standardised methods and sampling, and centralised storage of data and samples.

AB Interpretation of national-scale surveys is needed to determine long term impacts of land use on soil quality. We report the findings of a survey of soil quality in New Zealand conducted 1995-2001. The survey covered 511 sites representative of 98% of New Zealand's land area. Land uses included: arable cropping and horticulture, mixed cropping. drystock pasture (sheep, beef or deer), dairy pasture, tussock grassland, plantation forestry. and indigenous forest, occurring on 12 soil orders. At each site, land-use and soil profile were described. and the topsoil (0-10 cm depth) analyzed for total C, total N, anaerobically mineralisable N, pH, Olsen P, bulk density and macroporosity. Pastoral land and indigenous forests had similar total C contents (56-67 mg cm(-3)). Mean N contents under pastures were 4.3-5.9 ma cm(-3), whereas all other land uses were <3.5 mg cm(-3). Olsen P was much greater under pastures and cropping (44-49 ma cm(-3)) than under plantation and indigenous forests (ca. 10 mg cm(-3)). Indigenous and plantation forest soils were the most acidic (mean pH 5.4), and cropping soils the most alkaline (mean pH 6.2). Indigenous forests had the lowest bulk density, (0.76 Mg m(-3)). and mixed cropping soils the highest (1.22 Mg m(-3)). Macroporosity was variable (9.3-25.6% (v/v)). Overall, 80% of the soil properties fell within target ranges identified as desirable to maintain soil quality for production and environmental objectives. There was widespread but moderate compaction under pastures and cropping. depletion of total C tinder cropping, and nutrient imbalance (usually excess P) under cropping and dairy pastures. The study identified soil. land use and management combinations of concern for loss of soil quality, and provided benchmark data against which to measure change. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

AB The effect of leaf-shredding on Venturia inaequalis, and Phyllonorycter blancardella and its parasitoids was studied under orchard conditions, respectively, during four and three overwintering periods. Naturally scab-infected leaves were collected in the fall. Five treatments were compared in 1995 and 1996, i.e. shredded leaves. urea (590), Microsphaeropsis ochracea, Athelia bombacina and untreated leaves (control). In 1997 and 1998, two more treatments were added. i.e. shredded leaves treated with 5% urea and shredded leaves treated with M. ochracea. The ascospore production from a sample corresponding to the average area of nine leaves was evaluated for each spore ejection period from late April to early July. All treatments applied in fall 1995 and 1996 significantly reduced ascospore production in 1996 and 1997, and there was no significant difference anion! treatments. The most efficient treatment was urea followed by leaf shredding. M. ochracea, and A. bombacina, with reduction in ascospore production of 92.1, 85.2, 84.8, and 80.6%, respectively. In 1998 and 1999. highest reduction in ascospore production was obtained for combined treatments, i.e. shredding and M. ochracea or shredding and urea with 93.9 and 90.5% reduction in ascospore production, respectively. Apple leaf-shredding in the fall of 1994. 1995 and 1996 significantly reduced emergence of both adult P. blancaldella and adult parasitoids associated with the leafminer. Leaf-shredding is a sanitation practice that should be systematically done as a long-term tactic as part of a sustainable integrated pest management program in apple orchards.

AB Alley-cropping has successively been overestimated and despised, due to unrealistic expectations of this 'more natural' type of agriculture and the disappointment thereafter, when the negative effects of trees on crops became evident over time. In this paper we examine the performance and underlying mechanisms of a Calliandra (Calliandra calothyrsus Meissn.)-maize (Zea mays L.) alley-cropping system on a phosphorus (P) limiting ferralsol in Western Kenya. The system performance analysis methods of [The 'dark side' of intercropping: manipulation of soil resources. In: Sinoquest, H., Cruz, P. (Eds.). Proceedings of the International Conference on Ecophysiology of Intercropping. INRA, Paris, France, pp. 45-66] and [Agric. Ecosyst. Environ. 80 (2000) 87] were used as well as mechanistic research into availability, uptake and balances of below ground resources. The Calliandra-maize system performed worse than sole maize (I = -66%, according to Ong's method) Calliandra affected the less limiting resource nitrogen (N) positively, but the negative effect of Calliandra on P-availability, the main limitation of the environment outweighed the positive or fertility effect, according to Kho's performance analysis method. However, after P application, when the main limiting resource for maize in our environment shifted to N, the Calliandra had still only a marginal positive effect on maize yields (insignificant 5% increase of alley-cropping compared to sole maize). this was explained by a negative total N balance in the soil of -30 kg ha(-1), and a negative inorganic N balance in the soil of -277 kg ha(-1) over the seven seasons. The difference between total and inorganic N balance was due to a mineralisation of only 20% of the N in all the Calliandra mulch applied over the seven seasons. Net negative nutrient balances also explain the general trend of decreasing yields of 40-90% over the seven seasons. We conclude that the combination of Ong's simpled method, Kho's resource-base explanation and further investigation of long-term supply and availability of the resources that are the main limitation(s) of an environment can give an understanding needed to create productive and sustainable alley-cropping systems.

AB Despite the pivotal role human factors (anthropogenic drivers) are presumed to play in global environmental change, substantial uncertainties and contradictory conclusions about them continue. We attempt to further discipline the human factors issue by estimating the effects of two anthropogenic drivers, population and affluence, on a wide variety of global environmental impacts, including greenhouse gas emissions, emissions of ozone depleting substances, and the ecological footprint. Population proportionately increases all types of impacts examined. Affluence typically increases impacts, but the specific effect depends on the type of impact. These findings refocus attention on population and material affluence as principal threats to sustainability and challenge predictions of an ameliorating effect of rising affluence on impacts.

AB Background: Multiple review systems have been established within medicine and psychology to evaluate and disseminate research findings to clinical practice. Purpose: Within this article, five evidence-based review systems are reviewed to inform the development or the use of an evidence review system for the behavioral medicine field. Methods: Each review system is described on several dimensions: history of the reviews system the review process, and details about translation/sustainability efforts. Results: Various factors from each system have been identified that would benefit a behavioral medicine evidence review system, such as a discussion of clinical features that influence the generalizability of review findings (i.e., the American Psychiatric Association) and the use of pre-review protocols (i.e., the Cochrane Collaboration). Conclusions: Although each review system has limitations, it is important for behavioral medicine to join one system because (a) systematic reviews are the only feasible means to evaluate and judge the usefulness of our interventions, and (b) reviews can inform policy, and, with effort, influence patient well-being. This group of behavioral medicine experts recommends that the Cochrane Collaboration review behavioral medicine interventions.

TI A study on temporal and regional process of knowledge spillover
SO ANNALS OF REGIONAL SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
ID CONVERGENCE
AB The temporal and regional process of knowledge spillover that has a distinct geographical performance is an important process proposed by the theory of new economic growth. Based on two case studies on the keywords of sustainable development and knowledge economy, it is found that it is improper for traditional theories to estimate the spillover intensity only by knowledge gaps. Three important findings have been discovered on the basis of the case studies. Firstly, not only is knowledge spillover related to knowledge gaps, but also the regional demands determined by geographical characteristics. Secondly, similar to many economic geographical phenomena, the space of spillover intensity is exponentially decreasing. Thirdly, knowledge driven by regional demands is active rather than the ramification of trading. Finally, a new model describing the spillover intensity between regions has been proposed in this paper.

AB The marine resources of the Antarctic region are of global significance. In managing Southern Ocean marine resources, especially fisheries, the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) has adopted principles that aim: to balance harvesting and conservation; to protect the needs of dependent species, and to avoid changes that are irreversible in 20-30 years. CCAMLR has pioneered ecosystem approaches to fishery and environmental management, through the incorporation of precaution and uncertainty into its management procedures and by establishing an ecosystem monitoring programme using indicator species and processes. This pioneering application of precautionary and ecosystem approaches in the management of harvesting has met with some success, notably in applying conservative yield models for toothfish and krill stocks and in establishing strict rules for undertaking new and exploratory fisheries. However, toothfish management has been recently compromised by Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated (IUU) fishing which is driven by forces outside the Southern Ocean. Southern Ocean harvestable resources are also subject to other global forces such as environmental changes, and their management systems remain very vulnerable to rapid shifts in worldwide fishery economics, and to inadequate management in adjacent areas, particularly high seas. CCAMLR needs quickly to develop the basis of more flexible and effective management to cater for rapid shifts in capacity and demand. The complementary task, however, is to raise the management standard of other Regional Fisheries Management Organisations (RFMOs) to those of CCAMLR if global high seas marine resources are to be sustainable for the rest of this century.

AB A mineralogical study of 3 samples of municipal solid waste incineration bottom ash collected from different storage sites and with storage times varying from 3 weeks to 2 years, has enabled identification of the main secondary mineral species formed during weathering. The frequencies of the secondary phases were determined and a diagram is proposed for the relative distribution of the newly formed mineral phases: calcite much greater than Fe oxides quartz greater than or equal to sulphates and/or et-tringite (depending on the amount of reactive A1 present in the bottom ash). This approach, involving careful sampling, sample preparation and the combined use of various analytical techniques, also showed the high frequency of A1 hydroxides and amorphous phases and helped to identify more than 30 sulphates s.l. (sulphates, chromates, vanadates, etc.). Most of the secondary minerals (carbonates and sulphates s.l.) have broad metal trapping capacities for heavy element uptake (Pb, Zn, Cd, As, V, Cr, etc.) due to their crystal-chemistry characteristics. Ca-oxalates were also identified. Mineralogical data from the study provide new input for thermochemical models. The relative stability of metal uptake and the extent of associated neogenesis occurring during bottom-ash decomposition is discussed. Sulphate minerals (and certain heavy metal oxides (zincite)), which are extremely sensitive to environmental conditions, can trap metals only temporarily, as opposed to Fe oxyhydroxides (As, etc.) and carbonates (Pb, Zn, Cd), which are more stable under atmospheric conditions and constitute more sustainable trapping media with higher liquid/solid (L/S) ratios. Finally, a composite predictive diagram is proposed for the mineralogical evolution of bottom ash that accounts for variations in US ratios. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The introduction and discussion of biosecurity in aquaculture occurred in 1997 in a World Aquaculture Society (WAS) Special Session titled, 'Sustainable Shrimp Farming: Emerging Technologies and Products for Biosecurity and Zero Discharge.' By 2003, proceedings of several workshops were published which offer very valuable information on the need, application and problems with biosecurity. These published proceedings are identified and discussed.
   While biosecurity is relatively new to aquaculture, other agricultural animal production systems, namely poultry, have fully developed and finely tuned biosecurity procedures in place. The adoption of biosecurity protocols in shrimp aquaculture has required significant changes in the shrimp stocks and adjustments in feeds and feeding, genetic traits for selection, and overall production procedures.
   Biosecurity in aquaculture is a maturing activity, still in need of improved information on diagnostics, disease transmission, clean up and eradication. Biosecurity, health, nutrition genetics and environmental quality must be integrated to achieve a uniform and low cost product on demand. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A co-culture system is described in which both red abalone (Haliotis rufescens) and a red seaweed, dulse (Palmaria mollis), are grown together in the same culture system. Dulse provides food for the abalone and improves water quality by removal of excreted ammonia. The system can be balanced by determining the effects of light intensity on dulse production and comparing these rates with dulse consumption by abalone of different sizes. In addition, uptake of ammonia by dulse under different light intensities can be balanced against excretion rates of abalone of different sizes. Dulse production rather than ammonia uptake is the limiting factor for rearing abalone in this system. An estimated 21-31 times more area is required for dulse production to meet abalone food requirements compared to that required for removal of excreted ammonia. Dulse production rates and light utilization efficiencies are high compared with those of other marine plants, such as kelp, and comparable to those of the most productive terrestrial crops. The availability of high, year-round light intensities is a key factor in determining the economic commercial value of such co-culture systems. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The story of Siglufjorour (Siglufjordur), a north Iceland village that became the "Herring Capital of the World," provides a case study of complex interactions between physical, biological, and social systems. Siglufjorour's natural capital-a good harbor and proximity to prime herring grounds-contributed to its development as a major fishing center during the first half of the 20th century. This herring fishery was initiated by Norwegians, but subsequently expanded by Icelanders to such an extent that the fishery, and Siglufjorour in particular, became engines helping to pull the whole Icelandic economy. During the golden years of this "herring adventure," Siglufjorour opened unprecedented economic and social opportunities. Unfortunately, the fishing boom reflected unsustainably high catch rates. In the years following World War II, overfishing by an international fleet eroded the once-huge herring stock. Then, in the mid-1960s, large-scale physical changes took place in the seas north of Iceland. These physical changes had ecological consequences that led to the loss-of the herring's main food supply. Severe environmental stress, combined with heavy fishing pressure, drove the herring stocks toward collapse. Siglufjorour found itself first marginalized, then shutout as the herring progressively vanished. During the decades following the 1968 collapse, this former boomtown has sought alternatives for sustainable development.

AB Climate warming and resource development could alter key Arctic ecosystem functions that support fish and wildlife resources harvested by local indigenous communities. A different set of global forces-government policies and tourism markets-increasingly directs local cash economies that communities use to support subsistence activities. Agent-based computational models (ABMs) contribute to an integrated assessment of community sustainability by simulating how people interact with each other and adapt to changing economic and environmental conditions. Relying on research and local knowledge to provide rules and parameters for individual and collective decision making, our ABM generates hypothetical social histories as adaptations to scenario-driven changes in environmental and economic conditions. The model generates projections for wage employment, cash income, subsistence harvests, and demographic change over four decades based on a set of user-defined scenarios for climate change, subsistence resources, development, and government spending. Model outcomes assess how scenarios associated with economic and climate change might affect the local economy, resource harvests, and the well-being of residents for the Western Arctic Canadian community of Old Crow, Yukon. The economic and demographic outcomes suggest implications for less quantifiable social and cultural changes. The model can serve as a discussion tool for a fuller exploration of community sustainability and adaptation issues.

ID CONSERVATION; COLLAPSE; ECONOMICS; DIVIDE
AB Historical relationships between people and a changing Arctic environment (which constitute a social-ecological system, or SES) can offer insights for management that promote both social and ecological resilience. The continued existence of healthy renewable resources around communities is particularly important, as subsistence and commercial use of local resources are often the only practical avenues to healthy, long-term security for those communities. Our research draws on the position that SESs exist in an environment that is explicitly temporal: frequently cyclic, changing, contextual, and contingent. Therefore, the causes and effect of disturbances to SESs are rarely temporally linear; instead, they are characterized by a complex array of hysteretic effects and alternate (possibly repeating) states. The term 'timescapes' describes the time-space context element and its fundamental importance to sustainable practices. We investigate social-ecological timescapes of the circumpolar North in relation to four primary provisioning practices (hunting/gathering, pastoralism, agriculture, and market-based economy). Broadly, we identify distinct social-ecological states, interspersed with periods of change. For specific communities that have maintained their existence through a series of periods of profound change, we propose that elements of social and ecological resilience have been neither incrementally lost nor gained through time; rather, they have waxed and waned in accordance with specific, and sometimes repeating, conditions. To maintain their existence, we believe, communities have had to maintain their ability to recognize gradual or rapid changes in social, ecological, or economic conditions and reorganize themselves to adapt to those changes, rather than to any specific outcomes of a change. That is, they have adapted to a dynamic environment, not a preferred state. However, centralized Western management, despite fundamental flaws in accounting for local linkages between culture, economics, and the environment, is increasingly circumscribing local practices. We believe that the significant challenge of maintaining equity and resilience of remote communities, within and outside the Arctic, will necessitate incorporating localized cultural values and decision-making processes that fostered prior community existence with (data from) Western interdisciplinary research.

AB Europe's energy supply is characterised today by structural weaknesses and geopolitical, social and environmental shortcomings, particularly as regards security of supply and climate change. Energy is a major determinant of economic growth and these deficiencies can have a direct impact on EU growth, stability and the well being of Europe's citizens. Energy supply security, mitigating climate change and economic competitiveness are therefore the main drivers for energy research, within the context of sustainable development.
   Hydrogen and electricity together represent one of the most promising ways to realise sustainable energy, whilst fuel cells provide the most efficient conversion device for converting hydrogen, and possibly other fuels, into electricity.
   Fuel cells are intrinsically clean and very efficient (up to double the efficiency of internal combustion engines (ICEs)) and capable of converting hydrogen and other fuels to electricity, heat and power.
   The European Union (EU) has acknowledged the potential of hydrogen and fuel cells for a long time, both implicitly in its policies and also in its research programmes. However, the past two years have seen an unprecedented number of significant new initiatives not only in the EU, but worldwide, designed to open efficient and clean pathways to a hydrogen oriented economy. Although this will be a long term process the planning needs to start immediately - developing coherent strategic research and policy decisions to face the enormous technical and non-technical barriers this objective implies. This is the mission of the new European Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Technology Platform launched in January 2004.

TI Degrees of influence and the problem of pre-emption
SO AUSTRALASIAN JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY
LA English
DT Article
ID CAUSATION
AB This paper is an investigation into the notion of degree of influence, and its application to the problem of pre-emption. In 'Causation as Influence', Lewis presented a new account of causation under determinism and some new observations on the problem of pre-emption. He claimed that, in cases of pre-emption, the pre-empting cause is much more of a cause than its preempted alternative; it has much more influence. I begin by trying to make sense of the notion of degree of influence. Then I emend Lewis's approach to pre-emption in response to objections, compare it to Kvart's Sustainably Reducible Influence account, and finally conclude that all these accounts fail to solve the problem of pre-emption.

AB Why are the dominating areas of agricultural food production not identical with the initial farming regions?
   The analysis of the soil water status as the main criterion for plant growth and crop rotation was essential since the early beginning of plant production. It resulted in expressions like arable land or wheat/sugar beet soil. When fertilisation became more commonly known and applied the subject soil water status was forgotten, also because it could not be regulated artificially in those days. Since, however, the mass and the power of the agricultural machinery increases because of economical reasons, this situation has changed completely. Meanwhile, the consequences of such development become more obvious. Thus, the following requests are to be pronounced: a) The tendency of additional mass increase of agricultural equipment must be judged sceptically, because of an enhanced soil deformation. Alterations in size and intensity of areas with stagnic soil properties and visual prevented plant growth must be controlled thoroughly. In those areas where such ponding water situations are available, all field treatments and machine applications have to be carried out with lighter machines. Furthermore, alternative cropping and tillage systems must be applied. If OD the other hand no signs of any stagnic water features or erosion processes can be detected, we can continue with the present cropping and agricultural machinery systems. b) Prevention to indicate especially the energy and total mass of the agricultural machineries as the major argument for further machine development strategies. Such monocausal argumentation endangers increasingly the sustainability of soil and land use systems. c) The definitions of maximum machine mass as well as soil bulk density values can be only regarded as a transient solution, because it would suggest a final value which because of the complexity can not be linked to a single value. Furthermore, we have to keep in mind that the protection and conservation of the water household problems is of main interests especially in those climatic regions with high plant productivity. d) Although there are enormous problems in plant production concerning mechanisation and farming strategies, with respect to prevent further soil structure degradation, aeration, and hydraulic properties, we assume that the most dominant areas for crop production will remain in those most sensitive regions. We derive this from the experience, that in general long-term knowledge is available in plant production and we also understand how to alter and/or to prevent such soil degradation. Such problems can and must be solved, because it finally decides about the future not only in grain production but also about the complete agricultural plant production.

AB Use of Set-aside Land According to the EU Regulation and Use of Biotope Sites according to the Federal German Nature Conservation Act for Protecting the Environment, Soils, Landscapes, Nature, Species and Biotopes
   The objectives and measures of the EU set-aside scheme and of the Federal Nature Conservation Act should be harmonized. The land to be set aside in each case is of relatively low production value, so that achieving an agreement should be quite easy.
   The "priority" conservation areas" of both schemes should be subdivided into a central area without any agricultural use and a second marginal area used as extensive grassland. Arable land should only be used "sustainably", i.e. with a production intensity which excludes most negative external effects. The conservation of valuable landscape elements is already regulated well by the Direct Payments Commitment Ordinance and the 2004-2007 framework plan of the Joint Task for the Improvement of Agricultural Structures and Coastal Protection (GAK) and the eligible support funds by the EU, yet it must be extended to include the "renaturation of cleared-out landscapes".
   This leads to yield losses and hence establishes a market balance and eases the pressure on the national economy in terms of market organisation costs and external costs. This creates some leeway for slightly increased farm prices so that consumers, producers and the environment could benefit. Set-aside land (marginal soils) which cannot be used profitably for the production of food and feed should be used for environmentally sound energy production, mainly biogas production from extensively farmed grassland.
   Concerning the requirements of environmental protection it has to be stated that no effective improvement of the environmental situation is achieved although some elements for the granting of environmental premia are projected. The set of indicators presented here is much more consistent in its effect.

   attenuation; reductive dechlorination; sustainability
AB The sustainability of biodegradation reactions is of interest at Type I chlorinated solvent sites where monitored natural attenuation is being considered as a remedial alternative. Type I chlorinated solvent sites are sites undergoing reductive dechlorination where anthropogenic substrates (such as landfill leachate or fermentable organics in the waste materials) ferment to produce hydrogen, a key electron donor. A framework is provided that classifies Type I chlorinated solvent sites based on the relative amounts and the depletion rates of the electron donors and the electron acceptors (i.e., chlorinated solvents). Expressions are presented for estimating the total electron donor demand due to the presence of solvents and competing electron acceptors such as dissolved oxygen, nitrate, and sulfate. Finally, a database of 13 chlorinated solvent sites was analyzed to estimate the median and maximum mass discharge rate for dissolved oxygen, nitrate. and sulfate flowing into chlorinated solvent plumes. These values were then used to calculate the amount of hydrogen equivalents and potential for lost perchloroethylene (PCE) biodegradation represented by the inflow of these competing electron acceptors. The median and maximum mass of PCE biodegradation lost due to competing electron acceptors, assuming 100% efficiency, was 226 and 4621 kg year(-1), respectively.

AB The collection of shells is a popular tourist activity in coastal areas of tropical countries. Tourists also buy shells, particularly large gastropods, which may be important species in marine ecosystems. While some, though outdated, information exists on the magnitude of the international trade with ornamental shells, virtually nothing is known about the extent of the regional tourist-related curio trade. A survey in Zanzibar, Tanzania, showed that 39% of the tourists had collected shells and 7% had bought shells, contributing US$ 136,000 to the local economy. The weight of shells exported from Zanzibar by tourists may have been in the order of 13 t. Regarding other marine species, tourists consume only 1% of the fish catches, but they have substantially increased the consumption of crustaceans and the trade in shark teeth and jaws.

AB Sea otters (Enhydra lutris (L.)) were hunted to extinction off the coast of Washington State early in the 20th century. A new population was established by translocations from Alaska in 1969 and 1970, and currently numbers at least 550 animals. A major threat to the population is the ongoing risk of major oil spills in sea otter habitat. We apply population models to census and demographic data in order to evaluate the status of the population. We fit several density dependent models to test for density dependence and determine plausible values for the carrying capacity (K) by comparing model goodness of fit to an exponential model. Model fits were compared using Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). A significant negative relationship was found between the population growth rate and population size (r(2) = 0.27, F = 5.57, df = 16, p < 0.05), suggesting density dependence in Washington state sea otters. Information Criterion statistics suggest that the Beverton-Holt model is the most parsimonious, followed closely by the logistic model. Values of K ranged from 612 to 759 with best-fit parameter estimates for the Beverton-Holt model including 0.26 for r and 612 for K. The latest ( 2001) population index count (555) puts the population at 87-92% of the estimated carrying capacity, above the suggested range for optimum sustainable population (OSP). Analyses of extinction risk associated with oil spills were based on assumptions of variable spill frequency, and variable mortality rates associated with spills once they occurred. At lower rates of assumed spill frequency, extinction risk was either negligible or was substantial only at the highest assumed mortality rates. At the highest assumed frequency rate (0.5 yr(-1)), extinction risks were high across the full range of assumed mortality rates. Elasticity analysis was conducted to examine the effects of proportional changes in vital rates on the population growth rate (&lambda;). The elasticity values indicate that the population is most sensitive to changes in survival rates (particularly adult survival).

AB The purpose of this case study was to optimise design, operation and maintenance guidelines, and to assess the water treatment potential of a storm water pond system after 15 months of operation. The system was based on a combined silt trap, attenuation pond and vegetated infiltration basin. This combination was used as the basis for construction of a roof water runoff system from a single domestic property. United Kingdom Building Research Establishment and Construction Industry Research and Information Association, and German Association for Water, Wastewater and Waste design guidelines were tested. These design guidelines failed because they did not consider local conditions. The infiltration function for the infiltration basin was logarithmic. Algal control techniques were successfully applied, and treatment of rainwater runoff from roofs was found to be largely unnecessary for recycling (e.g., watering plants). However, seasonal and diurnal variations of biochemical oxygen demand, dissolved oxygen and pH were recorded. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Tropical ecosystems support a diversity of species and ecological processes that are unparalleled anywhere else on Earth. Despite their tremendous social and scientific importance, tropical ecosystems are rapidly disappearing. To help tropical ecosystems and the human communities dependent upon them better face the challenges of the 21st century, tropical biologists must provide critical knowledge in three areas: (1) the structure and functioning of tropical ecosystems; (2) the nature and magnitude of anthropogenic effects on tropical ecosystems; and (3) the socio-economic drivers of these anthropogenic effects. To develop effective strategies for conservation, restoration, and sustainable management of tropical ecosystems, scientific perspectives must be integrated with social necessities. Three principles for guiding tropical biological research are suggested: (1) broadening the set of concerns; (2) integration of biological knowledge with the social sciences and traditional knowledge; and (3) linking science to policy and action. Four broad recommendations are proposed for immediate action in tropical biology and conservation that are fundamental to all biological and social disciplines in the tropics: (1) assemble and disseminate information on life's diversity in the tropics; (2) enhance tropical field stations and build a worldwide network to link them with tropical field biologists at their field sites; (3) bring the field of tropical biology to the tropics by strengthening institutions in tropical countries through novel partnerships between tropical and temperate zone institutions and scientists; and (4) create concrete mechanisms to increase interactions between tropical biologists, social scientists, and policy makers.

AB WILLIAM Pickles demonstrated that by collecting simple information from a practice over many years, it is possible to make important discoveries concerning the nature of health and illness in local communities. This work was helped by his long-term knowledge of patients and families, and by the natural bonds of goodwill and helpfulness that exist between local communities and their general practitioners (GPs). Three types of more recent family study are described: using simple population data to sample families for investigations of susceptibility to diet, the pathophysiology of disease, and perceptions and understandings of familial risk. Research of this nature is increasingly relevant as new genetic technologies are developed and applied, and require not only increased collaboration between GPs; epidemiologists; and clinical, laboratory, and social scientists, but also sustainable relationships with families and communities. General practice is the ideal setting for such research, with its hallmark features of continuity, mutuality, and trust.

AB This paper examines the use and accuracy of a moisture probe used in the walls of a straw-bale building. The performance of the moisture probe is assessed against laboratory-based measurements. The measurements from a number of moisture probes placed in the walls of a case study straw-bale building over a 2-year period are presented. The moisture content measurements from the building are discussed in the light of laboratory findings and the condition of the straw in the lower part of the most exposed wall. Potential influences upon the readings obtained from the moisture probes along with possible alternative assessment methods are discussed. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The paper deals with improvements on environmental significant activities related to the life supporting function "building and housing", using life cycle assessment (LCA). In the calculation, back-casting technique is utilised and implies to a future scenario, based on known technology. Besides heating, waste water treatment is a significant issue, according to the definition of building and housing function practised. The main conclusions from the assessment are that rebuilding is an environmentally better choice than the construction of a new building, if the same essential environmentally related functional performance is reached. Furthermore, the case study and the national estimates performed prove that the potential environmental impact can be reduced by about 70% for the heating service and 75% for the waste water system, if the suggested measures are performed.

AB The Southeastern Anatolia Project (GAP) is a human-centered regional development project targeting the full-fledged socio-economic development of Southeastern Anatolia. As a project adopting the principle of sustainable development, GAP covers investments in such areas as urban and rural infrastructure, transportation, industry, education, health, housing, tourism and other sectors in addition to dams, hydraulic power plants and irrigation schemes on the rivers Euphrates and Tigris. The project has the main challenge of substantially improving the quality of life of the people and closing the development of GAP existing between this particular region and the other regions of the country. Under this project, activities for the resettlement of the people affected by the dams who live like nomad communities are taking place. In addition, improving physical and socio-economic features of existing settlements are considered.
   In these studies, the sufficiency of socio-cultural, structural and functional planning features of rural residential buildings which were constructed for whose villages were under Batman and Tigris (Dicle) dam reservoir and who live like nomad communities in resettlement areas were investigated and tried to solve their problems by the General Directorate of Rural Affairs.

AB Climate change and fishing are both major determinants of the distribution and abundance of marine species. As the rates of climate change and exploitation accelerate, additive. and synergistic interactions between them are becoming increasingly important to the dynamics of marine ecosystems and the sustainability of marine fisheries. We examine the impacts of climate change and fishing pressure on the stocks of three commonly exploited intertidal invertebrates on Northeast Pacific rocky shores. California sea mussels (Mytilus calfiornianus) are not likely to experience dramatic population shifts in the face of climate change, and the current low levels of exploitation appear to be sustainable. Owl limpets (Lottia gigantea), which grow more slowly, exhibit higher temperature sensitivity, and are preferred targets of fishers, will likely experience considerable reductions in distribution and abundance if temperatures rise and exploitation continues. Black abalone (Haliotis cracherodii) have already experienced dramatic declines directly attributable to over-exploitation and indirectly to warming trends that have exacerbated the effects of a devastating disease. Two generalities emerge from these comparisons. First, differences in life history characteristics result in a wide range of climatic and anthropogenic effects among species. Second, the effects of fishing pressure may unexpectedly magnify the effects of climate change, and vice versa. Synergistic interactions between environmental change and exploitation on rocky shores and in other marine ecosystems present considerable challenges for fisheries managers. The key to successful management and restoration in marine systems lies in developing a mechanistic understanding of the interactions between climate change and fishing pressure and how they affect population and ecosystem dynamics.

AB Globalisation is about the interconnection of peoples and places in accelerated ways, but it is also about resistance and adaptation in the face of change. Discussions of sustainability now incorporate both dynamic understandings of culture and the recognition that place matters because the practices that are in need of sustaining, as well as those that pose threats, happen in particular communities and in specific geographic contexts. Culture is codified not only in property rights and legislation, but also in the public artistic expressions of peoples and places. Case studies from Nunavut and Scotland show the interrelationships of sovereignty and claims to identity and community. Art, as a result of creative action in the case of Cape Dorset Inuit printmakers and carvers on Baffin Island, and a millennium tapestry telling the stories of the Isle of Harris, complement matters of property rights. Both discussions show that identity is about material culture and property relations in respect of land. Serious discussions of sustainability, in contrast to the technical practices frequently invoked using the term sustainable development, require considerations of the dynamics of complex culturalarrangements in particular places, rather than assumptions of stability of either peoples or their ecological contexts.

AB The 'green' revolution that is a part of moves towards sustainable development, will use high pressure technology as one of its tools. The main impetus for this conversion is twofold; the concern to reduce the usage of solvents and energy, and the value of high pressure as a tool to design and produce products with completely new characteristics. High pressure processes are already operated on the industrial scale but new research has shown the potential for many new processes resulting from the use of high pressure technologies, as well as deriving new fundamental data. There are many opportunities for the development of high-pressure machinery. In this paper a short overview of the present status and further expected developments in research of high pressure technology is presented.

AB The last two decades have seen a fundamental change in the way chemistry handles environmental issues. A shift in focus has occurred from 'end-of-pipe' to prevention and process integration. Presently an even more fundamental change is brought about by the need for sustainable development. It is becoming the incentive for much of the research and development in chemistry and engineering. Visions and approaches on the role of chemistry and the way chemistry is done, change. New knowledge is constantly needed. But the existing knowledge should not be discarded. It must be used in new ways. It asks for new thinking and novel methods for research and engineering. Chemical engineering education will have to take up this challenge too.

AB The development of high performance and innovative processes is crucial for a sustainable industrial growth. Membrane science and technology is expected to play an increasingly important role in the future for various industrial sectors. Membrane operations, with their intrinsic characteristics of efficiency and operational simplicity, high-selectivity and permeability for the transport of specific components, compatibility between different membrane operations in integrated systems, represent an interesting answer for the rationalization of a large variety of industrial productions. Moreover, beside the traditional separation processes, membrane operations find new applications in emergent fields like catalytic membrane reactors and membrane bioartificial organs.

AB In this paper we present a framework describing the developments in polymer reaction engineering (PRE), based on discussions held within the EFCE Working Party on PRE. In the past, PRE has been strongly based on engineering sciences. A changing focus, however, has induced a current integrated multidisciplinary approach that is strongly driven by sustainability. In the near future, we expect a change from 'technology-based PRE' towards 'product-inspired PRE'.

AB Soil aquifer treatment (SAT) of wastewater relies on extensive biogeochemical processes in the soil and aquifer to achieve large-scale and economic reclamation of municipal effluents. Removal of trace metals from the wastewater is a prime objective in the operation, but the long-term sustainability of the adsorptive filtration capacity of the soils is an open question. Solid/solution partitioning (measured by the distribution coefficient, K-d) and solid/solid partitioning (measured by selective sequential dissolution, SSD) of heavy metals were measured in soils sampled from active recharge basins in a wastewater reclamation plant and were compared to the adjacent pristine dune. K-d values for the adsorption of Cu, Ni and Zn, measured in short-term adsorption experiments positively and significantly correlated with solution pH. Quantitative estimation of Cu, Ni and Zn adsorption on multi-sorbents indicated that surface adsorption and precipitation on Fe oxides and/or carbonate may be the major mechanisms of metal retention in these soils. SSD analyses of metal partitioning in soils exposed to similar to20yr of effluent recharge showed that all solid-phase components, including the most stable 'residual' component, competed for and retained added Cu and Zn. Copper preferentially partitioned into the oxide component (32.0% of the soil-accumulated metal) while Zn preferentially partitioned into the carbonate component (51.6% of the soil-accumulated metal).

TI GROWTH OF NEW ECONOMIC SECTORS IN SECOND-TIER EXTENDED CITIES IN THE
   CHANGJIANG RIVER DELTA-Case of Suzhou, Wuxi, Changzhou

DE second-tier extended cities; new economic sectors; diversity supply
   horizontal division
AB The second-tier extended metropolises in the Changjiang (Yangtze) River Delta, including Suzhou, Wuxi and Changzhou near Shanghai, are becoming the most active and new innovative industrial agglomerating areas. Manufacturing industries in these second-tier cities have been in rapid growth due to increasing foreign investment. Nevertheless, the economic prospect of these cities is still constrained by a lack of local R&D capacity and production services, which are mainly dependent upon Shanghai. This paper analyses the impact of globalization on the new economic sectors in these cities, the change of industrial structure, the limitation of urban development and the problem of sustainability. Then, the paper analyses the conditions for the high-tech industry and production services in these areas. Also, it applies the industrial organization theory to these cities and examines how these cities can cooperate with each other in terms of horizontal linkages. Finally, the paper gives the future growth prospects in high-tech industry and production services.

DE sustainable farmland consolidation; financing mode
AB Sustainable farmland consolidation covers ecology, economy and society, which means, its only goal is to protect eco-environment, in accordance with public benefits and economic laws. China is still a developing country, facing capital-lacking, an important but difficult problem, while sustainable farmland consolidation will need more money than common farmland consolidation. To solve the problem, this paper put forward and designed a new financing mode for farmland consolidation: BOT (Build-Operate-Transfer), which can effectively solve the financing problem and investment reclamation by the way of concession, and make sustainable farmland consolidation be realized in China.

DE ecocity; urban farms; sustainability
AB The paper discusses the validity of the "urban versus rural" dichotomy in scientific literature, statistics and urban planning practice, especially in empirical studies developed around the issue of vegetable and animal farming inside and around cities. Santiago's rural-urban interface is presented as a case study. Sample results extracted in early 2003 have shown that farming mixed with other land uses is even now a reality in Southern Santiago, supported in solidarity alliances and a characteristic life philosophy, giving researchers the possibility of exploring a living ecocity laboratory.

AB The human perturbation of the carbon cycle via the release of fossil CO2 and land use change is now well documented and agreed to be the principal cause of climate change. We address three fundamental research areas that require major development if we were to provide policy relevant knowledge for managing the carbon-climate system over the next few decades. The three research areas are: (i) carbon observations and multiple constraint data assimilation; (ii) vulnerability of the carbon-climate system; and (iii) carbon sequestration and sustainable development.

AB Carbon sequestration in soil organic matter of degraded Sahelian agro-ecosystems could play a significant role in the global carbon (C) uptake through terrestrial sinks while, simultaneously, contributing to sustainable agriculture and desertification control. The paper documents the results of a two-year pilot project in Senegal assessing real project opportunities with main emphasis on the West-Central Agricultural Region ("Old Peanut Basin"). Current total system C content in this region, calculated on the basis of in situ soil and biomass carbon measurements, amounted to 28 t ha(-1) with 11 t C ha(-1) in soils (0-20 cm) and 6.3 t C ha(-1) in trees. Potential changes in soil C, simulated with CENTURY for a 25-year period, ranged from -0.13 t C ha(-1) yr(-1) under poor management to +0.43 t C ha(-1) yr(-1) under optimum agricultural intensification. Simulated changes in crop yields varied from -62% to +200% under worst and best management scenarios respectively. Best management practices that generate the highest sequestration rates are economically not feasible for the majority of local smallholders, unless considerable financial support is provided. Especially when applied on a larger scale, such packages risk to undermine local, opportunistic management regimes and, in the long run, also the beneficiaries' capacity to successfully adapt to their constantly changing environment.

AB Often it is argued that the EU depoliticizes political issues as bureaucrats and nonmajoritarian institutions are key in the policy-making process. However, recent research rejects this perspective and shows that domestic political cleavages organize the European political space. This article demonstrates that (a) political cleavages affect the organization of policy networks among Euro-level bureaucrats, politicians, and societal interests; and (b) that the institutional organization of government facilitates the emergence of advocacy coalitions mobilizing these political cleavages. The empirical analysis demonstrates that the European political space is dominated by a cleavage between a progrowth coalition and a sustainability coalition. Furthermore, it shows that political officials occupy a pivotal position enabling them to mediate between these two coalitions. Finally, data on the actors' resource reputations suggest that in granting access, public officials attach considerable value to the public support coalitions enjoy.

AB Understanding of dynamics of N derived from organic N sources in soil is required for the development of sustainable agricultural systems. The aim of this paper is to compare, using pot experiments, the fate of N from urea (UF) and organic N sources such as rice straw compost (RC) and cattle compost (CC) using N-15 labeled materials in paddy soil planted with rice. Two soils with a history of long-term applications of chemical fertilizers (LTCN) and organic N sources, i.e. straw compost +soybean cake, (LTON), were also compared. Nitrous oxide emissions were monitored during the growing period. Yield and N uptake of rice were higher in LTON soil than LTCN soil with no significant interaction with N applications. Chemical fertilizer increased yield and N uptake with a recovery rate by rice of 36 to 45%. Nitrogen recovery from RC and CC by rice was less than 10%. When recovery of N in soil was included with that recovered in the plant, 70% and 61% of applied N in the UF treatment was recovered from the LTCN and LTON soils, respectively. In comparison, more than 95% of applied N was recovered in the plant and soil for the RC and CC treatments. There was a sharp increase in N2O emission during the aerated period in nonplanted pots regardless of whether supplemental N was added, and this was associated with the increase in NO3- in soil solution at 0.5 cm depth. There was a much lower N2O emission in planted pots than nonplanted pots with no significant difference among the LTCN and LTON soils or the N treatments. The results indicated that the application of organic N source provided lower N supply to the plant than urea, but also could reduce N loss because of higher retention in the soil. Long-term continuous application of organic N sources enlarged the labile N pool without increasing N2O emission. Nitrous oxide emission was important during the mid-season aerated period from pot experiments and was partly related to the concentration of NO3- and the rate of nitrification.

AB Sustainable land management can be achieved through the implementation of agricultural practices that are informed by in-depth knowledge of the processes occurring in farms and the larger landscape of which they are part. A prototype interactive spatial decision support system (SDSS) has been developed to assist land use scientists, agricultural extension support personnel and farmers to classify and characterise land quality, assess sustainable land management and identify potential land use solutions at the farm recommendation unit and resource management domain levels in Kenya. The system implements a generic land quality assessment framework that integrates farmer-led participatory sustainability assessment with specialist input into a multi-disciplinary perspective. The system was conceived in support of methodological studies to identify, evaluate and interpret indicators of land quality. It provides a platform for formulating indicators to describe biophysical, socio-cultural and economic processes in agro-ecosystems. It integrates modular assessment, database management sub-systems and geographical information system (GIS). It has been structured to include a project environment, land quality data acquisition control, assessment and output engine and land quality spatial analysis. The output includes visual land quality diagrams and interactive land quality and land attribute quality maps. In its present structure, it is robust and specific enough to encapsulate the major land quality assessment indicators, yet broad enough to allow flexibility for application in different parts of Kenya.

AB The purpose of the underlying research for this paper was to obtain a better understanding of the eco-efficiency improvements of a crop protection product from the perspective of the crop protection industry in the context of sustainable agricultural development.
   The environmental impacts of an innovated and a traditional fungicide treatment were explored by applying two different product-oriented environmental life cycle analysis methods. One method (product life cycle-oriented energy balance) assessed the use of resources during the whole product life cycle, whereas the other method focused on the potential damage of the active ingredients for the environment and for humans.
   The functional unit and basis for comparison was defined as 'treating 1 ha of citrus crop for foot- and root rot and trunk cankers' during one crop season.
   Treatment with the innovated product resulted in relatively higher impacts per tonnage within the crop protection industry itself. However, outside the crop protection industry relatively fewer resources are needed and there are fewer potential releases into the environment. The innovated product fulfills its function more eco-efficiently or more sustainable than the traditional product. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Aims We tested the hypothesis that enhanced care for diabetes, tailored to the needs of the South Asian community with Type 2 diabetes, would improve risk factors for diabetic vascular complications and ultimately reduce morbidity and mortality.
   Patients and methods The study was a cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT) with general practice the unit of randomization. Six West Midlands general practices with a high proportion of South Asian patients were randomized to 'enhanced care' using Asian link workers and extra community diabetes specialist nurse sessions (intervention) or continued standard practice care (control).
   Results Of 401 patients recruited to the study, 361 (90%), comprising 178 from Coventry and 183 from Birmingham were eligible and included in the analyses. The mean age at baseline (standard deviation, SD) was 58.9 (11.7 years) with median (interquartile range; IQR) duration of diabetes 6.5 (3-11) years. At one year follow-up there was a significant difference in reduction of systolic (4.6 mmHg, P=0.035) and diastolic blood pressure (3.4 mmHg, P=0.003) and total cholesterol (0.4 mmol/l, P=0.005), comparing the intervention and control groups. After adjusting for baseline measurement and age, only differential reduction in diastolic blood pressure remained significant. There was no significant change in HbA(1c) and no difference between the groups.
   Conclusions Using link workers and extra community diabetes specialist nurse input together with treatment protocols in primary care might prove a useful strategy in working towards NSF targets for diabetes management. In this study, small reductions in blood pressure and cholesterol were achieved. Improvement in glycaemic control may require longer and possibly different strategies. Further research is required to evaluate fully the effectiveness, including the costs and longer term sustainability of culturally sensitive initiatives.

TI The health sector gap in the southern Africa crisis in 2002/2003

   humanitarian response; vulnerability

AB The southern Africa crisis represents the first widespread emergency in a region with a mature HIV/AIDS epidemic. It provides a steep learning curve for the international humanitarian system in understanding and responding to the complex interactions between the epidemic and the causes and the effects of this crisis. It also provoked much debate about the severity and causes of this emergency, and the appropriateness of the response by the humanitarian community.
   The authors argue that the over-emphasis on food aid delivery occurred at the expense of other public health interventions, particularly preventative and curative health services. Health service needs were not sufficiently addressed despite the early recognition that ill-health related to HIV/AIDS was a major vulnerability factor. This neglect occurred because analytical frameworks were too narrowly focused on food security, and large-scale support to health service delivery was seen as a long-term developmental issue that could not easily be dealt with by short-term humanitarian action. Furthermore, there were insufficient countrywide data on acute malnutrition, mortality rates and performance of the public health system to make better-balanced evidence-based decisions.
   In this crisis, humanitarian organisations providing health services could not assume their traditional roles of short-term assistance in a limited geographical area until the governing authorities resume their responsibilities. However, relegating health service delivery as a long-term developmental issue is not acceptable. Improved multisectoral analytical frameworks that include a multidisciplinary team are needed to ensure all aspects of public health are dealt with in similar future emergencies. Humanitarian organisations must advocate for improved delivery and access to health services in this region. They can target limited geographical areas with high mortality and acute malnutrition rates to deliver their services. Finally, to address the underlying problem of the health sector gap, a long-term strategy to ensure improved and sustainable health sector performance can only be accomplished with truly adequate resources. This will require renewed efforts on part of governments, donors and the international community.
   Public health interventions, complementing those addressing food insecurity, were and are still needed to reduce the impact of the crisis, and to allow people to reestablish their livelihoods. These will increase the population's resilience to prevent or mitigate future disasters.

AB Ecological restoration of riparian zones that have been degraded by decades of overgrazing by livestock is of paramount importance for the improvement of water quality and fish and wildlife habitats in the western United States. An increasingly common approach to the restoration of habitats of endangered salmon in the Columbia Basin of the Pacific Northwest (USA) is to exclude livestock from streamside communities. Yet, few studies have examined how ending livestock grazing changes ecosystem properties and belowground processes in herbaceous-dominated riparian plant communities (meadows). Along the Middle Fork John Day River, Oregon, we compared ecosystem properties of dry (grass and forb-dominated) and wet (sedge-dominated) meadow communities at three sites that had been managed for sustainable livestock production with three sites where livestock had been excluded for 9-18 years as a means of riparian and stream restoration. Profound differences in the belowground properties of grazed and exclosed communities were measured. In dry meadows, total belowground biomass (TBGB consisting of roots and rhizomes) was similar to50% greater in exclosures (1105 and 1652 g/m(2) in the grazed and exclosed sites, respectively). In exclosed wet meadows, the TBGB was 62% greater than in the grazed sites (1761 and 2857 g/m(2), respectively). Soil bulk density was significantly lower, and soil pore space was higher in exclosed sites of both meadow types. The mean infiltration rate in exclosed dry meadows was similar to 13-fold greater than in grazed dry meadows (142 vs. 11 cm/h), and in wet meadows the mean infiltration rate in exclosures was 233% greater than in grazed sites (24 vs. 80 cm/h). In exclosed wet meadows, the rate of net potential nitrification was 149-fold greater (0.747 vs. 0.005 mug NO3-N-[g soil](-l).d(-1)), and the rate of net potential mineralization was 32-fold greater (0.886 vs. 0.027 mug N.[g soil](-l).d(-1), respectively) when compared to grazed sites, though changes observed in dry meadows were not significant. Livestock removal was found to be an effective approach to ecological restoration, resulting in significant changes in soil, hydrological, and vegetation properties that, at landscape scales, would likely have great effects on stream channel structure, water quality, and the aquatic biota.

   PROPOSAL
AB Pressures on the environment resulting from corporate activities cause impacts that will occur over different time scale into the future and also have been occurring for different amounts of time in the past. The development of fair and equitable corporate sustainability reporting (CSR) initiatives requires that these temporal aspects be properly taken into account. In order to relate indicators of environmental pressure to indicators of environmental state changes. time scales specific to that pressure should be used. We review the different ways in which temporal aspects have been dealt with in CSR and other schemes and show that there is often no consistent and rigorous treatment of time. We discuss several obstacles that may have impeded the appropriate treatment of time in CSR so far and suggest that these issues must be resolved as CSR becomes more widely adopted.

AB The perception that better information on environment and development is the determinant of effective rational decision- and policy-making processes provide the impetus for global interest in the use of sustainable development indicators (SDIs). Accordingly, proposals for SDIs are framed either on organisational goals or on disciplinary and multidisciplinary theories-aiming to reduce uncertainties in choosing the best alternative among a set of options concerning sustainability. Despite the fact that many SDI initiatives are explicitly aimed at improving policy-making, it is not apparent that political settings and organisational realities are taken into consideration in designing the framework for sustainability assessment. Ignoring the realities of policy-making dynamics can result in poor institutionalisation of the SDI development process, and therefore reduced impact of indicators. Linkage of SDIs to policy processes must also take into account the complex role of information in policy processes. The importance of societal values, cultural contexts and behaviour of bureaucracies must be understood and used to assist the assessment of progress towards sustainability using SDIs. Essentially, objective knowledge must be tampered with pragmatism in governance. This paper highlights the case of SDI development in the state of Selangor where the notion of instrumental rationality is balanced with the 'incrementalism' of the policy process that provided the foundation for institutionalising the reporting and use of SDIs. The ideals and paradoxes of participatory decision-making, the principles of the rational model and decision-making processes within a state government are critically examined. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

AB A dynamic systems modeling technique has been developed to assess technologies according to the criterion of sustainability. In a case study, the potential contribution of bio-ethanol toward achieving Canada's commitment to the Kyoto targets for greenhouse gas reductions is analyzed. The analysis concludes that, although bio-ethanol may help reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the technology by itself is insufficient to meet the Kyoto target. Applying the systems modeling approach to analyze sustainability helps highlight those policy issues that warrant more in-depth study. Although the systems model may not provide definitive answers, it raises relevant questions about physical constraints that might be encountered and estimates the extent to which sustainability targets may be met under various scenarios.

TI Heterogeneity in ethnoecological knowledge and management of medicinal
   plants in the Himalayas of Nepal: Implications for conservation
SO ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY

ID TRADITIONAL ECOLOGICAL KNOWLEDGE; RESOURCE; MAYA
AB The importance accorded to ethnoecological knowledge for suggesting new paths in scientific research, understanding ecological processes, and designing sustainable management of natural resources has grown in recent years. However, variation in knowledge and practices, both within and across cultures, has not been given much attention in resource management nor in developing scientific understanding of the ecological status of key resources. In this paper, we discuss the heterogeneity and complexity of local ecological knowledge in relation to its practical and institutional context with respect to management of Himalayan medicinal plants. We show factors affecting this variation, and discuss how knowledge is put into action. We assessed variation in knowledge relating to the diversity of medicinal plant species, their distribution, medicinal uses, biological traits, ecology, and management within and between two culturally different social groups living in villages located in the Shey-Phoksundo National Park and its buffer zone in northwestern Nepal. Heterogeneity in levels of knowledge and in practices both within and between these groups corresponds to differences in level of specialization in relation to medicinal plants, to socio-cultural and institutional contexts, and to extra-local factors that govern people's activities. We argue that understanding the heterogeneity of knowledge and practices within a given area is crucial to design management practices that build on the intricate links between knowledge, practices, and institutional context. It is also important to develop ecological studies that will best inform management.

AB The sustainable management of biodiversity and productivity in forested lands requires an understanding of key interactions between socioeconomic and biophysical factors and their response to environmental change. Appropriate baseline data are rarely available. As part of a broader study on biodiversity and profitability, we examined the impact of different cropping methods on biodiversity (plant species richness) along a subjectively determined land-use intensity gradient in southern Sumatra, ranging from primary and secondary forest to coffee-farming systems (simple, complex, with and without shade crops) and smallholder coffee plantings, at increasing levels of intensity. We used 24 (40 x 5 m) plots to record site physical data, including soil nutrients and soil texture together with vegetation structure, all vascular plant species, and plant functional types (PFTs-readily observable, adaptive, morphological features). Biodiversity was lowest under simple, intensive, non-shaded farming systems and increased progressively through shaded and more complex agroforests to late secondary and closed-canopy forests. The most efficient single indicators of biodiversity and soil nutrient status were PFT richness and a derived measure of plant functional complexity. Vegetation structure, tree dry weight, and duration of the land-use type, to a lesser degree, were also highly correlated with biodiversity. Together with a vegetation, or V index, the close correspondence between these variables and soil nutrients suggests they are potentially useful indicators of coffee production and profitability across different farming systems. These findings provide a unique quantitative basis for a subsequent study of the nexus between biodiversity and profitability.

TI Combining science and traditional ecological knowledge: Monitoring
   Populations for co-management
SO ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY

AB Using a combination of traditional ecological knowledge and science to monitor populations can greatly assist co-management for sustainable customary wildlife harvests by indigenous peoples. Case studies from Canada and New Zealand emphasize that, although traditional monitoring methods may often be imprecise and qualitative, they are nevertheless valuable because they are based on observations over long time periods, incorporate large sample sizes, are inexpensive, invite the participation of harvesters as researchers, and sometimes incorporate subtle multivariate cross checks for environmental change. A few simple rules suggested by traditional knowledge may produce good management outcomes consistent with fuzzy logic thinking. Science can sometimes offer better tests of potential causes of population change by research on larger spatial scales, precise quantification, and evaluation of population change where no harvest occurs. However, science is expensive and may not always be trusted or welcomed by customary users of wildlife. Short scientific studies in which traditional monitoring methods are calibrated against population abundance could make it possible to mesh traditional ecological knowledge with scientific inferences of prey population dynamics. This paper analyzes the traditional monitoring techniques of catch per unit effort and body condition. Combining scientific and traditional monitoring methods can not only build partnership and community consensus, but also, and more importantly, allow indigenous wildlife users to critically evaluate scientific predictions on their own terms and test sustainability using their own forms of adaptive management.

ID RESILIENCE; KNOWLEDGE
AB We analyze the emergence of an adaptive co-management system for wetland landscape governance in southern Sweden, a process where unconnected management by several actors in the landscape was mobilized, renewed, and reconfigured into ecosystem management within about a decade. Our analysis highlights the social mechanisms behind the transformation toward ecosystem management. The self-organizing process was triggered by perceived threats among members of various local stewardship associations and local government to the area's cultural and ecological values. These threats challenged the development of ecosystem services in the area. We show how one individual, a key leader, played an instrumental role in directing change and transforming governance. The transformation involved three phases: 1) preparing the system for change, 2) seizing a window of opportunity, and 3) building social-ecological resilience of the new desired state. This local policy entrepreneur initiated trust-building dialogue, mobilized social networks with actors across scales, and started processes for coordinating people, information flows and ongoing activities, and for compiling and generating knowledge, understanding, and management practices of ecosystem dynamics. Understanding, collaborative learning, and creating public awareness were part of the process. A comprehensive framework was developed with a shared vision and goals that presented conservation as development, turned problems into possibilities, and contributed to a shift in perception among key actors regarding the values of the wetland landscape. A window of opportunity at the political level opened, which made it possible to transform the governance system toward a trajectory of ecosystem management. The transformation involved establishing a new municipal organization, the Ecomuseum Kristianstads Vattenrike (EKV). This flexible organization serves as a bridge between local actors and governmental bodies and is essential to the adaptive governance of the wetland landscape. It is also critical in navigating the larger sociopolitical and economic environment for resilience of the new social-ecological system. We conclude that social transformation is essential to move from a less desired trajectory to one where the capacity to manage ecosystems sustainably for human well-being is strengthened. Adaptability among actors is needed to reinforce and sustain the desired social-ecological state and make it resilient to future change and unpredictable events.

AB We investigated and compared management practices for dealing with uncertainty in agroecosystem dynamics in two cases of smallholder farming in different parts of the world: northeast Tanzania and east-central Sweden. Qualitative research methods were applied to map farmers' practices related to agroecosystem management. The practices are clustered according to a framework of ecosystem services relevant for agricultural production and discussed using a theoretical model of ecosystem dynamics. Almost half of the identified practices were found to be similar in both cases, with similar approaches for adjusting to and dealing with local variability and disturbance. Practices that embraced the ecological roles of wild as well as domesticated flora and fauna and the use of qualitative biological indicators are identified as tools that built insurance capital for change and enhanced the capacity to respond to changing agroecosystem dynamics. Diversification in time and space, as well as more specific practices for mitigating pest outbreaks and temporary droughts, can limit the effects of disturbance. In both Sweden and Tanzania, we identified social mechanisms for the protection of species that served important functions in the agroecosystem. We also found examples of how old practices served as a source of adaptations for dealing with new conditions and that new knowledge was adjusted to local conditions. The study shows that comparing management practices across scales and in different cultural settings can reveal insights into the capacity of farmers to adjust, respond to, and shape ecosystem dynamics. We emphasize the importance of continuous learning for developing the sustainable management of complex agroecosystems and securing agricultural production for the future.

AB Emerging insights from adaptive and community-based resource management suggest that building resilience into both human and ecological systems is an effective way to cope with environmental change characterized by future surprises or unknowable risks. We argue that these emerging insights have implications for policies and strategies for responding to climate change. We review perspectives on collective action for natural resource management to inform understanding of climate response capacity. We demonstrate the importance of social learning, specifically in relation to the acceptance of strategies that build social and ecological resilience. Societies and communities dependent on natural resources need to enhance their capacity to adapt to the impacts of future climate change, particularly when such impacts could lie outside their experienced coping range. This argument is illustrated by an example of present-day collective action for community-based coastal management in Trinidad and Tobago. The case demonstrates that community-based management enhances adaptive capacity in two ways: by building networks that are important for coping with extreme events and by retaining the resilience of the underpinning resources and ecological systems.

AB The concept of resilience has evolved considerably since Holling's (1973) seminal paper. Different interpretations of what is meant by resilience, however, cause confusion. Resilience of a system needs to be considered in terms of the attributes that govern the system's dynamics. Three related attributes of social-ecological systems (SESs) determine their future trajectories: resilience, adaptability, and transformability. Resilience (the capacity of a system to absorb disturbance and reorganize while undergoing change so as to still retain essentially the same function, structure, identity, and feedbacks) has four components-latitude, resistance, precariousness, and panarchy-most readily portrayed using the metaphor of a stability landscape. Adaptability is the capacity of actors in the system to influence resilience (in a SES, essentially to manage it). There are four general ways in which this can be done, corresponding to the four aspects of resilience. Transformability is the capacity to create a fundamentally new system when ecological, economic, or social structures make the existing system untenable.
   The implications of this interpretation of SES dynamics for sustainability science include changing the focus from seeking optimal states and the determinants of maximum sustainable yield (the MSY paradigm), to resilience analysis, adaptive resource management, and adaptive governance.

AB Increasing interest in regime shifts in ecological and linked social-ecological systems (SESs) has placed a strong focus on the thresholds of change. However, research into this topic has been hampered by a lack of empirical data. This paper describes a developing database established to address this need. The database is freely available and comprises a set of summarized published examples and a searchable bibliographic database of publications on the topic. Thresholds in the database are characterized in terms of a standardized set of 24 descriptors, including the variables along which they occur, the variables that change, and the factors that have driven the change. Readers are encouraged to contribute new examples. Examples range from conceptual models to empirical evidence. The former predominate in the literature and, although they make valuable contributions and will continue to be included, the intention is build up the number of examples based on data. Examples are presented in terms of whether the threshold occurs in the ecological system, the social system, or both, and the direction of interactions between systems. The paper concludes with some initial observations on thresholds based on the examples included so far, and poses some questions for future research. Research on a typology of thresholds is a priority topic in the emerging area of "sustainability science" and it requires a rich database of empirical data.

AB An ethnobotanical survey was carried out to collect information on the use of medicinal plants by the Lisu people who live in the mountainous areas of the Nujiang Canyon (Salween River Valley) in Nujiang Prefecture, northwestern Yunnan Province, China. A total of 52 medicinal plants, belonging to 32 families, were reported as being used locally for the treatment of human ailments. The scientific and Lisu names, parts used, and preparation of the plants are presented. Most of these species are wild (80%), while others are domesticated (8%) or semi-cultivated (12%). Among the 52 species, 11 species (21.2%) were reported as rare and 16 were widely commercialized in the region. Over-exploitation and deforestation are the main causes for the depletion of medicinal plants in this area. The Lisu people still mostly depend on medicinal plants for their health care. The loss and endangered status of these plants will, to a certain extent, impede their existing health care system; conservation and sustainable harvest of medicinal plants in the area are urgently needed.

AB An ethnobotanical survey of practicing dyers in the biodiversity rich ecosystems of Sierra Leone and of the literature was conducted on the common plant species used to produce natural dyes. In addition, the methods used to obtain these dyes and to dye fabric, together with the techniques used to produce various patterns on fabric were investigated. Although the thriving dye industry is now predominantly serviced by synthetic dyes, the knowledge of the plants used still survives among some dyers, who use plant dyes to some extent. However this indigenous knowledge is rapidly being lost as increasingly less of it is being passed on to succeeding generations. Several plants used in the dyeing process are documented, together with their taxonomic characteristics; local names; how the dyes are produced and fabric dyed; the colors obtained; in addition to how various patterns are designed. Sustainable utilization of this important renewable natural resource is discussed.

TI Estimating an equilibrium exchange rate for the dollar and other key

SO ECONOMIC MODELLING

DT Article
DE fundamental equilibrium exchange rate; multicountry modelling
ID TARGET ZONES
AB In this paper, we adapt the concept of fundamental equilibrium exchange rates 'FEER' in a complete model approach. We use it to determine the likely paths of the Dollar and other key currencies. The FEER is the (real) exchange rate that is consistent with internal balance and sustainable external balances. Here we examine the composition of a Dollar adjustment and hence the extent to which a FEER (for the US) depends on factors or rigidities elsewhere in the world, as well as at home. We find, the US still needs to accept an adjustment in her real exchange rate if the increase in her foreign liabilities is to come to an end. However, counterpart adjustments also have to be made in Canada, Mexico, and some Asian economies if this policy is to be successful. We also show that productivity growth differentials may act as a substitute for depreciation, and this provides an explanation for the failure of the dollar to depreciate in the 1990s.

DT Article
DE credit risk; sustainable debt; Euro
AB Sustainable debt has become the key issue in rating of private as well as sovereign debtors. The problem of how to estimate sustainable debt has also been at the center of the debate over the Asian 1997-1998 financial crisis. If the external value of the currency depends on the external debt of a country, it is necessary to estimate the creditworthiness of the country. This paper studies credit risk and sustainable debt in the context of a dynamic model. For a dynamic growth model with an additional equation for the evolution of debt, we demonstrate of how to compute sustainable debt and creditworthiness. The model is estimated by employing time series data for the core countries of the Euro-area. The computations show that the Euro-area has large external assets. Using time series methods, the sustainability of external debt (assets) is estimated for those core countries of the Euro-area. Those estimations show that the Euro will be a stable currency in the long-run. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB How will climate change affect the sustainability of Arctic villages over the next 40 years? This question motivated a collaboration of 23 researchers and four Arctic communities (Old Crow, Yukon Territory, Canada; Aklavik, Northwest Territories, Canada; Fort McPherson, Northwest Territories, Canada; and Arctic Village, Alaska, USA) in or near the range of the Porcupine Caribou Herd. We drew on existing research and local knowledge to examine potential effects of climate change, petroleum development, tourism, and government spending cutbacks on the sustainability of four Arctic villages. We used data across eight disciplines to develop an Arctic Community Synthesis Model and a Web-based, interactive Possible Futures Model. Results suggested that climate warming will increase vegetation biomass within the herd's summer range. However, despite forage increasing, the herd was projected as likely to decline with a warming climate because of increased insect harassment in the summer and potentially greater winter snow depths. There was a strong negative correlation between hypothetical, development-induced displacement of cows and calves from utilized calving grounds and calf survival during June. The results suggested that climate warming coupled with petroleum development would cause a decline in caribou harvest by local communities. Because the Synthesis Model inherits uncertainties associated with each component model, sensitivity analysis is required. Scientists and stakeholders agreed that (1) although simulation models are incomplete abstractions of the real world, they helped bring scientific and community knowledge together, and (2) relationships established across disciplines and between scientists and communities were a valuable outcome of the study.

AB Shenzhen City in China is developing rapidly now. Correspondingly, deterioration of the outdoor environment in phenomena such as heat island has become a serious problem. This aggravation of the thermal environment has spoiled urban sustainability. In this paper, (1) in order to predict the outdoors thermal environment in summer in an apartment block, unsteady coupled simulation of convection, radiation, and conduction is developed and used. The velocity, temperature, humidity, and MRT in the urban area are obtained from the simulation. In order to estimate the pedestrian level of thermal comfort in the outdoor thermal environment, the spatial distributions of New Standard Effective Temperature (SET*) is calculated using the above results. (2) The actual situation of the outdoors thermal environment in summer in an apartment block in Shenzhen City is investigated by field measurements. (3) The effect of schemes to improve the outdoor thermal environment in this apartment block, such as changing building shapes, planting arrangements, etc. are examined using this prediction method.

AB In order to ensure China, a populous country, to develop in a sustainable way, it is an urgent task to disseminate the concept of sustainability and put it into practice for urban construction. However, it is impossible for China to simply copy the experiences of developed countries, since China has the higher population and building density and less availability of reusable energy per square meter floor area. Therefore, it is necessary to develop the sustainable building technologies applicable to various climate regions, economic conditions, and residential customs in China, as well as sustainable to the most occupants and owners. Based on an introduction of the current situation of the development of construction industry and the energy consumption of buildings in China, this paper analyses the requirements, characteristics, standards for sustainable housing and urban construction, and recommends series of technical approaches along with different phases of sustainable design and construction, which strengthen a good cooperation among researchers, designers and constructors of different majors including architecture, planning, building physics, building services, and so on. Moreover, some issues, which need further research and especially handling, are pointed out along with the recommendations. Finally, policy issue related with the sustainable development of urban construction in China is discussed. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The author's aim is to construct and validate empirically a theoretical model that allows performance and competitiveness in firms located in industrial districts to be explained. From the strategic perspective adopted, economic revenues are explained by three types of advantage: shared advantages, competitive advantages, and comparative advantages. Neither integration in the district, nor its attraction due to the shared competences within it, are significant predictors of performance. Empirical results indicate that organisational performance is largely explained by the joint effect of firm distinctive competences and cluster-shared competences. It was also found that the greater the degree of a firm's embeddedness in an industrial district, the greater the effect of its distinctive competences on organisational performance. This evidence suggests that firms which are better endowed with resources and capabilities find the development of sustainable competitive advantages easier when they locate in industrial clusters, as they are more capable of capitalising on the potential for economic rents that these clusters offer. Therefore, the internal heterogeneity of the cluster stems from the different patterns of appropriation of shared competences. In addition, firm embeddedness in an industrial district is also revealed as a moderating variable in the relationship between shared competences and global performance/average return on assets, explained by the positive effects of the participation in models, values, and knowledge flows circulating within the cluster.

TI Sustainable future urban mobility: using 'area development negotiations'
   for scenario assessment and participatory strategic planning
SO ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING A-ECONOMY AND SPACE
LA English
DT Article
ID UTILITY; VALIDATION; LESSONS
AB An examination of how land-use planning can proceed while emphasising sustainability in transport objectives is presented in the authors' view. It is vital that citizen preferences are assessed, and the 'area development negotiation' method for obtaining such preferences is detailed within a case study framework. The method permits evaluations by various stakeholder groups of future urban mobility scenarios by means of multiattribute utility analyses. In order to illustrate the method, key results from a Swedish case study are presented, demonstrating that all interest groups-with the exception of business representatives-were aware of the importance of environmental factors and gave these factors greater weight than economic factors. Discussion focuses upon issues relevant to policy analysis, strategic planning including stakeholders, and upon issues relevant to the policy process, such as how the method can support and meaningfully engage the citizen in strategic planning.

SP UNDP
AB At the Rio Earth Summit of 1992 governments undertook to develop and adopt national sustainable development strategies as a key component of implementing the goals of Agenda 21. Only partial progress was reported at the 2002 World Summit in Johannesburg, with uncertainty as to the effectiveness of those strategies that had been introduced. This paper describes a methodology for assessing a country's progress in implementing a national sustainable development strategy (NSDS) and for identifying potential areas for improvement. Five key principles of sustainable development and strategic planning are identified, and a set of assessment criteria are proposed for testing their implementation. The results of applying the methodology in two Eastern European countries, Belarus and Slovakia, are reported. These case studies suggest that the proposed NSDS assessment methodology has considerable potential for strengthening sustainability planning at the national level. The effectiveness of the NSDS assessment methodology in strengthening national processes for sustainable development and strategic planning will also require greater transparency and accountability in governance practices. This suggests that progress in improving the quality of NSDS processes is likely to be conditional on broader considerations of institution building and governance reform.

AB Since the 1970s, it has been acknowledged that environmental education has an essential role to play in fostering environmental interrelations to promote sustainable societies, however, the theoretical and practical debates within environmental education are ongoing. There is an argument that divergent understandings of the environment need to be interpreted if interventions that are participatory and accommodate participants' environmental frameworks are to be planned. Research was carried out to verify whether the theory of social representations could assist environmental educators in interpreting participants' lifestyles and perceived needs. Accordingly, data were collected on environmental social representations within a group of 10 urban women from Manaus, Amazonas, Brazil. The objective was to understand the impact of such representations on the women's environmental awareness and assess the applicability of such data to planning environmental education interventions. The women's social representations were interpreted as being directed by five mediators, namely cultural heritage identity, the media, religion and situation, which influenced their environmental practices and understandings. The interpretation process also illustrated contradictions in identities and situations that impacted on the women's environmental awareness. Interpretation of social representations offers valuable information about participants' conceptual frameworks and indicators of themes appropriate to planning educational interventions.

AB Global trade in marine ornamental species includes numerous countries; however, 80% of the trade involves exports from the Philippines and Indonesia to the USA. The worldwide import value of marine ornamentals is estimated at USS 200-330 million annually. Recent concern regarding sustainability and environmental impacts on coral reefs where collection occurs has spurred debate as to how best to monitor, manage and regulate the industry. A certification programme proposed by the Marine Aquarium Council (MAC) has the potential to manage the trade efficiently by minimizing environmental impacts, thus continuing this important source of income for impoverished coastal villagers. The MAC Ecosystem and Fishery Management (EFM) Standard was established to protect fish stocks from overexploitation and will be the most difficult component of the certification programme to implement. Prerequisites for successful EFM in developing nations are local control over fisheries and accurate records to monitor catch. Collector logs were found to be a useful tool to monitor both catch per unit effort (CPUE) and catch composition from collection areas in the Philippines. Comparison of catch composition in two distinct regions of the Philippines indicated that one site was severely overfished while the other was moderately overfished. The Collection Area Management Plan required by the MAC certification programme, combined with the current legal framework in the Philippines allowing for local jurisdiction of reef resources, has the potential to prevent further overfishing in the latter region. Until sufficient ecological data can be obtained, CPUE can provide an effective means to monitor and manage the fishery within the framework of the MAC certification programme. Despite effective management plans in source nations, legislation in receiving nations may be required to help stimulate a strong market demand for certified ornamentals if the MAC certification programme is to be successful.

AB The area between Endada and Bhimunipatnam, an urban expansion of the Visakhapatnam Metrocomplex Region, Andhra Pradesh, India, is mainly underlain by the Eastern Ghats of Precambrian age. Geomorphologic units delineated are denudational, colluvial, fluvial and coastal plains. Geoenvironmental appraisal has been made with respect to the geomorphologic units. Geoenvironmental hazards include soil and rock characteristics, drainage conditions, structural features, slope stability, gully erosion, beach erosion, sea spray, depth to water table and groundwater quality, which impart considerable restraints on the urbanization of the area. Effective land use management measures are suggested to avoid the adverse impacts on the area for sustainable development.

TI Groundwater mining of bedrock aquifers in the Denver Basin - past,
   present, and future
SO ENVIRONMENTAL GEOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
DE aquifers; mining groundwater; artesian aquifers; Denver; Colorado; USA
AB The Denver Basin bedrock aquifer system is an important source of water for municipal and agricultural uses in the Denver and Colorado Springs metropolitan areas. The Denver area is one of the fastest growing areas in the United States with a population of 1.2 million in 1960 that has increased to over 2.4 million by 2000. This rapid population growth has produced a corresponding increase in demand for potable water. Historically, the Denver area has relied on surface water, however, in the past 10 years new housing and recreation developments have begun to rely on groundwater from the bedrock aquifers as the surface water is fully appropriated and in short supply. The Denver Basin bedrock aquifer system consists of Tertiary and Cretaceous age sedimentary rocks known as the Dawson, Denver, Arapahoe and Laramie-Fox Hills Aquifers. The number of bedrock wells has increased from 12,000 in 1985 to 33,700 in 2001 and the withdrawal of groundwater has caused water level declines of 76 m. Water level declines for the past 10 years have ranged from 3 to 12 m per year. The groundwater supplies were once thought to last 100 years but there is concern that the groundwater supplies may be essentially depleted in 10 to 15 years in areas on the west side of the basin. Extensive development of the aquifer system has occurred in the last 25 years especially near the center of the basin in Douglas and El Paso Counties where rapid urban growth continues and surface water is lacking. Groundwater is being mined from the aquifer system because the discharge by wells exceeds the rate of recharge. Concern is mounting that increased groundwater withdrawal will cause water level declines, increased costs to withdraw groundwater, reduced well yield, and reduced groundwater storage. As the long-term sustainability of the groundwater resource is in doubt, water managers believe that the life of the Denver Basin aquifers can be extended with artificial recharge, water reuse, restrictions on lawn watering, well permit restrictions and conservation measures.

AB Community-based coastal resource management has been widely applied within the Philippines. However, small-scale community-based reserves are often inefficient owing to management inadequacies arising because of a lack of local support or enforcement or poor design. Because there are many potential pitfalls during the establishment of even small community-based reserves, it is important for coastal managers, communities, and facilitating institutions to have access to a summary of the key factors for success. Reviewing relevant literature, we present a framework of "lessons learned" during the establishment of protected areas, mainly in the Philippines. The framework contains summary guidance on the importance of ( 1) an island location, ( 2) small community population size, ( 3) minimal effect of land-based development, ( 4) application of a bottom-up approach, ( 5) an external facilitating institution, ( 6) acquisition of title, ( 7) use of a scientific information database, ( 8) stakeholder involvement, ( 9) the establishment of legislation, ( 10) community empowerment, ( 11) alternative livelihood schemes, ( 12) surveillance, ( 13) tangible management results, ( 14) continued involvement of external groups after reserve establishment, and ( 15) small-scale project expansion.
   These framework components guided the establishment of a community-based protected area at Danjugan Island, Negros Occidental, Philippines. This case study showed that the framework was a useful guide that led to establishing and implementing a community- based marine reserve. Evaluation of the reserve using standard criteria developed for the Philippines shows that the Danjugan Island protected area can be considered successful and sustainable. At Danjugan Island, all of the lessons synthesized in the framework were important and should be considered elsewhere, even for relatively small projects. As shown in previous projects in the Philippines, local involvement and stewardship of the protected area appeared particularly important for its successful implementation. The involvement of external organizations also seemed to have a key role in the success of the Danjugan Island project by guiding local decision-makers in the sociobiological principles of establishing protected areas. However, the relative importance of each component of the framework will vary between coastal management initiatives both within the Philippines and across the wider Asian region.

ID MANAGEMENT
AB Lake Karla, Greece, was almost completely drained in 1962 both to protect surrounding farmlands from flooding and to increase agricultural area. Loss of wetland functions and values resulted in environmental, social, and economic problems. A number of restoration plans were proposed to address these problems. The plan approved by the government in the early 1990s proposed construction of a 4200-ha reservoir solely to improve water storage and flood attenuation functions. However, the Ramsar Scientific and Technical Review Panel states that the primary goal of any restoration project is to create resilient and sustainable ecosystems, as measured on a human timescale, in order to improve the ecological character and enhance the socioeconomic role that the wetland plays in the watershed. This study utilizes Ramsar guidelines for sustainable restoration of Lake Karla. Eight additional restoration measures are proposed based on functional analysis of the wetland to enhance additional wetland functions and support multiple values for humans and nature.

AB Droughts have been occurring persistently in southern African dryland regions for over a century. The impacts of droughts on people, their domesticated animals, wildlife, rangelands and cropped lands have been shown to be astronomical. If left alone the rangelands often recover after the calamity, however human occupation has led to irreversible damage. Even though some communities have evolved viable and sustainable coping mechanisms, recent times have seen weakened coping strategies leading to loss of life in most of the 10 countries in southern Africa. While land degradation has many inter-related causes and effects, drought-related effects have proven most difficult to manage and/or overcome. Drought-related land degradation or desertification poses a huge threat to sustainable land and resource management in the region. The paper examines appropriate drought mitigating initiatives, linking them to land tenure and land management practices. Numerous interventions targeted at reducing poverty and improvement in resource management have failed to achieve desired effects due to rigidity and imposition, and failure of the external interveners to recognise and incorporate indigenous peoples' preferences and coping strategies. Non-governmental organisations and authorities' willingness to institute drought and desertification combating measures are reviewed, highlighting the role that community action plays in reducing adverse effects in the region. Linkages to trade patterns that perpetuate poverty and unwise use of resources are discussed. Adopting 'people centred' mitigating measures is emphasised. Success rests with both the people in the 'south' and those in the 'north'. What is required is an informed global action.

AB The Thar Desert of western India is known for its rich and ancient culture system and traditions. The communities have long been part of the Thar Desert ecosystem and have evolved specific strategies to live in harmony with its hostile environment. This culture has provided several miracle plants of immense food and medicinal value to modem civilisation. The ancient rural livelihood knowledge system reflects time-tested techno-scientific knowledge with a proven track record of sustainability, especially during natural hazards like drought and famines. In addition, several of the traditional skills of local communities in arts and crafts, music and instruments have made modem man aware of the art and techniques of sustainably utilising local biological resources and preserving their biodiversity along with using waste products of the forests, without harming the desert ecosystem. Traditional cultural and socio-religious values are fast dwindling under the impact of materialistic approach, industrialisation and development. This paper endeavours to illustrate the need to assist and propagate indigenous rural livelihood systems rather than mindlessly replace or abandon them as a result of state bureaucracies.

AB Community knowledge exchanges have played a key role in developmental processes in the Suid Bokkeveld community of South Africa. Two exchange visits were undertaken with the support of the Department of Agriculture and an NGO, the Environmental Monitoring Group, which have led to local economic development and enhanced capacity to manage natural resources in a sustainable manner. These pilot projects were undertaken within the framework of the Community Exchange and Training Programme of the Global Mechanism of the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD). The methodology applied included facilitation to develop a community-based vision for development, in terms of which the community exchange process was designed. A Facilitation Team of service providers conducted preparatory workshops, and identified potential partner communities. Two exchange visits were carried out, one focused on Rooibos production and marketing, and the other on community-based eco-tourism. Following report-back and planning workshops, emerging community-driven initiatives were supported through their formative stages. The initiatives have not only resulted in enhanced livelihoods, but the methodology has also been applied widely in a number of different contexts.

AB The Spitzkoppe Community Campsite in western Namibia lies in an area with very limited water resources. Water scarcity places a constraint on community income generation and development opportunities. The existing water resources are overexploited and to ensure future water security, the community must take sustainable water management into consideration in their daily lives and business ventures, including tourism. This has been successfully achieved at the Spitzkoppe Community Campsite through a combination of high community motivation, organisation and action, the involvement of researchers and trainers in water resource management and support from developers. The most appropriate water management solutions were found through ongoing practical testing of different strategies and technologies over two years. This paper presents a case study of a community-based tourist camp at Spitzkoppe and traces the community's progress towards developing an alternative way to combat desertification and a potentially lucrative tourist business.

ID RANGE RESEARCH
AB The Great Basin Desert lies between the Sierra Nevada Mountains to the west and the Rocky Mountains to the east. Nearly 60% of the area's deserts and mountains (roughly 30 million ha) are managed by the U. S. Department of Interior's Bureau of Land Management. This area is characterized by low annual precipitation, diverse desert plant communities, and local economies that depend on the products (livestock grazing, recreation, mining, etc.) produced by these lands. The ecological and economic stability of the Great Basin is increasingly at risk due to the expansion of fire-prone invasive species and increase in wildfires. To stem this loss of productivity and diversity in the Great Basin, the BLM initiated the "Great Basin Restoration Initiative" in 1999 after nearly 0.7 million ha of the Great Basin burned in wildfires. The objective of the Great Basin Restoration Initiative is to restore plant community diversity and structure by improving resiliency to disturbance and resistance to invasive species over the long-term. To accomplish this objective, a strategic plan has been developed that emphasizes local participation and reliance on appropriate science to ensure that restoration is accomplished in an economical and ecologically appropriate manner. If restoration in the Great Basin is not successful, desertification and the associated loss of economic stability and ecological integrity will continue to threaten the sustainability of natural resources and people in the Great Basin.

AB This paper presents the results of the organic matter characterization of sludge from two ponds (retention and infiltration) located in France. Special focus was placed on studying hydrocarbons and PAHs. This investigation is part of a global project on road and urban sludge with the aim of identifying a better means for managing these materials.
   Gas chromatographic and GC/MS analyses indicate that the main component of the organic fraction stems from petroleum-derived products like diesel fuel and motor oil. This finding was confirmed by the presence of biomarkers from the hopane series, as well as by pyrolytic and alkylated PAHs. Results from this study clearly show that the contaminants are mainly generated from anthropogenic petroleum sources. Due to their levels of hydrocarbon contamination, these sludge deposits must be considered as waste and cannot therefore be disposed anywhere, especially within the current context of sustainable development.

AB Western industrialized societies are inberently unsustainable in their present form because they depend almost exclusively on a finite supply of nonrenewable minerals and fossil fuels. In addition, the resulting wastes cause various environmental problems ranging from widespread ecosystem disruptions to global warming. The most common response to these problems has been to promote technological improvements in eco-efficiency, which Welford defined as "adding maximum value with minimum resource use and minimum pollution." Although constructive, improvements in eco-efficiency alone will not guarantee sustainability of industrialized societies because the limited supplies of nonrenewable minerals cannot be extended indefinitely by recycling and substitution, and a transition to renewable and nuclear energy sources would result in significant negative environmental impacts, particularly if deployed on a large scale. In addition, according to the second law of thermodynamics, industrial production technologies have inherently unavoidable environmental impacts. Finally, any hard-won improvements in eco-efficiency will soon be negated if growth in population and consumption is allowed to continue. Consequently, long-term industrial sustainability can be achieved only through a transition to a steady-state economy where the total throughput of matter-energy is kept at a constant and sustainable level. This requires not only improvements in eco-efficiency but also a reassessment of fundamental societal values that erroneously equate material consumption and economic growth with well-being and happiness.

DE sustainable development; corporate sustainability programs
AB With increasing pressure to act and report on sustainability strategies, an overwhelming number of principles, tools, results indicators, and reporting formats have emerged to measure and communicate a corporation's approach. Corporations make use of various initiatives and programs to demonstrate their commitment to sustainable development. Yet participation in these initiatives and programs does not mean that a company is in fact becoming more sustainable or that it is recognizing real business value as a result.
   Providing a review of some of the prevailing sustainability programs, approaches, and decision-support tools, this paper fits the value of participating in particular initiatives into a more comprehensive view of sustainability. The paper provides a conceptual framework for a company to leverage its participation in existing sustainability initiatives to (1) assess its baseline sustainability performance and form the basis for improving its overall sustainability performance, and (2) reassess, align, and integrate its sustainability objectives and actions with its business objectives and actions.

TI The status of life-cycle assessment as an environmental management tool
SO ENVIRONMENTAL PROGRESS
LA English
DT Article
AB As environmental awareness increases, industries and businesses have responded by providing 'greener" products and using ''greener" processes. Many companies have found it advantageous to explore ways of moving beyond compliance, using pollution prevention strategies and environmental management systems, to improve their environmental performance. One such way is life-cycle assessment (LCA). This concept considers the entire life cycle of a product, process, or an activity. Evaluating environmental impacts holistically from raw material acquisition, through manufacture, use, and disposal using a life-cycle perspective is gradually being viewed by environmental managers and decision makers as an important element in achieving environmental sustainability. The use of a holistic, life cycle approach can help industry and government avoid the unintended trading of one environmental problem for another. this paper addresses ongoing research in LCA methodology in the US EPA's National Risk Management Research Laboratory. Two key areas of this research include life-cycle inventory (LCI) data availability and life-cycle impact assessment (LCIA) modeling.
   To address the issue of data availability, EPA developed a website entitled LCAccess. Although LCAccess does not itself contain data, it is a searchable global directory to potential data sources. LCAccess also serves as a central source for LCA information. In addition, EPA developed TRACI (the Tool for the Reduction and Assessment of Chemical and other environmental Impacts), which allows the characterization of ozone depletion, global warming, acidification, eutrophication, tropospheric ozone (smog) formation, ecotoxicity, buman Particulate effects, human health, fossil fuel depletion, and land use effects. TRACI can be used with life-cycle inventory to further analyze and understand the data. (C) 2004 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Environ Prog.

ID WORKSHOP
AB Metric identification has received growing attention as more alternatives become available,for quantifying the sustainability-oriented performance of a target human activity. Failure to tackle the diversity in these alternatives has given rise to significant difficulties in comparing and interpreting the assessment results obtained from using various metrics. This paper explores some bottlenecks in identifing "appropriate" environmental sustainability metrics that specifically meet the needs of a sustainability assessor. A new conceptual hierarchy "stressor-status-effect-integralio-well-being" (SSEIW) for metric classification is proposed. This hierarchy categorizes the full range of metrics into five levels, each of which measures the interested environment manner. This paper shows that the proposed hierarchy can be applied within the framework of life-cycle assessment (LCA), which provides a promising solution to "best-practice" metric identification as well as expanding the LCA applications to the sustainability field.

TI Hierarchical thermodynamic metrics for evaluating the environmental
   sustainability of industrial processes
SO ENVIRONMENTAL PROGRESS
LA English
DT Article
ID EXERGY; FRAMEWORK
AB Industrial progress toward sustainability requires meaningful practical, and scientifically sound metrics. Most existing metrics rely on information about material and energy inputs and emissions from the main process and selected processes in its life cycle. Such metrics often result in multiple conflicting variables, making it difficult to use them for decision making. Furthermore, sustainability metrics need to be scientifically rigorous and capable of evaluating the broader economy and ecosystem scale impacts of selected processes and products. This paper proposes a framework for evaluating the environmental sustainability of industrial processes that satisfies these needs. This framework uses energy analysis to combine different types of material and energy streams in a thermodynamically sound manner. Energy analysis is also combined with end-point life-cycle impact assessment methods for evaluating the impact of emissions. This results in metrics for a selected system with different levels of aggregation ranging from multiple to single dimensions. The challenge of analyzing a process at life cycle and coarser spatial scales is met by combining energy analysis, life cycle assessment, input-output analysis, and both economic and ecological aspects. The result is a doubly nested hierarchy, which analyzes processes at multiple spatial scales of process, life cycle, economy, and ecosystem. Each scale contains another hierarchy based on the degree of aggregation of the metrics. A case study of the ammonia process illustrates the characteristics of the proposed approach.

AB Renewable energy sources are currently receiving much attention, both as a means of reducing the dependency of the United States on imported oil and as a long-term substitute for fossil fuels. An important part of any renewable energy strategy is to find suitable transportation fuels to substitute,for gasoline and diesel oil. Fuels derived from biomass can potentially meet this need; however, traditional routes to biomass fuels are inefficient, leading to low energy yields per acre and questionable sustainability.
   In this paper, we present a systemwide analysis of biomass fuels and their production infrastructure. By analyzing the relative efficiency of different farming, harvesting, and processing approaches, fuel compositions, and engine technologies, we can identify technologies that substantially improve the overall energy efficiency and sustainability of biomass fuels. The analysis helps identify areas where additional research would yield the greatest benefits and set cost targets that must be achieved for biomassfuels to become competitive with conventional energy sources.

DE polylactide; polypropylene; inventory analysis; greenhouse gas emissions
AB SRI Consulting's Process Economics Program (PEP) was commissioned by its clients to undertake a lifecycle assessment (LCA) for the purpose of comparing a biodegradable polymer with a conventional commodity polymer in packaging applications. Biodegradable polymers offer the potential of addressing a wide range of environmental concerns associated with conventional polymers such as greenhouse gas emissions and sustainability. LCA is a tool specifically developed for assessing the overall environmental burden of a product including the system used for manufacturing it and its end-of-life treatment.
   This paper provides a cradle-to-grave LCA of two polymers that may be used in food packaging applications: polylactide (PLA), which is a biodegradable polymer derived from corn; and polypropylene (PP), which is primarily derived from natural gas in the United States. An inventory analysis of the PLA and PP systems is presented. An impact assessment focused on global warming is also provided. Although measured field or facility data are preferred for a rigorous LCA, PEP data can provide a reasonable basis when measured data are unavailable. Energy inventories and greenhouse gas emissions are readily derived from PEP data, but other potentially relevant impact indicators are not. (C) 2004 American Institute of Chemical Engineers.

AB Pulp and paper manufacturing constitutes one of the largest industry segments in the United States in term of water and energy usage and total discharges to the environment. More than many other industries, however, this industry plays an important role in sustainable development because its chief raw material-wood fiber-is renewable. This industry provides an example of how a resource can be managed to provide a sustained supply to meet society's current and future needs. The objective of this work is to present streamlined environmental life-cycle assessments (LCA) between chemical (kraft-sulfate), mechanical (or thermomechanical), and biopulping processes. This LCA would help us to evaluate the industry's current experience and practices in terms of environmental stewardship, regulatory and nonregulatory forces, life cycles of its processes and products, and future developments. The pulping industry has been traditionally using mechanical or chemical pulping methods, or a combination of the two, to produce pulps of desired characteristics. Mechanical pulping accounts for about 25% of the wood pulp production in the world today. Mechanical pulping, with its high yield, is viewed as a way to extend the forest resources. However, mechanical pulping is electrical energy-intensive and yields paper with less strength compared to that produced by the chemical pulping process. These disadvantages limit the use of mechanical pulps in many grades of paper. Chemical pulping accounts for about 75% of the wood pulp production in the world. This process produces paper with very high strength. However, the process has the disadvantages of being capital- and energy-intensive, giving relatively low yields, producing troublesome waste products, and producing by-products that are of relatively low values.

TI Cycles of history in plateau sociopolitical organization: Reflections on
   the nature of indigenous band societies
SO ETHNOHISTORY
LA English
DT Article
ID NONUNILINEAR DESCENT; REVITALIZATION
AB The nature of indigenous band societies is examined through an analysis of the historical dynamics of sociopolitical organization among the Secwepemc of the northern Plateau. Secwepemc history is characterized by recurrent tensions between the autonomy of extended family groups and the solidarity of the band collective. Unlike earlier static, and trait-based models of Plateau culture, this processual and historically grounded model of sociopolitical organization can account for cultural diversity among Plateau groups, can recognize patterned processes of cultural continuity and change through history, and may be applicable to other North American indigenous band societies. By implication, viable and sustainable forms of Aboriginal self-government in Canada must incorporate innovative structures allowing expression of these enduring commitments to different levels of social belonging.

AB Mechanized harvesting procedures for typical forest vehicles were analysed to examine soil stresses and displacements occurring in soil profiles and to reveal changes in physical properties of forest soils. All field experiments were carried out under traffic lanes of standard forest vehicles in forest stands of the southern Black Forest. The soil stresses were determined using stress state transducers (SST) and displacement transducer systems (DTS) at depths of 20 and 40 cm. Complete harvesting and trunk-logging processes with a total time span of 9 min were observed. The maximum vertical stresses for all experiments exceeded 200 kPa; some experiments showed maximum vertical stresses up to 500 kPa or more at a depth of 20 cm. To evaluate the impact of soil stresses on soil structure, the internal soil strength was determined by predicting the precompression stress. Comparison of soil stress data with the natural bearing capacity of the natural forest soil proves that sustainable traffic is not possible, irrespective of the vehicle type and the working process. Topsoil and subsoil compaction, an increase in the precompression stresses, deep rutting and vertical as well as horizontal soil displacement associated with shearing effects took place and affected the mechanical strength and the physical properties of forest soils. Considering these results, heavy forest machinery has a severe impact on soil physical properties such as air, heat, water fluxes and rootability. In order to sustain the present undamaged soil condition, a change in harvest logistics and organisation is necessary. This can be achieved with a permanent skid-trail system which has already been designed to implement new guidelines in Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany (Ministerium fur Ernahrung und landlichen Raum, Baden-Wurttemberg 2003, p 27).

TI Using model scenarios to predict and evaluate forest-management impacts
   on soil base saturation at landscape level
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH

DE landscape model; base saturation; stepwise multiple linear regression
   analysis; forest-management scenarios
ID SPATIAL PREDICTION
AB Silviculture, forest conversion and technical tools of ecosystem management, such as forest liming, display their effects at the landscape level. Therefore their planning and control should take place at the same scale. The primary objective of this work was to assess soil chemical properties and their changes in relationship to ecosystem management, especially forest conversion and forest liming. We calculated scenario models, based on regression analysis, which allow such an examination in the context of understanding landscape processes which can be expected to operate in the sampling region. Stepwise multiple linear regression analysis was used to predict soil chemical attributes ( base saturation, pH, C/ N content and stock, exchangeable stocks of Ca and Mg) as indicators of site stability or ``off-site effects'' of forest ecosystems such as effects on clean drinking water from forested watersheds. Because of space limitations, in this paper only the modelling results of base saturation are presented. Base saturation was used as an integrative example for other soil chemical properties. The transformation of measurements to the regional scale, i.e., the regionalization, was calculated for the forested parts of two test regions in the Black Forest on the basis of measured chemical properties of 90 - 150 soil profiles per test region. The models have a spatial resolution of 50 x 50 m, which is a spatial scale relevant for forestry practice and forest management. Topographic variables ( e. g., elevation, aspect, slope gradient, and slope length), the stratigraphic classification of the geologic substrate, stand characteristics from forest inventory data, and finally technical information about forest liming were the auxiliary variables ( secondary site properties) that provided indirect information about base saturation and were available for the whole forested area of the test regions. Base saturation could be predicted with an accuracy of similar to 50 - 70% ( in terms of the multiple R-2) by using these properties as predictor variables in multiple linear regression analyses. The explained proportion of variance was unexpectedly high considering the high geomorphological heterogeneity of the two test regions. Based upon the regionalization models, it was possible to establish scenarios showing the landscape-related effects on base saturation that may be achieved by forest conversion towards a higher proportion of forests with broad-leaved mixed stands and by forest liming. These scenarios allow the interactions between several influencing factors and management strategies and the impacts on the target variable to be synoptically judged. Thus the presented regionalization models achieve the role of decision support tools for the planning of forest management at the landscape level. They allow an assessment of the environmental effects of forest management strategies in terms of site sustainability or preservation of water resources in forested catchments.

AB The fisheries of two coastal lagoons, Keta and Songor, were studied as part of Ghana Coastal Wetlands Management Project (GCWMP) aimed at sustainable exploitation of wetland resources. Fish samples were obtained with seine nets and cast net as well as from local fishermen. Water quality parameters (pH, dissolved oxygen, temperature and turbidity) were similar in the two lagoons, except for salinity, which was significantly different (P < 0.001). Despite their close geographical proximity, the two lagoons supported different fish assemblages with the blackchin tilapia, Sarotherodon melanotheron Ruppell, and the redchin tilapia, Tilapia guineensis (Bleeker), being the most important commercial fishes in both lagoons. The number of individuals for each species in Songor Lagoon were far more abundant, with densities several orders of magnitude higher than in Keta Lagoon. However, both species were significantly larger (P < 0.01) in the latter [15-121 and 25-157 mm standard length (SL)] than in the former lagoon (30-102 and 15-95 mm SL) for S. melanotheron and T. guineensis respectively. Over-fishing, use of small-size mesh nets, limited mixing of marine and fresh water were some of the factors limiting fish production in both lagoons.

SO FOREST PRODUCTS JOURNAL

AB The reduction of stocking levels has been proposed as one part of a larger plan to restore western forests to sustainable ecological conditions and reduce fire hazard levels. Removal of trees to approximate natural disturbance processes is needed to reduce stocking levels in various western forest types. The problem is that current markets for small-diameter material are limited. New investments in facilities to produce wood-based products from small-diameter material will be needed. Investments will only occur if they are expected to yield a satisfactory financial return consistent with their level of risk. The financial feasibility of investing in a conventional random-length sawmill and a modern large-scale sawmill optimized specifically for processing small-diameter material was evaluated. Monte Carlo Simulation techniques were used for risk analysis of utilizing small-diameter material. Results of this analysis suggest that constructing a new sawmill optimized specifically for processing small-diameter material may be feasible. However, changes in forest policy designed to substantially reduce the risk of interruptions in the Supply of logs will be required for investment to occur.

   West Part II: Market pulp and oriented strandboard
SO FOREST PRODUCTS JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
AB The reduction of stocking levels has been proposed as one part of a larger plan to restore western forests to sustainable ecological conditions and reduce fire hazard levels. The cost effective removal of trees as part of an effort to approximate natural-disturbance processes in various western forest types will require the development of new markets for small-diameter material. Prior work utilized Monte Carlo simulation techniques to assess the feasibility of constructing a new sawmill optimized specifically for processing small-diameter material. The results of the analysis were favorable, which prompted the further question as to the feasibility of producing oriented strandboard (OSB) and market pulp from small-diameter forest removals. In this analysis, Monte Carlo simulation techniques were again used to assess the feasibility of investments in constructing new OSB and bleached chemithermomechanical pulp (BCTMP) mills to utilize this material. The results do not the support the construction of a BCTMP mill due to the high initial capital investment requirements and the relatively low prices for BCTMP market pulp at this time. The feasibility of constructing a new OSB mill was more favorable, but would probably require a modest subsidy in the form of zero stumpage prices as well as long-term supply assurances, before a company would seriously consider an investment of this type.

ID ANALYTIC HIERARCHY PROCESS; LAND EVALUATION
AB A system for the quantitative evaluation of soil productivity was developed and deployed in Gaoyou County, China. The study area, comprising 81,600 ha of cultivated land, was divided into 7367 evaluation units, and 19 soil properties were selected as factors for evaluation. Fuzzy analysis and expert score ranking combined with the Delphi method were used to quantify the membership functions of the evaluation factors selected. The weight contributions of individual factors to soil productivity were determined using the Delphi method and an analytic hierarchy process (AHP). A geographic information system (GIS) was used to manipulate the spatial database of the study area. This evaluation system, which differentiates between the concepts of land productivity and soil productivity, has several advantages compared with the China Agriculture Ministry Land Evaluation System (CAMLES), and can deliver detailed soil information to help decision makers and farmers identify the optimal agricultural management practices for achieving higher soil productivity and sustainable soil use. The proposed system has been accepted as the standard method for evaluating soil productivity in China. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID DELIBERATIVE DEMOCRACY
AB Involving the public in decision-making has become a bureaucratic pre-occupation for every health agency in the UK. In this paper we offer an innovative approach for local participation in health decision-making through the development of a 'grounded' citizens' jury. We describe the process of one such jury commissioned by a Primary Care Group in the north-west of England, which was located in an area suffering intractable health inequalities. Twelve local people aged between 17 and 70 were recruited to come together for a week to hear evidence, ask questions and debate what they felt would improve the health and well-being of people living in the area. The jury process acted effectively as a grass-roots health needs assessment and amongst other outcomes, resulted in the setting up of a community health centre run by a board consisting of members of the community (including two jurors) together with local agencies. The methodology described here contrasts with that practiced by what we term 'the consultation industry'. which is primarily interested in the use of fixed models to Generate the public view as a standardized output, a product, developed to serve the needs of an established policy process, with little interest in effecting change. We outline four principles underpinning our approach: deliberation, integration, sustainability and accountability. We argue that citizens' juries and other consultation initiatives need to be reclaimed from that which merely serves the policy process and become 'grounded', a tool for activism, in which local people are agents in the development of policies affecting their lives.

AB Aretaieion University Hospital participated in the World Health Organization (WHO) Pilot Health Promoting Hospitals Project from 1993 until 1997, when the Hellenic Network of Health Promoting Hospitals was established. This study is an overall evaluation of the participation of Aretaieion Hospital at the HPH Pilot Project. The evaluation comprised two questionnaire surveys, one among all the professionals, and the other among the patients involved in the subprojects. At the professional's survey, the response was 88.6% (39), while at the patient's survey the response was 62.2% (84). Differences were identified between the perceptions of the professionals who were external collaborators and those who were members of the hospital staff. Problems of the Project were reported to be lack of funding, lack of time and personnel shortages, lack of health promotion background and lack of incentives. Major successes were reported to be the personnel training, the development of collaboration and teamwork, the improvement of the overall image of the hospital into the community, the improvement of the working conditions of the personnel. Perception of sustainability of the projects by health professionals was found to be related to how interesting they found their subproject and how relevant to the work of their department. The communication strategy was inadequately planned and this resulted in some difficulties in developing rapport with the patients. However, the patients felt that they benefited from the project, a view also held by the hospital staff professionals.

AB Program sustainability is an ongoing concern for most people in health promotion. However, the current notion of sustainability in organizations, namely routinization, needs refinement. This article examines organizational routines. In so doing, it refines the notion of sustainability and the assessment of routines. Drawing on the organizational literature, a routinized program is defined by the presence of routinized activities, meaning that these activities exhibit four characteristics of organizational routines: memory, adaptation, values and rules. To answer the question of how these characteristics are useful, we conducted an empirical study of the routinization of the Quebec Heart Health Demonstration Project in five community health centers. Our method consisted of a multiple-case study. We observed project activities in each center in 2000. The data came from documents and interviews with project actors. Our results show that, in one of the centers, no resources had been officially committed to project activities. Even so, the actors continued some activities on an informal basis. In another center, the activities satisfied three of the four routine characteristics. In the three others, activities satisfied all of the characteristics. These results suggest focusing the study of program sustainability on the routinization of activities resulting from it. They indicate four distinct degrees of sustainability: (1) the absence of sustainability; no program activity is continued; (2) precarious sustainability; some residual activities are pursued, at least unofficially; (3) weak sustainability; the program produces some official activities that are not routinized; and (4) sustainability through routinization; routinized activities result from the program.

TI Health service utilization in the former Soviet Union: Evidence from
   eight countries
SO HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article

ID CARE; INSURANCE; TRANSITION; PAYMENTS; RUSSIA
AB Background. In the past decade, the countries that emerged from the Soviet Union have experienced major changes in the inherited Soviet model of health care, which was centrally planned and provided universal, free access to basic care. The underlying principle of universality remains, but coexists with new funding and delivery systems and growing out-of-pocket payments.
   Objective. To examine patterns and determinants of health care utilization, the extent of payment for health care, and the settings in which care is obtained in Armenia, Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Russia, and Ukraine.
   Methods. Data were derived from cross-sectional surveys, representative of adults aged 18 and over in each country, conducted in 2001. Multistage random sample of 18,428 individuals, stratified by region and area, was obtained. Instrument contained extensive data on demographic, economic, and social characteristics, administered face-to-face. The analysis explored the health seeking behavior of users and nonusers (those reporting an episode of illness but not consulting).
   Results. In the preceding year, over half of all respondents visited a medical professional, ranging from 65.7 percent in Belarus to 24.4 percent in Georgia, mostly at local primary care facilities. Of those reporting an illness, 20.7 percent of all did not consult although they felt they should have done so, varying from 9.4 percent in Belarus to 42.4 percent in Armenia and 49 percent in Georgia.
   The main reason for not seeking care was lack of money to pay for treatment (45.2 percent), self-treatment with home-produced remedies (32.9 percent), and purchase of nonprescribed medicine (21.8 percent). There are marked differences between countries; unaffordability was a particularly common factor in Armenia, Georgia, and Moldova (78 percent, 70 percent, 54 percent), and much lower in Belarus and Russia.
   In Georgia and Armenia, 65 percent and 56 percent of those who had consulted paid out-of-pocket, in the form of money, gifts, or both; these figures were 8 percent and 19 percent in Belarus and Russia respectively and 31.2 percent overall.
   The probability of not consulting a health professional when seriously ill was significantly higher among those over age 65, and with lower education. Use of health care was markedly lower among those with fewer household assets or a shortage of money, and those dissatisfied with their material resources, factors that explained some of the effects of age. A lack of social support (formal and informal) decreases further the probability of not consulting, adding to the consequences of poor financial status.
   The probability of seeking care for common conditions varies widely among countries (persistent fever: 56 percent in Belarus; 16 percent in Armenia) and home remedies, alcohol, and direct purchase of pharmaceuticals are commonly used. Informal coping strategies, such as use of connections (36.7 percent) or offering money to health professionals (28.5 percent) are seen as acceptable.
   Conclusions. This article provides the first comparative assessment of inequalities in access to health care in multiple countries of the former Soviet Union, using rigorous methodology. The emerging model across the region is extremely diverse. Some countries (Belarus, Russia) have managed to maintain access for most people, while in others the situation is near collapse (Armenia, Georgia). Access is most problematic in health systems characterized by high levels of payment for care and a breakdown of gate-keeping, although these are seen in countries facing major problems such as economic collapse and, in some, a legacy of civil war. There are substantial inequalities within each country and even where access remains adequate there are concerns about its sustainability.

DE hunting; community wildlife management; Bolivia; Chaco; Izoceno-Guarani
ID WILDLIFE SURVEYS; LOCAL HUNTERS; CONSERVATION; MANAGEMENT
AB Community wildlife management is being tested across the tropics as a means of promoting the conservation and sustainable use of wildlife resources. Key to successful programs is the effective participation of local hunters and communities in monitoring, planning, decision-making and implementation. We evaluate one method to achieve this participation, namely hunter self-monitoring. Between 1997 and 2000, Izoceno hunters from 22 communities in the Bolivian Chaco have voluntarily participated in monitoring their hunting activities, measuring and recording data on captured animals and hunting methods in personal notebooks. Despite the lack of remuneration, participation exceeds 60% of active hunters. However, the written information and specimens provided are not complete, and are biased according to hunting methods and prey characteristics. Complementary research is essential to answer specific research questions. Nevertheless, hunter self-monitoring serves to raise awareness of wildlife management issues at the communal or indigenous territory level, as evidenced by preliminary actions taken by hunters and communities in the Izozog.

ID ECOLOGICAL DIMENSIONS; LAND-USE; AUSTRIA; METABOLISM
AB The process of industrial modernization was characterized by fundamental changes in the interaction of socioeconomic systems with their natural environment. This paper reflects on this transformation process from an ecologically informed perspective, focusing on the interrelation of local populations, their specific mode of production, and the (agro-) ecosystem. Four Austrian villages in different agro-ecological zones serve as case studies for a comparative analysis of different types of farming systems and changes in these systems over time from the early nineteenth century to the present. The paper presents empirical results and aims at contributing to the discussion of relevant topics in human ecology and environmental history. Focusing on the changing significance of livestock in agricultural production systems, it addresses issues including the relation of population density to intensity of land use; soil fertility and nutrient management; the sustainability of preindustrial agriculture; and the gradual opening of locally closed cycles during industrialization and its effect on the landscape.

TI Community autonomy and the Maya ICBG project in Chiapas, Mexico: How a
   bioprospecting project that should have succeeded failed

DE community autonomy; sustainable economic development; natural resources;
   bioprospecting; Maya; Chiapas; Mexico

AB The autonomy of indigenous and local communities is widely recognized by international, national, and local laws and customs. This autonomy includes the recognized rights of communities to grant permission to enter into agreements for access to their resources, including the commercial use of these resources based on fair and equitable benefit-sharing arrangements. Nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and their allies have questioned the autonomy of local indigenous communities, which they claim have no rights to enter into agreements for bioprospecting projects. Efforts to limit the autonomy of local communities concerning commercial use of biological resources is tied to NGO opposition to any form of sustainable development which they believe contributes to globalization and exploitation of the developing countries of the South by the developed countries of the North. To achieve their goals, these groups have launched negative misinformation campaigns to discredit applied biodiversity research projects and the scientists who lead them. Although these NGOs have no legitimate authority to speak for local communities, their access to the press and the Internet provides them with a platform that allows them to be identified as the voice of the indigenous and local communities of the world. In this case study of the Maya ICBG project in Chiapas, Mexico, we describe how local community autonomy was taken from indigenous communities that had agreed to participate in an international development project on drug discovery, biodiversity conservation, and sustained economic development. A major lesson to be drawn from the Maya ICBG case is that local indigenous community autonomy, as envisioned in the 1992 Convention on Biodiversity, is more myth than reality in the access-to-biological-resources debate, especially in the politically charged climate of Mexico and Latin America.

AB Anthropologists can use longitudinal, comparative, and multiscale research to illuminate aspects of global change and development. Goals and procedures of the emerging field of sustainability science are examined here in relation to those of the linkages methodology and other multisited, historical, and transnational approaches in recent anthropology. Conclusions about the sustainability of development emerge from field studies in Arembepe, Brazil, and Ivato, Madagascar. The contrasts between Arembepe and Ivato, and the regions and nations that include them, are sharp and almost certainly irreversible. Madagascar suffers from an overdose of environmentalism, while Brazil has been dominated by developmental ism. Arembepe now has a sustainable diversified economy and cultural contacts linking its future with the dynamics of capitalist globalization. Ivato, by contrast, is in a region and nation with dramatically increasing population and diminishing natural resources but no investment stream to provide significant employment alternatives. In future years Ivato and similar farming communities may have little left of their past to sustain.

AB Mountain regions supply a large share of the world's population with fresh water. Quantification of the hydrological significance of mountains, however, is subject to great uncertainty. Instead Of focusing on global averages in advance, the present analysis follows a catchment-based approach using discharge data provided by the Global Runoff Data Centre (GRDC). The River Rhine originating in the European Alps is chosen as a first study area, revealing the hydrological relationship between mountainous and lowland regions in a well -documented area. Following the findings from this analysis, different aspects of runoff characteristics for a total of 22 case-study river basins world-wide have been investigated and compared, for a global view. The view has been extended through aspects of' climate and human use of mountain runoff. The particular hydrological characteristics of mountain areas are characterised by disproportionately large discharges. In humid areas, mountains supply up to 20-50% of total discharge while in arid areas, mountains contribute from 50-90% of total discharge, with extremes of over 95%. The overall assessment of the hydrological significance of mountain areas reveals that the world's major 'water towers' are found in arid or semi-arid zones where they provide essential fresh water for a significant proportion of a quickly growing global Population.

AB Reliability prediction methods, do not generally account for the actual life cycle environment of electronic products, which covers their environmental, operating and usage conditions: Considering thermal loads, thermal management, strategies still focus on a design-for continuous operation that is often determined based on an accumulation of worst-case assumptions.
   Health monitoring is a method of assessing the reliability of, a product in-its actual application conditions. A case study in. health and usage monitoring of electronic products is presented for a commercial notebook computer. Internal temperatures were dynamically monitored in situ and statistically analyzed during all phases of the life cycle, including usage, storage, and transportation. The effects of,power cycles, usage history, CPU computing resources usage, and external thermal environment on peak transient thermal, loads were characterized. Such monitored life cycle temperature data could be applied in a life consumption monitoring methodology, to provide damage estimation and remaining life prediction due to specific failure mechanism's influenced by temperature. These findings could contribute to the design of more sustainable, least-energy consumption thermal management solutions..

AB A field experiment was conducted during 1999-2000 to 2001-2002 at Sabour, Bhagalpur, to diversify traditional rice (Oryza sativa L.)-wheat (Triticum aestivum L. emend. Firoi & Paol.) cropping system. Among the rice-based-crop sequences tested, rice-potato (Solanum tuberosum L.)-onion (Allium cepa L.) gave the highest rice-equivalent Yield (26.94 tonnes/ha/year), net returns (Rs 65,573/ha) and production efficiency (81.6 kg/ha/day), followed by rice-potato-sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) having corresponding values of 23.92 tonnes/ha/year, Rs 61,533/ha and 80.6 kg/ha/day. Rice yields after green-manuring or fodder crops were higher than those after grain crops including greengram (Phaseolus radiatus L.). The highest benefit : cost ratio of 1:47 was noted in rice-berseem (Trifolium alexandrinum L.)-maize (Zea mays L.) + cowpea [Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp.] both grown for fodder. Rice-maize + greengram system had the highest land-use efficiency (96.8%). Rice-potato-onion required the highest energy inputs (69.90 x 10(3) MJ/ha), resulting in the lowest energy-use efficiency (2.46), whereas rice-potato-sunflower produced the highest output energy (205.71 x 10(3) MJ/ha). Green-manuring of Sesbania aculeata during summer improved organic carbon, available N, P2O5 and K2O level of soil.

AB Most oral health surveys in Nigeria have been sporadic and based on convenience samples. Periodontal disease with deep pocketing occurs in Nigerians at an early age, the prevalence being 15-58% in those aged above 15 years. Caries experience has been reported to vary between very low and low in most studies, but is moderate in some urban communities. Although mean DMFT is below 4 in most communities, the restorative index is extremely low, most carious teeth remaining unrestored. The higher caries prevalence in second than first permanent molars that has been reported is most likely due to a change from traditional to Westerntype diet. Other oral health problems include malocclusion, truamatised teeth, dental fluorosis, and oral tumours. The scanty oral health services available in the country are mainly in urban areas. There is, therefore, a need to develop sustainable strategies for national preventive and therapeutic oral health services in Nigeria.

ID POLICY
AB China's forest resources have been and continue to be threatened. The analysis of the various reported statistics, while often conflicting, does indicate significant challenges ahead for the forest to supply the material for industrial, non-industrial, fuelwood and conservation objectives. Given forecasted constraints on domestic fibre supply for at least two decades there could be a significant increase demand for logs and forest products from China's trading partners. Overall this paper indicates the challenge in reaching more specific conclusions since there are serious data discrepancies in all major statistical areas. These discrepancies must be addressed before a clear set of land and sustainable development policies can be created.

TI The China forest products trade: overview of Asia-Pacific supplying

SO INTERNATIONAL FORESTRY REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
DE China; Asia Pacific; forest product exports; livelihoods; policy issues
AB Over 70 % of China's timber product imports are supplied by countries in the Asia Pacific region, and China is the dominant forest product market for many of these countries. Unsustainable harvesting practices, illegal logging, and negative impacts on community livelihoods plague many of these supplying countries. The countries may be divided into those still harvesting and exporting timber from natural forests on a large scale and those which have gone past their highest levels of natural forest timber harvesting and are now more aggressively pursuing plantation development and processing. Apart front Russia, China's top Asia Pacific timber suppliers could at best maintain current supply, with natural forest resources being depleted in less than 20 years. Resource limits also constrain expansion and/or long-term continuation of processed product export to China. Greater attention and action on the part of governments, market leaders, and international organizations is needed to address negative impacts, shifting supply to a sustainable, legal and equitable basis and to determine from where China's long-term supply will come.

DE China; paper and paperboard; pulp; wood fibre; supply-demand trends
AB This study summarizes recent trends in China's paper and paperboard sector and projects supply and demand for each of the major grades through 2010. Baseline projections suggest that China's aggregate demand will grow from 48.0 million tonnes in 2003 to 68.5 million tonnes per year in 2010. With domestic production projected to reach 62.4 million tonnes per year, China is expected to dominate global capacity expansion for most major grades. China's annual demand for fibre furnish across all grades is projected to rise from 40.2 million tonnes in 2003 to reach 59.6 million tonnes by 2010. Of this, approximately 58 % will come from recovered paper, 25 % from wood-based pulp, and 17 % from nonwood pulp. This rapid growth has far-reaching implications for forest sustainability and rural livelihoods both within China and throughout the Asia-Pacific region. It will place new strains on China's domestic wood supply and may exacerbate forest conversion and illegal logging in key supplier countries, in addition to providing both threats and potential income opportunities for smallholder tree growers.

TI Chinas development of a plantation-based wood pulp industry: government
   policies, financial incentives, and investment trends
SO INTERNATIONAL FORESTRY REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
DE China; wood pulp; plantations; Asia Pulp & Paper; fuxing
AB The Chinese government is aggressively promoting development of a domestic wood Pulp industry, integrated with a plantation-based fiber supply and downstream paper production. It is doing so by providing discounted loans from state banks, fiscal incentives, and capital subsidies for establishment of at least 5.8 million hectares of fast-growing pulpwood plantations. This article examines the development of bleached hardwood kraft pulp (BHKP) mills in South China, including the Asia Pulp & Paper (APP) Jinhai mill in Hainan Province and the proposed Fuxing pulp mill project in Guangdong Province. Both mills face fiber shortfalls over the medium term, and significant new investments in plantation development will be needed to provide a sustainable fiber supply at the mills? projected capacity levels. However, there are few sites in southern coastal China where fiber can be grown at internationally competitive costs. In most instances, the cost of Chinese plantation pulpwood will be considerably higher than in countries like Indonesia and Brazil, raising important questions about the economic competitiveness of Chinese Pulp producers even within their home market.

ID ACCESS; REFORM
AB Collective forests form the majority of China's forested area and have proven to be critical in maintaining the livelihoods of hundreds of millions of rural inhabitants, supplying wood and other forest products for China's burgeoning demand, and providing critical environmental services. This paper describes the key policy and institutional dimensions of China's collective forests and how collective forest property rights are defined both in law and in practice. The national and provincial distributions of collective forests are presented. The paper assesses the impacts and implications of critical national policies, including the National Forest Protection Program (NFPP), the expansion of the public protected area system, the Forest Ecosystem Compensation Program (FECP), the system of taxes and fees, and the log-harvesting quota. It concludes with recommendations regarding policy reforms that would strengthen the collective forest sector and increase its contribution to poverty alleviation, rural development, and sustainable forest conservation.

TI China's Sloping Land Conversion Programme four years on: current

SO INTERNATIONAL FORESTRY REVIEW

DT Article
DE sloping land conversion; program sustainability; targeting; rural
   household income
AB With a budget of RMB 337 billion (over US$ 40 billion), the Sloping Land Conversion Program (SLCP) is one of China's most ambitious environmental initiatives, and is one of the world's largest land-conservation programs. Pending successful completion, it will have significant implications for China's forests and remaining natural ecosystems, representing an almost 10 % increase in current national forest area. However, we provide evidence that it is in danger of failing to reach its goals due to flaws in design and implementation. Four years into the program, this paper uses a 2003 data set of 358 households to examine SLCP implementation and to suggest improvements. Of central concern has been overly quick expansion over the past few years, which has served to exacerbate problems already revealed, but not adequately addressed, during the pilot phase of the program.

TI Forestry revenue policy in China: what has happened and why
SO INTERNATIONAL FORESTRY REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
DE China; forestry taxes; levies; sustainable forest management; economic
   appraisal
AB China forestry taxation and charging system hits been evolving from a planned to a market oriented system which in practice is complex, overburdened, inconsistent, and affected by high avoidance and low efficiency in collection. These are disincentives for forest management, and both household welfare and the environment are worse off because of them. Before 1985 government revenue came from controlling the price of timber and the market. After the market opened up, revenues came increasingly from taxes and additional charges on farmers. In the past 7 years, funds from the state fiscal account from forestry development have increased more than 20 times, but misuse of government funds either at collection, or in transfer from central fiscal accounts has resulted from overstaffing in the government sector and poor enforcement. Since 2002, the Chinese government has taken some measures to address these problems: it hits eliminated Special Agriculture Product Taxation and illegal charges; decreased the rate of officially approval charges, and promised to eliminate the Agriculture Production Tax within 5 years from 2004. China's case shows that government institutions were the major constraints on reform of forestry taxes and charges reform, and also that full solution of the problems involved will need to go well beyond the forestry sector itself.

AB Over the past several decades a growing interest has emerged in the relationship between forest-dependent communities and their use of non-timber forest resources (NTFR - i.e. berries, roots, barks). Motivated in large part by international concerns over the loss of biological and cultural diversity, efforts are now being made to conserve the world's remaining forests by repositioning NTFR to the forefront of the forest management process. Together with the Little Salmon Carmacks First Nation, we have undertaken an assessment that: 1) addresses the role of NTFR in fulfilling basic human necessities and well-being of community members, and 2) identifies the perceptual differences that exist among First Nation and non-First Nation community members regarding the security and future availability of forest resources. Based on our findings, we argue that if the true value of the forest is to be understood, and thus sustained, those involved in management must consider the full array of products and services the forest provides. Thus the conventional and over-simplified view that the forest is to provide primarily for commercial timber must be challenged in light of the multiplicity of values community members gain from forest use.

AB Thailand underwent a major shift in forest policy in the second half of the 1980s to promote sustainable management and control of deforestation. This paper puts this in the context of earlier changes in forest policy and analyses the underlying causes of the shift by analysing changes in the relative strength of different interest groups within the framework of a policy pressures model. Internal pressures had a stronger impact on Thai forest policy than external pressures. Protectionist groups became more numerous and more powerful in Thailand in the 1980s in relation to exploitative groups, and their rise in influence was facilitated by continuing progress in democratization and pluralization, linked to the consequences of economic development. Such political change could help to explain the apparent link between better environmental management and economic development shown in the Environmental Kuznets Curve.

ID ECOLOGICAL REGIONALIZATION; UNITED-STATES; CLASSIFICATION
AB Ecological regionalization is a base for rational management and sustainable utilization of ecosystems and natural resources. It can provide a scientific basis for constructing healthy ecological environments and making policies of environmental management. In this paper, based on synthetic analysis of the characteristics of the ecology and environments of China, the principles of ecological regionalization are discussed, and indices and nomenclature of ecological regionalization are proposed. The ecoregions on a national scale are divided. The results show that there are 3 domains, 13 ecoregions and 57 ecodistricts. The present scheme can be used as a framework for ecosystem assessment and management. Based on the ecoregions, measurements of management for forest, grassland, agriculture and wetland ecosystems are recommended. The experience and information can be used within and beyond the national scale for land-use planning, biodiversity conservation and ecosystem restoration.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND WORLD ECOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
DE sustainable tourism; stakeholders; Norway; management
AB This paper reviews some of the literature and guidance provided for businesses considering responses to the environmental aspects and impacts of their tourist activities. It concentrates on the role of destinations and stakeholders within the destination cooperating and networking to improve environmental performance and on generating a 'green' image. In order to move towards a type of tourism consistent with sustainable development (sustainable tourism), it is argued that we need to see enhanced management of a destination, creating opportunities for networking and cooperation between, in particular, service providers. In a case study of Lillehammer, Norway, three projects negotiated, developed and delivered by service providers in the area are examined. These projects looked at hotel management, transport and aesthetics. Success factors are identified, including the involvement of stakeholders, the development of locally orientated codes of conduct, the role and participation of local authorities and the importance of leadership. Findings add to the body of practical help in moving destinations towards sustainable tourism.

AB This paper discusses optimal management for water resources in the context of the over-exploitation of fish and the pollution of freshwater fisheries, along with aquaculture, in inland and coastal areas. An optimal control model maximizing social surplus focusing on the dynamic relationship of fish stock externality, price, outputs, costs and polluting wastes is developed. It provides the necessary conditions for optimal management for both fishery and aquaculture, which produce the same product for the market, and also develops time-paths and phase diagrams for policy application.

TI EU water framework directive vs. integrated water resources management:
   The seven mismatches
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WATER RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB The aim of this paper is to analyze how the EU Water Framework Directive complies with the international principles concerning Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM) agreed in major conferences. The outcomes of the International Conference on Water and Environment (Dublin, 1992), the Second World Water Forum (The Hague, 2000), the International Conference on Freshwater (Bonn, 2001), and the World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD) (Johannesburg, 2002) were compared with the EU Water Framework Directive. Seven notable mismatches were found, even though several EU countries have played a leading role in those conferences. The question arises whether the outcome of these conferences is not efficient enough to influence EU policies-do the conferences just produce collections of idealistic buzzwords or is there a requirement for different principles regarding IWRM for developing countries and developed countries?.

ID MIGRATION
AB Small island nations in the South Pacific are facing a serious problem of loss of human capital. The loss of skilled and qualified personnel from the small pool is causing a major setback in terms of providing the technical expertise to forge ahead with reform programs that these economies are undertaking. Fiji's policymakers are increasingly confronting this issue, because the nation has experienced a massive outflow of skilled labor following the political instability in 1987. While there is an outflow of skilled labor, the country is also losing a large amount of financial capital. The extent of the outflow has yet to be measured due to lack of a methodology. This study advances a methodology to measure the loss to the economy arising out of human capital loss in a small island economy.

TI No new Kierkegaard
SO INTERNATIONAL PHILOSOPHICAL QUARTERLY
LA English
DT Article
AB The aim of this paper is to contest an influential recent reading of one of Kierkegaard's most important books, the pseudonymously written Concluding Unscientific Postscript. According to the reading offered by James Conant, the Postscript is an "elaborate reductio" of the very philosophical project in which it itself appears to be engaged, namely, the project of attempting to clarify the nature of Christianity. I show that Conant's position depends upon four inter-related theses concerning Kierkegaard's text, and I argue that none of these theses is sustainable, either philosophically or exegetically. In the course of this critique, alternative and more convincing theses are developed, and I suggest that these theses are altogether better suited than Conant's to account for, and to provide a defense of, Kierkegaard's stature as a religious thinker.

TI Explorations in open space. The World Social Forum and cultures of
   politics
SO INTERNATIONAL SOCIAL SCIENCE JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
AB We are living through a time of the rise of dramatically new politics, including civil politics, at local, national, transnational, and global levels, and new global networks among refugees, migrants, and religious groups. One of the most prominent manifestations of world civil politics is the World Social Forum, which held its first world meeting in Porto Alegre, Brazil, in January 2001. Based on issue analysis and diagnosis, the Forum aims to encourage the formulation of alternative proposals and strategies to neo-liberal "pensee unique" and to all forms of fundamentalism. The dramatic growth in numbers attending the world event-from around 25,000 in 2001 to over 100,000 in 2004-attests to the relevance of the Forum to people all over the world.
   While it calls itself "Social", the Forum is a fundamentally political idea and promotes a specific vocabulary, grammar, and culture of politics. We call for a wide-ranging, critical, and insistently plural exploration of the idea and concept of "open space" as a political-cultural concept, focusing on the Forum and its self-defined culture(s) of politics. In these terms, the Forum represents both an important experiment and something of a paradox. On the one hand, it offers a rich vision of an "open space" for movements that challenge empires and celebrate diversity and plurality. On the other hand, the open space is circumscribed by a specific conception of politics and a specific ideological orientation. Is multiplicity sustainable within and in relation to a single, "unique" larger idea? Can the culture of "open space" politics operate coherently both within the Forum and in its relations with the world it seeks to change?

TI Furrow irrigation erosion and management
SO IRRIGATION SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
ID SEDIMENT; SIZE
AB Irrigation-induced furrow erosion reduces topsoil depth and pollutes surface waters. A variety of interacting factors, including inflow rate, slope and soil type, are known to affect furrow erosion. Data are inadequate to understand the furrow erosion process sufficiently well to recommend irrigation practices that maintain high levels of water quality and conserve soil. We performed furrow erosion field studies on two soils (a loamy textured alluvial soil and a clay loam cracking soil) with slopes ranging from 0.3 to 0.8%. Three inflow rates per furrow were applied in each of three irrigations. We found net rates of soil loss in the upper part of the furrow that were up to six times higher than the average net rate for the whole furrow. The soil loss was related to the inflow rate by power functions. High inflow rates on furrows with slopes greater than 0.3% caused unsustainable soil losses. However, at least in the loamy textured soil, it is possible to maintain high irrigation uniformity and application efficiency (within the range 80-85%), while keeping soil losses within a sustainable limit. An analysis of the sediment load data made in the frame of a simple conceptual model helped to explain the dynamics of the furrow erosion process and to establish the basis for modeling furrow erosion.

DT Article
ID MYCORRHIZAE; TREES
AB The structure of the line roots and their formation of mycorrhiza was investigated for Metasequoia glyptostroboides HU et CHENG both from natural growth in China and from planted trees, as well as from flooding experiments in order to better understand this species' adaptability to water saturated and flooded sites respectively. The fine root system consists of short roots of 0.5 to 0.7 mm thickness and of 1 to 1.5 cm in length. The long roots exhibit a diameter of 1 to 1.5 mill and a length of 10 to 12 cm, the difference in diameter call be explained with the formation of a broader cortex layer. Both root types are characterized by lignified thickenings (Phi sheats) in the connected cell walls of the cortex tissue contributing to the strength and elasticity of this tissue. The flooding treatment of 90 days altered the growth of the trees. The leaves of flooded plants turned to yellow and showed senescence earlier than the control plants. The special adaptability to temporarily flooded conditions also in field experiments could be related to an increased intercellular aerenchymous cortex tissue, which eminently extends as lacunas. In contrast to the dominant short root formation under normal soil conditions, the long roots are predominant under reduced content of oxygen in flooded soil. Under these stress conditions short and long roots do not develop mycorrhiza, whereas under normal soil conditions a special vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhiza (VAM) is the rule. These special adaptabilities of the fine root structure contribute to the possibility Of Sustainable management of plantations of this species even under unfavourable soil conditions.

AB 1. Disturbances and resource availability are key factors affecting plant diversity in managed forests. As disturbance regimes vary among silvicultural systems and may simultaneously affect different types of resources, effects on biodiversity can be unpredictable.
   2. We compared the effects of two silvicultural systems on understorey plant diversity, including species composition, structural attributes and functional organization. One hundred and thirty-five phytosociological releves were sampled from 27 forest stands managed under either a traditional coppice-with-standards (CWS, n = 12) or a 'close-to-nature' selective cutting system (SC, n = 15), over similar edaphic conditions. Important environmental factors affecting vegetation were deduced using Ellenberg indicator values. Structural diversity was described using traditional indices of alpha and beta diversity. Guilds were defined within the local pool of species using a set of 14 traits and their relationship with silviculture was assessed using correspondence analysis.
   3. Post-logged CWS stands share some compositional and structural characteristics with selectively cut stands, including high species richness and a dominance of early successional species. However the species pool for all coppicing areas was higher than for selectively cut areas, suggesting that the high disturbance frequency occurring in the latter may progressively eliminate the most sensitive species.
   4. Functional diversity strongly differs between the two systems. Although it is conserved through the silvicultural cycle in the coppice-with-standards system, some guilds were lacking in selectively cut stands. The most negatively impacted guilds were tree and shrub saplings, prostrated ruderals, shade-tolerant perennials and vernal geophytes. The latter two comprise 'true forest species' which may also be considered as 'coppicing-maintained species'. To reach the same values of guild richness (i.e. number of guilds) or redundancy (i.e. proportion of the maximal species richness within each guild), larger areas were required in SC compared with CWS systems.
   5. In the SC system, the high proportion of light reaching the forest floor induced a spectacular spread of blackberries Rubus fruticosus agg., which decreased species richness. It also caused shifts in guild composition: graminoids and ferns grew strongly to the detriment of true forest species.
   6. Synthesis and applications. Our results suggest long-term negative effects of selective cutting on both structural and functional plant diversity, compared with coppice-with-standards. Cutting intervals are shorter than recovery times, so that early successional species-dominated communities are maintained. Vernal geophytes and shade-tolerant perennials seem to be limited by the frequency of disturbance rather than by the severity of disturbance. We conclude that, from a biodiversity point of view, this 'close-to-nature' system does not cope with the objective of sustainable forest management. The rotations currently in use do not match natural disturbances very closely and are applied to a managed system rather than a natural forest. Retaining remnants of old coppice woods and extending rotations to at least 50 years are recommended where biodiversity conservation is a goal of forest management.

AB Cultivation, overgrazing, and overharvesting are seriously degrading forest and grassland ecosystems in the Taurus Mountains of the southern Mediterranean region of Turkey. This study investigated the effects of changes on soil organic carbon (SOC) content and other physical soil properties over a 12-year period in three adjacent ecosystems in a Mediterranean plateau. The ecosystems were cropland (converted from grasslands in 1990), open forest, and grassland. Soil samples from two depths, 0-10 and 10-20cm, were collected for chemical and physical analyses at each of cropland, open forest, and grassland ecosystems. SOC pools at the 0-20 cm depth of cropland, forest, and grassland ecosystems were estimated at 32,636, 56,480, and 57,317 kg ha(-1), respectively. Conversion of grassland into cropland during the 12-year period increased the bulk density by 10.5% and soil erodibility by 46.2%; it decreased SOM by 48.8%, SOC content by 43%, available water capacity (AWC) by 30.5%, and total porosity by 9.1% for the 0-20 cm soil depth (p < 0.001). The correlation matrix revealed that SOC content was positively correlated with AWC, total porosity, mean weight diameter (MWD), forest, and grassland, and negatively with bulk density, pH, soil erodibility factor, and cropland. The multiple regression (MLR) models indicated that any two of the three ecosystems and one of the two soil depths accounted for 86.5% of variation in mean SOC values ((P<0.001).

AB Using precipitation data from a semi-arid region in the highlands of central Mexico, historical values of productivity are assessed. Production models based on climatic indices are discussed. An empirical rain simulation equation shows that it is possible to reproduce the expected values of productivity from observed ecosystems and agricultural yields. A graphical method is proposed to estimate intrinsic growth rate and maximum sustainable yield. Spatial rainfall variability induced by orographic effects, introduces a chaotic semicyclic behavior as expected in a logistic simulation equation. Resilience and predictable drought-productivity tendencies can also be derived from this model. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI External engagement: The Baltic experience
SO JOURNAL OF BALTIC STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
AB The analysis of the Baltic transition reveals the importance of external actors' participation in the process of state transformation. Based on the experiences of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, this article establishes six broad policy principles for effective external engagement. First, the nature, level, and scope of engagement directly correlates with the sustainability of transition. Second, equality in bilateral cooperation brings trust and openness among partners. Third, for a transitional state to succeed it needs sufficient external motivation to sustain it through political and economic fluctuations. Fourth, if foreign aid does not come hand in hand with adequate accountability standards, it brings corruption and stagnation. Fifth, building local (and not foreign) capacity is the primary duty of an external actor. Finally, the reputation of an external actor is as important as the work that this actor conducts. All these principles form the backbone of successful and sustainable actor-to-actor cooperation.

ID CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY
AB The European Corporate Sustainability Framework (ECSF) is, among other concepts, based on a phase-wise development approach as described by Clare Graves' Levels of Existence Theory. As much as corporate sustainability has a sequence of adequate interpretations, aligned with each development level, also the notion of business excellence can be defined at multiple levels, as this paper demonstrates. Furthermore, the authors analyze the current EFQM Excellence Model for particular biases towards various development levels and suggest a new and innovative two-step approach to assessing organizational performance with respect to organizational excellence (OE) and corporate sustainability. According to the organization's ambition, the assessment is either limited to a shareholder approach, mainly focusing at optimal usage of resources, or it also includes an additional assessment format based on the stakeholder approach, with specific reference to the organization's performance on the financial, social and ecological bottom line. This paper demonstrates the need and feasibility of an EFQM-Based assessment tool with a combined focus on corporate sustainability and OE.

DE phase-wise development; ECSF; excellence; corporate sustainability
AB This article describes the European Corporate Sustainability Framework (ECSF). This framework addresses complex issues such as Corporate Sustainability, Corporate Responsibility and Corporate Change. It is a conceptual framework based on the tradition of the quality management approach and the concept of phase-wise development. The framework is based on several theories and models, all proven individually over several decades. These theories are the Emergent Cyclical Levels of Existence Theory (ECLET) of Professor Graves, The Four Phase Model(C) (Hardjono), EFQM's Business Excellence Model, Kaplan and Norton's Business Balanced scorecard, the research deliverables of the project "The European Way to Excellence'' and the SqEME(R) methodology. All these models, theories and/or studies belong to the interpretative sociology (Milwax Burell and Morgan, 1992). The aim of the ECSF is to support organizations in their implementation of Corporate Sustainability and Corporate Responsibility (CS-R) by addressing the ambiguity and complexity of these issues.

AB This paper describes a set of ideal type organizations in a developmental sequence. As these descriptions are based on Spiral Dynamics (or Emerging Cyclical Levels of Existence Theory - ECLET), the types are labeled as Order, Success, Community and Synergy. Per type the author elaborated on the underlying value system and relating institutional structures, such as leadership role, governance and measurement format. As a summary, a Transition Matrix is presented which indicate the paradigm shifts per discipline/department, as manifested in the subsequent ideal type organizations. As Order and Success generally describe the majority of corporations in Western Economies, the latter two types introduce new approaches to more innovative - and more sustainable/responsible - ways to doing business. Based on Community Values, the author introduces a new measurement format which is the foundation for a systemic and coherent set of management tools to be used in a stakeholder approach. These tools relate to the strategic, tactical and operational tasks of management and have been developed by researchers of the European Corporate Sustainability Framework (ECSF) consortium. The set includes two tools which are generic: the Strategic Sustainability Scan (Strategy) and the Sustainability Matrix, which is a self-assessment tool (tactics). Three operational tools are context and industry specific: These are the Community related Responsive Business Scorecard (RBS) and Benchmark Format for measuring and monitoring sustainability performance and a methodology - a Management Information System - to generate information on people, planet and profit in order to provide data for the set of key performance indicators.

AB This paper represents the attempt to define a methodology that can evaluate the degree to which companies' information systems correspond to needs determined by the objectives of sustainability the firm imposes on itself. The result is the creation of a general model which define the correct approach to evaluating information systems - a model which should be adapted to the specificity of each single company which intends to adopt it. In the chart indicated, we obviously have not considered activities connected to the implementation of the survey system, which are particular to each company's situation. The first part of the paper consists of an overall introduction to the approach that has been used to assess the (MIS) of Granarolo, one of the Italian companies involved. The case study contains a profile of the company, the analysis of its MIS referred to the three dimensions of sustainability, and an evaluation of the strong points and issues to be developed. This approach to evaluate the gap between desired requirements of an information system for sustainability and current data available in a firm, has proved its consistency and usefulness. It helps to understand where data are, which dimensions, spheres, stakeholders account for and what is the level of integration between different information systems existing in the firm.

DE Responsive Business Scorecard; Corporate Social Responsibility; business
   strategies
AB Several authors have pointed at opportunities to develop the well-established Business Balanced Scorecard into a Scorecard that enables companies to integrate sustainability into their strategy. Recent case studies and research experiences show that social and environmental targets are more widely recognized as strategic drivers for management. However, experiments also show that the traditional Scorecard has its limits when it comes to e.g. stakeholder management and product chain management. The European Corporate Sustainability Framework (ECSF) program distinguishes several ambition levels for Corporate Sustainability/Corporate Responsibility. The traditional Balanced Scorecard is suitable for companies that aim for Compliance-driven CS/CR or for Profit-driven CS/CR, where the financial bottom line is the ultimate indicator for success. More ambitious companies want to balance economic, social and ecological targets in a Community-driven CS/SR or Synergy-driven CS/CR. For ambitious companies, we propose a format of a Responsive Business Scorecard (RBS). The Responsive Scorecard enables companies to score at Profit, People and Planet, at the same time to integrate stakeholder demands into internal programs to improve performance. The RBS includes five Perspectives: Customers & Suppliers, Financiers & Owners, Society & Planet, Internal Process and Employees & Learning. We assessed the practical feasibility of a Responsive Scorecard in food and tourist industries. In the food industry, we analyzed whether existing business priorities of Italian companies can adequately fill a Responsive scorecard. Our conclusion is that traditional topics like finance, customers and employees are readily filled, but that sustainability topics like chain management (suppliers) and environmental performance (planet) need further elaboration. The tourist sector is dominated by Small and Medium Sized Enterprises. We investigated whether existing eco-labels for camping-sites and marinas can be developed into Responsive Scorecards. Our conclusion is that such a sector specific development of a Responsive Scorecard is possible. Further research has to show what is the value added of the new scorecard for companies in the tourist sector.

AB This paper investigates the state of the art with respect to sustainability reporting, its linkages with the corporations, internal measurement and monitoring systems and their combined impact on the quality of contemporary sustainability benchmarks, developed by SRI analysts and so-called rating and screening agencies. This research originated from the EU-funded research initiative to create a new generation management framework for corporate sustainability and responsibility (CS-R). The aim of it is to develop a coherent set of assessment -, measurement - and monitoring tools. The sustainability benchmark tool should align the interests of corporations implementing CS-R and various organizations supporting SRI, such as fund managers, analysts and screening agencies. This paper show the essentials features of an actual sustainability benchmark which is currently under construction. This approach will have significance impact on the further development of SRI and CS-R practices, as well as support the development of sustainability reporting standards.

AB This article gives a practice-based and theoretical overview of the transformation from a traditional hierarchical organization in the care and cure sector towards a so-called Community-driven organization providing human happiness to 6000 elderly people. The actual case study is intertwined with conceptual information for better understanding of the innovative transition which took place at Humanitas. The case description includes its initial situation, its new core values, mission and objectives and shows the sequence of emerging policies and interventions that resulted in a stakeholder oriented business model for the care sector. The selected concepts are Graves' Emerging Cyclical Level of Existence Theory (or Spiral Dynamics), Ken Wilber's Four Quadrant Model, Roberts Simons' Four Levers of Control and various elements from the European Corporate Sustainability Framework sponsored by the European Commission. The conclusion marks the match between theory and practice in transforming Humanitas Rotterdam into providing cure, care, housing and well-being to elderly people.

AB Should CSR be approached only on a voluntary basis or should it be complemented with a compulsory regulatory framework? What type of government intervention is more effective in fostering CSR among companies? This paper is an attempt to answer these questions, reviewing the debate between proponents of the voluntary case and the obligatory case for CSR, and critically analysing current international government-led initiatives to foster CSR among companies, and national government-led initiatives in the EU area. Finally, the paper focuses on the Spanish case, as an example of the failure of an exclusively voluntary approach. Despite the rapid uprise of CSR, Spain is still far behind late in CSR promotion strategies. Most action has been undertaken by companies themselves with no common guidelines, governmental support, or independent verification. The lack of a regulatory framework for CSR or ethical investment issues and the virtual absence of other indirect incentives, explains the misbalance between private, public and Third Sector initiatives. Based on the Spanish context which is quite similar to other non-OECD countries, the authors call for a more proactive government position in CSR related issues. The conclusions of the paper detail the features of this regulatory framework and other policies to promote CSR in Spain as well as in other OECD countries.

AB Environmental indicators can be used as a first stage in progress towards comprehensive environmental impact measures [J. Environ. Manage 65/3 (2002) 285]. In this article, we develop a 'pollutant interaction matrix method' that allows calculation of a global environmental protection index (E-p) in order to verify the eco-compatibility of an industrial activity. Two methods are proposed for the E-p index evaluation (which represents the numerical measure of the environmental sustainability): the Direct Method (E-Pd) and the Weighted Method (E-Pw).
   Both methods need to define, in the whole industrial process, homogeneous sectors (defined as construction sites where activities of the same type are carried out). Furthermore, for each activity a set of parameters (t, duration of pollution effect, P, quantity of pollutant produced, G, hazard of the pollutant) are required to evaluate the relative pollution index Y. All indices calculations were carried out using a set of matrices. The correct use of E-p evaluation provides an improvement in the total environmental performance of companies because it points out possible critical operations in each homogeneous sector which require solutions.
   The methodology is applied to evaluate the environmental pollution risk of a company that produces polymer materials and to improve their environmental performance. The results obtained show that the whole productive process has a low environmental impact factor. Nevertheless the applied methodology puts in evidence some processes that generate local pollution in specific areas of the factory and which could be dangerous for the workers' health.

AB Eco-efficiency has emerged as a management response to waste issues associated with current production processes. Despite the popularity of the term in both business and government circles, limited attention has been paid to measuring and reporting eco-efficiency to government policy makers. Aggregate measures of eco-efficiency are needed, to complement existing measures and to help highlight important patterns in eco-efficiency data.
   This paper aims to develop aggregate measures of eco-efficiency for use by policy makers. Specifically, this paper provides a unique analysis by applying principal components analysis (PCA) to eco-efficiency indicators in New Zealand.
   The study reveals that New Zealand's overall eco-efficiency improved for two out of the five aggregate measures over the period 1994/1995-1997/1998. The worsening of the other aggregate measures reflects, among other things, the relatively poor performance of the primary production and related processing sectors. These results show PCA is an effective approach for aggregating eco-efficiency indicators and assisting decision makers by reducing redundancy in an eco-efficiency indicators matrix.

AB Formulation of effective sustainability indicators for national assessment demands a comprehensive understanding of the utilisation, diffusion and dissemination of information in policy processes. To illustrate the dynamic of sustainability assessment within the context of policy processes, this paper uses a case study of national sustainability indicators development in Malaysia. Subsequently, this paper ascribes the limited achievement of national sustainability assessment in Malaysia to four types of constraints: meta-policy issues; technical capacities; communication concerns; and the inherent knowledge gaps within the indicator developer community vis-a-vis their theoretical limitations. It is proposed that such constraints will be encountered in many countries. Drawing from the literature on public policy, this paper outlines a framework for investigating indicator behaviour within policy processes based on well-established concepts such as knowledge utilisation and policy learning. I conclude this paper by elaborating on the corresponding future challenges that must be addressed before effective integration of sustainability indicators within policy systems can occur.

AB If world development is to continue, mid-century energy requirements are daunting. For world development, per capita energy use in the developing world must be brought up to levels in the already developed world. Restrictions on how much CO2 mankind can responsibly put into the atmosphere may complicate the task further. Studies show that by 2050 the world will require an additional 10-30 terawatts (TW) of carbon free power, at least as much additional, as the 10 TW generated today with fossil fuel. This paper suggests that the fusion hybrid is one of rather few possibilities for generating this power economically, in an environmentally acceptable way, and with little proliferation danger.

   fibroblasts against virus-induced apoptosis and are required for

AB Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) strain AD169 mutants carrying transposon insertions or large deletions in UL37 exon 1 (UL37x1) were recovered from modified bacterial artificial chromosomes by reconstitution in human fibroblasts expressing the adenovirus anti-apoptotic protein E1B19K. UL37x1 mutant growth was severely compromised in normal fibroblasts, with minimal release of infectious progeny. Growth in E1B19K-expressing cells was restored, but did not reach wild-type levels. Normal fibroblasts infected by UL37x1 mutants underwent apoptosis spontaneously between 48 and 96 h after infection. Apoptosis was inhibited by treatment of cells with the broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor z-Val-Ala-Asp(OMe)-fluoromethylketone, resulting in substantially increased release of virus. Inhibition of viral DNA replication by phosphonoformate or ganciclovir also inhibited apoptosis, implying that death was triggered by late viral functions or by replication and packaging of the viral genome. Immunofluorescent staining showed that although viral proteins accumulated normally during delayed-early phase and viral DNA replication compartments formed, viral late proteins were detected only rarely, suggesting that spontaneous apoptosis occurs early in late phase. These results demonstrate that anti-apoptotic proteins encoded by HCMV UL37x1 [pUL37x1 (vMIA), gpUL37 and gpUL37(M)] prevent apoptosis that would otherwise be initiated by the replication programme of the virus and are required for efficient and sustainable virus replication.

AB Near-natural stormwater infiltration can cause rising groundwater tables in urban areas. In order to assess these effects, the area-differentiated groundwater recharge in a real investigation area in Germany and their effects on the groundwater table are modelled using three different computer programs. The first program determines the natural area-differentiated groundwater recharge for the whole study area without considering the infiltration facilities. The second program is used to localise infiltration processes and it calculates the groundwater recharge below the infiltration facilities. The groundwater recharge rates calculated with these two programs are incorporated in the numerical groundwater model. It is used to simulate the groundwater surface level development. By varying the size of additional development areas, the degree of sealing, the infiltration rate and the precipitation different simulation scenarios were conducted. It was found that both the precipitation and the infiltration rate are the most influencing factors concerning the groundwater surface. Further, problems have to be expected especially in areas with low hydraulic conductivities. To ensure sustainable depths to groundwater table calculating the water budget can be recommended, as to name just one of the recommendations presented in this paper. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

AB Chemical technology has contributed tremendously to the development of affluent human life by providing various kinds of useful materials. Although there have been several adverse effects, the positive effects were dominant. As for the future, we are confident that chemical technology will continue to play key roles, but we can not foresee similar expansion as in the past, because of the limited supply of resources and the intolerable environmental disruption. The influences of science and technology might have grown beyond our controllability. We now need new innovative chemical technology which supplies to the society various materials with super high performance and, at the same time, friendly to the society and the environment.

AB A Geographical Information System (GIS) was developed to integrate data on the distribution of biodiversity, environmental factors governing distributions, human activities such as fishing and Marine Protected Area (MPA) planning. The GIS was established because there is a paucity of collated information on the marine resources of Rodrigues, western Indian Ocean, hampering marine environmental protection. The GIS was established in MapInfo software using a Landsat satellite image as a base layer. Field surveys were undertaken at 183 sites throughout the lagoon and reefs to ground-truth the satellite image. A hierarchical biotope classification was developed and 42 biotopes were described within four habitat groups (Coral, Sand and rubble with mixed vegetation, Lagoon muds, and Consolidated limestone), and used to create a biotope map layer. A relational database was linked to the GIS to store and display site-based data, including biotope descriptions and photographs, species lists and illustrations, and environmental data. GIS output is exemplified by thematic maps illustrating species richness and habitat at sites, percentage cover of benthic life forms, data collection sites and depths, and number of octopus and potential octopus refugia. The GIS was also used to identify the biotopes protected by proposed Marine Protected Areas, illustrating that some existing MPAs may be ineffective and proposed boundaries could protect more than 30% of the shallow marine environment of Rodrigues. The GIS provides a useful tool to establish the conservation and sustainable use of the island's marine resources, and the highly visual and interactive system should prove valuable for education and public awareness purposes.

AB Two experiments were conducted in north-central Florida to examine the effects of various winter cover crops on plant-parasitic nematode populations through time. In the first experiment, six winter cover crops were rotated with summer corn (Zea mays), arranged in a randomized complete block design. The cover crops evaluated were wheat (Triticum aestivum), rye (Secale cereale), oat (Avena saliva), lupine (Lupinus angustifolius), hairy vetch (Viein villosa), and crimson clover (Trifolium incarnatum). At the end of the corn crop in year 1, population densities of Meloidogyne incognita were lowest on corn following rye or oat (P <= 0.05), but no treatment differences were observed in year 2. Wheat was a good host to Paratrichodorous minor, whereas vetch was a poor host., but numbers of P. minor were not lower in vetch-planted plots after corn was grown. The second experiment used a split-plot design in which rye or lupine was planted into field plots with histories of five tropical cover crops; soybean (Glycine max), cowpea (Vigna unguiculata), sorghum-sudangrass (Sorghum bicolor x S. sudanense), sunn hemp (Crotalaria juncea), and corn. Population densities of M. incognita and Helicotylenchus dihystera were affected by previous tropical cover crops (P <= 0.05) but not by the winter cover crops present at the time of sampling. Plots planted to sunn hemp in the fall maintained the lowest M. incognita and H. dihystera numbers. Results suggest that winter cover crops tested did not suppress plant-parasitic nematodes effectively. Planting tropical cover crops such as sunn hemp after corn in a triple-cropping system with winter cover crops may provide more versatile nematode management strategies in northern Florida.

ID TYRANNY
AB Recently, a number of "green" developments have been built. Green developments will reach their potential only if residents understand the design, support the goals, and act as responsible land managers. However, studies by psychologists, anthropologists, environmental educators, and economists show that even knowledgeable, well-intentioned people frequently fail to adopt proenvironmental behaviors. This article identifies three categories of potential barriers to better individual land management: barriers to recognizing environmental problems, internal barriers to action, and external barriers to action. Two case studies show that unless barriers are addressed through education or design, individuals probably will not adopt more ecologically sensitive practices. Both cases are in the tallgrass prairie ecoregion.

TI New urbanism as sustainable growth? A supply side story and its
   implications for public policy
SO JOURNAL OF PLANNING EDUCATION AND RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
DE New Urbanism; sustainable growth; public policy; infill development
ID COMMUNITY; SPRAWL
AB New Urbanism is being promoted as a set of ideas to mitigate sprawl, to encourage sustainable growth, and to facilitate infill development. In this article, the author focuses on the supply side story of New Urbanism to examine its implications for public policy. Specifically, tire author evaluates where designers, developers, and planners involved with New Urbanist projects differ (or concur) in their endorsement of New Urbanist principles and in their satisfaction with the implementation of these ideas. Research reveals that in general, these designers, developers, and planners are endorsing New Urbanist ideas as a tool for achieving sustainable growth. The study shows that New Urbanist principles that focus on neighborhood design are most likely to be promoted and are expected to influence public policy, while principles that focus on regional planning may not generate enough support and are least likely to be implemented. The article concludes with policy recommendations.

TI Energy consumption and economic growth in Korea: testing the causality
   relation
SO JOURNAL OF POLICY MODELING
LA English
DT Article
DE energy; GDP; Granger causality; Korea
ID ERROR-CORRECTION; REAL INCOME; COINTEGRATION RANK; TEMPORAL CAUSALITY;
   PRICES; GDP
AB The causal relationship between energy consumption and economic growth is investigated applying two multivariate time series models: a demand side model of energy, GDP and real energy price and a production side model of GDP, energy, capital, and labor. To test for Granger causality in the presence of cointegration among the variables, we employ a VECM rather than a VAR model. Empirical results from the two models for Korea over the period 1981:1-2000:4 suggest no causality between energy and GDP in the short run and a unidirectional causal relationship running from GDP to energy in the long run. It implies an energy conservation policy may be feasible without compromising economic growth in the long run. It also implies that a sustainable development strategy may be feasible with lower level of CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion. (C) 2004 Society for Policy Modeling. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Direct and non-intrusive observations of crystallization and melting behavior of alpha and beta polymorphs in bulk syndiotactic polystyrene were made by means of temperature-programmed x-ray diffraction. Results indicated that the highest sustainable temperature identifiable via wide-angle x-ray diffraction using stepwise annealing at increasingly higher temperatures (T-a) for the perfected (with the initial crystallization temperature T-c=245 degreesC, followed by annealing at stepwise increased T-a above 250 degreesC) alpha" phase may be at least 286 degreesC. In a similar manner, the highest sustainable temperature of the perfected (with T-c= 265 degreesC, followed by annealing at stepwise increased T-a above 275 degreesC) beta' phase may be at least 280degreesC. These observations suggest complete melting should occur only above the respective sustainable temperatures. It thus follows that equilibrium melting of the alpha and the beta phases should occur at temperatures higher than 286 and 280degreesC, respectively. Perfection of the less ordered alpha' form into the better ordered alpha" form within the alpha family is observed to occur in the vicinity of 270 degreesC; no evidence of transformation between alpha and beta phases is identified.

DE alternative development policies; neoliberal policy; Washington

ID ECONOMIC-GROWTH; POLICY
AB This paper summarizes our new book, Reclaiming Development: An Alternative Economic Policy Manual (Chang and Grabel, 2004). It begins from the premise that the view that there is no alternative to neoliberal economic policies in developing countries is fundamentally and dangerously incorrect. The "no alternative" dictum has commonly been associated with popularizations (and arguably, misinterpretations) of Williamson's original statement of the "Washington Consensus." We demonstrate that feasible alternatives to neoliberal policies exist that can promote rapid economic development that is equitable, stable, and sustainable. Some of these are proposals for strategies not yet adopted. But many others have already proven their worth in practice across the globe. We offer them in order to shatter the idea that there is no alternative, and to contribute to the vigorous campaign now underway across the globe to "reclaim development" from the neoliberal orthodoxy.

AB This study investigates the applicability of methods used to describe patterns of distribution, and estimates of density and biomass of the Pacific geoduck clam, Panopea abrupta, from western North America for populations of the New Zealand geoduck, Panopea zelandica in Kennedy Bay, on the Coromandel Peninsula, and in Wellington Harbour. Central to this is the use of line transect surveys and estimations of the detection rate of geoduck (show-factor) using counts of siphon holes. Studies were restricted to less than 17 m water depth. Geoduck in Kennedy Bay were found from 4-8 m water depth, whereas geoduck in Wellington Harbour occurred in several separate beds from 4-16 m. In Wellington Harbour, there was a pattern of increasing numbers with depth up to similar to15 m. Numbers seemed to decrease thereafter. Analysis of sediment samples indicated that P. zelandica was more prevalent in fine sand to fine silty sand substrates. A abrupta is found in similar habitats. There was no significant difference in the show-factor (the proportion of geoduck detectable by sight or touch vs. the actual number of geoduck present) of geoduck with respect to season (summer and winter), region (Wellington Harbour and Kennedy Bay), or tidal height (low, mid, and high tide). Hence, a mean show-factor of 0.914 was used to adjust density estimates from all surveyed populations. Estimates of the mean population density (+/-SE) of P. zelandica were much lower than those reported for P. abrupta ranging from 0.058 (+/-0.01) geoduck/m(2) in Kennedy Bay to 0.489 (+/-0.08) geoduck/m(2) in Shelly Bay, Wellington Harbour. Survey densities, abundance, and biomass estimates were reasonably well determined with coefficients of variation (CVs) generally less than 20%. The results suggest that the methods used to provide population estimates for P. abrupta are readily transferable to A zelandica. However, further research needs to be conducted on the diver variability on counts of geoduck, the role that geoduck occurring in water depths >17 m play in the population dynamics of local populations, and the density dependence of fertilization success of P. zelandica. Given the low estimates of density in this study, fisheries managers will have to carefully consider the feasibility of sustainably harvesting this species.

AB One mechanism to enhance oyster production is the timely transplant of oysters from nursery beds to beds used for commercial harvesting. Transplanting in Delaware Bay is normally done with a traditional oyster dredge. Such dredges can concentrate market-size oysters, a desirable characteristic for some transplant goals. Unfortunately, catch rates are slow. The suction dredge is much faster, but suction dredges likely do not concentrate large oysters and, by removing most surficial material, may reduce bottom shell coverage and decrease bottom complexity. We investigated the relative benefits of using a traditional oyster dredge and a suction dredge in a transplant program. In this study, traditional oyster dredges used for transplant operations had dredge efficiencies of approximately 5%, about 100 bushels of material being loaded per hectare swept. The tendency for the dredge to catch larger particles preferentially was negated by the tendency to operate the dredge at below-optimal efficiencies. Nevertheless, deck loads contained a factor of 2 to 3 more oysters per bushel than present on the bottom. The suction dredge operated very differently, although deck loads contained 1 to 3 times as many oysters as were present on the bottom. Catch efficiencies were high, between 19% and 58%. Swept area per bushel loaded was much lower, about 600 bushels being loaded per hectare swept. Catch efficiencies were highest for small particles. Dredge efficiency rose markedly after transplanting, from 6% to 28% on the plots worked by the traditional oyster dredge and from 11% to 56% on the plots worked by the suction dredge. Nevertheless, neither method proved deleterious to bottom complexity, cultch availability, oyster growth and mortality, or population health. In a sustainable transplant, the number of small oysters and amount of cultch moved should be minimized. This goal was not achieved. The suction dredge, by selective removal of smaller particles enriched in juveniles and cultch, risks a long-term decline in live oyster abundance and shell coverage. The traditional oyster dredge has the inherent capability of concentrating larger animals, but, as used in the transplant process, much of the selective advantage disappears. A behavioral shift to exploit the desirable selective advantage of the traditional oyster dredge may improve the efficiency of the transplant program.

AB Remarkable progress has been made in recent years in abalone cultivation in China. Beginning in the early 1980s, commercial scale mariculture of abalone has involved 2 species: Pacific abalone, Haliotis discus hannai Ino and the small tropical abalone, H. diversicolor Reeve. Intensive culture of H. d. hannai is distributed mainly in the northern China region, Liaoning and Shandong Provinces with an annual production increasing from about 47 nit (1992) to 4500 nit (2003). The small tropical abalone is the dominant species with a total production of H. diversicolor reaching 3878 mt produced in 2001 in Fujian. Guangdong and Hainan Provinces. Seeds for cultivation are exclusively produced from hatcheries with well-developed technology. Cultivation practices may vary widely among different sea types. Three major forms of grow-out are used in abalone cultivation, land-based tanks, suspended longline cages and intertidal ponds. Abnormal mortality has threatened sustainable development of the abalone industry from its inception. During 1992 to 1996, many facilities in the north ran at a loss due to mass mortality occurring in juveniles and seeds. Mortality usually occurred in the postsettlement nursery phase when spat remain on settlement plates, characterized by cease of dietary intake and falling from the substratum. The cause of this large-scale mortality remains as yet unknown. The same Situation occurred in Fujian front 1996, after 2 y of large-scale farming, and has already spread to all other provinces of abalone mariculture. Genetic improvement of abalone has drawn much attention. Hybridization between different populations from Japan and China has been achieved to obtain significant heterosis with growth and survival. Preliminary results on H. d. hannai have shown that survival of selective strains is significantly higher than normal controls.

AB The ormer (Haliotis tuberculata) occurs from the Senegal coast in the south to the Cotentin peninsula of France in the north. Commercial fisheries currently operate in France and Spain. The French abalone fishery was opened in 1994. Abalone catches are regulated by a permit and quota system. Total Allowable Catch (TAC) was determined by two initial stock assessments carried Out locally in the vicinity of St Malo, Central-North Brittany, and Morlaix, North-West Brittany, in the 1980s. Quotas have since been revised, according to decisions of local fishing committees, without information on the stock situation or independent assessments since the opening of the fishery. In 1996 to 1997, a severe bacterial disease devastated the stock of the main fishing grounds in St Malo and many other places around Brittany. Mass mortalities were correlated with high sea surface temperatures. The stocks have only partially recovered since then, and the total catch has been significantly reduced from about 80 tons to 60 tons per year, resulting ill catches significantly lower than the TAC currently implemented. There are no reliable catch per unit effort data available. The absence of a strong enforcement policy, evidence of poaching, and strong activity of the local black market constitute a Situation where there is a significant threat to the stocks and sustainability of the fishery. In Spain, the fishery was reopened in 2002, after 10 y of inactivity related to PSP toxins found during imports into the Japanese market. It was closed again, soon after reopening ill 2002, because of a major oil spill on the Northern coasts. An abalone aquaculture industry is developing around Europe, mainly in Ireland where H. discus hannai and H. tuberculata have been imported and acclimatized. There are prospective aquaculture developments in France, England, Spain, and Scotland.

AB Understanding density dependent processes in abalone is important for sustainable management of fisheries, and optimum aquaculture production. Density and food were manipulated to test their interacting effects on the growth and survival of hatchery produced postlarval Haliotis rubra. Feeding and dispersive behavior was also examined. Initial densities ranged between the densities used in aquaculture and those reported in the natural environment. Higher initial density increased the mortality rates of postlarvae in two experiments. Simultaneous manipulation of diatom food supply and density showed that the effect of density on mortality was mostly independent of food. Growth was strongly related to food supply, but also significantly reduced by high initial density, and these effects were additive. When diatom density was low, postlarvae did not increase rasping rates so the effect was that food was consumed more slowly. This explains the strong effect of food supply on growth. No aggressive interactions between feeding postlarvae were observed, but they graze intensively, leaving small distinct patches that have been cleared of algal food. Postlarvae encountering patches without food move rapidly and apparently randomly in search of food. The dispersal rate of postlarvae increased with density, presumably because post larvae spent more time searching for food. This searching is likely to be energetically expensive. and would increase at high densities because more cleared patches are created. This may explain why high initial densities of postlarvae had persistent reduced growth even when food was abundant, but does not explain the increased mortality at high density irrespective of food supply. We hypothesize that this effect may be attributable to other factors, such as the increased transmission of a pathogen at high density.

AB Sustainable development and livable communities represent the big visionary ideas of contemporary urban planning. But attempts to implement these popular visions can encounter a host of conflicts. The future of land use planning may well depend on how it copes with these conflicts. I propose the sustainability/livability prism as a tool to understand and express the conflicts, and I illustrate the prism's usefulness through an application to plans in the Denver area.

AB This paper describes a study that investigates the local and regional effects of vegetation restoration in northern China via regional climate model simulations, and reports implications for the sustainability of vegetation under the altered rainfall regime. Ensemble simulations with the current vegetation cover and an idealized re-greening scenario for a test area in northwestern China (90degrees-110degrees E and 36degrees-42degrees N) were performed using large scale boundary forcing derived from 1998. The results indicate that such re-greening has both significant local and regional effects on the atmospheric circulation and rainfall distribution.
   Replacing desert and semi-desert areas with grass in the test area increases net radiation at the surface, and hence total heat flux from the surface to the atmosphere. This results in enhanced ascending motions and moisture supply to the atmosphere over the test area. Consequently, rainfall increases in the whole test area. However, the increase in rainfall largely occurs due to an increase in intensity rather than an increase in frequency. Lack of frequent rainfall, especially in the lowlands of the test area, makes it very difficult to maintain a vegetated surface. This implies that the current vegetation restoration activities will be largely limited to areas where water resources are relatively abundant, or they will depend heavily on irrigation. The increased runoff at higher elevations could be important for providing water for irrigation in the lowlands. The increase in rainfall in the highlands and far eastern parts of the test area, which already receive more frequent rainfall, may help support a restored vegetation cover in these regions.
   The enhanced ascending motions over the test area are compensated by increased subsidence to the east, centered over Yellow River Delta and Shandong Peninsula, resulting in a higher-pressure and anticyclonic circulation anomaly there. Consequently, rainfall decreases at these areas. This anticyclonic anomaly provides significant northeasterly low-level anomalous winds that enhance cyclonic shear vorticity in the Yangtze River Basin and South China when they meet southwesterly monsoonal flow. This causes strong ascending anomalies over southern China and the Sichuan Basin, and increases rainfall in these regions.

AB The efficacy of a local Thai-strain of the copepod, Mesocyclops thermocyclopoides and the larvicide, Bacillus thuringiensis var. israelensis (Bti), used jointly and singly, was studied against Aedes aegypti in water containers. In a laboratory test, copepods alone produced mortality of 98-100% in 1(st) instar larvae of Ae. aegypti at copepod:larvae ratios ranging from 1:1 to 1:4. In ail Outdoor field simulated experiment that ran for 16 wk, after a single inoculation, the treatment of copepods and Bti combined yielded the better, more sustainable results than the agents used individually. Numbers of mosquito larvae per sample in the combined treatment were zero during the first 8 wk; larval numbers then increased but were maintained at a very low level for the next 4 wk after which the larval numbers increased moderately but still remained below numbers in the control. Bti alone kept the larvae at the zero level for the first 4 wk after which their numbers increased slightly and were at low levels up to 12 wk. Copepods alone maintained larval numbers at a low level as compared with those of the control. During the course of the experiment the larval numbers in the control were greater than 20 per sample. Statistically significant differences were noted among treatment means (F = 23.083, df = 3/60, P<0.01) over the total period of the study. The number of copepods in the joint treatment was significantly higher than in the copepod alone treatment for the first 8 wk (t = -4.97, df = 14, P<0.01). The density of copepods, however, for the whole 16-wk period was not significantly different in these two treatments (t=-1.51. df = 30, P>0.1).

AB Large demographic shifts will have many effects on the quest for sustainable use of the planet. Using Garrett Hardin's simile, which portrays Earth as a lifeboat, achieving sustainability requires a dispassionate, objective appraisal of the rate at which additional people can be taken aboard without sinking the lifeboat. However, the world population increase is not uniform among countries, and the growing rate of international migration from countries that have a high fertility rate to countries with a more equable rate is spreading the ecological threat contingent on over-population to all habitable regions of the globe.

AB Sustainable product development of an automotive structure requires a balanced approach towards technological, economical and ecological aspects. Current paper shows the application of a structural optimization system to the optimal choice of foams as a core material for sandwiches with aluminum alloy faces, for the use as floor panels in the bottom structure of a concept car. The minimization problem for the weight of the entire bottom structure under static load conditions, including stiffness, strength and buckling constraints, is formulated and solved for each material application. In addition to optimal (minimized) mass and materials' price used for selection of foams, the assessment of an environmental impact of materials-candidates during the entire life cycle of the structure is considered.

AB The present paper deals with the application of several chemometrical methods (cluster and principal components analysis, Source apportioning on absolute principal components scores) to an aerosol data collection from Unterloibach, Austria. It is shown that seven latent factors explaining almost 80% of the total variance are responsible for the data structure and are conditionally identified as "secondary aerosol", "mineral dust", "oil burning", "lead smelter", "coal burning", "salt" and "fertilizer" emission sources. Furthermore, the contribution of each identified source to the formation of the particle total mass and chemical compounds total concentration is calculated. Thus, a reliable assessment of the air quality in the region is performed. The requirements of the sustainability concept for ecological indicators in this case is easily transformed into a multivariate statistical problem taking into account not separate indicators but the specific multivariate nature of aerosol pollution.

   SIMULATIONS
AB We examine the possibility that hyper-accretion on to newly born black holes occurs in highly intermittent, non-asymmetric fashion favourable to gravitational-wave emission in a neutrino-cooled disc. This picture of near-hole accretion is motivated by magnetorotationally induced, ultrarelativistic disc dynamics in the region of the flow bounded from below by the marginally bound geodesic radius r(mb). For high spin values, a largely coherent magnetic field in this region has the dynamical implication of compact mass segregation at the displacement nodes of the non-axisymmetric, magnetorotational instability modes. When neutrino stress competes favourably for the disc dynamical structure, the matter clumps may be rather dense and sufficiently long-lived to excite the quasi-normal ringing (QNR) modes of the Kerr geometry upon infall. We find that this accretion flow may drive bar-like, quadrupole (l, m = 2, 2) modes in nearly resonant fashion for spin parameters a greater than or equal to0.9. The ensuing build-up in strain amplitude of the undamped oscillations warrants a brisk rate of energy deposition into gravitational waves. A detectability assessment for the LIGO interferometers through the match filtering technique is given by integrating the energy flux over a one-second epoch of resonant hyper-accretion at 1 M-circle dot s(-1). Thus, a 15-M-circle dot Kerr black hole spinning at a similar or equal to 0.98 (f (QNR) similar or equal to 1677 Hz), and located at 27 Mpc (e.g. GRB 980425), will deliver a characteristic strain amplitude, h(char) similar or equal to 2.2(-21), large enough to be detectable by LIGO II. If resonant hyper-accretion were sustainable for a longer period (or at higher rates) possibly associated with a second broad hump in a gamma-ray burst light curve, these objects could be detected by LIGO I at very low redshifts.

TI So much conflict, yet so much in common: Considering the similarities
   between western water law and the Endangered Species Act
SO NATURAL RESOURCES JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
ID PROTECTION; TAKINGS
AB The West has recently experienced major clashes over its scarce water supplies, with traditional water users on one side and endangered species on the other. These clashes, including those in the Klamath and Middle Rio Grande basins, have pitted western state water laws based on prior appropriation against the federal Endangered Species Act (ESA). One could easily mistake these laws for polar opposites, but, in fact, western water law and the ESA share a number of important and ironic similarities. This article identifies some of the similarities that arise from the basic provisions of the laws and from the way they are implemented. Despite these important similarities, however, recent efforts to reform the laws have been notably one-sided, focusing almost entirely on the ESA. The article concludes that the West will not achieve a sustainable balance in water use by revising the ESA alone.

AB The Navy has a longstanding commitment to protect the environment while supporting military sustainability, operations, and readiness. While many environmental issues have the potential to affect Navy ships and operations, the Navy has traditionally taken a leadership role, as evidenced by the successful responses to the international bans on the production of ozone-depleting substances (ODSs) and the international bans on the discharge of solid waste at sea. Climate change has received increased political attention and has certainly been at the forefront of public debate. The Navy, through its ongoing initiatives, has been aggressively phasing out systems that use ODSs and has initiated technological development to design more energy efficient ships. These initiatives result in reduced cost, increased readiness, and reduced greenhouse gas emissions.

AB The increased attention to environmentalism in western societies has been accompanied by a rise in ecotourism, i.e. ecologically sensitive travel to remote areas to learn about ecosystems, as well as in cultural tourism, focusing on the people who are a part of ecosystems. Increasingly, the internet has partnered with ecotourism companies to provide information about destinations and facilitate travel arrangements. This study reviews the literature linking ecotourism and sustainable development, as well as prior research showing that cultures have been historically commodified in tourism advertising for developing countries destinations. We examine seven websites advertising ecotourism and cultural tourism and conclude that: (1) advertisements for natural and cultural spaces are not always consistent with the discourse of sustainabihty; and (2) earlier critiques of the commodification of culture in print advertising extend to internet advertising also.

AB There is little information available on the magnitude of nutrient losses to surface water from the two-pond and daily irrigation treatment systems for farm-dairy effluent (FDE). A research site has been established on a mole-pipe drained Tokomaru silt loam at Massey University's No. 4 Dairy Farm (475 cows) to investigate some of these issues. The site consists of four plots (40 x 40 m) that have been instrumented to allow the continuous monitoring of drainage and surface runoff. The research was conducted over three lactation seasons (2000/01-2002/03). Based on data collected at the study farm it was calculated that in the past 1500 kg N yr(-1) and 250 kg P yr(-1) were potentially discharged from the two-pond system directly to a stream. A simulation exercise suggests that approximately 108 kg N yr(-1) and 18 kg P yr(-1) would be lost to surface waters if daily irrigation was practised at the farm. The problems of daily irrigation, particularly those related to surface runoff, were further quantified in an experiment in which a single 25-mm FDE irrigation was applied to a soil near field capacity. Approximately 40% of the applied effluent left the soil profile as mole and pipe drainage and 30% as surface runoff. These losses equated to 12 kg N ha(-1) and 2 kg P ha(-1). To minimise nutrient losses from land application of FDE, a system called "deferred irrigation" was designed. Deferred irrigation involves storing effluent in a two-pond treatment system and then applying it strategically when there is a suitable soil water deficit, i.e., the irrigation volume does not exceed the potential soil-water storage. The evaluation of deferred irrigation over three lactation seasons showed that direct losses of nutrients to surface waters were almost eliminated and resulted in the drainage of only approximately 1% of the total effluent nutrients applied. The successful adoption of the deferred irrigation system would require only the capability to store effluent and model or measure soil moisture status within the active root zone.

SO NJAS-WAGENINGEN JOURNAL OF LIFE SCIENCES

DT Article
DE integrated pest management; farmers' knowledge; interactive research
AB Cotton production constraints in Benin as perceived by farmers were studied from May to July 2003. The knowledge, perceptions and practices of farmers growing cotton under different pest management regimes were analysed. The methods used were open and semi-structured interviews with groups and individuals, as well as participatory exercises (brainstorming, prioritization, and problem analysis). Pest damage, low price of produce, late payment for seed cotton, and increasing input costs were the main production constraints perceived by producers. Regardless of the pest management system practised, most of the farmers adapt the recommendations of the research institute and non-government organizations to their livelihood systems. In general, farmers had a poor understanding of the key concepts underlying alternative pest control systems. Pest damage was considered important and farmers were eager to share their knowledge, perceptions and practices in pest management. The study provides the foundation for the creation of a learning platform; actors will be invited to collaborate in participatory experimental agricultural technology development linked to the farmers' needs. in order to develop sustainable pest management strategies further interactive research is proposed, involving all stakeholders.

ID SPEARGRASS IMPERATA-CYLINDRICA; STRIGA-HERMONTHICA; COVER CROPS;

AB Weeds are an emerging constraint on crop production, as a result of population pressure and more intensive use of cultivated land. A diagnostic study was carried out from June through August 2002 in the five agro-ecological zones of Benin (i) to identify the relative importance of weeds among major production constraints, (2) to better understand farmers' perceptions of weed problems, and (3) to take cognizance of their reactions and the different actors involved in weed management technology development. The study also aimed at suggesting the development of weed management strategies that work and are acceptable under small-scale farmers' conditions. Data were collected through semi-structured and unstructured group and/or individual interviews, and through participant observation, transect studies and weed identification during field visits. The results show considerable diversity in biophysical constraints and socio-economic conditions. Population density has led to high pressure on arable land, resulting in land degradation and weed problems. in all situations, pernicious (Imperata cylindrica, Cyperus spp., Commelina spp.) and parasitic (Striga spp.) weeds are difficult to eradicate, causing substantial food crop yield losses and threatening the livelihood of people. Land and labour shortage, low commodity prices and lack of credit were the main constraints hindering weed management. Causes, effects and consequences were analysed, taking into account the socio-economic context. The study's findings with respect to weed management measures, and their adaptation and constraints in using them, suggest that effective and acceptable weed management strategies should be developed, taking into account both biological and social science perspectives with a focus on adding value to indigenous knowledge. Promising strategies for discovery learning about weed management were identified, in order to foster sustainable crop production in Benin.

   dilemma
ID INDIGENOUS KNOWLEDGE; GHANA
AB The perception of farmers from the Atacora and Save regions of Benin was studied about the causes and consequences of land degradation and corrective actions for sustaining soil fertility. Research methods in this diagnostic study included group discussions, using non-standardized unstructured interviews and participant observations. Farmland degradation leading to declining yields, and land tenure arrangements were identified as the main constraints on the sustain ability of agriculture. In both regions the farmers stated that climatic changes (less and more irregular rainfall), run off, erosion, and overexploitation of farmlands caused land degradation. Soil fertility status was assessed on the basis of dicotyledonous weeds, soil texture and colour, and soil fauna (earthworm casting activity). Farmers have adapted their cropping systems to the local environment by developing traditional and new strategies and activities that could contribute to maintain or enhance crop productivity. These strategies include animal manure, inorganic fertilizer, crop rotation, a five-year fallow, extensive cropping systems with cassava or egusi melon, and emigration. Land tenure arrangements between landlords and migrants affect strategies that can be applied to maintain soil fertility. The importance of building mutual trust and the need to experiment with different land tenure arrangements are indicated. A framework for interactive research where knowledge is collectively generated is proposed in order to test the effectiveness and applicability of some of these local innovations not yet well understood by conventional science.

DE forest inventory; forest sustainability; sampling error; data analysis
AB Forest inventory statistics developed by the USDA Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) units are useful in examining a variety of economic and biological issues, including forest-industry plant location, biological supplies of specific timber species, forest health, and long-term sustainability of timber resources. In general, these statistics accurately represent the resource, especially at the inventory-unit and state levels. However, several issues related to data collection must be understood to prevent spurious conclusions, especially when examining forest change characteristics such as removals, mortality, net growth, or the growth-removal ratio. Because FIA statistics are developed by sampling procedures, they are subject to sampling error. As the size of the forest area under study decreases, the number of observations used to develop FIA statistics decreases. The number of observations used to calculate FIA statistics can be particularly inadequate when examining net growth, removals, mortality, and growth-removal ratios of specific species for geographical areas smaller than inventory units.

AB The predicted increase in world demand for electricity requires that the gift of nuclear energy that has served developed nations must not be wasted. The development of nuclear energy is hampered by the absence of a clear and unequivocal policy regarding the storage and disposal of radioactive waste and is seen by a significant section of the public as a threat to their rights. Public opposition may cause the demise of nuclear electric power in developed nations and proscribe its use in the third world.

TI Plutonium management in the medium term
SO NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
DE plutonium management; MOX mixed-oxide fuel; OECD/NEA
AB For many years various countries with access to commercial reprocessing services have been routinely recycling plutonium as UO2/PuO2 mixed oxide (MOX) fuel in light water reactors (LWRs). This LWR MOX recycle strategy is still widely regarded as an interim step leading to the eventual establishment of sustainable fast reactor fuel cycles. The OECD/NEA Working Party on the Physics of Plutonium Fuels and Innovative Fuel Cycles (WPPR) has recently completed a review of the technical options for plutonium management in what it refers to as the "medium term." For the purpose of the review, the WPPR considers the medium term to cover the period from now up to the point at which fast reactor fuel cycles are established on a commercial scale. The review identified a number of different designs of innovative plutonium fuel assemblies intended to be used in current LWR cores, in LWRs with significantly different moderation properties, as well as in high-temperature gas reactors. The full review report describes these various options and highlights their respective advantages and disadvantages. This paper briefly summarizes the main findings of the review.

SO ORGANIZATION & ENVIRONMENT
LA English

DE sustainable development; ecological embeddedness; cultural change; Cree;
   hydroelectric development; EIA
AB Although there has been a tremendous amount of past and future development in the James Bay region of northern Canada, there has been very little empirical research that examined the impact of economic development on Cree tallymen, who are the senior grassroots managers of this vulnerable ecosystem. This oversight is particularly important because the region is currently facing the possibility of additional large-scale hydroelectric development and there is no existing baseline information on past impacts on Cree tallymen. In addition, tallymen continue to have important cultural significance to the Cree Nation and also broader significance to the field of sustainable management. This article attempts to fill this gap by providing ethnographic research on the impact of past development on Cree tallymen from the perspectives of the tallymen themselves. The author also draws implications for environmental impact assessments in the region and, more broadly, for the future study of ecologically embedded managers such as the Cree tallymen.

AB Poverty has persisted in most African countries due largely to poor agricultural performance. In Nigeria, efforts to improve the agricultural sector have been unsuccessful. About 45% of the population lives below the poverty line. This study was carried out in northern Nigeria to reassess farmer circumstances and suggest new agricultural development strategies. Results show that low input use, high land-use intensity, diseases/pests/weeds, drought and poor institutional development have resulted in low and declining crop/livestock productivity. Agricultural transformations have taken place and farmers have devised both appropriate and damaging coping strategies. The study concludes with recommendations for sustainable agricultural development.

LA English
DT Article
DE sustainable development; sustainability issue; egg-production system;
   laying hen; SWOT analysis
ID AMMONIA EMISSIONS; HOUSING SYSTEMS; QUALITY; AMERICA; CAGES
AB The aim of this paper was to demonstrate how participatory strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats (SWOT) analysis can be used to identify relevant economic, ecological and societal (EES) issues for the assessment of sustainable development. This is illustrated by the case of egg production in the Netherlands. Participatory methods are used to facilitate the exchange of ideas, experiences and knowledge of all relevant stakeholders and to create a basis for implementation of the final results. It can be concluded that the combination of a brainstorming session and SWOT analysis with a heterogeneous group of stakeholders constitutes a useful tool to order and structure these listed aspects and to identify relevant issues for sustainable development. Final selection of EES issues from the SWOT analysis, however, required additional reviewing of the literature and consultation with experts from specific fields. Final EES issues selected in the case study of Dutch egg production include welfare and health, environment, quality, ergonomics, economics, consumer concerns, and knowledge and innovation.

TI Controversial issues - teachers' attitudes and practices in the context
   of citizenship education
SO OXFORD REVIEW OF EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
ID SCIENCE
AB Current conceptions of citizenship favour public involvement in dialogue on controversial issues such as GM food. 'Students with higher levels of civic knowledge are more likely to expect to participate in political and civic activities as adults' (Kerr et al., 2003, p. 4). Young people need to be aware of the nature of controversy and be able to see how arguments are constructed to sway our opinions if they are to be fully scientifically literate. A survey of the literature suggests that the principles and methods relating to the teaching of controversial issues are themselves controversial. This irony is more relevant to teachers now than ever before. In England, the teaching of 'Citizenship' has been compulsory for students aged 11-16 in the state sector since September 2002. As it is currently framed, 'Citizenship' includes education for sustainable development and the teaching of the nature of controversy. This paper explores the issue of teachers' readiness to use controversial issues in the classroom, and reports on research involving focus groups and questionnaires. We suggest that many teachers are under-prepared and feel constrained in their ability to handle this aspect of their work. We conclude by offering a set of foci for developing support materials to help teachers be more effective at teaching controversial issues.

AB The Earth Simulator Research Project started in March 2002 with the primary objective of producing reliable prediction data for global climate change. Within a couple of months after the start of operation, the Earth Simulator achieved an amazing performance of 35.86 Teraflops (about 90% of the peak performance of 40.96 Teraflops) in the Linpack benchmark test and, more surprisingly, 26.58 Teraflops for a typical application program of global atmospheric circulation model (called AFES) with a horizontal resolution of 10km. These facts ensure us that the real contribution of the Earth Simulator be far greater than originally expected. Undoubtedly, the Earth Simulator would work to make a paradigm shift in science, industry, and human thinking, as well as finding the best human's wisdom to keep a sustainable symbiotic relationship with nature.

AB Our objective was to determine whether an asthma education program in schools would have 1) a direct impact on student knowledge and attitudes to asthma and quality of life of the students with asthma, 2) an indirect impact on teacher knowledge and attitudes to asthma and on school policies about asthma, and 3) a sustainable program after the resources to implement the research were withdrawn. Seventeen intervention and 15 control schools participated in a controlled trial. Baseline knowledge and attitudes were measured in year 8 students (ages 13-14 years) and their teachers together with quality of life in the students with asthma. A three-lesson package about asthma was delivered by teachers as part of the Personal Development/Health/ Physical Education (PD/H/PE) curriculum. Follow-up questionnaires were administered to students and staff. Efforts to change school policies were documented. Five years after the intervention, PD/H/PE teachers were contacted to determine whether the program was still operating. Main outcome measures included asthma knowledge, attitudes, and quality of life. Questionnaires were returned by 4,161/4,475 of the year 8 students at baseline and by 3,443 at follow-up. In intervention schools, compared with control schools, students showed improved asthma knowledge (P < 0.0001), improvement in tolerance to asthma (P = 0.02), internal control (P = 0.03), and less tendency to believe in the role of chance in asthma control (P = 0.04). Students from intervention but not control schools showed significant improvements in overall quality of life (P = 0.003 vs. P = 0.82, respectively). Teachers from intervention schools showed significant increases in knowledge compared to control schools (P < 0.0001). Intervention schools were more likely to seek further health education about asthma (P < 0.01). Five years after the 35 schools involved in the development of the materials or the trial had been offered the Living With Asthma package, 25 (71%) were still teaching the program to most or all of their students. Fifty-nine of the 61 (97%) high schools in the Hunter Region now have the program. Management and distribution of the Living With Asthma program have been taken over by the Asthma Foundation of New South Wales. The package has been updated and is being offered to all high schools throughout New South Wales as part of the National Asthma-Friendly Schools Project. In conclusion, a teacher-led asthma education program in secondary school had direct and indirect beneficial outcomes and was sustained at a high level for 5 years in most schools in the Hunter Region, despite minimal ongoing maintenance and support from health workers.

AB Long-term trends of financial markets are considered as a growth phenomenon, with a steady influx of money needed to ensure a sustainable growth. A study is made of the impact of money supply, dividends and interest rates, on the growth of a market. A method to estimate the level of investment of cash into stocks is introduced, thereby eventually also identifying periods when stock markets are likely to have topped. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

AB Wood ash was applied to a forest ecosystem with the aim to recycle nutrients taken from the forest and to mitigate the negative effects of intensive harvesting. After two years, the application of 8.000 kg ha(-1) of wood ash increased soil exchangeable Ca and Mg. Similarly, an increase in Ca and Mg in the Norway spruce fine roots was recorded, leading to significant linear correlations between soil and root Ca and soil and root Mg. In contrast to these macronutrients. the micronutrients Fe and Zn and the toxic element Al decreased in the soil exchangeable fraction with the addition of wood ash, but not in the fine roots. Only Mn decreased in soil and in fine roots leading to a significant linear correlation between soil and root Mn. In soil, as well as in fine roots, strong positive correlations were found between the elements Ca and Mg and between Fe and At. This indicates that the uptake of Mg resembles that of Ca and that of Al that of Fe. With the wood ash application. the pH increased from 3.2 to 4.8. the base saturation from 30% to 86%. the molar basic cations/Al ratio (BC/Al) of the soil solution from 1.5 to 5.5, and the molar Ca/Al ratio of the fine roots from 1.3 to 3.7. Overall, all below-ground indicators of soil acidification responded positively to the wood ash application within two years. Nitrate concentrations increased only slightly in the soil solution at a soil depth of 75-80 cm, and no signs of increased heavy metal concentrations in the soils or in the fine roots were apparent. This suggests that the recycling of wood ash could be an integral pan of sustainable forest management because it closes the nutrient cycle and reverses soil acidification.

AB The term "policy sciences" refers both to a distinctive tradition within the policy movement and to the broader policy movement itself. While the generic use of this term is sure to persist, the community of policy scientists trained in the tradition founded by Harold Lasswell and Myres S. McDougal faces challenges to its sustainability as a distinctive tradition of the policy movement. To motivate open discussion and debate, this essay follows the logic of a problem-oriented analysis, and also includes personal reflections and anecdote, with the following objectives: It suggests that the policy sciences tradition faces challenges to its sustainability because of the simple arithmetic of generational turnover in university faculty. It explores six factors internal and external to the policy sciences community militating against sustainability. The essay then critiques three different roles the policy scientist might play in contemporary academia, and concludes with a discussion of alternatives that might enhance the sustainability of the policy sciences tradition, should sustainability indeed be a desired outcome.

TI Sustainable development as a policy telos: A new approach to political
   problem-solving
SO POLITICAL STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
AB The world seems to be characterized by political pluralization (the emergence of 'polities' other than the nation state) in addition to an already existing state of moral pluralism. This severely complicates political attempts at problem-solving on, for example, a global scale. One of the most stressing potential problems is the coexistence of mutually effacing or contradictory systems of political norms. To tackle such problems, we argue that policy teloi - shared conceptions giving direction to cooperative political ventures (particularly sustainable development) - can be helpful. The conditions of success for policy teloi in the case of environmental sustainability are investigated.

TI Sustainable housing - is it legal?
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF CIVIL ENGINEERS-MUNICIPAL ENGINEER

DT Article
DE legislation; planning & scheduling; sustainable housing
AB Most construction professionals would expect to be conversant with the relevant legislation relating to building and development: the Building Act and its approved documents, the Town and Country Planning Act, the Planning Policy Statements, the Contaminated Land Regime and the Control of Pollution Act probably spring to mind. What about sustainable housing? What legislation should be considered when thinking about housing in the context of its social, environmental and economic aspects? What issues are relevant for housing rather than houses? This paper explores the regulatory framework for sustainable housing in England and Wales, and identifies sources of information. It emerges that sustainable housing may be covered by a complex network of policy aims and guidelines, but there is little that requires housing providers to take sustainability into account unless they wish to obtain funding from bodies such as the Housing Corporation and English Partnerships. The paper does not set out construction legislation or technical standards, but seeks to identify issues of wider sustainability and discusses the issues involved in describing 'sustainable development' in legal terms.

DE drainage & irrigation; environment; floods & floodworks
AB The recent Barker Report on housing supply has identified serious shortages which partly result from slow planning decisions and conservative interpretations of Planning Policy Guidance 3 (PPG3) development rules. Increased and wider stakeholder interests and associated consultation times are also stretching out medium- to large-scale development approval times. Sustainable development design for high-density masterplanning, based on enhanced lifestyle and environmental parameters and which incorporate sustainable drainage systems are proposed, which bring together the apparently contradictory objectives of PPG3 development and PPG25 flood risk regulations.

AB The pressure on planning authorities in Ireland to grant permission for rural housing has led to increasing public dissention, frequently leading to political intervention on behalf of individuals; this in turn has severely undermined county planning strategies. The objective of the rural housing sustainability index is to ensure that better-quality and more sustainable housing is constructed in rural areas, while also minimising the effect of such housing on the rural environment. The index uses 70 criteria or indicators categorised into site, design, construction and social indicators. A score is allocated for each indicator with higher scores allocated for more sustainable actions or options. Threshold scores are set for each category from which the sustainability of the proposed development is determined. This allows planners to more accurately assess the impact of rural development as well as increasing the sustainability of the housing stock. The concept of a trade-off, by allowing more sustainable and sensitive housing in areas where normal housing is inappropriate, is explored.

ID RISK-ASSESSMENT; PRESSURES
AB There are some 35000 km of estuarine and river flood defence embankments in England and Wales with an annual budget of approximately 450 million pounds spent on maintenance and new construction. The effective performance of these embankments during extreme flood events is critical for the provision of sustainable flood defences. However flood embankments can become less effective over a period of time for a number of reasons such as (a) increased frequency of flooding due to climate change, (b) an increase in the required standard of service or other functional requirements and (c) long-term deterioration from the intended condition-as constructed or maintained. The tendency for earth embankments to deteriorate with time is of particular concern because climate change and the increasing rate of occurrence of extreme events are leading to an increase in loading. This paper reviews the geotechnical factors that can affect the performance of fluvial and estuarine flood defence embankments in the short and long term. The review considers the traditional methods used to construct flood embankments compared with modern techniques, the type of local materials used for construction, the range of possible geotechnical factors that can lead to a loss of performance and finally case histories of embankment breaches.

DE tidal current; tidal stream; renewable; sustainable; resource;
   hydrodynamic modelling
AB Tidal energy has been used since Roman times, although the use of tidal currents as a possible industrial energy source is a more modern concept. Unlike wind power, however, there is still no consensus on the most appropriate technology for resource exploitation. Similarities with wind power can cause errors of interpretation, especially when attempting to assess resource potential. The energy availability estimates that have been produced have, until now, only taken account of the apparent current flow speeds before the extraction of energy. As demonstrated in this paper, this may not be appropriate, especially for large energy extraction rates, which alter the underlying hydraulic nature of the flow environment. In a simple hypothetical channel linking two infinite oceans, a maximum extraction of 10 per cent of the apparent raw kinetic flux would appear to be acceptable. The limitations on sea loch type environments may, however, be less restrictive.

DE e-Business; QFD; balanced scorecard; value chain; planning framework
ID QUALITY FUNCTION DEPLOYMENT
AB E-Business represents new avenues for sustainable competitive advantage. Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are now expected to be digital-ready to continue as trading partners for their customers. SMEs require socio-technical skills and organizational skills and know-how to comprehend e-Potentials and transform them into e-Implementation. An e-Business planning framework is proposed here which links both in strategic and operations management by applying quality function deployment (QFD, also known as house of quality). The balanced scorecard (BSC) will be used to provide an organization overview to objectives setting, critical in ensuring e-Initiatives are aligned with organization vision and objectives. The paper presents the pilot stage of this research project, discussing how the proposed planning framework works. Data from a case study are employed, and expert advice was sought to prioritize and rank the system components (the '`whats') and their interrelationships. The paper begins with an introduction to the importance of e-Business to SMEs, and a brief review of the key components of the proposed framework. Next follows a discussion of the case study and how the framework can be applied in this particular situation. The paper concludes with suggestions for proposed future work; the conclusion can also be extended to provide a series of matrices to provide a clear, step-by-step planning framework for SMEs which are planning and implementing e-Business, by converting customer needs into feasible e-Business plans.

AB This paper first displays the global framework for the study of emerging diseases aimed at disease control, sanitary crises avoidance and promotion of sustainable agriculture. Then, the research programmes, stages, methods and tools that are needed for emerging disease study and control are presented. These are either already available, under development or awaiting for research studies. They mainly concern information systems, biomathematics, epidemiological methods and molecular biology markers. Finally, some of the main organisational principles (synergies between health protagonists: veterinarians, herdsmen, researchers, health managers, local authorities) are introduced. These principles have to be satisfied if we want to reach an efficient vigilance towards potentially emerging diseases and to take up the challenge that is facing animal populations and human societies en route for globalisation.

Based on a conceptual framework of industrial ecology (IE), the role of ecomaterials in the tide of sustainable development was determined as a technical operational tool. The discussion about the scope of ecomaterials showed the different standpoints of material science and IE's, which perhaps is the key to the argument about the concept of ecomaterials. Finally, the kernel of ecomaterials was briefly discussed and a generic guideline for ecomaterial design was proposed.

ID CONVERGENCE; LOCATION
AB During the last few years, there has been a significant interest by both academics and policy-makers in the notion of regional competitiveness. Yet, despite the relative popularity of the term, there is a surprisingly lack of consensus about what is meant by the competitiveness of regions and cities. The paper discusses some of the key issues that arise in operationalizing the concept and it focuses on the central relevance of productivity in the debate about regional competitiveness. It then examines the pattern and dynamics of regional productivity across the European Union (EU) including the new Central and East European Enlargement (CEEE) enlargement states, and in particular it addresses the issue of whether, and to what extent, there has been regional convergence in productivity levels over the past two decades. Regional convergence in the EU-15 has been remarkably slow, and while recent regional productivity growth has been rapid in CEEE Member States, suggesting possibilities for catch-up in those countries, it seems to have been accompanied and, indeed, in part achieved by falls in regional employment rates, a combination hardly sustainable in the long run. The persistence of regional disparities in productivity across the EU clearly raises key issues for policy at the very time that intense debate surrounds the scale and allocation of the Structural Funds.

AB Agricultural industrialization, Green Revolution technologies, environmental change and civil conflicts have all been cited as contributing to the erosion of crop biodiversity. An additional factor is change in the characteristics of markets, including distance to market. Proponents of sustainable agriculture claim that one benefit of local food systems is the preservation of crop biodiversity. This paper explores that claim, examining Ohio orchardists' understanding and valuation of apple varieties and relating these to the preservation of biodiversity. Growers provided lists of apple varieties and then performed pilesorts on them. Analysis using multidimensional scaling reveals the underlying dimensions growers use to distinguish those cultivars. Salient characteristics are taste, use and market focus. Demands of the conventional commercial market with regards to transportation, appearance and storage exclude the old varieties. On the other hand, there is a strong congruence between sales in local markets and production of old varieties. Local markets, such as roadside stands and 'pick-your-own' operations, play an important role in the preservation of heirloom varieties of apples.

AB We consider the adoption of biologically integrated agricultural practices from the perspective of farm management style. Adoption decisions for farming practices must fit into a broader farm decision-making context that incorporates economic. environmental, social. family and personal considerations. as well as use of agricultural information sources. Drawing from a study of California almond and winegrape growers, we demonstrate that management styles differ substantially among farmers, these differences affect use of information sources and adoption of biologically based practices on the farm, and such adoption does not negatively affect crop performance. We used Q-methodology, a method for eliciting qualitative data using a variant of factor analysis. to identify three distinct management styles among a purposive sample, of 410 growers. The Environmental Stewards' management style places higher priority on conservation of natural resources than on getting the highest possible yields or profits. Production Maximizers, with a different style, prioritize more traditional goals of producing the highest possible yields and quality and focusing resources on the farm rather than on outside concerns. Networking Entrepreneurs, on the other hand. value learning about innovative techniques in social contexts such as informational field days. evaluate new information with a business-like attitude and enjoy off-farm interests. A two-season mail survey of farming practices and information sources demonstrated that differences in management styles affect the adoption of practices. Environmental Stewards were more likely to practice biological pest control and encourage wildlife and less likely to use the most toxic chemicals. Production Maximizers had a greater tendency to use prophylactic and broad-spectrum chemicals, while Networking Entrepreneurs preferred more innovative biological pest controls but tended to avoid time-consuming cultural practices. Production Maximizers were distinguished by less use of more social forms of communication. such as attending field days and talking with other growers. Crop health and quality indicators showed that almost all growers were managing their crops very successfully. regardless of management style or choice of practices. These results hold important implications for efforts to increase the adoption of sustainable agriculture. especially by showing that contents and methods of outreach efforts must vary to accommodate diverse farm management styles.

ID NORTHAMPTONSHIRE
AB Waste minimisation clubs (WMCs) have been a major focus within the UK for the importation of sustainable waste management into, mainly, industry and commerce. Waste Strategy 2000-waste strategy for England and Wales-lays out the context for club contribution to national strategy. Waste production can be seen as a result of inefficiencies in production and management processes and this happens in many companies because of a knowledge gap. The role of Envirowise-UK Best Practice programme, specialising in clean technology and waste minimisation-is highlighted as a major contributor to driving sustainable waste management in business, partly through WMCs. Early WMC development (1992 onwards) was based upon preceding developments from mainland Europe. Various models for club structure have emerged and these include; Demonstration, Facilitated Self-Help and Sectoral. Access to funding for WMCs is a key limiting factor for their formation, many recent WMCs had been funded by the Landfill Tax Credit Scheme (LTCS). The Government stated, during December 2002, that the LTCS had made a number of marked contributions to sustainable practice, however, it considered there was little evidence that it had delivered a step change; so Object C/CC would no longer be funded under the LTCS. From 2003 onwards, the UK lost the major funding source for sustainable waste management research and development, including new and novel approaches to industrial/commercial WMC development. A model is proposed to reverse the decline in WMC development; a key step forward would be the formation of an Envirowise led forum along with industry, service providers, higher education and waste minimisation champions of proven worth. The forum would produce an Action Plan based upon the English regions; a similar approach could also be, used with the Devolved Assemblies of Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales. Each Region would be allocated a provisional fund, by Central Government, to sponsor Envirowise appointed waste minimisation champions who would hase with the, Regional Development Agency and other Regional bodies to produce an Action Plan for WMC development, based on a Facilitated Self-Help model. This way a wide range of local expertise and support will be recruited to the formation and management of WMCs, decreasing costs and increasing income leverage.

AB Bottomland hardwood forests of the southeastern United States have declined in extent since European settlement. Forest restoration activities over the past decade, however, have driven recent changes in land use through an intensified afforestation effort on former agricultural land. This intense afforestation effort, particularly in the Lower Mississippi Alluvial Valley, has generated a demand for alternative afforestation systems that accommodate various landowner objectives through restoration of sustainable forests. We are currently studying an afforestation system that involves initial establishment of the rapidly growing native species eastern cottonwood (Populus deltoides Bartr. ex Marsh.), followed by enrichment of the plantation understory with Nuttall oak (Quercus nuttallii Palm.). In this article, we examine the growth and biomass accumulation by Nuttall oak seedlings to determine whether this species can be established and whether it will develop beneath the cottonwood overstory. After 3 years of growth beneath cottonwood canopies, Nuttall oak seedlings were similar in height (126 cm), but were 20% smaller in root-collar diameter than seedlings established in open fields. Seedlings established in the open accumulated more than twice the biomass of seedlings growing beneath a cottonwood canopy. However, the relative distribution of accumulated biomass in seedlings did not differ in the two environments. Ten percent of total seedling biomass was maintained in leaf tissue, 42% was maintained in stem tissue, and 48% was maintained in root tissue on open-grown seedlings and seedlings established in the understory of cottonwood plantations. Though establishment in the more shaded understory environment reduced Nuttall oak growth, seedling function was not limited enough to induce changes in plant morphology. Our results suggest that an afforestation system involving rapid establishment of forest cover with a quick-growing plantation species, followed by understory enrichment with species of later succession, may provide an alternative method of forest restoration on bottomland hardwood sites and perhaps other sites degraded by agriculture throughout temperate regions.

TI Capitalism and ecological sustainability: the shaping of environmental
   policies
SO REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY
LA English
DT Article
DE class and environmental struggles; value; regulation
AB Detailed analyses of environmental policies and their implications for the ecological sustainability of capitalism are missing from the eco-Marxist literature. Moreover, environmental policies have been often dismissed by several eco-Marxists on the ground that they are shaped on capital's terms. It is the objective of this paper to theorize the shaping of environmental regulation from a value-theoretic and class struggle perspective. It is argued that the negative economic impacts of pollution and resource depletion, captured by prices and rents, instigate various class and environmental conflicts and struggles which reshape the interchange between capitalism and nature. The state as a social site becomes an arena of these struggles. The state is called upon by the many different competing agents to mediate their access to nature. Evidence from many concrete cases shows that environmental policies and adjustments have been the outcome of this complex social interaction. However, the emerging ecological restructuring of capitalism can not guarantee its ecological sustainability. In particular, it gives rise to new problems and contradictions rendering ecological sustainability of capitalism uncertain.

AB Many of the problems associated with the delivery of quality veterinary services to smallholders in Africa are attributed to the complexity of the provision of animal health care (AHC) in sub-Saharan Africa. In this region, a holistic and analytical approach is needed to determine area-specific requirements for sustainable, and thus quality, AHC. This study examines three components of the animal health care system in sub-Saharan Africa, namely, the structure, the process and the outcomes. It focuses particularly on the factors that contribute to the quality of the structure and the process. For this purpose, two measures of quality are used, i.e. availability (in relation to the structure) and acceptability (in relation to the process). The authors identify factors that affect the availability and acceptability of AHC and suggest ways in which they, and hence the quality of AHC provided to smallholders in Africa, can be improved.

DE real-time production scheduling; genetic and evolutionary algorithms
AB Classical scheduling approaches are not effective in real plants since they assume highly unrealistic assumptions that are seldom found in practice. These assumptions mainly deal with the consideration of the manufacturing environment as static. But in most real manufacturing installations some unexpected events take place. Ignoring these events may lead to schedules of unacceptable performance. Moreover, a quick reaction to changes is necessary, taking into account the significant amount of indirect costs involved in the derived interruptions. Reactivity and flexibility have to become key requirements at high control levels since they Call contribute to shorten throughput times, improve equipment utilisation rates and service to customers. There is a need to extend classical scheduling models, so that they are able to better represent the factory. Genetic algorithms stand for one of the most promising alternative techniques to the classical ones. They show non-linearity, domain independence, robustness and flexibility. In this article, an evolutionary genetic algorithm has been used for sequencing job-shop problems in a real-time environment. Untoward events such as lack of materials or tools, change in production orders or unavailability of machines have been represented in the model and a solution using genetic algorithms has been designed and implemented. In the context of a European project belonging to the Competitive and Sustainable Growth programme, a prototype of a dynamic scheduler using genetic algorithms is described and some conclusions are drawn regarding the feasibility and quality of the solution.

AB Previous studies have established that community residents and aders differ in their support for hazardous waste facility siting in rural areas (Spies et al. 1998). We examine whether these same differences exist in rural communities that face other high-risk development decisions by analyzing resident and leader support for a proposed gold cyanide process (GCP) mine in, Montana. Compared to proposed hazardous waste facilities, a much stronger predictor of both resident and leader support in the GCP mine context is, recreancy, or distrust in institutions and outside interveners. However, perceived economic benefits remain key differences between residents and leaders in both the GCP mine and hazardous waste facility cases.

AB Objective-Our first objective is to describe total, age- and gender-specific prevalences of subjects in a well-defined population for whom medical follow-up is indicated due to unfavourably high blood pressure and/or cholesterol levels, as defined by the 2003 European guidelines on cardiovascular disease prevention in clinical practice. Our second objective is to highlight scientific questions and ethical dilemmas relating to implementation of the guidelines.
   Design, setting, and participants-Cross-sectional population study comprising 62 104 adult Norwegians aged 20-79 years who participated in The Nord-Trondelag Health Study 1995-97.
   Main outcome measures-Total, age- and gender-specific point prevalences of individuals with total cholesterol greater than or equal to5 mmol/ l and/or systolic blood pressure greater than or equal to 140 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure greater than or equal to 90 mmHg, or taking antihypertensive medication.
   Main results-In total, 76% of individuals aged 20-79 years have an "unfavourable'' cardiovascular disease risk profile, according to guideline definitions. The point prevalence of individuals with cholesterol and/or blood pressure above the recommended cut-off points increases with age. By age 24, the prevalence reaches 50%. By age 49, it reaches 90%. Men below 50 years of age have higher combined risk prevalence than women.
   Conclusions and implications-Implementation of the 2003 European guidelines on CVD prevention would label a large majority of Norwegian adults as having unfavourably high cholesterol and/or blood pressure levels. The current biomedical standards appear to invalidate demographic health statistics. The theoretical basis on which the guidelines rest should thereby be scrutinized with regard to scientific methodology and consistency. Important ethical dilemmas arise at the point of guideline implementation, relating to risk labelling and medicalization, as well as resource allocation and sustainability within the healthcare system.

TI Promotion of academic careers in school psychology: A conceptual
   framework of impact points, recommended strategies, and hopeful outcomes
SO SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGY QUARTERLY
LA English
DT Article
AB School psychology is facing a major shortage of faculty in graduate training and education programs. To deal with this shortage and the issues that surround it, we propose a conceptual framework that incorporates a number of impact points that graduate training programs can use to educate and sustain individuals in academic careers. The impact points include: selection of students, program-related training variables, post-program transition variables, and sustainability of academic careers. Each of these impact points is discussed within the context of the role that current faculty and practitioners in the profession can play in graduate education and training of academic scholars. Among the variety of potential solutions to the shortage, we introduce the concept of the "virtual university" to promote future education and sustainability of faculty within our graduate training programs. A case scenario from graduate students at the University of Wisconsin-Madison is presented as a context for the impact points raised in the article. We argue that those of us in the profession think systemically and lead the way into a new era of collaborative work across our graduate programs and among our colleagues in clinical, counseling, and related areas of applied and professional psychology graduate training.

AB The Oslo Airport at Fornebu was closed in 1998 after 60 years of operation. An area of 3.1 km(2) was made available for one of Norway's biggest property development projects. Plans include 6000 residences and 20,000 workplaces. Fomebu is situated on a peninsula in the Oslo Fjord just outside the city of Oslo and is regarded as a very attractive area for both urbanisation and recreation. The residential area located centrally at Fomebu surrounds a centrally located park area. In the planning process, there was an expressed interest in using water as a life-giving element within the vegetation structure of the park. In Norway, stormwater in urban areas has traditionally been collected and transported in pipe systems to adjacent watercourses. However, there is an increasing interest in alternative "green" solutions for the management of stormwater. The paper presents a concept for sustainable stormwater management at Fomebu. A main objective is to improve the recreational and ecological value of stormwater while achieving a cost-effective solution. This objective is reached by replacing conventional urban drainage pipes with swales, filter strips, wetlands and ponds as collection, storage and treatment systems designed for natural processes. The paper thereby addresses integrated systems for stormwater management by approaching nature's way and sustainable development principles. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

DE sustainable urban drainage systems (SUDS); multicriteria analysis;
   decision-making procedure; benchmarking; urban and highway runoff
AB The control and treatment of urban and highway runoff involves a variety of stakeholders in the selection of sustainable drainage systems (SUDS) as the design process needs to consider not only water quantity but also water quality and amenity. Thus, technical, environmental/ecological, social/community and economic cost factors become prime potential sustainability criteria in terms of assessing long-term, cost-effective drainage options. The paper develops a multicriteria analysis methodology for the evaluation and accreditation of SUDS structures within the context of an overall decision-support framework. Approaches independently developed in the UK and France are outlined with the common multicriteria structures defining generic performance criteria together with supporting benchmark standards and exclusion thresholds. A French case study is presented to illustrate the approach and to highlight the inherent constraints and subjectivity embedded in the decision-making process. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

AB Since 1996 the New Zealand Ministry of Transport (MOT) has been investigating the effects of road transport on local air quality. The outcome has been the government's Vehicle Fleet Emissions Control Strategy (VFECS). This is a programme of measures designed to assist with the improvement in local air quality, and especially in the appropriate management of transport sector emissions. Key to the VFECS has been the development of tools to assess and predict the contribution of vehicle emissions to local air pollution, in a given urban situation. Determining how vehicles behave as an emissions source, and more importantly, how the combined traffic flows contribute to the total emissions within a given airshed location was an important element of the programme. The actual emissions output of a vehicle is more than that determined by a certified emission standard, at the point of manufacture. It is the engine technology's general performance capability, in conjunction with the local driving conditions, that determines its actual emissions output. As vehicles are a mobile emissions source, to understand the effect of vehicle technology, it is necessary to work with the average fleet performance, or "fleet-weighted average emissions rate". This is the unit measure of performance of the general traffic flow that could be passing through a given road corridor or network, as an average, over time. The flow composition can be representative of the national fleet population, but also may feature particular vehicle types in a given locality, thereby have a different emissions 'signature'. A summary of the range of work that has been completed as part of the VFECS programme is provided. The NZ Vehicle Fleet Emissions Model and the derived data set available in the NZ Traffic Emission Rates provide a significant step forward in the consistent analysis of practical, sustainable vehicle emissions policy and air-quality management in New Zealand.

AB DAPPLE (Dispersion of Air Pollution and Penetration into the Local Environment, http://www.dapple.org.uk) is a major research project that will provide the understanding necessary to assess the sustainability of urban road transport in terms of exposure to traffic-related air pollution as an alternative to current indicators based on emissions, roadside, or far-from-road air pollution levels. The methodology is described, which combines on-street and laboratory measurement with modelling of the movement of air, vehicles, and vehicle exhaust emissions. The relationship between this kind of assessment and more realistic indicators of sustainability is discussed. The value of large-scale interdisciplinary research in this area is thus demonstrated.

AB In the framework of the SOCCARE Project, focusing on families dealing with a double front of care for children and frail elderly people, similarities can be found in Italy, France and Portugal beyond their different welfare regimes. The comparison of family histories and caregiving strategies, by the methodology of case-matching, gives an interesting overview of the relationship between the debate on social care and that on the intergenerational contract. The paper aims to understand which are the available combinations of family, informal and institutional resources making a heavy burden of care "acceptable and still normal": this focuses both typical situations of each country and common features through the countries. The results show how changes in the representations of obligation and duty in the intergenerational pact produce different outcomes and demands in welfare systems. The analysis of shifting boundaries between the public and private spheres in care provides useful policy recommendations, aimed at improving choices and "sustainable" responsibilities of individuals, families and social networks. Sustainable policies seem to be more dependent on family and structural types and resources of networks than on different welfare and services support.

AB Great hopes have been held out for microfinance and other community development finance institutions (CDFIs) in industrialized countries as an instrument of "financially sustainable welfare provision", following on from their success in many developing countries. Using interview data drawn from an exploratory sample of 45 clients, this paper examines the social and economic impact of three microfinance institutions in Glasgow, Sheffield and Belfast. The tentative conclusion is that most loans we examined do hit the target of the "financially excluded but bankable", and exert an impact on poverty and social exclusion through the labour market and through helping to build social networks which reduce interpersonal risk. Our initial estimate is that each loan studied here was responsible for about 0.67 exits from unemployment over the two years 2000-2. If this ratio holds good outside the sample (and we emphasize the limitations of small sample size), this could mean that in the absence of microfinance services, the national unemployment total would be higher by some 2.4 per cent (or 22,000 individuals). The loans we have examined also save about pound0.4 million on what would otherwise have been social security payments; grossed up again to all microfinance organizations, this implies an annual saving of about pound250 million (1.4 per cent) on the total social security budget. However, to achieve this optimal impact microfinance institutions need to diversify their product: for example by switching from business loans into consumption loans, micro-insurance, and equity, particularly in the rehabilitation of run-down council estates.

AB Improved understanding of the interactive relationships of plant material decomposition kinetics to biochemical characteristics and nitrogen availability is required for terrestrial C accounting and sustainable land management. In this study, 15 typical and/or native Australian plant materials were finely ground and incubated with a sandy soil at 25 degreesC and 55% water holding capacity without nitrogen (-N) or with nitrogen (+N) addition (77 mg N kg(-1) soil as KNO3). The C mineralisation dynamics were monitored for 356 days and the initial biochemical characteristics of the plant materials were determined by NMR and wet-chemical analyses.
   Under the -N treatment, C mineralisation rates of the plant materials were positively correlated with their initial N contents during the first several weeks, and then negatively correlated with lignin and polyphenols contents during the late stages of incubation. Thus the ratios of lignin/N, polyphenols/N and (lignin+polyphenols)/N had more consistent correlation with the cumulative amounts of C mineralised throughout the incubation than did any single component. In terms of the C types determined by NMR analysis, the C mineralisation rates were initially related positively to carbonyl C contents, and then negatively to aryl and O-aryl C contents from day 3 onwards.
   Addition of NO3--N accelerated C mineralisation during the early stages, but resulted in lower cumulative C mineralisation at the end of the incubation for most plant materials. Under the +N treatment, the decomposition rates were correlated with the contents of lignin and the sum of cellulose + acid detergent-extractable non-phenolic compounds, or with aryl, O-aryl and N-alkyl + methoxyl C contents. Regardless of the N treatment, the ratios of aryl/carbonyl, O-aryl/carbonyl and (aryl + O-aryl)/carbonyl C had the closest and most consistent correlations with the cumulative C mineralisation among all biochemical indices examined.
   A double exponential model with defined mineralisation rate constants for the active and slow pools was used to describe the C mineralisation dynamics. The biological meanings of the kinetically estimated active and slow pool sizes are interpreted and their relationships to the initial chemical/biochemical composition of the plant materials are explored.

AB "Close-to-nature forest stands" are one central key in the project "Future oriented Forest Management" financially supported by the German Ministry for Science and Research (BMBF). The determination of ecological as well as economical consequences of mechanized harvesting procedures during the transformation from pure spruce stands to close-to-nature mixed forest stands is one part of the "Southern Black Forest research cooperation". Mechanical operations of several typical forest harvesting vehicles were analysed to examine the actual soil stresses and displacements in soil profiles and to reveal the changes in soil physical properties of the forest soils. Soil compaction stresses were determined by Stress State Transducer (SST) and displacement transducer system (DTS) at two depths: 20 and 40 cm. Complete harvesting and trunk logging processes accomplished during brief 9-min operations were observed at time resolutions of 20 readings per second. Maximum vertical stresses for all experiments always exceeded 200 kPa and at soil depths of 20 cm for some vehicles and sequences of harvesting operations approached greater than or equal to500 kPa. To evaluate the impacts of soil stresses on soil structure, internal soil strengths were determined by measuring precompression stresses. Precompression stress values of forest soils at the field sites ranged from 20 to 50 kPa at soil depths of 20 cut depth and from 25 to 60 kPa at soil depths of 40 cm, at a pore water pressure of -60 hPa. Data obtained for these measured soil stresses and their natural bearing capacities proved that sustainable wheeling is impossible, irrespective of the vehicle type and the working process. Re-occurring top and subsoil compaction, increases in precompression stress values in the various soil horizons, deep rut depths, vertical and horizontal soil displacements associated with shearing stresses, all affected the mechanical strengths of forest soils. In order to sustain naturally "unwheeled" soil areas with minimal compaction, it is recommended that smaller machines, having less mass, be used to complete forest harvesting in order to prevent or at least to maintain currently minimal-compacted forest soils. Additionally, if larger machines are required, permanent wheel and skid tracks must be established with the goal of their maximum usefulness for future forest operations. A first step towards accomplishing these permanent pathways requires comprehensive planning with the Federal State Baden-Wurttemberg. The new guideline for final opening with skid tracks (Landesforstverwaltung Baden-Wurttemberg, 2003) proposes a permanent skid track system with a width of 20-40 m. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

AB After clear-felling of a first generation Chinese fir (Cunninghamia lanceolata) forest, mixed stands of Chinese fir and Michelia macclurei (a broadleaf tree) (MCM), pure M. macclurei stands (PMS) and pure Chinese fir stands (PCS) were established in 1983. The effects on soil were evaluated 20 years after planting by measuring physicochemical, microbiological and biochemical parameters. Both broadleaf monoculture and mixtures of broadleaf and conifer exerted a favourable effect on soil fertility. A soil quality index (SQI) decreased in the order: PMS (0.62) > MCM (0.57) > PCS (0.41). Improvement in soil quality, enhanced biological activity and forest productivity demonstrated that mixed stands are an effective measure to maintain sustainable forest productivity, as well as to control soil degradation under successive stands of Chinese fir. In addition, since the microbiological and biochemical parameters measured were sensitive to the forest management, they may be potential indicators for assessing the sustainability of different management systems. The results also showed that total organic carbon, cation exchange capacity and microbial biomass carbon are effective indicators of the improvement or deterioration of soil quality under forest.

AB This paper argues that the gap between the theoretical utility and the practical utility of the resource-based view (RBV) may be narrowed by operationalizing the theory more consistently with Penrose's original framework. The operationalization proposed here is a twofold approach. First, the RBV may be enhanced by the explicit recognition of Penrose's two classes of resources, namely, administrative resources and productive resources. This distinction suggests a focus on the administrative decisions of managers that lead to economic performance. Second, we argue that the RBV is a theory about extraordinary performers or outliers-not averages. Therefore, the statistical methods used in applying the theory must account for individual firm differences, and not be based on means, which statistically neutralize firm differences. We propose a novel Bayesian hierarchical methodology to examine the relationship between administrative decisions and economic performance over time. We develop and explain a measure of competitive advantage that goes beyond comparisons of economic performance. This Bayesian methodology allows us to make meaningful probability statements about specific, individual firms and the effects of the administrative decisions examined in this study.

AB The European Union Water Framework Directive offers an unparalleled opportunity for improving river basin management and moving towards a sustainable future. It is widely accepted that the concept of sustainable development itself can be understood in fairly simple terms, but that implementation, making the concept practically operable, is difficult to achieve in practice. There is a need to animate this process, making it more engaging and comprehensible for participants. This research examined the emerging role of active stakeholder participation in 'planning for sustainability'. The DesignWays planning process, developed by the author, was tested in the context of waterside regeneration in the Mersey Basin Campaign. The overall aim of this research was to explore the use of a systems thinking paradigm to inform participatory ecological design. It has demonstrated that a process consistent with a living systems paradigm can contribute to the development of more integrated, ecologically sound plans.

ID BOTTLE-NOSED DOLPHINS
AB Whale-watching tourism is a growth industry worldwide. In Australia, with whale-watchers approaching one million per annum there has been considerable effort to develop management regimes that protect the whales while enabling the development of a sustainable ecotourism industry. A mixture of National and State laws and regulations have governed the industry (Tourism based on free-ranging marine wildlife: opportunities and responsibilities, Wildlife Tourism Research Report No. 11, Status Assessment of Wildlife Tourism in Australia Series, CRC for Sustainable Tourism, Gold Coast, Queensland) but these have been mainly derived from experiences with humpback (Megaptera novaeangliae) whale watching from vessels at sea. In this article we describe the development and nature of new and rapidly growing swim-with-whales operations based on the dwarf minke whales (Balaenoptera acutorostrata) in the Great Barrier Reef of northern Queensland. The distinctly different quality of these operations raise interesting questions for long-term management (Towards sustainable management of the developing dwarf minke whale tourism industry in northern Queensland, CRC Reef Research Technical Report 27, James Cook University of North Queensland, 30pp (emended version of SC/50/WW1)).
   In the 1999-2000 seasons, 453 passengers (88.1% of respondents) swam with minke whales. Only 25% of visitors came specifically for the whale interactions and 43% learned of the whales on board the vessel. Passengers thus had low expectations about whales and encounters. A variety of factors, including the diving experience, particular dive sites, a range of wildlife species and socializing contributed to visitor satisfaction. Nonetheless, there was a significant correlation between visitor satisfaction and closeness of approaches by the whales, total number of whales seen and total time spent with whales. We discuss the key issues associated with swim-with-whales programs in the light of our findings. The cooperative engagement of tourism operators, researchers and government management agencies is a feature of this new industry. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID STRUCTURAL EQUATION MODELS
AB Online travel community has been considered central to models of Internet marketing and electronic commerce in the travel industry. The successful operation of an online travel community depends on the understanding of member participation in and active contribution to the online travel community. This study evaluates an integrated model of an online travel community using structural equation modeling. The results of the study indicate that participation in the travel community is driven mainly by social and hedonic benefits, while level of active contribution can be explained by three instrumental, efficacy, and expectancy related incentives. Implications for the development of a dynamic and sustainable online travel community are discussed. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

DE integrated risk assessment; endocrine; CREDO
AB The procedures currently employed for risk assessment are unlikely to be sustainable in the future for a variety of reasons. A number of actions are needed to remedy the situation and the most important of these actions are:. to improve access to existing data; to introduce a prioritisation system based on exposure assessment; to co-ordinate and harmonise approaches of different organisations involved in risk assessment.
   Integration of information and methodologies between human health risk assessment and ecological risk assessment (integrated risk assessment) is advocated in this paper as one of the most important steps towards a holistic and effective way of conducting a risk assessment.
   A framework is proposed for identification of agents for which an integrated risk assessment would be of particular value. Close collaboration across disciplines and across countries is necessary for the potential of integrated risk assessment to be realised in practice. The practicality of applying integrated risk assessment to endocrine disrupting agents is presently being investigated in an EU funded multi-laboratory collaborative study (CREDO).

AB Schistosoma mansoni infection, associated morbidity and symptoms were studied in Piida fishing community at Butiaba, along Lake Albert, Uganda, from November 1996 to January 1997. The study revealed that S. mansoni is highly endemic with an overall prevalence of 72%, a mean intensity of 419.4 eggs per gram (epg) faeces (geometric mean for positives only), with 37.8% of mates and 33.0% of females excreting over 1000 epg. Prevalence and intensity peaked in the 10-14 year old age group and decreased with increasing age. Females were less heavily infected than mates. Differences were also shown between tribes. Diarrhoea and abdominal pain were commonly reported in Piida. However, no clear-cut correlation between intensity of S. mansoni infection and these conditions could be demonstrated, indicating that retrospective questionnaires concerning S. mansoni related-symptomatology are of limited value. Organomegaly, as assessed by ultrasonography, was frequent and hepatomegaly was associated with heavy S. mansoni infection. No correlation was demonstrated between splenomegaly and infection. This study emphasizes that schistosomiasis mansoni is a major public health problem in Piida fishing community and presumably also in many similar fishing communities. These observations call for immediate intervention and can help in planning tong-term strategies for sustainable morbidity control. (C) 2004 Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene.

ID GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION-SYSTEM
AB Groundwater is a main water resource for most of the cities in North China. By virtue of the self-regulation potential of shallow aquifers, the yearly or long-term asymmetric water recharges, if properly operated, can be converted into valuable water resources to increase the water supply for corresponding cities, especially in arid periods. This is of great practical importance for cities in North China, where the annual Precipitation differs greatly from year to year and mainly centralizes in summer To quantitatively estimate the self-regulation potential of such shallow aquifers, a representative case study was carried out in a small aquifer (about 400 km) in Beijing. A two-dimensional (2D) finite element flow model coupled with a Geographic Information System (GIS) was used to estimate the evolution of the flow system according to climate variability and to assess the reaction of the aquifer system under different scenarios of groundwater development. The results indicate that the aquifer has a potential to supply sustainably almost double of the current abstraction (about 0.3 Mm(3)/d) in drought periods. When the water demand decreases in abundant precipitation years, the water table can recover rapidly after stopping the emergency wells, which are for overexploitation in drought years.

AB This study develops a water distribution control model to manage and operate a multipurpose, multi-reservoir system in the Yellow River Basin. The aim is to make the best use of limited water resources and to coordinate different uses. The overall control task is made up of two processes. An initial distribution scheme is obtained through a simulation model first, then the scheme output suggestions are adjusted by a harmony index which is considered as a feedback regulator and the order parameter in synergetic theory is applied in this regulator Control criteria and a subsequent application of the method are presented. Case studies indicate that the proposed control process facilitates quick and efficient distribution control and can provide both theoretical and technical support for sustainable water resources development in the Yellow River in China.

DE water-dispatching; lower reaches of Yellow River non-flood season;
   reservoir regulation; water dispatching for reaches
AB Due to the water resource shortage in the lower reaches of the Yellow River in recent years, this paper presents a study on water dispatching. From the view of temporal and spatial allocation of water resources, water dispatching consists of two components: reservoir regulation and water dispatching for reaches in order to implement the total volume control and coordination between users. The combined regulation model of Sanmenxia reservoir and Xiaolangdi reservoir giving full consideration to the priorities of user water demands, conforms to the reality of the Yellow River The water-dispatching model for reaches applies various methods including the equal proportion method, weighting method, and user-involving method, which are characteristic of simplification, flexibility, and practice. In addition, the influence of flow routine time has also been considered to enable the water-dispatching scenarios obtained to be more practical. The methods and models have been applied in the praxis of water dispatching in the lower reaches. of Yellow River in 2000 and have resulted in significant economic and social benefits.

AB In an interdisciplinary project to develop protocols for long-term cultural and ecological monitoring of wetland restorations in Minnesota, we compared restored and reference wetlands on several ecological and cultural measures including land-use context, cultural perceptions, and management practices. Cultural measures were drawn from our surveys of visitors, neighbors, planners, and managers of the wetlands. This paper discusses their perceptions of six metropolitan wetlands (four recent restorations and two reference sites), how cultural measures of their perceptions compared with selected site characteristics and biodiversity measures, and what results suggest for wetland design and management. Overall, sites that were perceived as more well-cared-for and as a good place to enjoy nature were perceived as more attractive. In addition, objective site characteristics, like cultural cues and natural landscape context, were related to perceived attractiveness. While plant species richness was not significantly related to perceived wetland attractiveness for our sites, bird species richness was related to attractiveness.

AB Painted turtles (Chrysemys picta) are commercially harvested in large numbers in Minnesota for sale to biological supply companies and the pet trade. We investigated the possible effects of this harvest by comparing size, demography, and catch rates of painted turtles in 12 harvested and 10 nonharvested painted turtle populations in 2001 and 2002. We correlated turtle catch rates to harvest status, and harvested lakes had a lower catch -per-unit-effort than nonharvested lakes. Harvest had minimal effect on the size of turtles captured, and we found no significant differences in the count of male:female:juvenile turtles among lakes of different harvest status. We suggest that painted turtle populations likely have been impacted by harvester activities, but it was unclear whether the current harvest is sustainable. Further work is needed to determine whether there are any long-term effects on painted turtle populations.

ID ANIMAL-WELFARE
AB The Protocol on Animal Welfare annexed to the EC Treaty in 1999 obliges the European Institutions to fully consider animal welfare in the drafting and implementation of Community legislation. The reform of the common agricultural policies (CAP) foreseen by Agenda 2000 follows the trend of more market oriented measures decoupling subsidies from production. Farming is seen as fundamental to other key societal goals such as food safety and quality, animal welfare, rural development, sustainability etc.
   Over the years, recommendations of the Council of Europe and EU Directives specifically concerning farm animal welfare were developed and these are becoming increasingly stringent. European regulations relevant for poultry include Directives on the housing of laying hens, transport and slaughter. Recently, the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) identified animal welfare as a high priority for the coming years. Actions include the development of internationally applicable guiding principles and standards for good animal welfare practice.
   Animal welfare is an issue of increasing significance for European consumers and citizens. Since the consumer is the end-user, his or her requirements form the bottom-line for any effort intended to achieve the ultimate fine-tuning necessary to assure societal and economic sustainability of agri- and food-chains ('from farn to fork'). This means that efforts to inform the consumers and to address their concerns about animal welfare need to be at the forefront of policy and industry agendas.

AB This paper presents a conceptual design for an integrated sugar, ethanol and cogeneration plant employing state-of-the-art technology to create a benchmark for minimized emissions and maximized electricity cogeneration. The paper gives an overview about selected and applicable technologies that drive the energy demand of an integrated cane processing plant to its minimum and take advantage of a simultaneously increased power export. Further aspects focused on are the minimization of air and waste water emissions.
   Nowadays, many cane sugar factories still concentrate on the core business, the production of sugar. Often, energy consumption is rather high, environmental standards are low and air and water pollution are major problems that prevent reaching the status of a sustainable agricultural business. Energy efficient technologies and by-products such as ethanol and surplus electrical power can turn the negative environmental balance. The paper includes a description of the suggested process technologies for an integrated cane processing plant which could serve as a benchmark for reaching sustainable production.

AB This essay set the stage for the 2003 Star Island conversation on "Ecomorality" by remembering the cosmic, geological, and ecological context in which we live. It reflects on the immense journey that matter and life have traveled from the beginning and reminds us that, throughout that journey, all that was and is emerged from a fertile mix of individual well-being and reciprocity. But to sense the meaning of the story and to know our place in it takes more than hearing its broad Outline. We need to remember the individual actors who have gone before us; to read their stories in particular places, like the rocks and ecosystems of Star Island; and to listen carefully for the meaning to be found in those actors and those places. Those stories, actors, and places invite us to sense the sacredness of our time and place and to reconsecrate our selves and our energies to developing an ethic that honors our common ancestry.

AB The competition among shrimp producing countries, the rapid advances in technology and the increase in market demand suggest that the shrimp industry at a global level and in Mexico in particular needs to take appropriate measures to maintain its viability and be able to compete successfully. This can be achieved by making better use of the available scarce resources and appropriate technology without further deteriorating the environment. Decision makers, i.e. policy-makers and farmers, are challenged with the responsibility of planning and conducting aquaculture development in a sustainable way whereby social, environmental and economic goals are simultaneously satisfied.
   Based on an unbalanced panel of semi-intensive shrimp farms containing primary-source information at pond level for the period 1994, 1996-1998 in northwest Mexico, this paper assesses farm performance indicators adjusted to incorporate environmental impacts. This 4-year time series coincides with a switch in the species reared in commercial shrimp farms from white shrimp (first 2 years) to blue shrimp, as a consequence of viral disease outbreaks in the former species which impacted operations in Mexico in 1995 and 1996. Therefore, efficiency and productivity can be measured and the results can be analyzed in correspondence with three events: use of white or blue shrimp in operations; the effect of experience of working with one species after many years (white shrimp) and to initiate a learning curve with a new species (blue shrimp) after 1996; and the effect of the viral outbreak on production performance.
   Using an input distance function approach, total factor productivity (TFP) and technical efficiency (TE) using both traditional (T) and environmentally adjusted (EA) indicators were examined. TFP was reduced in 1996-1998 compared to 1994, due to a technological regression as reflected by increased input-intensive production technology resulting in an increase in undesirable outputs. The learning curve resulting from a shift from white shrimp to blue shrimp production species resulted in higher FCRs, water exchange and pollution emissions, despite increasing shrimp yields. In all years except 1994, EA TE and EA TFP were lower than the traditional TE and TFP scores. TE and TFP had an opposite behavior than yields in this period of time. In order to improve the technological change (TC) component of TFP in light of stable TE scores, increased government assistance in disseminating technological know-how is necessary to improve TFP at a faster rate during the transition period.

AB The spatial and temporal variability in density and distribution of mussel larvae and spat associated with bottom-drifting algae was investigated at Ninety Mile Beach, northern New Zealand, between October 1998 and April 2000. Analyses of plankton tows conducted at in-shore and off-shore sites around the southern end of Ninety Mile Beach revealed highest mussel larval densities during spawning peaks in July 1999. Higher densities generally were found in-shore versus off-shore, and in southern versus northern sites. Dredging of the sandy bottom at the same sites indicated that drift algae occur in greater quantities in-shore at the southern end of the beach, compared to off-shore and northern sites. The clumps of mostly filamentous red algae almost exclusively contain spat of Perna canaliculus. Dredged algal samples also showed that smaller mussels ( < 1 mm) are more abundant during the spawning peak in July, whereas larger mussels ( > 1 mm) are more common at the end of the spawning period in January. In addition, spatial and temporal patterns of algal and spat composition and arrival to the beach were investigated from beach-cast algal samples. Mussel densities in beach-cast algal samples were highest between July and September and lowest between January and May, in agreement with local spawning and larval availability patterns. A distinct, consecutive shift of mussel size-class dominance throughout the year was observed in the beach-cast material, with the density of smallest mussels peaking in August and largest mussels peaking in January. Analyses of six large algal rafts that were dispersed northward by the predominant along-shore current revealed a marked and consistent pattern of both increasing mussel size and algal branching in the northern direction, along the trajectory of the rafts. The dynamic patterns of mussel larval/juvenile dispersal and transport observed in this study provide a framework to develop future sustainable management and conservation strategies for natural mussel and algal populations, upon which the commercial mussel industry in New Zealand currently depends.

AB The ciliate Euplotes vannus is a common protozoan in mass cultures of rotifers, and rapid reproduction of E. vannus occasionally reduces the rotifer yield. We performed a competition experiment between the rotifer Brachionus rotundiformis and the ciliate E. vannus. The ciliate was inoculated at three stages of the rotifer growth curve: the lag phase, the logarithmic growth phase and the stationary phase. When feeding on the alga Yetraselmis tetrathele, the ciliate increased and the rotifer growth was suppressed. The interference with rotifer growth was stronger in the lag and stationary phases than in the logarithmic growth phase. In contrast, when feeding on the alga Nannochloropsis oculata, the ciliate did not increase and the rotifer growth was similar to the control. In addition to the competition experiments, N-15 incorporation experiments were performed on the ciliate to investigate its food preference. The nitrogen incorporation rates (% of body nitrogen h(-1)) of the ciliate were 0.7% through dead algae and 1.9% through rotifer feces when using T tetrathele, and 0.4% through dead algae and 3.4% through rotifer feces when using N. oculata. The incorporation rate through bacteria-free rotifer feces was about one-third that of normal rotifer feces. These results indicated that the ciliate did not incorporate algal nitrogen directly, but rather through the microbial food chain, from phytoplankton to rotifer feces to bacteria. E. vannus incorporated the nitrogen of N. oculata and grew for a short time but the growth was soon suppressed. This growth inhibition may be due to allelopathy of N. oculata for E. vannus. Consequently, we propose that periodic addition of N. oculata should control E. vannus, and that this technique of applying allelopathy should be more sustainable than conventional treatments.

AB Exploitation of carrageenophytic seaweeds in Chile has increased significantly over the past few years. Gigartina skottsbergii is one of the species exploited and the harvesting pressure could have negative consequences on the sustainability of this resource. Although demand for raw material of G. skottsbergii continues to increase, basic knowledge needed to cultivate this unique carrageenophyte is lacking. In this study, we determined the light, temperature, and nutrient requirements for juvenile G. skottsbergii cultivation, as well as the culture system and stocking densities required to optimize its indoor cultivation. An optimal temperature range of 10-14degreesC combined with dim light conditions are recommended. Nutrients do not need to be constantly added and ammonium instead of nitrate should be used, whereas phosphate must be also added. Floating cultures provide an adequate alternative, where containers support loads of 13-14 g (fresh weight) L-1. Only in very precise combination of factors, the specific growth rate can be over 2% per day. (C) 2004 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Implementation of the saline drainage water reuse system proposed for the westside of the San Joaquin Valley (SJV) of California requires development of sustainable cropping systems, which incorporate useful, salt-tolerant agronomic species. Ion composition in the saline drainage effluents present in the SJV is unique, with Na+, SO42-, Cl-, Mg2+ and Ca2+ predominating in that order. To identify potentially suitable crops for reuse systems, 10 forages were tested in greenhouse sand cultures located at USDA-ARS George E. Brown Jr. Salinity Laboratory, Riverside, California. Crops were: alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) cvs. 'Salado' and 'SW 9720% narrowleaf trefoil (Lotus glaber Greene) cv. 'PI 608022% broadleaf trefoil (L. ulginosus Schk.) cv. 'Big'; tall wheatgrass (Agropyron elongatuM (Host) Beauv.) cv. 'Jose'; alkali sacaton (Sporobolus airoides Tom); kikuyugrass (Pennisetum clandestinum Hochst. Ex Chiov.) cv. 'Whittet'; paspalum (Paspalum vaginaturn Swartz) cvs. PI '299042' and 'Polo'; and bermudagrass (Cynodon dactylon L. Pers.) cv. 'Tifton'. Two saline treatments, 15 and 25 dS m(-1), were imposed. Shoots were sub-sampled for mineral ion analysis when the forages were harvested. Patterns of shoot ion concentrations were unique for each species and varied with salinity level, external ion ratios, harvest date and plant age. Plant preference for K+ over Na+ did not appear to be a reliable predictor of salt tolerance. Salt-tolerant crops, such as kikuyugrass and bermudagrass, were highly selective for K+ (SK,Na - 200 to 400), whereas selectivity coefficients for the equally salt-tolerant grasses, alkali sacaton and tall wheatgrass, ranged from 20 to 40. The forages were highly selective for K+ over Mg2+ despite unusually low K:Mg2+ ratios in the external solutions. Total-S in the herbage was high and generally increased as external SO42- increased. Based on sustained nutritional health and lack of visual signs of toxicity or deficiency symptoms, several of the forages tested show promise as suitable candidates for the saline-sodic water reuse systems.

AB Reuse of drainage waters is an attractive management option that has been proposed for many irrigated agricultural areas. In California's San Joaquin Valley (SJV), however, drainage effluents are not only saline, but may also contain potentially toxic trace elements such as selenium and molybdenum. Crop suitability for reuse systems depends on the influence the sodium sulfate-dominated waters have on biomass production, plant sustainability, and mineral elements that are critically important for forage quality.
   Ten promising forage crops were grown in greenhouse sand cultures irrigated with synthetic drainage waters dominated by Na2SO4 with an EC of either 15 or 25 dS/m each containing 500 mug/L-2 Se and Mo as SeO42- and MoO4. Plant material was analyzed three times for mineral content and selected trace elements that may have a profound influence on ruminant health.
   Trace element concentrations indicate Se toxicity is of little concern, but that high concentrations of both Mo and S in the herbage may lead to Cu deficiency in ruminants. Similarly, high K/Mg and K/ (Ca + Mg) ratios in many of the legume and grass forages, respectively, indicate that there may be potential for development of sub-normal Mg levels (hypomagnesaemia) in ruminants. However, each of these disorders can be avoided or corrected with dietary supplements. The most concern regarding ruminant nutrition based on these data is sulfur toxicity. Sodium-sulfate dominated drainage waters will likely elevate forage S concentrations to levels that might cause excessive sulfide concentrations in the rumen and potentially lead to serious neurological disorders affecting animal health.

AB Ecological systems in general often exhibit the mechanism of critical depensation, i.e. the system may collapse due to decreasing population densities caused by, for example, an increasing predation pressure on the prey that causes both populations to collapse to extinction. In this study a semi-arid predator-prey grazing system is taken as an example and optimal, model based, harvesting rates for the herbivore population are presented that allow survival of both herbivores and grasses during long dry periods without precipitation. Recovery to a maximum sustainable yield is achieved in the next rain season under the assumption of model validity. Optimal control theory is utilized in this example as the principal method of solution. Both analytical and numerical issues of the solution method and obtained solutions are discussed. Survival of the system is possible if the pastoralist is willing to decrease his population considerably once the dry period has set in. The social willingness, necessary to implement these management strategies, can be interpreted in terms of a discount rate in the current value Hamiltonian associated with the dynamical grazing system. The example is worked out in more detail and dynamical solutions for two discount rates are presented. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We examined the maximum sustainable swimming speed of late-stage larvae of nine species of tropical reef fishes from around Lizard Island, Great Barrier Reef, Australia. Larvae were captured in light traps and were swum in flumes at different experimental swimming speeds (of 5 cm s(-1) intervals) continuously for 24 h. Logistic regression was used to determine the speed at which 90% of larvae were able to maintain swimming, and this was used to indicate the maximum sustainable swimining speed for each species. Maximum Sustainable swimming speeds varied among the species examined, with the lethrinid maintaining the fastest sustainable swimming speed (24 cm s(-1)), followed by the Pomacentridae (10-20 cm s(-1)) and the Apogonidae (8-12 cm s(-1)). U-crit (maximum speed) explained 64% of the variation in sustainable speed among species, whereas total length only explained 33% of the variation in sustained swimming. A regression fitted across species suggests that 50% U-crit is a good approximation of the speed able to be maintained by these larvae for 24 h. A model based on a cubic relationship between sustained swimming time and speed was found to be more successful than either length or U-crit as a method of estimating sustainable swimming speed for most of the species examined. Overall, we found that swimming speed is an important factor when considering the potential for active swimming behaviour to influence dispersal patterns, recruitment success and levels of self-recruitment in reef fish larvae and needs to be carefully considered in models of larval dispersal.

AB Bacterial symbionts have long been suspected to be the true producers of many drug candidates isolated from marine invertebrates. Sponges, the most important marine source of biologically active natural products, have been frequently hypothesized to contain compounds of bacterial origin. This symbiont hypothesis, however, remained unproven because of a general inability to cultivate the suspected producers. However, we have recently identified an uncultured Pseudomonas sp. symbiont as the most likely producer of the defensive antitumor polyketide pederin in Paederus fuscipes beetles by cloning the putative biosynthesis genes. Here we report closely related genes isolated from the highly complex metagenome of the marine sponge Theonella swinhoei, which is the source of the onnamides and theopederins, a group of polyketides that structurally resemble pederin. Sequence features of the isolated genes clearly indicate that it belongs to a prokaryotic genome and should be responsible for the biosynthesis of almost the entire portion of the polyketide structure that is correlated with antitumor activity. Besides providing further proof for the role of the related beetle symbiont-derived genes, these findings raise intriguing ecological and evolutionary questions and have important general implications for the sustainable production of otherwise inaccessible marine drugs by using biotechnological strategies.

The characterization of the status and development of the harvested stands, as well as the timber potential of the unmanaged ones, is necessary to achieve a sustainable forest management. In southern Patagonia, Nothofagus forests are the basis for the sawmill industry. Since European colonization, different silvicultural management regimes have been applied in primary forests. Forestry policies and available sawmill technologies have also been involved. There is little knowledge about the consequences of the different silvicultural systems implemented, as well as about the regeneration status of the harvested stands and future possibilities of the managed forests. The objective of this work is to analyse the logged, affected from harvesting and current forest structures, as well as the regeneration development (during the last 40 years and the consequences derived to forests of southern Patagonia.
   The harvesting was applied irregularly between the studied decades (30 +/- 15% of the original basal area was removed) creating an irregular forest structure. Large quantities of sawn logs were abandoned in the forest floor and a high percentage of the remaining forest structure was damaged during the harvesting. Negligent management and wind throw produced a huge amount of wasted timber, resulting in a scarce standing log volume of very low quality. Nevertheless, regeneration was successfully installed (222 +/- 185 thousands/ha) within the harvested stands. No differences in the harvesting intensity were found with the different theoretical silvicultural methods applied through the years (selective cuts, clear-cuts or shelterwood cuts). As a result, the forests present a low current and future economical potential. Hence, the status of the secondary forest must be improved and regulated in order to achieve sustainability. Otherwise, the local forest industry will suffer from negative consequences, and this valuable resource will not be profitable in the future. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The most efficient way to improve health is to use locally available, sustainable, and effective approaches. In the 1970s policy developers tested the concept that public health interventions could be designed around uncommon, beneficial health behaviours that some community members already practised.(1 2) This concept-known as positive deviance(3 4)-was used successfully to improve the nutritional status of children in several settings in the 1990s.(5-10) Recently, the approach has also been applied to newborn care, child nutrition, rates of contraception, safe sexual practices, and educational outcomes.(11-13) In this article we describe how the approach works, the evidence that it is effective, and possible future applications.

AB The present work studies the catalytic hydrogenation of the (-)-menthone fraction existing in a dementholized peppermint oil, subproduct of the low-temperature crystallization process of the Arvensis peppermint oil. The aim is to obtain a liquid menthol composition for commercial use that replacing the crystal form. Pt/Al/O-2(3) catalysts with different metal content (1 and 4% Pt) were used and the effect of several operating variables is analyzed: H, pressure, reaction temperature, and reactant mass/catalyst mass ratio. Total conversion values ((-)menthone + (+)-isomenthone) in the order of 95% on the fresh catalyst after 4 It on-stream were obtained for 4%Pt/Al2O3. These conversion values decrease when the catalyst is reused, which is indicative of deactivation. When the Pt content is reduced, the total conversion values fall drastically. The (-)-menthone to (-)-menthol selectivity values are higher than 90% in every case. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In a previous work it was observed that Pt/Al2O3 catalysts, prepared by wet impregnation, are deactivated during liquid phase hydrogenation of dementholized peppermint oil fractions. The aim of this work is to determine the main causes for this deactivation. Fourier transform infrared (F-FIR), with and without chemisorbed carbon monoxide, temperature programmed desorption (TPD), temperature programmed hydrogenation (TPH) and gas phase cyclohexane dehydrogenation were used to characterize fresh and used Pt/Al2O3 catalysts. It was found that metal platinum active phase is mainly deactivated by strong adsorption of surface carboxylate-like species and/or unsaturated carbon compounds. These strongly adsorbed species are generated from the interaction of catalyst surface with decarbonylation products from menthone and other carbonyl compounds present in the dementholized peppermint oil fraction. In addition, it was found that Pt/Al2O3 catalyst can be reactivated in hydrogen flow at temperatures between 400-450 degreesC. Treatments in nitrogen flow led only to a partial regeneration of the catalysts. This is because hydrogen converted surface carboxylates and unsaturated carbon compounds into methane facilitating their removal. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The Prisoner's Dilemma, a two-person game in which the players can either cooperate or defect, is a common paradigm for studying the evolution of cooperation. In real situations cooperation is almost never all or nothing. This observation is the motivation for the Continuous Prisoner's Dilemma, in which individuals exhibit variable degrees of cooperation. It is known that in the presence of spatial structure, when individuals "play against" (i.e. interact with) their neighbours, and "compare to" ("learn from") them. cooperative investments can evolve to considerable levels. Here, we examine the effect of increasing the neiahbourhood size: we find that the mean-field limit of no cooperation is reached for a critical neighbourhood size of about five neighbours on each side in a Moore neighbourhood, which does not depend on the size of the spatial lattice. We also find the related result that in a network of players, the critical average degree (number of neighbours) of nodes for which defection is the final state does not depend on network size, but only on the network topology. This critical average degree is considerably (about 10 times) higher for clustered (social) networks, than for distributed random networks. This result strengthens the argument that clustering is the mechanism which makes the development and maintenance of the cooperation possible. In the lattice topology, it is observed that when the neighbourhood sizes for "interacting" and "learning" differ by more than 0.5, cooperation is not sustainable, even for neighbourhood sizes that are below the mean-field limit of defection. We also study the evolution of neighbourhood sizes, as well as investment level. Here, we observe that the series of the interaction and learning neighbourhoods converge, and a final cooperative state with considerable levels of average investment is achieved.

AB Purpose. There is increasing evidence that physicians may be compromised by their interactions with the pharmaceutical industry. The authors aimed to develop and determine the effect of an educational intervention to inform family medicine residents about pharmaceutical marketing.
   Method. Confidential, self-administered questionnaires were administered to family medicine residents at McMaster University, Hamilton, Canada, immediately before and after a two-part, 2.5-hour educational intervention. The curriculum consisted of (1) a faculty-led debate and discussion of a systematic review of physician-pharmaceutical industry interactions, and (2) an interactive workshop that included a presentation highlighting key empirical findings, a video illustrating techniques to optimize pharmaceutical sales representatives' visits, and small- and large-group problem-based discussions. Residents were asked about their attitudes toward five marketing strategies: drug samples, industry-sponsored continuing medical education, one-on-one interactions with sales representatives, free meals, and gifts worth less than CAN $10.
   Results. A total of 37 residents responded to both questionnaires. After the intervention residents had more cautious attitudes, rating marketing strategies on a five-point Likert scale as less ethically appropriate (-0.41, P < .05) and less valuable to patients or useful to the resident (-0.39, p < .05), and reporting less intention to use them in the future (-0.44, P < .01).
   Conclusion. This intervention appears to have promoted more cautious attitudes toward pharmaceuticals marketing. Its long-term sustainability and effect on behavior remain unknown.

AB This article aims at modeling the impact of road characteristics and local spatial environment on road (un)safety. The study applies to Belgium where some 1500 people are killed annually on the roads. This statistic corresponds to one of the highest risks in Europe. Road unsafety is expressed here as whether an hectometer of road belongs to a black zone; a black zone is defined as a segment of road where roads accidents are concentrated. Logistic modeling including spatial autocorrelation is used and compared to non-spatial regression. It is shown that a spatial model is needed to avoid biased estimated parameters. Results show that local environment and road infrastructure play a substantial role in the co-occurrence of road accidents. Hence, education and enforcement cannot be the only measures taken to reach a sustainable road safety. To attain their objectives of accident reduction, public authorities should also take their responsibilities in the matter of securing road infrastructure. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Farm level modelling can be used to determine how farm management adjustments and environmental policy affect different sustainability indicators. In this paper indicators were included in a dairy farm LP (linear programming)-model to analyse the effects of environmental policy and management measures on economic and ecological sustainability on Dutch dairy farms. For analysing ecological sustainability, seven indicators were included in the model: eutrophication potential, nitrate concentration in groundwater, water use, acidification potential, global warming potential, terrestrial ecotoxicity, and aquatic ecotoxicity. Net farm income was included for measuring economic sustainability. The farm structure of "De Marke" formed the basis for three optimisations: (1) basis situation without environmental policy, (2) situation with Dutch environmental policy for 2004, and (3) situation with farm management measures applied at "De Marke". The Dutch environmental policy was included to comply with the EC nitrate directive. It resulted in lower fertiliser use and consequently in a decrease in sales of maize. This led to a decrease in net farm income of ca. EURO2500. Including this policy improved most used ecological indicators (except for ecotoxicity) and showed to be an effective tool to reduce the environmental impact of dairy farming. Adapting the model with farm management measures applied at experimental farm "De Marke" resulted in even better ecological performance compared to the situation with environmental policy. Nonetheless this increase in ecological performance led to a considerably lower net farm income (EURO14,500). (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Soil structural disturbance effects on crop yields and soil properties
   in a no-till production system

AB The development of well-structured soils is a goal for achieving sustainable and productive agricultural systems. Nevertheless, the maintenance of soil structure in continuous no-till (NT) soils has sometimes been thought to induce soil conditions that are detrimental to crop yields. The objectives of this research were to characterize the effects of periodic tillage disruption in otherwise NT systems on soil properties and the yields of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), double-cropped soybean [Glycine mar (L.) Merr.], and maize (Zea mays L.) in rotation and to determine if soil structural changes occurring in tilled soils are independent of changes in other soil properties. A field experiment was established in 1992 on a Huntington silt loam soil (Fluventic Hapludoll) at the University of Kentucky Research and Education Center in Princeton (KY) under a NT crop sequence with two seedbed preparation methods for winter wheat, (a) NT or (b) chisel plus disk tillage (Till). In fall 2000, similar soil chemical properties were observed between disrupted and continuous NT systems over the 0- to 20-cm layer. The geometric mean diameter of dry fragments and the soil water content retained between 0.0003 and 0.03 MPa water potential was greater in NT soils than in soils tilled for winter wheat. Tillage for winter wheat enhanced winter wheat yields (4.2% increase), mostly under low-yielding conditions, but it resulted in a reduction of subsequent summer crop yields (i.e, 3.7% for soybean and 7.0% for maize). The yields obtained in our study translate to an economic benefit for the continuous NT system. Net returns per hectare were estimated to be $73 higher for the winter wheat/double-crop soybean-maize rotation under NT than under Till treatments. The differences in maize yields between NT and tilled treatments were attributed to a better water supply in NT soil due to the maintenance of a larger number of mesopores and a great hydraulic conductivity. In the absence of significant changes in other physicochemical properties, periodic tillage appears to disrupt soil structure, which negatively affects crop productivity.

AB The personal safety and well-being of one fifth, and water supply for almost half of all people depend directly or indirectly on the functional integrity of mountain ecosystems, the key component of which is a robust vegetation cover. The green 'coat' of the world's mountains is composed of specialized plants, animals and microbes, all nested in a great variety of microhabitats. Because a single mountain may host a series of climatically different life zones over short elevational distances, mountains are hot spots of biodiversity and priority regions for conservation. With their diverse root systems, plants anchor soils on slopes and prevent erosion. Both landuse and atmospheric changes such as elevated CO2 and climatic warming affect mountain biodiversity. Sustained catchment value depends on sustained soil integrity, which in turn depends on a diverse plant cover. Whether landuse in mountains is sustainable is a question of its consequences for water yield and biodiversity. Given their dependence on mountains, lowlanders should show concern for the highlands beyond their recreational value.

TI Mountains of the world: Vulnerable Water Towers for the 21(st) century
SO AMBIO
LA English
DT Article
AB Mountains as "Water Towers" play an important role for the surrounding lowlands. This is particularly true of the world's semiarid and and zones, where the contributions of mountains to total discharge are 50-90%. Taking into account the increasing water scarcity in these regions, especially for irrigation and food production, then today's state of knowledge in mountain hydrology makes sustainable water management and an assessment of vulnerability quite difficult. Following the IPCC report, the zone of maximum temperature increase in a 2 x CO2 state extends from low elevation in the arctic and sub-arctic to high elevation in the tropics and subtropics. The planned GCOS climate stations do not reach this elevation of high temperature change, although there are many high mountain peaks with the necessary sensitive and vulnerable ecosystems. Worldwide, more than 700 million people live in mountain areas, of these, 625 million are in developing countries. Probably more than half of these 625 million people are vulnerable to food insecurity. Consequences of this insecurity can be emigration or overuse of mountain ecosystems. Overuse of the ecosystems will, ultimately, have negative effects on the environment and especially on water resources. New research initiatives and new high mountain observatories are needed in order to understand the ongoing natural and human processes and their impacts on the adjacent lowlands.

TI Increasing the role of environmental taxes and charges as a policy
   instrument in developing countries - Some conceptual considerations
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS AND SOCIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB The judicious use of natural resources is a crucial prerequisite for sustainable growth not just in developed countries but even more so in the third world. More generally, natural resource use is determined to a substantial degree by the tax structure governing a country's economic activity. When a tax constitution can be designed that stimulates the judicious use of natural resources, an important step toward achieving sustainable growth has been made. Designing such a constitution is not a simple task, however. For third-world countries, the task is further complicated by at least three factors. First, the tax system has to be exceedingly simple, since both number and quality of tax instruments available to third-world governments tend to be limited. Second, the legal system tends to mirror the state of economic development. This limits not only the tax structure an economy can bear; it also limits a government's ability to regulate natural resource use by legal means. Third, the more elaborate a legal system, the more diversity it affords its country for economic activity, including opportunities for the division of labor, that is, international competition and trade.

SO ANIMAL CONSERVATION
LA English
DT Article
ID GREAT-BARRIER-REEF; CONSERVATION; QUEENSLAND; MANAGEMENT
AB A significant proportion of the world's remaining dugongs (Dugong dugon) occur off northern Australia where they face various anthropogenic impacts. Here, we investigate the viability of two dugong meta-populations under varying regimes of indigenous hunting. We construct population viability analyses (PVAs) using the computer package VORTEX and published estimates of population sizes and hunting rates. In Torres Strait between Cape York and New Guinea, our models predict severe and imminent reductions in dugong numbers. Our 'optimistic' and 'pessimistic' models suggest median times for quasi-extinction of 123 and 42 years, respectively. Extinction probabilities are also high for eastern Cape York Peninsula. We demonstrate the inadequacy of reserves when harvest rates in neighbouring areas are high, identify the maximum harvest rates for meta-population stability and emphasise the urgent need for indigenous community involvement in management to establish sustainable rates of dugong harvest in these regions.

TI Aerial surveys and the potential biological removal technique indicate
   that the Torres Strait dugong fishery is unsustainable
SO ANIMAL CONSERVATION
LA English
DT Article
ID HERVEY-BAY; AUSTRALIA; SEAGRASS; QUEENSLAND; RECOVERY; SURVIVAL
AB The globally significant dugong population of Torres Strait supports an important indigenous fishery for meat and oil. The fishery is protected by the Torres Strait Treaty between Australia and Papua New Guinea. A time series of aerial survey estimates from 1987 2001 confirms that there is considerable temporal variability in the size of the dugong population in the region and adds to a growing body of evidence from other aerial surveys and satellite tracking that dugongs undertake large-scale movements associated with temporal and spatial changes in the distribution of their seagrass food. The magnitude of these effects on both the size of the population and the catch cannot be disaggregated from the effects of population depletion from over-harvesting. The Potential Biological Removal method was used in conjunction with the aerial survey data to estimate sustainable anthropogenic mortality from all causes for a range of empirically-derived estimates of dugong life-history parameters. These estimates of a sustainable harvest are so far below the current harvest that it must be unsustainable. Governments should heed the Islanders' requests for assistance in implementing co-management of the fishery as a matter of urgency.

AB Current procedures for ranching and sustainable use of guanacos necessitate their transport. Transportation is a risky process for animals, and is a particular concern for wild-caught or semi-domesticated species such as the guanaco - a wild South American comelid species increasingly being established on forms in Chile and Argentina. This study investigated the effect of transport on the physiological and behavioural responses of eight castrated adult male guanocos, transported on a single 2 h journey at a stocking density of 113.5 kg m(-2) (0.76 m(2) per animal). Plasma cortisol and blood glucose concentration, total and differential white blood cell (WBC) counts, heart rate, and body weight were measured one week before, immediately before, immediately after, 2 h after and one week after transport. Behavioural responses were recorded during handling prior to loading. Immediately after transport we found significant increases in plasma cortisol concentrations and neutrophil. lymphocyte (N:L) ratio, the latter peaking 2 h after transport. Heart rate increased significantly only during loading, while body weight remained constant throughout. Behavioural responses related to handling (Jumping, vocalising, kicking, spitting and urinating) were not associated with the physiological response. All variables returned to pre-transport values within one week. Transport of guanacos under these conditions produced physiological changes similar to those associated with a mild and transient stress response in other species and which, we judge, fall comfortably within acceptable limits for their welfare.

AB In this paper, a decision-making framework (DMF) based on stochastic dynamic programming (SDP) is presented for a wastewater treatment system, consisting of a liquid treatment line with eleven levels and a solid treatment line with six levels (Chen and Beck, 1997). A continuous-state SDP solution approach based on the OA/MARS method (Chen, Ruppert, and Shoemaker, 1999) is employed, which provides an efficient method for representing a wide range of possible influent conditions. The DMF is used to evaluate current and emerging technologies for the multi-level liquid and solid lines of the wastewater treatment system. At each level, one technology unit is selected out of a set of options which includes the empty unit. The DMF provides a comparison on possible technologies for screening which types of technologies may best be further developed in order for an urban wastewater infrastructure to be judged progressively more sustainable. The results indicate that one or a pair of technologies are dominant in each level. The cheap, lower-technology unit processes receive a mixed review. Some of them are selected as the most promising technology units while the others are not considered as good candidates.

AB Studying land degradation through a soil quality approach, which reveals soil functioning within the ecosystem, is necessary for sustainable management of land resources. This investigation was conducted to understand the changes of soil functions, resulting from exploitive management, using some soil quality indicators and their statistical and geostatistical. measures. Undisturbed and disturbed sites were identified in each of two study areas, including an oak forest and a semiarid rangeland in central Iran. Soil organic carbon (OC), total nitrogen (TN), microbial respiration (MR), aggregate stability (AS), and hydraulic properties of the sites were determined. Statistical comparisons of frequency distribution functions of OC and MR revealed that these functions are normal in protected forest, while in the disturbed forest distributions deviate from normality. In the rangeland sites, the results were exactly the opposite. Spatial variability of the two variables in forest sites demonstrated pure nugget and spherical pattern in protected and disturbed sites, respectively. As for the rangeland ecosystem, pure nugget pattern was observed for both sites. According to our findings, protection of rangeland has resulted in higher OC and MR with no effect on the amount of TN and infiltration rate. The negative effect of this management system was a decrease in aggregate stability due to the formation of crust as a result of complete grazing exclusion. By contrast, improvement in all soil quality indicators in protected forest indicated the success of conservative management in this region. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Multimicrobial inoculation has been proposed as a way of protecting plants against environmental stress and increasing the sustainability of plant production. To study these possibilities in a micropropagation system, microplants of strawberry, Fragaria x ananssa, were inoculated or left uninoculated with five microorganisms (Glomus mosseae BEG29, Bacillus subtilis M3, Trichoderma harzianum DB11, Pseudomonas fluorescens C7rl2 and Gliocladium catenulatum Gliomix(R)), used either singly or in dual mixtures in the presence or absence of the strawberry diseases crown rot (Phytophthora cactorum) and red stele (P. fragariae). Finnish light Sphagnum peat was used as the growth substrate in the experiments. Seven experiments were performed as two to three months pot experiments in greenhouses of research laboratories in Finland and Belgium and in a nursery in Finland. In most experiments, the inoculated microorganims were detected at sufficient densities four weeks after inoculation. Exceptions were T harzianum and G. mosseae which were detected at insufficient densities in several experiments. This might have been due to the biological and/or nutritional properties of the peat. None of the microorganisms or their mixtures caused significant growth-promoting effects in more than two experiments. Dual inoculation did not increase growth more than inoculation with single organisms. B. subtilis was the most promising growth promoting microorganism. Most of the microbial treatments decreased crown rot shoot symptoms as well as the numbers of oospores in the roots when the experiment was performed in autumn. In the summer experiment with conditions more favourable for strawberry growth, no disease control was obtained, but some of the microorganisms increased the severity of crown rot. No microbial treatment decreased shoot symptoms of red stele, but the degree of root necrosis was slightly decreased by B. subtilis and G. mosseae + G. catenulatum. The numbers of oospores of P. fragariae in strawberry roots were not decreased by any treatment, but several treatments increased them. Both growth promotion and disease control considered, the single microorganisms T harzianum, G. catenulatum and B. subtilis as well as the mixture T harzianum + G. catenulatum were the most promising treatments in this study. However, the great variation between experiments indicates that more studies are needed for optimization of the whole plant-substrate-microorganism system. The importance of microbial inoculation for ensuring subsequent growth in the field also needs to be studied. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Forecasting the effects of enhanced sediment loads to coastal areas: a

AB 1. Concern about possible harmful effects of sedimentation in coastal areas has fuelled efforts towards detecting the effects of sedimentation on coastal assemblages.
   2. In order to identify sustainable management strategies, it is time that efforts move from 'detecting' to 'forecasting' the consequences of changes in sediment loads and thresholds of impact for different species and habitats.
   3. It is suggested that the cumulative impact of human modification to the regimes of sediment deposition and movement should be approached through the use of large-scale, long-term monitoring and, whenever possible, experimental protocols.
   4. Treating human perturbations as experiments and overlying well-designed monitoring programmes on the resulting alterations to sedimentation regimes is one useful way to accumulate key information on the effects of sedimentation on coastal assemblages, and also to judge to what extent mitigation is necessary.

AB Riparian corridors of eastern Oregon and Washington, like those in other regions, comprise small portions of river drainages but provide disproportionately important ecosystem functions. However, most riparian and fluvial ( streams and rivers) systems have been greatly altered. Degraded ecosystems commonly reflect influences of land-uses ( e. g., mining, logging, road construction, fire suppression, livestock grazing), hydro-developments ( e. g., dams, irrigation, flood control) and other human actions. Some important consequences include: degradation and fragmentation of habitats, changes in riparian plant associations, isolated fish populations, and altered flow and sediment regimes. This synthesis paper evaluates some major environmental factors that can influence the sustainability of riparian corridors and fluvial systems along lowland-arid to mountain gradients within river drainages of eastern Oregon and Washington. Four tributary rivers of the Columbia River, the Grande Ronde and John Day Rivers in northeastern Oregon, and the Yakima and Methow Rivers on the eastside of the Cascade Mountains in Washington, provide perspectives on environmental conditions. Factors evaluated include: a) dominant riparian plant associations and distributions in relation to differences in precipitation and temperature regimes along elevation gradients; b) ecological and physiochemical functions of riparian and fluvial systems along elevation gradients; c) long-term historical and contemporary cumulative impacts of human actions; and d) management provisions that could restore and sustain ecosystem functions. Ecological functions of riparian and fluvial systems are viewed as being closely coupled because of their dependence on hydrological ( surface and sub-surface) and sediment routing regimes. From a river landscape perspective, achieving greater connectivity can be a key objective for analyzing and integrating the management of riparian and fluvial ecosystems. Effective management should include ensuring the delineation of major limiting factors ( e. g., erosion, water shortages and temperatures) and identification of streamside and channel networks that link critical habitats at multiple landscape scales ( e. g., locations and spacing of refuge habitats for fish and wildlife). Management actions should encourage the connectivity of reaches and habitats and maintenance of riparian and fluvial functions so interactions can occur. Efforts should include renewal of natural flood and sediment routing regimes and the reestablishment of habitats adjacent to ecologically intact habitats.

DT Article
AB The OECD International Energy Agency (IEA) annually publishes its World Energy Outlook. It alternately presents analyses and scenarios of future worldwide developments in energy consumption and specific topics of world energy consumption.
   The current World Energy Outlook, among other things, analyzes the global energy system in the period up to 2030.
   The sobering picture presented in the World Energy Outlook is the worldwide increase by almost 60% of energy requirement by 2030. Fossil sources of energy are going to dominate the international structure of energy consumption and cover most of the additional energy consumption.
   The share of nuclear power and renewable energy resources will remain very limited.
   IEA summarizes its outlook by stating that the worldwide energy trends "require fast and decisive political responses" if a sustainable path is to be embarked on. An alternative political scenario indicates that a more efficient and less polluting future use of energy can result in lower energy consumption and less CO2 emissions than is the case in the reference scenario. A detailed account is given of the future role of Russia in world energy supply.

AB Severe problems of fragmented policies and uncoordinated implementation undermine natural resource management in Australia. There have been promising signs of progress through activities such as the National Forest Policy, Council of Australian Government water reforms, National Land and Water Resources Audit, the Murray-Darling Basin initiative and the National Action Plan for Salinity and Water Quality to integrate resource policies. There have also been some notable successes at State and local level. But fragmentation endures. This paper provides evidence of the enduring problem of fragmentation and presents a framework to analyse Australia's experience in natural resource management. The analysis reveals the multi-dimensional character of the problems and identifies a diverse set of actions that need to be taken to improve integration in policy and implementation. Particular attention is given to the potential for regional programs to contribute to improved integration and NRM.

TI Effective community engagement for sustainability: Wombat community
   forest management case study
SO AUSTRALIAN GEOGRAPHER
LA English
DT Article
DE community forest management; sustainability; public participatory
   planning systems; e-governance
AB The first significant government sponsored community-based forest management project in Australia was initiated in Central Victoria in 2002. This paper analyses the initial stage of the Wombat Community Forest Management Pilot Project. The paper develops a functional concept of 'effective community' for structuring community engagement in these kinds of natural resource management projects. The effective community has characteristics in common with a community of interest, adopts a bioregional perspective, embodies the values of environmental stewardship and interacts in a fully informed way as a 'discursive community' (Meppam 2000). The paper offers general advice for organising effective community engagement in such projects and 12 recommendations for governments developing similar initiatives elsewhere.

TI The ageing of Australia: Fiscal sustainability, intergenerational equity
   and inter-temporal fiscal balance
SO AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF SOCIAL ISSUES
LA English
DT Article
AB Australian public policy makers are presently confronted with significant demographic changes that will profoundly affect the formulation of rational economic and social policy over the long term. This paper seeks to outline the potential impact of this demographic change and place it in historical perspective. The challenges posed by an ageing population for fiscal policy are explored and it is stressed that policy inertia will invite severe costs in future. It is argued that an appropriate policy stance should be developed in the context of a framework for inter-temporal fiscal balance not only to focus on long-run fiscal sustainability, but also to include considerations of intergenerational equity.

TI Measurement Issues in EBD Research: What We Know and How We Know It
SO BEHAVIORAL DISORDERS
LA English
DT Article
ID POSITIVE BEHAVIOR SUPPORT; SOCIAL VALIDITY; CHILD
AB Since the passage of the No Child Left Behind Act in 2002, educators have been advised that it is no longer acceptable to allow ideology, fads, or untested procedures to define teaching. Therefore, knowing what counts as evidence and why it counts is the primary issue of the early 21st century in the field of Emotional and Behavioral Disorders (EBD). Over the last several years, we have been engaged in an effort to define our field as a set of standardized, evidence-based, and sustainable practices. Issues related to the validity of research are at the center of that discussion. This article responds to the work of other authors in this special issue through a discussion of the role of science in EBD, various aspects of validity related to current interventions, and threats to the systematic determination of a valid research base in the field.

AB Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are important for the normal development and function of all organisms, and are essential in maintaining human health. Impaired PUFA metabolism is thought to be associated with pathogenesis of many chronic diseases. Dietary supplementation of PUFAs, such as gamma-linolenic acid, arachidonic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid, and docosahexaenoic acid, which bypass the defective or dysfunctional steps of the biosynthetic pathway has been found to significantly alleviate the symptoms of the disease. These findings have drawn a great deal of interest from general public and food manufacturers. As the demand of these beneficial PUFAs has drastically increased in recent years, there are also increasing efforts in finding the alternate sources of PUFAs that are more economical and sustainable. One option is to modify the oil-seed crops to produce PUFAs through genetic engineering technique. This review examines the isolation, identification and expression of genes encoding the enzymes required for the biosynthesis of the above mentioned PUFAs in plants.

AB Prior to 1982, the uncontrolled mountaineering activities to the Nanda Devi peak led to the heavy destruction of the biological resources of the region in the form of poaching of wild animals, tree felling by expedition parties, collection of medicinal herbs and accumulation of garbage. To curb the biotic interference, the area was declared as Nanda Devi National Park (NDNP) and adventure tourism was stopped in 1982. Further in 1988, an area of 2236.74 km(2) was designated as Nanda Devi Biosphere Reserve (NDBR) with an inner core zone (NDNP) surrounded by a buffer zone. A ban on tourism activities. followed by the designation of NDBR directly helped in a significant improvement in forest cover and density. The better status of wild animals. including rare and endangered species such as musk deer (Moschus chrysogaster) and blue sheep (Psuedois nayaur), is an indicator of such improvements. However, from a socio-economic point of view the loss of income from adventure tourism forced local people to migrate from the area, a phenomenon that was reflected in the human population trends, registering 15% decline between 1981 and 1991 and another 13% between 1991 and 1996. In the absence of alternative income sources, marginal agriculture and animal husbandry became the major sources of income for the locals. Nonetheless, the low density of human population kept the level of biotic pressure under control in NDBR. Promotion of eco-tourism and natural resource based employment generation schemes are suggested to compensate for the economic loss to the local people and to maintain the biodiversity of NDBR.

AB We determined the importance of unprotected forest habitat outside the Tana River Primate National Reserve (TRPNR), Kenya, in conserving the critically endangered Tana red colobus. We compared colobus and forest attributes inside and outside the reserve and found no significant difference in colobus density or mean group size, although absolute values for both measures were higher outside the reserve. Forests outside TRPNR had a higher basal area of trees, basal area per tree, and basal area of stumps from human use. We also compared data on group size and composition collected inside and outside TRPNR during the period of reserve establishment (1978), 10 years after establishment (1988) and over 20 years after establishment (2000). Mean group size declined by nearly 50% since the reserve was established across all age classes both inside and outside. TRPNR. Since the red colobus population is in decline and forests outside TRPNR are as suitable as those inside as colobus habitat, we recommend adopting a community-based conservation strategy of sustainable forest management and use outside TRPNR to enhance conservation goals.

AB Because the response of ecosystem patterns and processes to disturbance is rarely linear, the dynamic regime concept offers a more realistic construct than linear models for understanding ecosystems. Dynamic regimes, and shifts between them, have been reported for a diversity of ecosystem types (e.g., terrestrial, marine, aquatic) at a variety of scales (e.g., from small lakes to the global climate). Ecosystem regimes that are obvious at one scale may not be at another. Regimes are maintained by internal relationships and feedbacks between species, and these internal dynamics can interact with large-scale external forces (such as global weather patterns) and trigger shifts to alternative regimes. The dynamic regime concept is commonly used in ecosystem management, restoration, and sustainability efforts, in what are known as "state-and-transition," "threshold," or "alternative stable state" models. Here we review the application of this concept to ecosystem management and restoration, and discuss how dynamic processes at multiple scales can affect this application.

TI Molecular identification of the swede midge (Diptera : Cecidomyiidae)
SO CANADIAN ENTOMOLOGIST
LA English
DT Article
ID DNA; MODEL
AB Early detection of pest infestation is a prerequisite for sustainable crop protection. However, many pest species are difficult to detect and thus infestation is diagnosed from damage observed on the respective crop. This diagnosis is often made too late for implementation of crop protection measures, and serious crop losses may result. The swede midge, Contarinia nasturtii Kieffer, is a major pest of Brassica L. (Brassicaceae) vegetables in Europe that has recently invaded North America. With its small size and short adult life-span, and the cryptic lifestyle of the larvae feeding at the growing points of its host plants, it is usually detected only after damage has already occurred. Furthermore, because field-trapped specimens are rarely fully intact, it is extremely difficult to identify. Therefore, we developed a species-specific molecular diagnostic method that enables reliable identification of swede midge from various sources such as alcohol or sticky glue traps. The method enables large-scale screening of field-trapped specimens and is used to evaluate the attractiveness and specificity of pheromone traps that are currently under development.

ID POTENTIAL CONSEQUENCES; POLLINATOR DECLINES; HABITATS; CONSERVATION
AB We assessed bee diversity and abundance in urban areas of Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, to determine how urban environments can support bees. Habitats examined were community and botanical gardens, urban wild areas, Naturescape flower beds and backyards, and traditional flower beds and backyards. A total of 56 bee species (Hymenoptera), including species of the genera Andrena Fabr. (Andrenidae), Bombus Latr. (Apidae), Osmia Panzer and Megachile Latr. (Megachilidae), and Halictus Latr. and Dialictus Pauly (Halictidae), were collected. Abundance exhibited strong seasonal variation. Wild bees were most abundant during late spring, whereas honey bees peaked at the end of the summer. The most abundant species seen was the managed honey bee Apis mellifera L. (Apidae), followed by wild Bombus flavifrons Cresson. Community and botanical gardens, and plants such as cotoneaster (Cotoneaster Medik. sp.) and blackberry (Rubus discolor Weihe & Nees) (Rosaceae), centaurea (Centaurea L. sp.; Asteraceae), buttercup (Ranunculus L. sp.; Ranunculaceae), and foxglove (Digitalis L. sp.; Scrophulariaceae), had the highest abundance of bees, while bee populations in wild areas were the most diverse. Weeds such as dandelions (Taraxacum officinale G.H. Weber ex Wiggers; Asteraceae) dominated these wild areas and had one of the highest diversities of bee visitors. Traditional flower beds with tulips (Tulipa L. sp.; Liliaceae) and petunias (Petunia Juss. sp.; Solanaceae) had relatively poor diversity and abundance of bees throughout the year. Our study suggests that urban areas have the potential to be important pollinator reservoirs, especially if both bloom and habitat heterogeneity are maintained and enhanced through sustainable urban planning.

AB This paper is concerned with the sustainability of free-trade agreements (FTA). FTA sustainability is influenced by governments' valuations of political contributions, discount factors, the lobbying position of the specific-interest groups in the intra-industry trade sectors, and the sectoral coverage of the FTA. I find that (i) under certain conditions, the FTA under protectionist lobbying could be more sustainable than the FTA under no political pressure; (ii) the lobby-supported FTA is more sustainable than the lobby-opposed FTA and the FTA under no political pressure; and (iii) multisector trade enhances FTA sustainability.

AB Arbuscular mycorrhizae are important factors of soil quality through their effects on host plant physiology, soil ecological interactions, and their contributions to maintaining soil structure. The symbiosis is faced with numerous challenges in agroecosystems; in order to inform sustainable management strategies it is hence a high priority to work towards mechanistic understanding of arbuscular mycorrhizae contributions to soil quality. This review focuses on glomalin-related soil protein (GRSP), operationally defined soil C pools that have been linked to arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF). In discussing this protein pool, we propose a new terminology used to describe fractions of soil proteins and glomalin. GRSP concentrations in soil are positively correlated with aggregate water stability. GRSP has relatively slow turnover in soil, contributing to lasting effects on aggregation. Controls on production of GRSP at the phenomenological and mechanistic level are evaluated. While there are significant gaps in our knowledge about GRSP and glomalin (particularly at the biochemical level), it is concluded that research on GRSP holds great promise for furthering our knowledge of soil structure and quality, for informing suitable management, and as a foundation for novel biotechnological applications in agriculture and beyond.

AB The influence of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) on soil processes is difficult to define, in part because it varies with the plant and fungal genotypes as well as with environmental conditions. The influence of AMF on N cycling is just being discovered. This short review examines areas of knowledge related to the nature of the mycorrhizosphere, AMF-microbe interactions, and N and P mobilization in the root zone. The role AMF could play in the root zone in N and P dynamics is presented. The spatial organization of roots and hyphae in soil suggests that AMF may enhance the reabsorption of nutrients lost through root exudation. These fungi influence soil microorganisms and, hence, they may influence biochemical reactions in soil including mineralization of organic matter and nitrification. AMF seem to improve the capacity of their host plant to use organic sources of P and N. AMF might improve the ability of plants to compete with saprotrophs for the uptake of P and N. The impact from this latter effect of AMF could exceed that stemming from their possible direct use of amino-acid-N, their production of phosphatase enzymes and possibly of organic anions. Better competitive ability of mycorrhizal plants under conditions of low soil P and N levels could reduce saprotrophic populations and, if this occurs, regulate soil organic matter turnover rate. The management of biological soil resources, in truly sustainable cropping systems, may be the largest challenge in crop production.

AB Fine and coarse recycled aggregates recovered from demolished masonry and concrete structures were utilized in the manufacture of new concrete mixtures. Three properties of these new concretes were analyzed: water absorption, total pores volume, and carbonation. The recycled concrete families were created by replacing parts of the natural aggregates forming families of concrete with 0%, 20%, 50%, and 100% of aggregates from recycled sources. The usual comparison between mixtures by comparison between behaviors of concrete families. This research shows that the mix design nomogram (NMN) is a new and useful tool that allows the researchers to compare properties and behaviors of different concretes. The results show that the family concrete with the highest pore volume and with the same compressive strength of 20, 30, and 40 MPa (2900, 4350, and 5800 psi) did not always correspond to the concrete family with the highest degree of carbonation. This experiment also showed that some compositional characteristics of concrete could have more influence on the durability that the traditional physical aspects. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

AB It is widely believed that evolutionary dynamics of artificial self-replicators realized in cellular automata (CA) are limited in diversity and adaptation. Contrary to this view, we show that complex genetic evolution may occur within simple CA. The evolving self-replicating loops ("evoloops") we investigate exhibit significant diversity in macro-scale morphologies and mutational biases, undergoing nontrivial genetic adaptation by maximizing colony density and enhancing sustainability against other species. Nonmutable subsequences enable genetic operations that alter fitness differentials and promote long-term evolutionary exploration. These results demonstrate a unique example of genetic evolution hierarchically emerging from local interactions between elements much smaller than individual replicators.

AB Aims To evaluate whether diabetes care in a district population can be sustained over time and intensive management of multiple risk factors can be achieved against a background of rising prevalence of known diabetes and shift of responsibility towards primary care.
   Methods Assessment of process and outcome measures achieved by a comprehensive diabetes service. Routine data were collected from patients registered with diabetes in a district population by repeated cross-sectional survey in 1991 (n = 2284 patients) and 2001 (n = 5809 patients).
   Results Between 1991 and 2001 the recording of body mass index (76.8 vs. 71.3%, P = 0.01) and HbA(1c) measurement (92.2 vs. 86.4%, P < 0.001) decreased, whereas recording of smoking status (72.4 vs. 82%, P < 0.001), cholesterol level (54.7 vs. 82.5%, P < 0.001) and eye screening result (86.1 vs. 91.3%, P < 0.001) improved. Surviving patients with Type 2 diabetes had significant improvements in systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure and cholesterol, significant deterioration in HbA(1c) and creatinine, and no change in body mass index. Changes in blood pressure and HbA(1c) over time were similar to those reported in the UKPDS.
   Conclusions The delivery of processes and outcomes of care to a district population can be sustained at a high level over a 10-year period within a comprehensive diabetes service. We would suggest that a multifaceted complex intervention is required to achieve these results.

AB We propose a global mechanism to finance sustainable development (SD) that offers a number of advantages over the current Global Environmental Facility (GEF). The mechanism would be multinational, provide incentives for rich and poor countries to promote SD, incorporate the principle of common, but differentiated, responsibilities and link incentives and fundin2 for SID to structural benchmarks and performance targets. It would operate as a large fund into which rich countries would pay based on their level of population, per capita income and change in a measure of environmental sustainability. Receipts front the funds, called Country Undertakings and Rights for Environmental Sustainability (CURES), would be made to poor Countries based on their population, per capita income and absolute level of environmental sustainability. This approach differentiates payments and receipts on the basis of income, while rewarding improvements in environmental performance in rich countries, and making greater payments to countries with greater environmental problems. To promote flexibility, recipient countries would be able to trade, bank or borrow their assigned CURES, provided that the trade resulted in a verifiable improvement in environmental sustainability in the purchasing country. A reformed GEF that adopted the desirable features of CURES, if widely adopted and funded at a sufficiently high level, would offer a significant boost to global SD and would greatly assist poor countries to address the twin challenges of poverty and environmental degradation.

AB Assessing the economic impacts of urban land use transformation has become complex and acrimonious. Although community planners are beginning to comprehend the economic trade-offs inherent in transforming the urban fringe, they find it increasingly difficult to analyze and assess the trade-offs expediently and in ways that can influence local decision making. New and sophisticated spatial modeling techniques are now being applied to urban systems that can be used for assessing the probable spatial outcomes of given communal policies. Applying an economic impact assessment to the probable spatial patterns can provide to planners the tools needed to quickly assess scenarios for policy formation that might ultimately help inform decision makers.
   This paper focuses on the theoretical underpinnings and the practical application of an economic impact analysis submodel developed within the Land Use Evolution and Impact Assessment Modeling (LEAM) environment. The conceptual framework of LEAM is described, followed by an application of the model to the assessment of the cost of urban sprawl in Kane County, Illinois. The high spatial resolution of the approach allows for discerning the macro-level implications of micro-level behaviors. The results show, that spatially explicit dynamic modeling has various conceptual advantages over other approaches to modeling urban dynamics, both from a theoretical and a practical point of view. However, model validation and the assessment of the uncertainty of large-scale spatial dynamic models deserve considerable future attention. The implications of land use change decisions on individual and communal costs are discussed and ways to improve the methodology are outlined. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.

TI Sustainable homeservices? Toward household services that enhance
   ecological, social and economic sustainability?
SO ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
LA English
DT Article

ID CONSUMPTION; LIFE
AB The idea of services replacing products is increasingly offered as a solution to making the production and consumption patterns of the affluent consumers more sustainable. However, the discussion about 'sustainable services' or 'sustainable product-service systems' tends to emphasize the eco-efficiency perspective, rather than explicitly capture all sustainability aspects. Social or socioeconomic considerations are often forgotten or by-passed without scrutiny. This paper argues that there is the need for a concept of sustainable services in which the social sustainability aspect is also recognized with equal attention. Since a major part of private consumption occurs in the household context - living at home and moving to and from it-this paper will put forth the concept Of Sustainable homeservices and will suggest a way to assess sustainability of services directed to households. For assessing the sustainability of services directed to households, a set of indicators relating to the ecological, social and economic dimensions of sustainability is proposed. With the ann of giving an idea of how to assess homeservices in practical terms, the paper will also exemplify how one could operationalize these indicators on an ordinal rating scale. The conclusion is that it is possible to assess the sustainability of a homeservice in a relative fashion, using 'no service' or the 'product alternative' as the point of comparison.
   Households alone have a limited capacity to influence their consumption choices, because other actors set the frame. For this reason, institutional arrangements for making services easily available to households are outlined. It appears that housing organizations have a central role in the alternative option for organizing the supply of service provision. They are involved in five of the seven alternative ways of supplying services that could be identified. The role of the housing organization can vary from direct supply to lighter forms, such as cooperative arrangements with external service providers, or resident involvement.

ID ISEW
AB The Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI), a version of the Index of Sustainable Economic Welfare (ISEW), is a significantly more comprehensive approach to assessing economic progress than conventional measures like gross domestic product (GDP). GPI adjusts for income distribution effects, the value of household and volunteer work, costs of mobility and pollution, and the depletion of social and natural capital. 1SEW or GPI have been estimated for several countries around the world and a few Canadian provinces, but we report here on the first multi-scale application at the city, county and state levels in Vermont, USA. We show that it is feasible to apply the GPI approach at these smaller scales and to compare across scales and with the national average. Data limitations and problems still exist, but potential solutions to these problems also exist. All three Vermont scales had significantly higher GPI per capita since 1980 than the national average, indicating the major differences that can exist within countries. The GPI per capita for all Vermont scales was similar to the national average in the 1950-1980 period, but more than twice the national average by 2000. The main factors explaining this difference had to do with Vermont's much better environmental performance than the national average in the post-1980 period. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

AB In the context of ecosystem change and significant sociocultural, political, and institutional complexity, ecosystem managers and scientists (natural and social) need to be sensitive to processes of knowledge construction and legitimization and to the influence that explanations, or "narratives," of change and complexity have on the policy process. Using the Banawa-Marawola uplands of Central Sulawesi, Indonesia, as an example, this review shows how narratives of change and complexity linking the subsistence agroecological practices of upland communities, deforestation, and biodiversity loss, and the policy interventions that result, emerge within several institutionalized and embedded perspectives, including (a) an entrenched political and administrative discourse on modernization and development in Indonesia, (b) a subsequent emphasis on the culturalization or civilization of upland groups considered backward or primitive, and (c) linear or equilibrium explanations of upland change linking population growth and environmental decline. As this review suggests, integrative analyses require historically sensitive frameworks that take into account the sociocultural, politicoinstitutional, and ecological dimensions of change and complexity. Such frameworks are more likely to succeed in challenging the stabilizing assumptions about the role of local people in ecosystem modification, particularly in regions where there is a long history of nature-society interaction.

AB During the period 1996-1999 a joint field research programme (BIOPRINT-II) funded by the European Union was undertaken. The main objective of this project was the deployment of biochemical fingerprint techniques of soil invertebrate biomarkers for assessing the exposure and effect of toxicants on soil invertebrates in the field. The aim was to apply these techniques in the field focusing on a a chronically polluted field near a lead and zinc smelter in Avonmouth (UK). Therefore six sites were selected from which organisms were either sampled or transplanted to or from the laboratory. The project has provided a unique opportunity to apply a series of biological test methodologies in order to determine the hazard posed to soil sustainability and by inference soil biodiversity and function. This work has attempted to understand the linkage between effects measured at the molecular or cellular level and relate these to changes at higher levels of biological organisation. Here we evaluated the links between biomarkers and soil function parameters. The paper aims to summarize and explore the necessary caveats that must be understood before soil biomarker test systems may be used to strengthen the risk assessment process.

AB For most of their history, two separate, but related, after-school education programs operated independently, coordinated by separate teams of university and community partners. When the existence of the programs was threatened, a community-university coalition formed in an effort to sustain them. This coincided with the university-community teams' joint response to a reorientation of the statewide university system's policies on affirmative action. This article uses Cuban's framework of sustainability and cultural-historical activity theory to analyze a process of communication, collaboration, creativity, and continuing that resulted in sustaining the two programs as well as the expansion and development of multiple new programs.

AB The reduction of greenhouse gases' emissions (especially CO2) from power plants is a subject of great debate. In order to design sustainable electricity production scenarios, the reduction options have to be assessed from an environmental life cycle perspective. In this paper, a life cycle assessment of (i) four scenarios of coal based electricity production, including coal and biomass (waste or cultivated) co-firing and combustion, flue gas CO2 capture and coal ash valorisation and (ii) one hypothetical scenario of biomass combustion were conducted. The results showed that biomass co-combustion is always environmentally better than the sole CO2 capture and/or biomass combustion. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT; IMPACTS
AB All nations of the world depend on fossil fuels for their energy needs. However the obligation to reduce CO2 and other gaseous emissions in order to be in conformity with the Kyoto agreement is the reason behind which countries turn to non-polluting renewable energy sources. In this paper the pollution caused by the burning of fossil fuels is initially presented followed by a study on the environmental protection offered by the two most widely used renewable energy systems, i.e. solar water heating and solar space heating. The results presented in this paper show that by using solar energy, considerable amounts of greenhouse polluting gasses are avoided. For the case of a domestic water heating system, the saving, compared to a conventional system, is about 80% with electricity or Diesel backup and is about 75% with both electricity and Diesel backup. In the case of space heating and hot water system the saving is about 40%. It should be noted, however, that in the latter, much greater quantities of pollutant gasses are avoided. Additionally, all systems investigated give positive and very promising financial characteristics. With respect to life cycle assessment of the systems, the energy spent for manufacture and installation of the solar systems is recouped in about 1.2 years, whereas the payback time with respect to emissions produced from the embodied energy required for the manufacture and installation of the systems varies from a few months to 9.5 years according to the fuel and the particular pollutant considered. Moreover, due to the higher solar contribution, solar water heating systems have much shorter payback times than solar space heating systems. It can, therefore, be concluded that solar energy systems offer significant protection to the environment and should be employed whenever possible in order to achieve a sustainable future.

AB Tire rubber use in energy generation allows both to get cheaper energy and to eliminate a nonbiodegradable solid residue. Previously, to be established as a common practice in energy generation, its environmental impact must be assessed to ensure a sustainable development. With this aim, rubber from tire and 10/90 and 30/70 tire rubber/coal blends have been burnt in an atmospheric fluidized-bed reactor at different temperatures (750, 800, and 850 degreesC), keeping the gas speed (0.24 m/s) and the oxygen excess (5%) constant. The environmental impact on soil, water, and air because of the rubber from discarded tire combustion is deeply studied in this work. The disposal and lixiviation of the generated bottom ash as well as the atmospheric emissions in fly ash are analyzed by proximate and ultimate analysis, scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy, and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry.

AB The UK Government is committed by their 2003 Energy White Paper to developing a sustainable energy economy in the 21st Century, and to taking a lead in reducing CO2 emissions amongst the industrialised (OECD) countries. A target of reducing these emissions to 60% of their existing figure by 2050 has been adopted. The only way in which this fall could be achieved is by significantly reducing primary energy consumption to between 45% and 75% of the present demand; depending on the energy technology mix. This requires the widespread adoption of energy-saving measures across the economy. It is in this area that thermodynamic analysis can make a major contribution to identifying where the improvement potential lies. Energy options are inevitably constrained by thermodynamic limits on individual plant and the sector as a whole. Nevertheless, energy policy advice to Governments, particularly that in the UK, tends to be dominated by views from the humanities and social sciences. Thermodynamic ideas, by contrast, often appear rather esoteric to the non-specialist; this dichotomy is arguably a manifestation of C.P. Snow's 'two cultures' (the apparent divide between the arts and social sciences on the one hand, and engineering and the natural sciences on the other). Other methods for generating policy advice, including that from the discipline of economics, will not provide substitute insights to those of energy and exergy analysis. However, thermodynamic techniques such as these should not be used alone, but as part of a broader interdisciplinary 'toolkit' of sustainability assessment methods. They cannot determine, for example, the economic consequences or the environmental (ecotoxicological) impact of different energy technologies. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

DE micro-generation; co-provision; electricity
ID COPRODUCTION
AB Electricity generation by individual households (known as micro-generation) is attracting an increasing amount of interest within government, industry and the research community. This paper focuses on the potential for micro-generation to contribute to a more active role for household energy consumers in the development and operation of the energy system. The paper applies the concept of energy service co-provision to aid an understanding of this more active role. It considers a number of alternative models for micro-generation investment that imply different kinds of co-provision by consumers and energy companies. The analysis focuses in particular on the economics of these models in the UK, the associated barriers to micro-generation investment, and the scope for overcoming these barriers through changes in fiscal rules. Having conducted this economic analysis, the paper concludes with a brief discussion of the wider implications of these models for consumer behaviour. In particular, it considers the impact of IT and control systems that might be employed to facilitate energy service co-provision that includes micro-generation. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The likely extension of commercial inland navigation in the future could increase hazards directly impacting on the nurseries of freshwater fish, especially for smaller individuals with limited swimming abilities, One limitation of the evaluation of inland navigation on fish assemblages is the lack of suitable hydraulic models. This article presents a hydraulic model to assess the increase of navigation-induced physical forces due to higher vessel speed, length, and drought in a low-flowing waterway related to maximum swimming performance of fish to (1) foresee hazards of enhancement of inland navigation, (2) derive construction measures to minimize the hydraulic impact on small fish, and (3) improve fish recruitment in waterways.
   The derived model computed current velocities induced by passing commercial vessels in inland waterways experimentally verified and parameterized in a German lowland waterway. Results were linked with a model of maximum fish swimming performance to elucidate consequences for freshwater fish populations. The absolute magnitude of navigation-induced current limits the availability of littoral habitats for small fish. Typical navigation - induced current velocities of 0.7-1 m/s in the straight reaches of waterways will be maintained by fish longer than 42 mm only. Smaller juveniles unable to withstand those currents could become washed out, injured, or displaced. In contrast, in small local bays, the navigation-induced current declined significantly. According to our model, in a 20-m extended bay, the return current drops below 0.11 m/s, corresponding to the maximum swimming speed of a 9-mm-long fish. Thus, enhancing shoreline development by connecting oxbows, tributaries, and especially by purpose-built bays limits the impact on fish recruitment without restricting navigation resulting in more precautionary and sustainable inland navigation.

AB The Household Responsibility System initiated in the late 1970s in China has brought a profound change to its rural economy. The shift from the collective farming system to individual family farms has changed land management. The change, including fertilization and crop systems, may have significant effects on soil quality and agro-environmental sustainability. However, very little research is being carried out on the impact of reformed land tenure systems on the spatial variability of soil nutrients. In this study, geostatistics was applied to analyze changes in the spatial variability of soil organic matter and nutrients in paddy fields in Pinghu County, China after 20 years of land management change. In 1984 and 2002, 617 and 131 locations were selected, respectively, for collecting surface soil samples to analyze soil organic matter (SOM), total nitrogen (TN), available phosphorus (AP), and available potassium (AK). From 1984 to 2002, variabililly of the SOM and TN changed from strongly to moderately spatial-dependent, and the variability of AP remained weakly dependent on space, but that of the AK changed from moderately to weakly spatial-dependent. That the trend of the variability of four soil properties in 2002 became weaker than that in 1984 showed that the extrinsic factors (soil management practices, such as fertilization) weakened the effect by intrinsic factors (soil formation factors, such as soil parent materials) owing to a long period of land management change. The temporal geographic maps of the SOM and nutrients spatial distributions suggested that the concentrations of the SOM and nutrients had been changed to different extents during the period. Significant increase in AP and decrease in AK were noted. The changes were likely due to the imbalance between N, R and K fertilizers and increased grain yield.

AB Theoretical work has demonstrated that sustainable development requires nondeclining per capita wealth, where wealth is defined to include produced, natural, human and social capital. Several studies have attempted to measure total national wealth or changes in wealth, but have been seriously hampered by a lack of data, especially for natural and human capital. To address this problem, the UN and other international statistical agencies developed a standardized framework for environmental accounts, the System of integrated Environmental and Economic Accounts (SEEA). Using the newly available asset accounts for natural capital, national wealth accounts are constructed and used to assess the contrasting development paths of Botswana and Namibia. Botswana, with an explicit policy of reinvestment of resource rents, has roughly tripled per capita wealth and national income over the past two decades. Namibia, with no explicit policy to use natural capita to build wealth, has seen per capita wealth and income decline.

AB A system of metrics is proposed for a rough-guide evaluation of the greenness of new and existing chemical technologies as well as for the analysis of flow sheets of new processes. The proposed methodology is based on a hierarchical approach. The main feature of the proposed system is the reflection of the stakeholder relevance of various aspects of green chemistry at different levels of the hierarchy and the corresponding system boundaries. Therefore, the developed methodology provides a basis for the multiobjective comparison of alternative technologies in terms of their greenness. A novel technology for recovery of volatile organic chemicals (VOCs) using monolithic adsorbents has been evaluated in terms of its environmental efficiency using a small set of indicators assembled into a hierarchical metric. A comparison between incineration and recovery of VOCs via adsorption has been performed using the proposed methodology. The comparison highlights considerable environmental advantages of the recovery technology. Flow sheet analysis points out which stages of the adsorption process could be further improved. Indicators have been evaluated within defined system boundaries.

AB This paper discusses the limitations, omissions and value judgements of the application of conventional economic analysis in the evaluation of climate change mitigation policies. It is argued that these have biased the result of the assessment models towards the recommendation of less aggressive mitigation strategies. Consequently, this paper questions whether they provide appropriate policy recommendations. The unequal distribution of rights implicitly assumed in conventional economic analyses applied to climate change is questioned and an alternative approach considering a distribution of rights consistent with sustainable development is put forward. Finally, the points that an analysis consistent with sustainable development should take into account are presented.

AB In order to address contemporary issues economics and decision sciences need to expand their empirical relevance by introducing more and more realistic (thus more complex) assumptions in their models. One of the most interesting research directions in the field of public economics is the attempt to introduce political constraints, interest groups and collusion effects explicitly (J.J. Laffont, Incentives and Political Economy, 2000). The main argument developed here is the proposal of the concept of social multi-criteria evaluation (SMCE) as a possible useful framework for the application of social choice to the difficult policy problems of our millennium, where, as stated by Funtowicz and Ravetz, "facts are uncertain, values in dispute, stakes high and decisions urgent". This paper starts from the following main questions:
   1. Why "social" multi-criteria evaluation?
   2. How should such an approach be developed?
   The foundations of SMCE are set up by referring to concepts from complex system theory and philosophy, such as reflexive complexity, post-normal science and incommensurability.
   To give some operational guidelines on the application of SMCE basic questions to be answered are
   1. How is it possible to deal with technical incommensurability?
   2. How can we deal with the issue of social incommensurability?
   To answer these questions, using theoretical considerations and lessons learned from real-world case studies, is the main objective of the present article. (C) 2003 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Large investments are being made in the establishment of tree plantations on degraded land in Asia. These initiatives are often politically driven and aspire to achieve both economic and environmental benefits. However, the lack of clarity about the precise objectives of these schemes means that they often fail to yield either local economic or global environmental benefits. There is often a failure to negotiate with all concerned stakeholders and to recognize and resolve trade-offs. Subsidies have often had perverse impacts, and market forces may be better drivers of economic objectives of restoration programmes. Security of tenure and use rights is an important but often neglected requirement for achieving sustainability. Remnant patches of natural vegetation, even when degraded, are often valuable sources of local biodiversity in restoration schemes. The spatial patterns of different types of forest and of non-forest land are important determinants of environmental values. Biodiversity conservation requires maintaining or re-establishing habitat strips to connect natural forest blocks and protect ecological gradients. However, even monoculture plantations often have significant biodiversity value. The fundamental principles of ecosystem approaches as adopted by the Convention for the Conservation of Biological Diversity and principles for successful common property resource management provide valuable frameworks for forest restoration schemes.

AB Tropical forest area is disappearing at the rate of 13.5 million ha each year, due mainly to clearing for agriculture and shifting cultivation. Timber harvesting results in more than 5 million ha of tropical forest annually being transformed into degraded, poorly managed, logged-over forests. The reduction and degradation caused by anthropological activities affect not only the sustainable production of timber but also the global environment. Accurate scientific information will enable managers to devise silvicultural systems to enhance soil properties and forest resources important for sustainable production and to minimize deleterious impacts of harvesting and short-rotation plantations. Ultimately, rehabilitation can increase the area of forest as well as conserve remaining primary forests and environmental quality.
   Rehabilitation aims to improve biological diversity, increase commercial value of timber and non-timber products, increase forest functions and improve soil fertility. Technical advances will reduce logging impacts, accelerate natural regeneration and improve species selection, enrichment, sustainable site management, catalytic planting and site evaluation and classification. Socio-economic reform should focus on local community participation and acceptance. The CIFOR/Japan project has undertaken research in many countries to evaluate impacts of harvesting and fires on forest ecosystems and to develop methods to rehabilitate logged-over forests and degraded forestlands in ways that are biologically successful as well as socio-economically acceptable.
   In Indonesia, CIFOR collaborates with Universitas Mulawarman at the Bukit Soeharto Education Forest, a mixed dipterocarp forest logged by INHUTANI I in 1976. The approach to rehabilitation has been through the "taungya" system whereby farmers grow annual crops among newly planted trees. With the Instituto Nacional de Investigacion Agraria (INIA), Peru, the project is trialling revegetation of fallow fields abandoned after agricultural use in the Ucayali region of the Peruvian Amazon. There is specific interest in selecting tree species with high economic value that grow rapidly in abandoned agricultural land and on infertile soils. Early results point to promising species. The project also involves small farmers in silvicultural activities and species selection. (C) 2004 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB China is a vast country with a diverse physical environment, rich biodiversity and complex forest types. Old China has left us with few forests and a poor base for forestry. Owing to the rapid growth of population, coupled with the development of agriculture and urban construction, as well as improper forest management, the degradation of forest resources in China has been accelerating. As a result of forest degradation, environmental problems including soil erosion and loss of biodiversity are being experienced and natural hazards are occurring with increasing frequency. The Chinese government has increased its focus on conservation of forests and restoration of degraded forest ecosystems. Particularly in recent years, a series of measures have been put in place. This paper presents a general introduction to the technical as well as policy aspects involved in the restoration of degraded forest ecosystems and the approach to sustainable forestry in China.

AB Ecosystem management is a key strategy for sustainable development of natural resources. A workable definition of ecosystem is necessary to manage ecosystems successfully. Hierarchical grouping of ecosystem division in spatial scale is also needed to define concrete forest ecosystems.
   South Korean landscape is divided into five ecoprovinces, 16 ecoregions and 120 ecodistricts. The Kangwon Ecoregion is located in the centre of the east coast of the Korean Peninsula. It is characterized as dry and very windy in spring, and is very susceptible to forest fires. In 1996, this ecoregion experienced the largest forest fire ever recorded to that time; 3762 ha of forestland were burned. The Korea Forest Research Institute has studied the burnt areas extensively, using data on regional climate and vegetation, landform and geology, forest soils, plant communities, hydrology, pests, wildlife and pine mushrooms. Basic principles of restoration were established and long-term ecological research has been initiated. A forest fire, six times bigger than that of 1996, occurred in Kangwon Ecoregion in 2000. A comprehensive and integrated investigation group, including representatives from the Forest Service, Ministry of Environment and local and non-governmental organizations has been formed. The group, composed of 176 specialists including professors and researchers from various disciplines, has proposed concrete principles and future management strategies for restoration of degraded forest areas based on integration of the ecological, social and economic sectors.

AB The goal of international cooperation is to promote sustainable forestry through diverse partnerships involving individuals, communities, industries, governments, institutions and organizations. Through advice, education and training, joint research and exchange of experiences, information and technical know-how, cooperation can bring together baseline information for the world's community. In this way, developed countries and international forestry and forestry research organizations can assist developing countries to enhance dialogue, partnerships and inter-relationships in forestry at a global level. NGOs also can play an intermediary role between government and the private sector. They are becoming increasingly important in facilitating the transfer of technology, for promoting public awareness and negotiating on international environment issues. Government support for NGOs has enabled the organizations to perform their work better and more efficiently.
   The establishment of the Northeast Asian Forest Forum (NEAFF) in Mongolia and China is timely and meaningful in the sense that the Mongolian and Chinese governments are working diligently to plant trees and combat desertification. The governments are no longer able to tolerate environmental degradation accumulated over the past several decades. NEAFF in Seoul fully supports the collaborative efforts between Korea, China and Mongolia, universities and research institutions in Korea, and international tree-planting NGOs in the international campaign to plant trees on bare lands and desert in China and Mongolia. Such efforts to expand projects in reforestation and combating desertification, especially within the two countries, will provide opportunities for neighbouring countries to expand their dialogue, as well as bridge differences, by addressing common environmental issues across these regions. A network is being developed, and part of this work is already in progress to promote synergies and comparative research on the forest ecosystems of northeast Asian countries. The key to a successful network is the coordination of activities by the participating countries. (C) 2004 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Research per se is a highly heterogeneous activity with a variety of objectives, actors and stakeholders, and a range of mechanisms to enhance collaboration while minimizing cost and unnecessary duplication. There is an urgent need to disseminate the results of research in forms that can be understood by policy-makers, administrators, the media and the public as well as by resource managers and peer scientists.
   To be effective, research itself needs to be restored. It must be both proactive and reactive to policy and public issues and use modern techniques of information technology and networking. Current human demands on forests for social, environmental and economic benefits require new, interdisciplinary approaches to research and rapid implementation of relevant results by appropriate stakeholders.
   In this paper, the extents, rates and causes of deforestation are identified together with the criteria and indicators of sustainable forest management that have specific relevance to restoration of site productivity. The changes in forest policies and management objectives over the second half of the 20th century are described and it is recognized that the role of forests as global resources may conflict with national sovereignty.

AB This technical paper reviews CERTFOR, the Chilean initiative for sustainable plantation forestry. Since its release in January 2002, 1.5 million ha of Pinus radiata and Eucalyptus species plantations have been certified as well managed, Forestal Arauco S.A. becoming the first company and major player with nearly 35% of total planted woodlands in Chile. QMl conducted the audits using a multi-disciplinary international team. The structure of the standard includes 9 principles, 43 criteria and 190 indicators. In early 2004, the PEFC started a public consultation period for the assessment of CERTFOR. Once completed, it will be the first non-European standard to be recognized by PEFC.

AB in recent decades, debates have erupted and intensified about the relationships between religions, cultures, and the earth's living systems. Some scholars have argued that ritual and religion can play a salutary role in helping humans regulate natural systems in ecologically sustainable ways. Others have blamed one or more religions, or religion in general, for promoting worldviews and cultures that precipitate environmental damage. Religious production in recent years suggests not only that many religions are becoming more environmentally friendly but also that a kind of civic planetary earth religion may be evolving. Examples of such novel, nature-related religious production allow us to ponder whether, and if so in what ways, the future of religion may be green. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID WATER-RESOURCES; SAFE YIELD; UNCERTAINTY
AB Ground water resource management programs are paying increasing attention to the integration of ground water and surface water in the planning process. Many plans, however, show a sophistication in approach and presentation that masks a fundamental weakness in the overall analysis. The plans usually discuss issues of demand and yield, yet never directly address a fundamental issue behind the plan-how to define sustainable yield of an aquifer system. This paper points out a number of considerations that must be addressed in defining sustainable yield in order to make the definition more useful in practical water resource planning studies. These include consideration for the spatial and temporal aspects of the problem, the development of a conceptual water balance, the influence of boundaries and changes in technology on the definition, the need to examine water demand as well as available supply, the need for stakeholder involvement, and the issue of uncertainty in our understanding of the components of the hydrologic system.

AB The Medicare Trustees' 2004 report indicates that the Part A Hospital Insurance trust fund will be exhausted by 2019. Medicare's sustainable growth rate (SGR) formula for physician reimbursement is widely recognized as being flawed; if it is not reformed, it may result in reduced access to physician services for beneficiaries. MedPAC proposes an alternative to the SGR formula that involves explicit consideration of Medicare program objectives and ensures that payments for physician services be adequate to maintain access. Section 646 of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act (MMA) of 2003 may provide answers regarding providing high-quality care in fee-for-service Medicare.

ID SAFE MOTHERHOOD
AB High maternal morbidity and mortality in many developing countries are highly associated with poor access to and quality of health care. Here we review the economic feasibility of the WHO's mother-baby package as a means of reducing maternal and neonatal mortality and morbidity in Tanzania. This paper examines the costs of maternal health care in Tanzania, and how much can we expect households to contribute to these expenses, if the MBP were implemented. Using data from the Tanzanian 1993 Living Standard Measurement Survey (LSMS), we analyze responses from 757 women of reproductive age who have had a birth in the 12 months preceding the survey. We estimate current spending on maternal health care by different socio-economic groups and its share in relation to total household expenditures. Using logistic regression analyses, we examine the effect of the prices paid for maternal health care on the likelihood of using antenatal and safe delivery services, controlling for relevant socio-economic and demographic factors. Results show that if the MBP recovered 100% of its costs, most of the households would have to allocate more than half of their annual consumption on maternal health care. Poor socio-economic groups would experience the greatest increase in service utilization if MBP care were subsidized. In the face of scarce resources, subsidies should be targeted according to socio-economic group, in order to attain equitable and sustainable maternal health services. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

ID HEALTH-POLICY
AB Technical assistance agencies have a sustainable impact on the health systems of the countries they are operating in. As well as policy-makers at the national level, technical assistance agencies see themselves confronted that their interventions should be based on evidence, usually meaning the results of research. This study has the aim to analyse role of research in the implementation of technical assistance.
   We sent a questionnaire to all health project managers of the 'German Agency for Technical Co-operation' and performed a qualitative case study in one of the health projects. Forty-seven of 80 (58.8%) of the questionnaires were completed and sent back. The managers considered publications of International Organisations (IOs), scientific articles and local research as most important for their work. The case study showed application problems in the daily work. Research use not only depends on the relevance of the data but also on analytical skills, linguistic barriers and technical access to research by the potential users.
   The role of knowledge and information management has to be clearly defined in an organisation of technical assistance. The specific needs at the different levels have to be analysed so that skills and resources can be allocated adequately. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The objective of the present paper was to identify the profile and needs of social and healthcare users in Spain who required long-term care. To achieve this goal, an extensive empirical study was carried out in 2001 of a typical southern European region: the Valencia Autonomous Region in Spain. The method used was a questionnaire-based survey. The data collection instrument was a questionnaire comprising 119 questions grouped into seven sections: social and demographic data; clinical diagnosis and treatment; living environment; degree of dependence in activities of daily living (ADLs); cognitive state; social support; and the social, demographic and attendance data of the carer, if available. The sampling was carried out in two strata, i.e. social and healthcare: first, the authors randomly selected the centres and services as sampling points, and then they randomly selected the subjects. A total of 1265 people were interviewed. The results show different care profiles: users aged under 65 years were mostly mentally ill and/or drug users requiring short- and medium-term care from the health services, while those aged over 65 years had chronic illnesses for which they were actively receiving treatment, were functionally dependent for ADLs, and were normally receiving social care that basically provided company and resolved functional limitations.

AB Water is now a global political agenda and water science is part of it. The United Nations Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) in 2000, the World Summit on Sustainable Development in 2002, the 3rd World Water Forum and Ministerial Conference in Kyoto in 2003 and the G8 Summit in Evian in 2003 were all concerned about urgent global water issues and call for international scientific research collaboration. Hydrology is responding to such political commitments with various scientific initiatives that include the International Association of Hydrological Sciences (IAHS) Predictions in Ungauged Basins (PUB), the Global Energy and Water Circulation Experiments (GEWEX) Coordinated Enhanced Observation Period (CEOP), and the Global Water Systems Project (GWSP). These initiatives will play key roles in the implementation of the new intergovern mental project, Global Earth Observing System of Systems, under preparation by Global Observation Summits from 2003 to 2005. In order to achieve the MDGs, hydrological science has to play a major role supporting policy makers by overcoming methodological obstacles and providing the necessary information. This paper emphasizes that: the availability of ground measurements is a limiting factor that prevents the full use of scientific knowledge; hydrology has to integrate and downscale the various global information into local-scale information useful for river basin management; as the availability of professional personnel is in critical short supply, in addition to funds needed, to achieve the MDGs any scientific research should always accompany capacity-building programmes to close the science divide between developed and developing nations.

AB Research has shown a close correlation between the decline of the UK Skylark Alauda arvensis population and the replacement of spring-sown cereals with winter-sown varieties, in which advanced sward development prevents successful multiple nesting attempts and reduces access for foraging. Widescale reversal of sowing times is unlikely for commercial reasons, so research has recently focused on ways of manipulating the sward structure of winter wheat to prolong access to nest-sites and food. An RSPB pilot study investigated leaving small 'undrilled patches' in otherwise conventionally managed winter wheat crops. This option was later incorporated into a fully replicated experimental design, as part of the Sustainable Arable Farming For an Improved Environment (SAFFIE) project. This large consortium-led project aims to test solutions for improving biodiversity within winter-cereal-dominated rotations. The experiment described here ran over 2002-3, with three field-scale 'treatments' on 15 sites in the first year. The treatments compare (1) conventional winter wheat, (2) winter wheat sown in double-normal width (25 cm) wide-spaced rows (WSR) and (3) winter wheat with two 4-m by 4-m undrilled patches per hectare (UP). Results from the 2002 breeding season showed that undrilled patch treatments supported more breeding Skylarks for longer, most likely by aiding accessibility of food. WSR rows were little used by Skylarks and did not improve the abundance of favoured seed and invertebrate food items over conventional crops. Nesting performance and foraging patterns are discussed with reference to invertebrate food abundance and its accessibility, as determined by sward structure.

AB Novel carbon dioxide (CO2) soluble photoresists were synthesized based on random copolymers of 1,1-dihydroperfluorooctylmethacrylate and 2-tetrahyrdopyranyl methacrylate. These resins, along with specially designed CO2-soluble photoacid generators, were utilized to demonstrate the potential for a new "dry" lithographic process. Photoresist spin casting, development, and stripping were all carried out using only liquid and supercritical CO2 as the processing medium. A novel high-pressure spin coating process was used to deposit the photoresist films. Parameters such as resist sensitivity, contrast, and resolution were investigated. Wafers were imaged using both 248- and 193-nm radiation, demonstrating the potential of this new photoresist platform for use as a sustainable technology for the microelectronics industry.

AB Despite a recent surge of interest, the subject of pricing in general and value-based pricing in particular has received little academic investigation. Yet, pricing has a huge impact on financial results, both in absolute terms and relative to other instruments of the marketing mix. The objective of this paper is to present a comprehensive framework for pricing decisions which considers all relevant dimensions and elements for profitable, and sustainable pricing decisions. The theoretical framework is useful for guiding new product pricing decisions as well as for implementing price-repositioning strategies for existing products. The practical application of this framework is illustrated by a case study involving the pricing decision for a major product launch at a global chemical company. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc.

ID COLLABORATION
AB Utilizing an integration of social-cognitivist and socio-cultural approaches, this study - comparing the interactive processes among peers and their mentor in two contrasting groups - was designed to explore the reasons why two learning groups, engaged in an inquiry-based learning project with comparatively sustained discussion, produced vastly differing results. Using discourse threads as the unit of analysis, together with the mentor's perceptions of group facilitation, the findings of this study highlighted the effect of group dynamics upon the mentor's facilitation. Group interaction with explicit and decisive discourse will result in a better understanding for the mentor of the group's zones of proximal development (different ZPDs), and will provide greater opportunity for effective group scaffolding.

AB Coral reefs contain the most speciose communities of fishes on this planet, so it is appropriate to use these to explore how fish species are organized into communities. While descriptive data suggest that the diverse communities of fish on coral reefs are equilibrial assemblages of species, all finely adapted to specific and unique ecological roles, these are highly dynamic, non-equilibrial assemblages with structure driven more by patterns of recruitment and loss of individual fishes, than by patterns of resource allocation among differently adapted phenotypes. As a consequence, local assemblages differ in structure, and structure wanders through time. Individual fish are confronted by different mixes of species in different times and places. The recruitment process that drives these dynamics is complex, being governed by several mechanisms, and local populations receive some portion of their recruitment from distant sources. Information on this connectivity among local populations is critically important for management which is based increasingly on use of marine protected areas (no-take zones) both to conserve, and to provide sustainable fisheries. At present, however, we do not know the spatial scale or the extent of this connectivity, and this critical knowledge gap impedes both management, and fundamental understanding.

ID KARNATAKA; BIOENERGY
AB Biomass is a renewable source that accounts for nearly 33% of a developing country's energy needs. In India, it meets about 75% of the rural energy needs and the rural population constitutes 70% of the total population. Sustainable management of these resources requires better and timely decisions, which can lead to increased cost-efficiency and productivity. This would help in regional energy planning and conservation through appropriate decision interventions. To assist in strategic decision-making activities, considering spatial and temporal variables, Spatial Decision Support Systems (SDSS) are required. Spatial decision support system is an interactive computerized system that gathers data from a wide range of data sources, analyze the collected data, and then present it in a way that can be interpreted by the decision maker to deliver the precise information needed to make timely decisions. Decision support system (DSS) framework is designed and implemented to ease and speed up the use of environmental systems. In this regard, to assist planners to plan and manage bioresources in a sustainable way, Biomass Energy Potential Assessment (BEPA) decision support system is designed and is being implemented at regional levels through proper training. Overall objective of this DSS is the development of a set of tools aimed at transforming data into information and aid decisions for bioresources. This article outlines the design and implementation of DSS for assessment of biomass energy potential of a region considering the resources available and the demand. It is designed with user friendly GUI's (Graphic User Interface) using VB (Visual Basic) as frontend with Microsoft Access database as the backend. This helps to build executive information systems and reporting tools that tap vast data resources and deliver information in the context of daily processes. This tool can be used to form a core of practical methodology that will result in more resilience in less time and can be used by decision-making bodies to assess the impacts of various scenarios and to review cost and benefits of decisions to be made. It also offers means of entering, accessing and interpreting the information for the purpose of sound decision making.

ID INTENSIVE-CARE; MALARIA; AUDIT
AB Objective: Our objective was to identify the frequency, causes, and avoidable factors of severe acute maternal morbidity (SAMM) in four non-specialist hospitals in rural South Africa. Method: We conducted a prospective audit using criteria for SAMM suited to the diagnostic and treatment facilities available in the primary hospital setting. For each case of SAMM, a local audit team assessed the standard of care against local management guidelines and examined avoidable factors. An external specialist also retrospectively examined avoidable factors. Result: The facility-based incidence of SAMM was 541 cases per 100,000 births (95% CI 368-767). The commonest organ systems involved were cerebral (42%), coagulation (19%), and vascular dysfunctions (16%). The commonest obstetric diagnoses were eclampsia (39%) and obstetric haemorrhage (32%). Approximately 65% of cases were avoidable. Conclusion: A qualitative case review audit of SAMM in a non-specialist rural setting appears feasible and sustainable, and provides valuable information towards improving deficiencies in maternal care.

AB The use of hydrogen as an alternative fuel is gaining more and more acceptance as the environmental impact of hydrocarbons becomes more evident. A life cycle assessment study has been carried out to investigate the environmental aspects of hydrogen production. Production by natural gas steam reforming and production upon renewable energy sources are examined. Hydrogen is selected as a future alternative fuel because of the absence of CO2 emissions from its use, its high-energy content and its combustion kinetics, A very large number of environmental burdens result from he operation of the different hydrogen production routes. A complete and accurate identification and quantification of the environmental emissions has been attempted. The use of wind, hydropower and solar thermal energy for the production of hydrogen are the most environmental benign methods. The benefits and the drawbacks of the competing hydrogen production systems are presented. (C) 2004 International Association for Hydrogen Energy. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

SO INTERNATIONAL SUGAR JOURNAL

DT Article
AB The potential of biorenewables is about to be rediscovered. However it is essential that true sustainability in the sense of economics, environmental impact and cultural/social acceptability is taken as the yardstick against which biorenewables are developed. Whilst considerable input has been put into R & D and proof of concept, little has been achieved in terms of industry pull. This issue needs addressing although it has to be recognised that there are a number of reasons why uptake of biorenewables has been limited. Markets of biorenewables as exemplified by the IENICA (Interactive European Network for Industrial Crops and their Application) project are large and considerably under exploited. This limits economic, environmental and rural benefits. If uptake of biorenewables is a desired strategic target then definitive strategies confirming this and supporting measures will be essential.

LA English

DE environmental taxes; Pigouvian tax; political support; majority voting
ID OPTIMAL TAXATION; EXTERNALITIES; POLICY
AB This paper studies the issue of political support for environmental taxes. The environmental tax is determined by majority voting, given a refund rule that specifies the allocation of tax proceeds. The refund rule is chosen by a welfare-maximizing constitutional planner. We show that: (i) The equilibrium tax rate is increasing in the proportion of tax reductions based on wage incomes. (ii) If labor and capital income taxes are reduced in the same proportion, to keep the government's budget balanced, majority voting yields a rate of environmental taxation that is lower than the optimal (Pigouvian) level. (iii) To mitigate this negative bias, the government reduces wage taxes by a higher proportion than capital income taxes. (iv) The final outcome will either be the Pigouvian tax or else all reductions will be given in wage taxes. This depends on individuals' preferences for the polluting good as well as wage and capital income distributions.

TI Irrigation externalities and agricultural sustainability in
   South-eastern Nigeria
SO JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS
LA English
DT Article
ID AREA
AB Agricultural intensification by irrigation is increasingly regarded as the key to solving food supply problems in Sub-Saharan Africa. Conversely, mounting empirical evidence suggests that irrigation externalities might preclude long-term sustainability of arable agriculture. Choosing between intensive irrigation schemes and less intensive farming systems is therefore, problematic. The paper examines the implications of irrigation systems intensification in south-eastern Nigeria using adjacent rain-fed farms as the counterfactual. The analyses found mixed results. When first introduced, the irrigation scheme increased marginal factor productivity and gross margins but this has subsequently declined to the extent that the marginal factor product of land has become negative. The annual yields of the irrigated farms were also less stable than those of the less intensive rain-fed farms. These results indicate the dilemma that irrigation externalities present to sustainable agricultural policy and suggest a need to look again at the potential for developments in rain-fed systems.

TI Economic impacts of technology, population growth and soil erosion at
   watershed level: The case of the Ginchi in Ethiopia
SO JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS
LA English
DT Article
AB A dynamic bio-economic model is used to show that. without technological and policy intervention, soil loss levels, income and nutrition could not be substantially or sustainably improved in a highland area of Ethiopia. Although cash incomes could rise by more than 40% over a twelve-year planning period, average per ha soil losses could be as high as 31 tonnes per ha. With the adoption of an integrated package of new technologies, however results show the possibility of an average two-and-a-half fold increase in cash incomes and a 28% decline in aggregate erosion levels even with a population growth rate of 2.3%. Moreover, a minimum daily calorie intake of 2000 per adult equivalent could be met from, on-farm production with no significant increases in erosion. However. higher rates of growth in nutritional requirements and population introduce significant strains on the watershed system. From a policy perspective, there is a need for a more secure land tenure policy than currently prevailing to facilitate uptake of the new technology package, and a shift from the current livestock management strategy to one that encourages livestock keeping as a commercial enterprise. It would also imply a shift to a imore site-specific approach to land management.

AB Sequestration of Carbon in Soil Organic Matter (SOCSOM) in Senegal is a multi-disciplinary development project planned and refined through two international workshops. The project was implemented by integrating a core of international experts in remote sensing, biogeochemical modeling, community socio-economic assessments, and carbon measurements in a fully collaborative manner with Senegal organizations, national scientists, and local knowledge and expertise. The study addresses the potential role developing countries in semi-arid areas can play in climate mitigation activities. Multiple benefits to smallholders could accrue as a result of management practices to re-establish soil carbon content lost because of land use changes or management practices that are not sustainable. The specific importance for the Sahel is because of the high vulnerability to climate change in already impoverished rural societies.
   The project focuses on four objectives in specific locations across the agroecological zones of Senegal. These objectives are: use of soil sampling and biogeochemical modeling to quantify the biophysical potential for carbon sequestration and to determine the sensitivity of the carbon stocks to various management and climate scenarios, to evaluate the socio-economic and cultural requirements necessary for successful project implementation directed toward an aggregation of smallholders to sequester around 100,000 t carbon (C), to support capacity building to develop a Carbon Specialist Team, and to initiate extrapolation from site-specific project areas to the Sahel region and the national level.

ID SUSTAINABLE INTENSIFICATION; CARBON; SAVANNAS; FLUXES
AB Described is (1) the land use and land cover changes that have taken place in the Department of Velingara, an area of tropical dry woodland in south-central Senegal, (2) the biophysical and socio-economic drivers of those changes with an emphasis on transition to agricultural use, and (3) an assessment of the likelihood of intensification of agriculture in the Department. Results indicate that land devoted to agriculture, either in active cultivation or short-term fallow, is increasing. There is little evidence of agricultural intensification in most of Velingara, with extensification coming largely at the cost of reduction in both upland woodlands and riparian forest.

AB Total carbon stock in vegetation and soils was reduced 37% in south-central Senegal from 1900 to 2000. The decreasing trend will continue during the 21st century unless forest clearing is stopped, selective logging dramatically reduced, and climate change, if any, relatively small. Developing a sustainable fuelwood and charcoal production system could be the most feasible and significant carbon sequestration project in the region. If future climate changes dramatically as some models have predicted, cropland productivity will drop more than 65% around 2100, posing a serious threat to food security and the efficiency of carbon sequestration projects.

   corporate citizenship
AB Varying conceptions of and purposes for dialogue exist. Recent dialogic theorists and advocates urge exploration of forms of dialogue for learning and applying relational responsibilities within stakeholder networks. A related phenomenon has been the recent emergence of multi-stakeholder dialogues that involve parties significantly affected by major issues or concerns, such as environmental sustainability, that have complex and wide-spread implications. The extent to which these recent multi-stakeholder dialogues assume anything resembling the relationship or caring and the learning potentials of dialogic goals and processes suggested by recent advocates, however, can certainly be questioned. This article explores potential directions for research on enhanced forms of multi-stakeholder dialogues that emphasize goals of dialogic learning, relationship building, and business social responsiveness within a more reflective practice of corporate citizenship. Many issues and questions concerning appropriate antecedents, processes, and outcomes for these enhanced multi-stakeholder dialogues are raised and discussed.

TI Moderating unintended pollution: the role of sustainable product design
SO JOURNAL OF BUSINESS RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
DE waste; ecosystems; sustainable marketing; sustainable product design;
   eco-attributes
AB As we enter the 21st century, a well-documented scenario of pervasive ecosystems degradation has emerged as a political-social issue of global proportions. This general decline in ecosystems quality is linked to marketing as follows: marketing strategies facilitate consumption, which includes processes such as product manufacturing, distribution, and consumer use. These processes involve conversions of natural capital/resources, and all conversions generate waste-the antecedent to pollution. The outcome is designated as an unintended consequence of marketing because the decision-making processes that underlie marketing strategy formulation generally fail to recognize ecosystems impact as a standard decision influence. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate how sustainable product design can counter ecosystems degradation. Because the natural capital conversions that underlie product making are the source of the waste that is polluting ecosystems, it makes sense that engaging in sustainable product design initiatives that moderate this circumstance is a major and actionable solution to the problem.

AB The implementation of a peer support project in 13 schools from a disadvantaged background is discussed using the social ecological, systems and social construction theory as a theoretical guide in action research. The goal was to establish an alternative helping system in schools that was sustainable within the school system. In the implementation of peer support attention was given to the integration of the project into the existing context; encouraging participation on all levels, facilitating change and creating shared meanings, supporting the process of reorganizing and restructuring and providing feedback to facilitate further change. From a process evaluation of the programme implementation challenges in the implementation process were identified and recommendations made that could contribute to the optimal functioning and sustainability of the project to address the needs of learners and enhance well being in the school community.

AB We show how to decentralize constrained efficient allocations that arise from enforcement constraints between sovereign nations. In a pure exchange economy these allocations can be decentralized with private agents acting competitively and taking as given government default decisions on foreign debt. In an economy with capital these allocations can be decentralized if the government can tax capital income as well as default on foreign debt. The tax on capital income is needed to make private agents internalize a subtle externality. The decisions of the government can arise as an equilibrium of a dynamic game between governments.

AB In principle, a country cannot endure negative genuine savings for long periods of time without experiencing declining consumption. Nevertheless, theoreticians envisage two alternatives to explain how an exporter of non-renewable natural resources could experience permanent negative genuine savings and still ensure sustainability. The first one alleges that the capital gains arising from the expected improvement in the terms of trade would suffice to compensate for the negative savings of the resource exporter. The second alternative points at technological change as a way to avoid economic collapse. This paper uses the data of Venezuela and Mexico to empirically test the first of these two hypotheses. The results presented here prove that the terms of trade do not suffice to compensate the depletion of oil reserves in these two open economies. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

DE environmental performance; sustainability; spatial indicators; intensive
   use of space; multiple use of space
AB In this paper, as part of a diptych, we discuss the factor space as a means of improving the environmental performance of building projects. There are indicators for space use efficiency and several more or less broadly supported methods for assessment of environmental issues such as ecological quality, use of building materials and energy consumption. These are discussed in this paper. Assessment methods coupling space use to environmental indicators had not been available until now. Beforehand, plans with different spatial properties could therefore not be environmentally compared. We present a method for the implementation of space use in assessments concerning sustainability. This method was applied to the urban case study presented in our second paper in this journal. In this paper, we also present solutions for improved environmental performance through intensive and multiple use of space in the second, third and fourth dimension. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

DE railway station areas; sustainability; intensive use of space; multiple
   use of space; spatial indicators; environmental performance
AB As a follow-up to our first paper in this journal, this paper discusses projects involving intensive and multiple use of space recently completed or still being developed around railway stations in London (Broadgate and Canary Wharf), Paris (Seine Rive Gauche and La Defense) and Amsterdam (Zuidas and Bijlmer).
   The cases were compared on the basis of spatial, functional and environmental indicators, as treated in our first paper. The environmental performance of each of the cases was determined through comparison with a theoretic reference project for an equal number of users, yet with average West-European urban values for spatial, functional and environmental properties. The case studies revealed that a high floor space index is easily achievable in urban plans, implying efficient use of land and preservation of green area outside the city. For a mono-functional office area it is easier to achieve a high FSI than for a functionally diverse area with, e.g. apartments and shops. Therefore, with respect to a reference functionally equal to the cases, the predominant office character of Canary Wharf, Broadgate and La Defense results in good environmental performance. However, on the basis of a functionally diverse reference, for which monofunctional cases were enlarged with additional area for housing and amenities, the varied areas of Zuidas and Seine Rive Gauche perform best.
   With respect to average urban plans, the cases achieved environmental improvement of factor 1.5. This performance is restricted by the energy consumption of buildings, which has by far the most influence on the end result. The impact of stacking on the use of building materials and energy consumption of buildings is limited, and specific sustainability measures on the building scale were not involved in the calculations. The environmental benefits of intensive and multiple use of space are mainly demonstrated by the great improvement factors for the green area preserved and transport fuel consumption. The environmental costs used for these parameters were however relatively low, leading to a limited influence on the end results.
   Additional effective improvements to the environmental performance of dense and functionally diverse urban plans are sustainable building design and an integrated approach to urban utilities based on sustainable technologies. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT

DE access rights; fisheries; conflicts; local communities; Chilika lake
AB The status of fisheries in Chilika lake on the east coast of India is in a critical state. Local fishing communities feel that catches have reduced significantly and they face more hardships now to sustain their livelihoods. The study presents findings from field research and argues that notions of access are linked to community perceptions of the resource, the extent of authority they have to make decisions related to access and use rights and the traditional management strategies. State interventions through mechanization and new regulations have undermined the traditional management strategies leading to conflicts between different stakeholders and decline in traditional fisheries. There is a growing realization that without traditional fishing community's participation it is not possible to ensure sustainable use of the lake resources. Legitimizing community access and use rights is one of the key factors for successful management of fisheries. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

   WATER; POLLUTION; STREAM; ZONES; TRANSPORT; REDUCTION
AB Previous studies have observed higher levels of soluble nutrients leaving vegetative buffers than entering them, suggesting that the buffers themselves are acting as a source rather than a sink by releasing previously stored nutrients. This study used 98 atom % N-15-labeled KNO3 at a rate of 5 kg ha(-1) to quantify buffer efficiency for sequestering new inputs of NO3--N in an extensively grazed irrigated pasture system. Buffer treatments consisted of an 8-m buffer, a 16-m buffer, and a nonbuffered control. Regardless of the form of runoff N (NO3-, NH4+, or dissolved organic nitrogen [DON]), more N-15 was lost from the nonbuffered treatments than from the buffered treatments. The majority of the N attenuation was by vegetative uptake. Over the course of the study, the 8-m buffer decreased NO3--N-15 load by 28% and the 16-m buffer decreased load by 42%. For NH4+-N-15, the decrease was 34 and 48%, and for DON-N-15, the decrease was 21 and 9%. Although the buffers were effective overall, the majority of the buffer impact occurred in the first four weeks after N-15 application, with the buffered plots attenuating nearly twice as much N-15 as the nonbuffered plots. For the remainder of the study, buffer effect was not as marked; there was a steady release of N-15, particularly NO3-- and DON-N-15, from the buffers into the runoff. This suggests that for buffers to be sustainable for N sequestration there is a need to manage buffer vegetation to maximize N demand and retention.

AB Biodiversity in Asia is reviewed here from both scientific and socio-economic perspectives. Biodiversity in Asia has been very high, for historical and climatic reasons; however, this situation has been changing rapidly, due to population growth and economic development. The forest biodiversity in this region has both global and local value, yet it is seriously threatened. As natural capital, biodiversity functions in a variety of ways: production and regulation functions have global value, while habitat and information functions have social and cultural value, as well as local importance. Sustainable forest management is dependent on the regulatory functions of the ecosystem and biodiversity. Sometimes the functions of forests or biodiversity make conflict. Moreover, biodiversity has an information function related to sustainability via local knowledge and culture. Levin's (1999) proposals are helpful as a conceptual framework for developing sustainable management for Asian forests.

AB Covering a vast territory, China is rich in forest resources and diversified environments. The changes in forest resources have a direct bearing on environmental quality. This paper gives a detailed account of the dynamic change in forest resources in China, including the overall process of forest evolution, the status quo, and features of the existing forest resources and the development and use of major forest resources. In addition, it analyses the current situation of China's environment and explores the main contributing factors based on the overall environmental situation. To achieve sustainable management of forest resources and improve the environment in China, the Chinese Government attaches great importance to the protection and development of forest resources as well as to environmental development and improvement. The paper gives an overview of current thinking for sustainable forest resource and environmental development in the future and highlights the current focus of efforts toward this objective.

   Science-policy interface; Information management
AB New challenges are facing the managers of the world's forests, with stakeholders demanding a broader range of goods and services. Balancing the demand for forest products and the responsibility for forest protection is not an easy task. The earlier narrow perspective of wood-resources sustainability has often been transferred to an equally narrow biological diversity conservation perspective. Segregation, in which most of the fiber is produced in plantations, attempts to solve the conflict between conservation and wood production. Biotechnology offers a strategy to gain more wood on less land and with less harm to the environment.
   The traditional forest research community has not always been able to react properly and promptly to the needs of the users of research results. Consequently, forest research has lost ground to other disciplines. Forest researchers should not consider the newcomers as competitors but instead should try to create more collaboration with those who are interested in solving forest-related problems but do not belong to the old forestry family. There is also a clear need to improve the interface between the research and user communities. Very often the problem is not so much a need to obtain more data than in discovering how to find the most appropriate existing information. In general, forest research should be more cost-efficient. Adopting a more business-like environment should not, however, lead to an excessively result-oriented, short-term way of thinking, to the extent that basic research, and also quality of research, would be in danger.

AB The time series of landings in the Venice Lagoon from 1945 to 2001 were analysed with the aim of explaining the ecosystem changes occurred. The comparative analysis of the total landings and mean Trophic Level (mTL) time series allowed to identify four different stages in the lagoon ecosystem. The first period, from 1945 to 1973, was characterised by increasing trends in the landings and their mTL. The second one, from 1974 to 1989, showed a decrease in the landings but still an increase in the mTL. The third period, from 1990 to 1998, had again a positive trend in the landings, but the mTL showed a sharp decline. After 1998, a slight decreasing trend in both mTL and landings was observed: the analyses of the artisanal fishery landings only date back to 1995 this effect. The presence of four distinct periods was also confirmed by the analysis of the trends of other indices estimated using landings data: the Fishing, in Balance index (FiB), the Trophic Efficiency (TE) and the Pelagic on Demersal landings ratio (P/D). In the first period, the increasing fishing pressure, along with no evidence of ecosystem crisis, suggested that an increased nutrient discharge was supporting it; analogously, the bottom-up effects had driven the dynamics of the ecosystem also in the second period, when the decrease in nutrient loads caused a shift of the primary producers from planktonic to macrobenthic. The spreading of the Manila clam, a non-native species, and the development of its massive mechanical exploitation have been the main forces driving the ecosystem during the third period, for which, however, no signs of crises were detected. The fourth period showed evidence of the "fishing down the food web" effect. Possible causes of such an effect were investigated and allowed us to conclude that not overfishing, but the effects of mechanical harvesting of the Manila clam had caused relevant impacts on habitat and benthic communities, concluding that the present level of exploitation of the stock of Manila clam is not sustainable in the long term. Our findings were also compared with the general evolution of enclosed seas, subjected to high nutrient loads, fishing pressure and invasion by non-native species. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

AB This paper and a companion article present illustrated guides to the identification of sub-fossil chironomid larvae (Insecta: Diptera: Chironomidae) preserved in the sediments of low- and mid-elevation lakes in East Africa. They are based on analysis of surface-sediment death assemblages from 61 lakes located in the humid to semi-arid environments in equatorial East Africa (Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania), supplemented with similar surface-sediment samples from 12 lakes in the Horn of Africa (Ethiopia), and sub-recent core samples from six lakes in Kenya and two in Uganda. We analyzed about 11,000 specimens and identified 98.4% of these to species, species group, genus, or tribe level, depending on current alpha-taxonomic knowledge of the various considered genera and the taxonomic resolution of preserved diagnostic features. We distinguished 90 different sub-fossil morphotypes, of which 16 are Tanypodinae, 19 are Orthocladiinae, and 55 are Chironominae. In this paper we focus on the subfamily Chironominae (tribes Chironomini and Tanytarsini). The diagnostic characters distinguishing these morphotypes from each other resemble differences at the species level in the better-known Holarctic fauna, hence we consider most of our morphotypes equivalent to morphological species or groups of closely related species. Given that core samples yielded only seven morphotypes not also found in the surface-sediment samples, the current inventory of 90 taxa likely represents the large majority of distinct sub-fossil chironomid larval types to be found in East African lakes, excluding the few very large Rift lakes, cold-water lakes above treeline, and special standing-water environments such as fens and bogs. Consistent use of a single set of morphological characters to identify both fossil and living chironomid larvae would ensure exchangeability of information between modem and paleoenvironmental studies on aquatic invertebrate communities in African lakes, and increase the relevance of paleoenvironmental reconstructions to water-quality evaluations aimed at sustainable management of scarce, fluctuating surface-water resources in tropical East Africa.

AB We computed, through the transition matrix method, the optical properties of cosmic dust grains modelled as aggregates (clusters) of spheres with a Gaussian-like size distribution function. The calculation is performed without resorting to any approximation and with a computational effort that is noticeably lighter than the one required by other methods. Our results show that particle clustering produces an enhancement in the extinction and radiation pressure cross-sections per unit mass. These results might help in the identification of sustainable structures for dust grains in the typical physical and chemical conditions of the diffuse interstellar medium. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Arbuscular mycorrhizae (AM) can ameliorate the impact of disturbance on agroecosystem sustainability. The objective of this study was to describe mycorrhizal colonization patterns in contrasting grazing situations (exclosure and continuous grazing) and topographical positions (upland and lowland) in the flooding pampa (Argentina). We determined the mycorrhizal colonization of the community as a whole and of Dallis grass (Paspalum dilatatum Poir.), a highly palatable, dominant species. We characterized colonization by the proportion of root length occupied by fungi and their different structures. At the community level, there was higher total colonization in the grazed area than in the exclosure. In contrast, Dallis grass showed higher total colonization and higher proportion of vesicles and arbuscules in the exclosure than in the grazed area. For both levels, colonization was higher in the lowland than in the upland position. Differences were observed only in winter and spring, not in summer. Our results show that 1) continuous grazing is associated with an increase of mycorrhizal colonization at the community level and 2) community-level patterns of mycorrhizal colonization cannot be inferred from dominant species. To our knowledge, this is the first characterization of AM abundance at the plant community level under contrasting long-term grazing conditions in a subhumid grassland.

AB The School Health Portfolio System (SHPS), developed originally to evaluate the Florida Coordinated School Health Program Pilot Schools Project, offers a new and innovative system for planning and evaluating a coordinated school health program at the individual school level. The SHPS provides practitioners a detailed but easy-to-use system that enables schools to create new programs or modify existing programs across all eight components of the CSHP model, as well as administrative support critical to sustainability. The System comes packaged as a self-contained, notebook-style manual divided into 15 sections. It includes electronic templates of key documents to guide school teams in creating a customized portfolio, and a list of sample goals and artifacts that confirm achievement of a goal related to the school's coordinated school health program. An evaluation rubric provides a structured method to assess a program portfolio's contents, and the extent to which the contents document achievement of program goals. The rubric produces both a qualitative assessment, such as a narrative summary of program strengths and areas for improvement, and a quantitative assessment, such as a numerical score (0-100), letter grade (A-F), or 5-star system (* - *****). The physical structure, function, and scoring of the rubric depend on the method of assessment. The SHPS enables schools to set goals based on individual school needs, and incorporate CSHP goals into school improvement plans - a critical factor in sustainability and accountability. The System also offers teams the option of coordinating their efforts with CDC's School Health Index as a companion assessment measure. This article outlines the process a team would follow in developing a portfolio, and includes a sample assessment for the area of School Health Education.

DE drainage quality; mineralogical composition; rock-pH; pollution

AB In this paper, a technique has been suggested to know the quality of mine drainage even before the start of mining operation. The coal and associated rock samples are collected from the mine site. The mineralogical composition and geochemical character of each rock types occurring at the site are determined. The geo-chemical properties are measured in terms of R-pH, pollution production potential (PPP) and acid neutralization potential (ANP). The geo-chemical characteristics of various rock types indicate that they have different geo-chemical properties. There is a discrepancy in pH values obtained under laboratory conditions and field data and an explanation is given. On the basis of geo-chemical properties and weathering tests, it is found that except sandstone, all other litho-types such as, coal, shale, and shaly coal have the potential to deteriorate water quality and whatever the water pollutants present in the mine water are just because of interaction of these rock units with water. It is predicted that drainage from coal, shale, and shaly coal may be acidic, whereas drainage from sandstone is basic. The more or less same patterns are observed in the field. The technique suggested for the prediction of drainage quality may prove helpful and can identify rock types likely to produce water contaminants during their exposure to atmosphere in a mine.

AB Although many species of Alnus Miller grow in wet soils, none is as closely associated with low-oxygen, waterlogged soils as Alnus matithna (Marsh.) Muhl. ex Nutt. (seaside alder). An actinorhizal species with promise for use in horticultural landscapes, land reclamation, and sustainable systems, A. maritima associates with Frankia Brunchorst, thereby forming root nodules in which gaseous nitrogen is fixed. Our objective was to determine how root-zone moisture conditions influence the occurrence, location, and anatomy of nodules on A. maritima. Plants of Alnus maritima subsp. maritima Schrader and Graves were established in root zones with compatible Frankia and subjected to four moisture regimens (daily watered/drained, partially flooded, totally flooded, and totally flooded with argon bubbled through the flood water) for 8 weeks. Oxygen content of the root zone, number and location of nodules on root systems, and dry weight and nitrogen content of shoots were determined. Root-zone oxygen content ranged from 17.3 kPa for daily watered/drained plants to 0.9 kPa for argon-treated plants. Across all treatments, 87% of the nodules were within the upper one-third (4 cm) of the root zone. Although shoot dry weights of daily watered/drained and partially flooded plants were not different, daily watered/drained plants had more nitrogen in their leaves (2.53 vs. 2.21 mg.g(-1)). Nodulation occurred in all treatments, but nodules on totally flooded roots (with or without argon) were limited to a single lobe; in contrast, multilobed nodules were prevalent on partially flooded and daily watered/drained plants. Frankia infection within submerged nodule lobes was limited to one or two layers of cortical cells. Submerged nodules developed large air spaces between cortical cells, and phenolic-containing cells appeared to inhibit Frankia expansion within the nodule. These data suggest that access to root-zone oxygen is critical to the Frankia-A. maritima subsp. maritima symbiosis, and that plants of this subspecies in the drained soils of managed landscapes may benefit more than plants in native wetland habitats from nodulation and nitrogen fixation.

TI Multiobjective optimization for sustainable groundwater management in
   semiarid regions
SO JOURNAL OF WATER RESOURCES PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
ID PARAMETER-IDENTIFICATION; DECISION-MAKING; HYDROLOGY
AB Increasing demands for water by competing users in semiarid regions pose new challenges for water resources managers. Decision makers must understand the interactions between surface water, groundwater, and the environmental system. Additionally, the decisions made with regard to water transfer and allocation must take into consideration the diverse objectives that include water supply, cost efficiency, and ecosystem protection. The work presented herein demonstrates the use of groundwater simulation and optimization to construct a decision support system (DSS) for solving a groundwater management problem associated with the Upper San Pedro River Basin, located in southeastern Arizona. The case is treated as a multiobjective optimization problem in which environmental objectives are explicitly considered by minimizing the magnitude and extent of drawdown within a prespecified region. The approach adopted uses the constraint method to derive the tradeoffs among three competing objectives. Once the proposed algorithm identifies a set of efficient solutions (alternatives), concepts borrowed from fuzzy set theory are applied to rank the alternatives and to assist decision makers in selecting a suitable policy among them, each of which is optimum with regard to its goal and the corresponding consequences.

AB Although globalization, liberalization and the development of the network economy have undoubtedly enhanced the competitiveness of the Taiwanese economy, with the island's citizens benefiting enormously from lower prices on a wide range of products, the downside has been the obvious increase in unemployment, and the accompanying instability of employment amongst the island's remaining workforce. Policies adopted by the Taiwanese government to tackle this and improve human capital in the human resources development (HRD) process on the island, give rise to many. questions, however, such as whether employee training programs can really provide Taiwan's workforce with sustainable employability and whether such programs can effectively reduce the probability of unemployment. They also raise the questions of whether employee training programs can help unemployed workers to shorten their unemployment period, thus reducing the overall number of structurally unemployed workers and whether these programs can ultimately lead to increases in overall income levels for successful trainees. These are the questions to be investigated in this paper. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

DE additive; chemistry sustainable; rapeseed oil; tribochemical reactions;
   tribology perfomance
AB The effects of sulfur type additives T321 and phosphorous type additives P120 on the EP and A W abilities of rapeseed oil were investigated by a four-ball testing machine using the rapeseed oil as base oil. The effect of T321 mixed with P120 on the tribochemical perfomance of the rapeseed oil was studied. The result shows that the load carrying, extreme pressure and abrasion capacities of lubricant film, can be improved by adding T321 and P120 as additives in rapeseed oil, respectively. The SEDX analysis on the surface of steel balls reveals that tribochemical reactions occur during the friction process, the barrier lubricating film is formed containing triglyceride and the additives can improve the anti-wear ability, anti load-carrying capacity.

TI Human resources for health: overcoming the crisis
SO LANCET
LA English
DT Article
AB in this analysis of the global workforce, the joint Learning Initiative-a consortium of more than 100 health leaders-proposes that mobilisation and strengthening of human resources for health, neglected yet critical, is central to combating health crises in some of the world's poorest countries and for building sustainable health systems in all countries. Nearly all countries are challenged by worker shortage, skill mix imbalance, maldistribution, negative work environment, and weak knowledge base. Especially in the poorest countries, the workforce is under assault by HIV/AIDS, out-migration, and inadequate investment. Effective country strategies should be backed by international reinforcement. Ultimately, the crisis in human resources is a shared problem requiring shared responsibility for cooperative action. Alliances for action are recommended to strengthen the performance of all existing actors while expanding space and energy for fresh actors.

DT Article

   Marine Fisheries Service
AB The North Pacific has the world's largest groundfish fisheries, with a value in excess of $1 billion annually. The North Pacific also is home to the largest population of Steller sea lions (SSL), an ancient species that is now endangered. Decline of the western stock of SSL in the 1970-1990s coincided with the US nationalization and exponential growth in the Gulf of Alaska and Bering Sea/Aleutian Islands groundfish fishery.
   The article treats five aspects of the competition between the fishery and protection of the endangered species. First, we analyze competition of interests in the use, management, and preservation of the North Pacific commons, including offshore and near-shore fisheries, environmental organizations, governments (federal, state, and local), and the scientific community. Second, the article compares and contrasts provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act, the Marine Mammal Protection Act, the Endangered Species Act, and the Magnuson-Stevens Act (as amended in 1996 by the Sustainable Fisheries Act).
   Third, we examine the regulatory environment with a focus on the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) and its relationship to the North Pacific Fishery Management Council. We illustrate how NMFS establishes fishery management plans and the methods, such as crafting biological opinions and environmental-impact-statements, it uses to resolve conflicts. Fourth, we investigate how the dual pressures on the agency-to increase fisheries production for the benefit of the industry and to preserve endangered marine species-have affected its culture (behavioral norms and operational codes). Then, the article explains agency changes in terms of crises, competition among affected interests, and development of new scientific knowledge.
   The article concludes by drawing lessons from the SSL controversy in the North Pacific which may pertain to national and global biodiversity conflicts. These concern the role of law in biodiversity protection, the role of science, and agency capacity for change. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

DE port policy; competitive ports policies; port strategies
AB The globalisation of the economy and the need for sustainable growth are having a strong influence on international sea freight transport and its infrastructures. Commercial sea ports, faced with the loss in 'loyalty' of their traffic and the appearance of 'new rules in the game', are developing new strategies in order to achieve the loyalty of their clients. The present paper is a reflection on the findings generated in recent years in the area of competitive port policies. The main focus is on the formulation of commercial and technological strategies, the new legislative framework and its consequences for the European Union in the context of the future 'Common Ports Policy'.

AB INTRODUCTION The introduction of graduate entry medical courses requires attention to models of decision-making and change. Much of the educational literature describes change as either centralised or decentralised with the latter claimed to be more effective. Recently Fullan has argued for the importance of an ongoing culture of change. This paper examines the change culture of two medical schools adopting graduate entry courses; Flinders University in South Australia and St George's Hospital Medical School, London.
   METHOD Comparative case study was used. Key informants were interviewed and documents and records analysed. Data were cross-checked and categorised to generate models of change.
   RESULTS There were four components of the change culture at Flinders but they were not sufficient on their own to generate change. The process was triggered by a significant external event. The nature of the change was also important. The descriptive model developed suggested a complex interplay of factors rather than attributing the success of the change to the change mechanisms adopted alone. The model was tested for explanatory potential at St George's. The culture there was described as both 'macro-innovative' and 'micro-conservative'. External events were also important but they exerted a positive force. A more centralised approach was adopted.
   DISCUSSION The models developed represent change as 'dynamic, complex and open' rather than a simple centralised or decentralised dichotomy. While some of the elements of a change culture were evident at both schools there were longer term questions of sustainability. This has implications for development of all programmes but particularly for graduate entry schools.

AB Objective: It is important to teach community members about the causes, magnitude and effects of health disparities that affect them, and to partner with them to develop, test and disseminate programs that they can sustain to improve health. East and Central Harlem are two underserved, predominantly minority, inner-city communities whose residents have disproportionately high morbidity and mortality from chronic conditions. We developed an approach to educate and work together with Harlem residents to study health disparities, and to use peer-led classes to improve chronic disease management and outcomes.
   Methods: Researchers and community leaders formed a community-based research core ("Core") with funds from a large health disparities grant. We then assembled a community advisory board and partnered with them to start a community newsletter to explain the causes of local health disparities and suggest ways to eliminate them. Together, we also began to create a self-sustaining cadre of community-based peer educators to teach culturally acceptable chronic disease self-management skills.
   Results: The recruited board consists of 33 leaders of community-based health and social service organizations, religious institutions, and tenant organizations, as well as local activists. We produced and distributed our first educational newsletter to more than 4,000 community leaders, members and community-based organizations. We also adapted an existing chronic disease self-management program for the Harlem population and developed strategies to recruit peer educators and sustain their efforts in the future. To help them attain expertise in teaching chronic disease self-management, the board selected four individuals to become master peer-education trainers. The board then helped recruit more than 60 community members and leaders for our first two peer-education courses.
   Conclusions: Researchers, clinicians and community leaders worked together to disseminate knowledge about health disparities and a peer-organized education program to address these disparities. This approach provides a foundation to attain a cadre of community-based experts to inform the community about ways to reduce health disparities. By pooling local and academic expertise and resources, we hope to develop programs that are workable, effective and sustainable without outside control or funding.

AB There is a common belief that underdeveloped regions with major accessibility problems have insufficient resources for development. However, social and economic development in these regions can be realized through proper planning and resource management. A rural development project (RDP) focusing on social and economic development through protection of biodiversity in northern Turkey is a good example. Breeding of Caucasian queen bees (Apis mellifera caucasica), ecotourism, and ecoagriculture have been successful in this respect. The project received the "World Summit Business Award for Sustainable Development Partnership" from the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) and the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) at the World Summit on Sustainable Development 2002 in Johannesburg.

AB Amenity migration, the movement of people for pleasure rather than economic reasons, has become a major phenomenon in mountainous regions of western North America. Research suggest that planning to promote and manage amenity migration can contribute to the sustainable development of mountain communities. The present article reports the results of a rapid reconnaissance of the capacities of hinterland mountain municipalities in British Columbia, Canada, to plan for amenity migration. Low capacity was found in awareness and technical understanding of the phenomenon.

AB The International Year of Mountains (IYM) 2002 drew attention to mountain regions and their fragile ecosystems. The present article makes a comparative analysis of mountain case studies from developing countries (DCs) and industrialized countries (ICs) using sustainability variables in the framework of a Driving force-Pressure-State-Impact-Response Model (DPSIR Model). Response variables, ie efforts made by society to move towards sustainable mountain development (SMD), are believed to improve the situation with regard to sustainability and are a focus of this study. In the course of the IYM, a total of 40 appropriate case-studies were analyzed, to demonstrate the wide variety of approaches to SMD. Case studies that deal with themes considered to be particularly important in mountain regions were chosen for analysis. Such key themes include freshwater, forestry, agriculture; poverty, indigenous knowledge, migration, tourism, and legislation. Variables of great importance in any mountain area include "involvement of stakeholders in planning and development process (public participation)" and "gathering of baseline information." Additional challenges to SMD in DCs include lack of options to facilitate out-migration, declining forest cover, insufficient access to resources, and poverty. The main conclusion of this study is that the DPSIR Model that was applied is an adequate tool with which to analyze SMD case studies, especially studies relating to DCs.

AB The use of public procurement to achieve social outcomes is widespread, but detailed information about how it operates is often sketchy and difficult to find. This article is essentially a mapping exercise, describing the history and current use Of government contracting as a tool of social regulation, what the author calls the issue of 'linkage'. The article considers the popularity of linkage in the I 9,h century in Europe and North America, particularly in dealing with issues of labour standards and unemployment. The use of linkage expanded during the 20(th) century, initially to include the provision of employment opportunities to disabled workers. During and after World War 11, the use of linkage became particularly important in the United States in addressing racial equality, in the requirements for non-discrimination in contracts, and in affirmative action and set-asides for minority businesses. Subsequently, the role of procurement spread both in its geographical coverage and in the subject areas of social policy that it was used to promote. The article considers examples of the use of procurement to promote equality on the basis of ethnicity and gender drawn from Malaysia, South Africa, Canada, and the European Community. More recently, procurement has been used as an instrument to promote human rights transnationally, also by international organizations such as the International Labour Organisation. The article includes some reflections on the relationship between 'green' procurement, 'social' procurement, and sustainable development, and recent attempts to develop the concept of 'sustainable procurement.

AB This article discusses the development Of corporate social responsibility (CSR) in Brazil from the perspective of the Ethos Institute of Business and Social Responsibility. The Institute is a not-for-profit, non-governmental organization, that has played a leading role in the Brazilian CSR effort. In Brazil, CSR initiatives have a long tradition of philanthropy, a consequence of the country's great social inequalities. The increased attention to corporate social responsibility has paralleled growing concern about sustainable development and the intensifying activities of pressure groups (consumers, customers, investors, NGOs, labour unions, the media, among others) that have been increasing since the 1990s as natural resources are progressively becoming exhausted, social tensions rising and environmental conditions deteriorating worldwide. This article identifies problems and obstacles to the growth of corporate social responsibility in Brazil, as well as advances and alternatives for CSR and towards creating conditions for the country to be internationally competitive and sustainable in the financial, social and environmental areas.

AB Oil spills caused by maritime transport of petroleum products are still an important source of ocean pollution, especially in main production areas and along major transport routes. We here provide a historical and geographic analysis of the major oil spills (> 700 t) since 1960. Spills were recorded from several key marine ecosystems and marine biodiversity hotspots. The past four decades have been characterized by an overall decrease in the number of accidents and tonnes of oil spilled in the sea, but this trend was less distinct in the European Atlantic area. Recent black tides from the Erika and Prestige vessels provided new evidence for the high risk of accidents with serious ecological impact in this area, which according to our analysis is historically the most important oil spill hotspot worldwide. The English Channel and waters around Galicia in Spain were the areas with most accidents. Maritime transport in European Atlantic waters has been predicted to continue increasing. Together with our own results this suggests that, in addition to measures for increased traffic safety, deployment of emergency capacities in the spill hotspot areas may be crucial for a sustainable conservation of sea resources and ecosystems.

AB From 26 to 28 May 2004 an international seminar was held in Wageningen, the Netherlands. about current knowledge and advice on rodent management on organic pig and poultry farms in Western Europe. This paper summarizes the discussions. Rodent management is necessary to protect the food production chain from health hazards to livestock and humans. Some organic farmers prefer biological rodent control, but since rodents can also transmit diseases this bears certain risks for the production of healthy live-stock and safe food. Effective rodent management requires a thorough understanding of the biology of the pest species concerned. These can be divided into two groups: Field rodents. such as and commensal rodents like house mice and rats. The objective of managing Field rodents is to minimize livestock exposure to these vectors. and to regulate their populations in case their density is expect.

TI One vision of academic nursing centers
SO NURSING ECONOMICS
LA English
DT Article
AB Academic-based nursing centers typically strive to fulfill multiple purposes, providing care to underserved populations, clinical experiences for nursing students, and practice opportunities for faculty.
   This complex set of objectives are often rooted in tenuous funding arrangements as evidenced by the closure of more than half of clinics established within the last 20 years due to financial viability.
   Sustainability should be carefully considered when establishing a program given the seriousness of the commitment entered when embarking upon patient and community relationships.
   The Penn Macy Initiative is noted for defining key success factors and stabilizing forces in academic-based nursing,centers including the. alignment of organizational mission; a faculty model supporting practice as an aspect of appointment, promotion, and tenure; and the level of commitment represented in an organization's mission.
   Dedicated, full-time nurse managers were also cited as critical leaders with the necessary skills to balance their role as entrepreneur and trustee.

AB There is an urgent need to establish sustainable nutrient cycling. Changes in amounts of N flow and separation of production and consumption sectors are becoming a serious environmental problem. In this study, the yearly N in- and outflow of a city in northern Japan from 1912 to 2002 was investigated based on the statistics and inventory data. Based on the characteristics of the N flow, the period was divided into manure-based period (MBP, 1912-1950), transition period from manure- to chemical fertilizer-based period (TP, 1950-1970), and chemical fertilizer-based period (CBP, 1970-2002). The highest amount of N inflow (up to 350 Mg N y(-1)) was observed at the end of the MBP, and the second peak (about 300 Mg N y(-1)) at the beginning of the CBR The N application rate on farmland increased from 68 kg N ha(-1) in 1912 to above 250 kg N ha(-1) in the 1950s, then decreased to 168 kg N ha(-1) in 2002. The farmland productivity increased from 30 kg N ha(-1) at the end of the 1950s to 90 kg N ha(-1) in 2002, due to improvement in crop varieties and management methods. In MBP surplus N in farmland and NH3 volatilization accounted for 90 % of the N outflow from the city, then in CBP, disposal N and surplus N in farmland became the main N outflow. All these outputs are considered to increase the N concentration in rivers and/or underground water. In the case of surplus N in farmland, it exceeded the amount of optimum N management (< 50 kg N ha(-1); Zebarth et al. 1998, Agricult. Ecosyst. Environ. 72: 35-52) during 1935-1970 and 1981-1997. In order to prevent degradation of the environment through artificially altered nutrient flow, we need to be aware of the environmental impact of the N flow and establish proper N management practices.

AB Departing from the historical background of scientific interest in soil fertility and sustainable agricultural production in sub-Saharan Africa, a review is conducted of nutrient budget studies carried out in semi-arid West Africa at scales ranging from individual fields to the sub-continent. For both, nitrogen and phosphorus, the comparison discloses largely diverging balances calculated for similar agro-ecosystems. In a first step, the modes of calculation of the nutrient budgets are examined. It is demonstrated that the calculations used in the different studies differ by the variables and biophysical processes taken into account, and by the choice of spatial scales as well as related time scales. One important discrepancy between approaches is whether and to which extent nutrient flows are internalized when upscaling. The extent to which the impact of individual and communal management, especially of pastoral and forestry resources, on nutrient flows is accounted for is a second cause of divergence. Moreover, it was observed that nutrient budgets tend to be increasingly negative as the spatial scale of the study increases from farm to sub-continent. This unexpected trend is traced back to the lack of internalization of nutrient flows when upscaling. The complexity of the scale patterns of nutrient flows and that of the interactions and the tradeoffs in the effects of management calls for the use of models to calculate nutrient budgets. Therefore, in a second step, examples of a static model, a multiple-goal linear programming model and a decision rules model were reviewed, all of which include the calculation of nutrient flows and balances and which were applied to West-African farming systems. The models are analyzed for their way of dealing with the critical issues of spatial and temporal scales and the impact of resource management on nutrient flows, taking into account that they have different objectives and were designed for different spatio-temporal scales. To conclude, suggestions were made for strengthening the use of models as tools enabling ex-ante testing of alternative agricultural technologies and policies that could improve soil nutrient balances in semi-arid sub-Saharan Africa.

AB Unanimity rule is an important benchmark for evaluating outcomes of decisions in the social sciences. However, organizational researchers tend to ignore unanimous decision making, for example, because unanimity may be difficult to realize in large groups and may suffer from individual participants blocking decisions. This paper reconsiders unanimity rule in view of the development of circular systems for organizing decision making. It focuses on developing a theory of decision making under unanimity rule. The author uses a system dynamics model to explore the conditions under which unanimity rule supports the organization's ability to make decisions. Simulation experiments suggest that the dynamics and outcomes of unanimous decision making under and exceeding a critical threshold level of decision pressure are fundamentally different. Under this critical threshold, the decision-making system is capable of recovering from severe shocks to the system. If decision pressure is close to its threshold, a relatively small change can cause the decision process to collapse. In this respect, large groups operating under unanimity rule are less sustainable because they are more likely to exceed their critical threshold than small groups. Decomposing the decision-making system in small units, embedded in a hierarchical structure, therefore appears to be a necessary condition for sustainable performance in large organizations applying unanimity rule.

AB The majority of papers dealing with concrete concentrate on one property at a time, thus giving a somewhat distorted picture of the importance of the various parameters in achieving a good concrete structure. The theme of this paper is that this objective can be achieved only by a seamless process of a number of operations, which are briefly discussed. Among the topics presented are the composition of today's cements, selection of concrete mixes, use of binders such as fly ash and silica fume, self-consolidating concrete and sustainable construction. The article concludes with a review of special aspects of precast concrete.

AB Agroforestry systems seem to be a sustainable alternative for agricultural production. The objective of this work was to evaluate the quality of a soil used under an agroforestry system by the quantification of the following soil physical attributes: density, porosity, resistance to penetration and aggregate stability. The soil under agroforestry exhibited a superior quality compared to the same soil cultivated by a conventional system. reflected by smaller soil density, higher porosity, lesser resistance to penetration and higher aggregate stability.

AB Purpose. B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) has been in clinical use for the treatment of decompensated congestive heart failure. However, BNP has a very short half-life in circulation, which limits its application to acute CHF and requires continuous i.v. infusion. To provide superior pharmacological benefits of BNP to other stages of chronic congestive heart failure and to eliminate problems associated with drug delivery via continuous i.v. infusion, we have designed and evaluated AlbuBNP, a long-acting form of BNP by recombinant fusion to human serum albumin for use in chronic congestive heart failure, post-acute follow-up, and postmyocardial infarction.
   Methods. Human BNP (1-32) was seamlessly fused to mature human serum albumin at N-terminus to create AlbuBNP. The bioactivities of AlbuBNP were evaluated by natriuretic peptide receptor-A mediated cGMP activation assay, hemodynamic responses, and plasma cGMP elevation. The pharmacokinetic properties were determined after single i.v. or s.c. bolus injection in C57/BL6 mice.
   Results. AlbuBNP had approxiamtely the same maximal bioactivity as BNP to activate cGMP in the in vitro NPRA/cGMP assay. The EC50s were 28.4+/-1.2 and 0.46+/-1.1 nM for AlbuBNP and BNP, respectively. In spontaneously hypertensive rats, AlbuBNP lowered both systolic and diastolic blood pressure, having sustainable mean arterial pressure reduction for more than 2 days. Six nmol/kg AlbuBNP i.v. bolus in mice increased plasma cGMP level 5.6-fold over the baseline. The elimination half-life in mice was dramatically increased from 3 min for BNP to 12-19 h for AlbuBNP.
   Conclusions. AlbuBNP is bioactive and has desired pharmacokinetic properties for long-term use. It has the potential to be further developed as a new therapeutic option for chronic, acute, and post-acute CHF to alleviate symptoms, improve clinical status, and slow the disease progression by sustained drug exposure via infrequent simple subcutaneous injections.
