AB When rain forest is logged, rills and gullies are often initiated on heavily disturbed and compacted terrain components; whether and for how long they continue to enlarge following logging is critical as regards the recovery and sustainability of the regenerating forest. This paper examines these two issues in logged rain forest in northeastern Borneo. Results are presented of an investigation into how soil erosion rates and surface topography varies in selectively logged forests at different stages of regeneration (up to 15 years after logging) in Danum Valley, eastern Sabah, Malaysia. Measurements were made of changes in ground level and surface roughness at over 100 transect sites over periods of 1-15 years using the erosion bridge (microprofiler) technique. In the complex mosaic of the post-logging regenerating forest, attention focused on key features, notably abandoned logging tracks, gullies, heavily disturbed or compacted areas and road-related landslides and comparisons are made with primary forest terrain. The role of extreme rainstorms in controlling the temporal pattern of post-logging erosion in both regenerating and primary forest is demonstrated. The different situations in which rills and gullies initiated during or following logging enlarge or disappear in post-logging terrain are highlighted. The implications of the results for slope evolution and sustainable rainforest management policies are briefly considered. (c) 2006 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Key catchments of the Roztocze loess area in south-east Poland have a great potential of revealing the history of long-term soil erosion and changes in land use. The knowledge of how and when soil erosion took place in the past helps one understand the impact of land use changes on the landscapes [Bork, H.-R., 1989. Soil erosion during the past Millennium in Central Europe and its significance within the geomorphodynamics of the Holocene. Catena 15, 121-131]. The Jedliczny Dol gully system near the town Zwierzyniec in south-east Poland was investigated by using detailed field stratigraphy and radiocarbon dating of charcoal and wood.
   In connection with new settlements which were established between the 14th and 16th centuries, arable land was cultivated and forests were used much more intensively. As a consequence, the loess soils were strongly eroded during heavy rainfalls. Up to 4 m of colluvial sediments were deposited in the gully system during the 15th and/or 16th centuries. The thickness of the colluvial sediments indicate severe erosion which might be related to excessive timber exploitation for the local glass and iron production. With the foundation of the so-called Ordinariat Zamoyski at the end of the 16th century, some parts of the area were presumably reforested. High pressure on the land at the beginning of the 19th century enabled a second main phase of gulling before 1900.
   Since 1890 at the latest, almost the whole catchment is used as a forest, however, concentrated runoff on compacted forest roads can still be high after heavy rainfalls.
   In loess areas soil erosion caused by intensive land use, triggered by heavy rainfalls, can change the landscape drastically. These changes will continue to influence how catchments react, even if land use gets less intensive again. This knowledge should be considered regarding future, sustainable land use and recent changes in land use in the south-eastern Polish loess regions. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The Saxonian loess belt is one of the areas in Germany most endangered by water erosion. As consequence of extreme rainstorms, farmland and adjacent areas, e.g. villages, roads, biotopes and watercourses, are repeatedly damaged. Estimating soil loss is a crucial factor for sustainable land use planning in this region. Since soil erosion measurements are usually conducted at the scale of plots, thereby being both costly as well as time-consuming, erosion models are substantial tools for soil protection policies. This paper summarises and integrates the results of a research project aimed at assessing the present situation as well as that of future landscape planning alternatives, using the physically based EROSION 3D simulation model on a catchment scale. EROSION 3D can estimate the yields of sediment for small watersheds and enables environmental researchers and planners to locate the main areas of soil loss and deposition. Five different scenarios based on past and present land use information as well as future landscape 2 planning alternatives were simulated.
   The modelling results showed that scenarios based on only one option for minimising soil loss were not sufficiently effective in reducing sediment production. However, the combination of active soil protection measures such as conservation tillage with passive measures like grassed waterways or buffer strips resulted in an adequate soil protection. In contrast to passive protection measures, best management practices like non-tillage systems are commonly used in the Saxonian loess belt already. Thus, the implementation of passive measures is an important future task in land use planning. Simulation models like EROSION 3D can provide the information needed for the adequate localisation and the dimensioning of site-specific measures. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB It is difficult to determine the information required to address sustainable forest management (SFM) issues. In the case of local-level soft law standards, such as third-party forest certification, the information must ensure adequate planning, inventory, reporting, inspection and compliance. It must also serve the practical and strategic needs of both the certified and certifying organization. In this study, the nature of the monitoring and information reporting required under soft law was obtained through a purposive sample of forestry soft law standards from North America and Europe. An inductive and investigative process was designed to formulate theory regarding the observed phenomena by systematically gathering and analyzing relevant data. The resulting matrix highlights many similarities and differences in the specific content of the soft law standards from different jurisdictions in North America and Europe. The results emphasise the importance of transparency, cooperation and comparison when evaluating third-party certification in different jurisdictions. They confirm the notion that international comparisons of forest management need to better reflect forest management standards rather than taking forest certification at face value. When considered in the context of globalization and internationalization, the research findings support international efforts to encourage the harmonization of SFM-related monitoring and information reporting.

AB The effect of 30 years of continuous cropping, fertilization and manuring on the potassium (K) balances, the soil K pools and the non-exchangeable K release in a Typic Haplaquept soil from Almora, India under a rainfed soybean-wheat cropping system were investigated. The apparent K balance was measured as the difference between the total K added and that removed by the crops. The results showed that the total removal of K by the crops exceeded the amount of total K applied to the soil in all the treatments showing a net negative K balance. This ranged from 3.7 in the plots under NK to 81.7 kg ha(-1) year(-1) in the N+FYM treated plots. Continuous annual application of recommended doses of NPK+10 t FYM (NPK+FYM) to soybean resulted in an accumulation (+56 kg K ha(-1)) of exchangeable K (1 N NH4OAc extractable K) in the 0-45 cm soil depth over the study period, despite the highest average annual uptake of K by the system (150.8 kg ha(-1) year(-1)). However, there was a net depletion of exchangeable K (-80 kg K ha(-1)) in that soil depth under the NPK treated plots. The results also revealed that the content of non-exchangeable K decreased substantially from 3482 kg ha-(1) to 2677 and 2896 kg ha(-1) in the 0-45 cm soil layer after 30 years of cropping in the plots under NPK+FYM and NPK treatments, respectively.
   There was a significant decline in total soil K with the removal of non-exchangeable soil K in the surface (0-15 cm) soil layer (R-2 =0.526, P < 0.001, n=36). Thus, long-term application of non-revised recommended fertilizer rates may threaten sustainability of the rainfed continuous soybean-wheat system. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Sustainable groundwater management in Kinmen Island
SO HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES

DT Article
DE sustainable; groundwater management; safe yield; Kinmen
AB Kinmen county is located in the southwest of Fujen province, China. It comprises Kinmen, Leiyu and other small islands. Its total area is around 150 km(2). Kinmen is the largest island, and 95% of the population resides there. The average annual precipitation is 1072 turn. Rainfall is concentrated in a 5 month period from mid-April to mid-September. Water resources are limited relative to demand. Eastern Kinmen utilizes surface water, whereas western Kinmen uses groundwater. Moreover, the Kinmen sorghum liquor is brewed using the native groundwater in the west of the island. MODFLOW-96 was used to simulate the groundwater distribution and determine the annual amount of infiltration, pumping, and boundary inflow and outflow. Additionally, a groundwater management index was adopted to evaluate the status of groundwater level change, thus allowing local government officials to adjust the pumping scheme dynamically. To achieve a sustainable groundwater supply in Kinmen, an integrated groundwater extraction plan was proposed. This plan includes enhancing the infiltration by using treated wastewater from the east of the island, monitoring the groundwater level change, adjusting the groundwater pumping scheme, and constructing seawater desalination plants. If the hostile confrontation between Taiwan and mainland China is resolved, then the water supply through an undersea pipeline from Sharmen, China, to Kinmen can be another potential source of water for Kinmen in the future.

AB Ensuring that water resources development in harmony with aquatic environment is the major water policy of Taiwan in the 21st century, Taiwan's water authority has adopted several methodologies, such as utilizing ecological engineering techniques, establishing integrated water resources management configuration, involving the public in decision-making processes, etc., and applying them in the field. Significant consequences in ecological engineering were obtained in several cases, such as for Ta-Chia Creek, where wire cages, tires, and boulders were installed to improve the stream habitat, and for Wu-Lao Creek, where natural water purification facilities were constructed to reduce river pollution. Although the sustainable methodologies have been widely accepted by hydraulic engineers in Taiwan, lack of engineer-friendly evaluation indices or methods hindered the further progress of river ecological engineering projects. This research applied a non-metric multidimensional-scaling (MDS) analysis to measure the assemblage change of river aquatic habitat. A dike construction project at Chu-Lan Creek was selected for verification in this study. The analyzed results showed that the dike construction project did affect the aquatic habitat in Chu-Lan Creek. The proposed MDS analysis successfully captured the effect of the construction. The MDS method could be used to evaluate the improvement or damage of aquatic habitat by a traditional hydraulic approach or a new ecological hydraulic developed technique in Taiwan.

AB Successful recovery and sustainability of threatened and exploited species depends in part on retention and maintenance of genetic diversity. Theory indicates that genetic diversity is lost at a rate inversely proportional to the genetically effective population size (N-e), which is roughly equal to one-half the adult census size (N) in many organisms. However, Ne has been reported to be up to five orders of magnitude lower than N in species with life histories that result in type III survivorship (high fecundity, but heavy mortality in early life stages, e.g. bony fishes), prompting speculation that low values of Ne may be a general feature of such organisms despite sometimes vast abundances. Here, we compared Ne and the ratio N-e/N across three ecologically similar fish species from the arid southwestern United States, all with type III life histories but with differing expectations of egg and larval survivorship that correlate with the degree of human-imposed habitat fragmentation. Our study indicates that type III life history may be necessary, but this alone is insufficient to account for extraordinarily low values of N-e/N. Rather, life history interacts with environmentally imposed mortality to determine the rate and magnitude of change in genetic diversity in these desert fish species.

AB Southern Africa is a region facing multiple stressors, including chronic, recurrent food insecurity and persistent threats of famine. Climate information, including seasonal climate forecasts, has been heralded as a promising tool for early-warning systems and agricultural risk management in southern Africa. Nevertheless, there is concern that climate information, for example climate forecasts, are not realizing their potential value in the region. The present study considers the actual and potential roles played by climate information in reducing food insecurity in southern Africa from 2 perspectives. The first relates to improved understanding of the contextual environment in which end users operate and use information. Users, including farmers, usually operate in an environment of considerable uncertainty, reacting to and coping with multiple stressors whose impacts are not always clear or predictable. The second perspective relates to improving the current design and variety of mechanisms (e.g. climate outlook forums) for the dissemination and uptake of climate information. The first relates to improved understanding of the contextual environment in which end users operate and use information. Users, including farmers, usually operate in an environment of considerable uncertainty, reacting to and coping with multiple stressors whose impacts are not always clear or predictable. The second perspective relates to improving the current design and variety of mechanisms (e.g. climate outlook forums) for the dissemination and uptake of climate information. Climate information, it is argued, used in isolation (e.g. in 'stand alone' climate outlook forums) and undertaken in a traditional, linear fashion, where information is moved from producer to user, is divorced from the broader, complex social context in which such information is embedded. This current articulation of climate information flow represents an ineffective means of dealing with climate variability and food security. Alternative modes of interaction (e.g. using existing platforms to 'piggyback' information or seeking appropriate 'boundary organisations') should be found to sustainably manage climate risks in the region.

TI Long-Term Persistence of Robust Antibody and Cytotoxic T Cell Responses
   in Recovered Patients Infected with SARS Coronavirus
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
AB Most of the individuals infected with SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) spontaneously recovered without clinical intervention. However, the immunological correlates associated with patients' recovery are currently unknown. In this report, we have sequentially monitored 30 recovered patients over a two-year period to characterize temporal changes in SARS-CoV-specific antibody responses as well as cytotoxic T cell (CTL) responses. We have found persistence of robust antibody and CTL responses in all of the study subjects throughout the study period, with a moderate decline one year after the onset of symptoms. We have also identified two potential major CTL epitopes in N proteins based on ELISPOT analysis of pooled peptides. However, despite the potent immune responses and clinical recovery, peripheral lymphocyte counts in the recovered patients have not yet been restored to normal levels. In summary, our study has, for the first time, characterized the temporal and dynamic changes of humoral and CTL responses in the natural history of SARS-recovered individuals, and strongly supports the notion that high and sustainable levels of immune responses correlate strongly with the disease outcome. Our findings have direct implications for future design and development of effective therapeutic agents and vaccines against SARS-CoV infection.

AB Governing natural resources sustainably is a continuing struggle. Major debates occur over what types of policy "interventions" best protect forests, with choices of property and land tenure systems being central issues. Herein, we provide an overview of findings from a long-term interdisciplinary, multiscale, international research program that analyzes the institutional factors affecting forests managed under a variety of tenure arrangements. This program analyzes satellite images, conducts social-ecological measurements on the ground, and tests the impact of structural variables on human decisions in experimental laboratories. Satellite images track the landscape dimensions of forest-cover change within different management regimes over time, On-the-ground social-ecological studies examine relationships between forest conditions and types of institutions. Behavioral studies under controlled laboratory conditions enhance our understanding of explicit changes in structure that affect relevant human decisions. Evidence from all three research methods challenges the presumption that a single governance arrangement will control overharvesting in all settings. When users are genuinely engaged in decisions regarding rules affecting their use, the likelihood of them following the rules and monitoring others is much greater than when an authority simply imposes rules. Our results support a frontier of research on the most effective institutional and tenure arrangements for protecting forests. They move the debate beyond the boundaries of protected areas into larger landscapes where government, community, and comanaged protected areas are embedded and help us understand when and why deforestation and regrowth occur in specific regions within these larger landscapes.

AB The overuse of rainforests in the last century and its consequences necessitate a rethinking of logging policies. To this end models have been developed to simulate rainforest dynamics and to allow optional management strategies to be evaluated. Parameterisation of presently existing models for a certain site needs a lot of work, thus the parameterisation effort is too high to apply the models to a wide range of rainforests. Hence, in this paper we introduce the simplified model FORREG using the knowledge we have gained from a more complex model, FORMIX3-Q.
   The FORREG model uses differential equations to determine the volume growth of three successional species groups. Parameterisation is simplified by a genetic algorithm, which determines the required internal model parameters from characteristics of the forest dynamics. The new model is employed to assess the sustainability of various logging policies in terms of yield and damage.
   Results for three forests are discussed: (1) the tropical lowland rain forest in the Deramakot Forest Reserve, (2) the Lambir National Park in Malaysia and (3) a subtropical forest in Paraguay. Our model reproduces both undisturbed forest dynamics and dynamics of logged forests simulated with FORMIX3-Q very well. However, the resultant volumes of yield and damage differ slightly from those gained by FORMIX3-Q if short logging cycles are simulated. Choosing longer logging cycles leads to a good correspondence of both models. For the Deramakot Forest Reserve different logging cycles are compared and discussed. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

DE decoupling process; soil erosion; human activities; the Loess Plateau

AB Accelerated soil erosion is thought to couple with population growth, land exploitation and environmental degradation, leading to a major pressure on sustainable development of agro-ecosystem. However, implementation of wise policy and application of sound new techniques combined with traditional knowledge, may lead to less soil erosion or limited erosion under the tolerable value while intensive land use or exploitation is adopted for the population and economic growth. Such process of breaking the link between "environmental bads" and "economic goods" was termed as "decoupling". In the present paper, decoupling process of soil erosion from human activities has been analyzed with the conception of decoupling indicators on the Chinese Loess Plateau. Before 1949, intensive soil erosion, as indicated by the high suspended sediment yield in the Yellow River, was induced by the wars within the nation and against the invasion of foreign countries. A distinct decoupling occurred after 1949, especially since the 1980s because of adoption of watershed-based comprehensive soil-water conservation measures. It implies that soil erosion could be decoupled from intensive land use exploration and the increasing population by a wise policy. And the decoupling indicator could be a sensitive indicator for agri-environment assessment. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In recent years there has been considerable interest in evaluating carbon budgets in forests because of the importance of these ecosystems as carbon sources and sinks. Quantifying forest net primary production (NPP) is critical to understanding the global carbon cycle because forests are responsible for a large portion of the total terrestrial NPP The present study provides information about the temporal and spatial dynamics of carbon (C) stored in aboveground tree biomass in even-aged, pure stands of maritime pine and radiata pine managed under different silvicultural regimes in northwest Spain. Carbon budgets (storage calculations) for tree biomass provide useful information for characterizing forests as important C sinks and allow assessment of the potential effects of harvesting and logging residue management on forest C status. Stand dynamic growth models were used to estimate the amount of C accumulated in the remaining stand and the amount removed in thinning treatments throughout the whole rotation.
   For radiata pine, carbon sequestration in total aboveground tree biomass at stand level in the whole rotation (thinnings and clear-cutting at 30 years) ranged from 3.4 Mg ha(-1) per year (the lowest initial stocking density, the worst site quality and 35% of thinning intensity) to 5.9 Mg ha(-1) per year (the highest initial stocking density, the best site quality and 15% of thinning intensity). For maritime pine, the amount of tree biomass at stand level was significantly lower than in radiata pine stands, and mean annual carbon storage ranged from 2.3 to 4.6 Mg ha(-1) per year for the same rotation length. The total aboveground and stem wood biomass C pools in these stands can be increased by increasing the rotation age and site quality and decreasing thinning intensity. Selection of the best site qualities, reduction of the thinning intensity and perhaps extension of the rotation length are therefore possible strategies for sustainable management of pine stands in Spain when the main objective is biomass production and C sequestration.

AB Currently, there is a strong demand for estimates of the current and potential future carbon sequestration in forests, the role of management practices, and the temporal duration of biotic carbon sinks. Different models, however, lead to different projections. Model comparisons allow us to assess the range of potential ecosystem responses, and they facilitate the detection of the strengths and weaknesses of particular models. In this study, the empirical, individual-based forest models MASSIMO, the semi-empirical individual-based forest models SILVA-both combined with the soil model YASSO - and the process-based, biogeochemical model Biome-BGC were used to assess the above- and below-ground carbon pools and net fluxes of several forested regions in Switzerland for the next 100 years under four different management scenarios: (1) the current harvest amounts were used, (2) harvest was intensified by reducing the amount of large tree dimensions, (3) harvest was reduced to a minimum by only maintaining the protection function in mountain forests and avoiding pests and diseases, and (4) harvest was adjusted to achieve maximum sustainable growth. The results show that the three models projected similar patterns of net carbon fluxes. The models estimated that in the absence of large-scale disturbances the forest biomass and soil carbon can be increased, particularly under scenario 2, and therefore, forests can be used as carbon sinks. These sinks were estimated to last for a maximum of 100 years. Differences between the management scenarios depend on the time period considered: either net carbon fluxes are maximized at a short term (30-40 years) or at a longer term (100 years or more). In contrast to the similar carbon fluxes, some carbon pools projected by the models differed strongly. These differences in model behaviour can be attributed to model-specific responses to the strongly heterogeneous Swiss climate conditions and to different model assumptions. To find the optimum strategy in terms of not only maximizing carbon sequestration but climate protection, it is essential to account for wood-products and particularly substitution of fossil fuel in the model simulations.

AB Bamboo is an important resource for humans, particularly in Asia, providing shoots for food and calms for construction. It is also an ideal subject for intensive management. However, most of the resource is obtained from wild stands for which the sustainability of harvests is poorly documented and intensive management is often impractical or inappropriate. I conducted two shoot harvest trials in riparian stands of the north Australian bamboo Bambusa arnhemica F. Muell. (Poaceae), testing a harvest protocol in which stands are rotated among years. In both trials, harvest had no effect on recruit numbers, but recruits were markedly smaller than in control clumps. There was no residual effect of the harvest on recruit size or number in subsequent years. However, both trials demonstrated that the harvest clumps failed to increase recruitment in subsequent years to compensate for the loss of biomass in the harvest year. This rotational harvest system cannot be recommended because a cumulative loss of biomass is predicted with multiple harvest cycles. Alternative management protocols involving within-season harvest limits may prove practical for wild bamboos, but achieving sustainability in the absence of intensive management may not be easy.

AB In this case study of Swedish boreal forestry, we analyze the implementation in practical management of a sustainable forest management that includes the continued capacity of ecosystems to also provide non-timber services. In the Swedish national forest policy, the equal goals of timber production and biodiversity conservation have increased the responsibility of landowners and managers to modify practical management. We compiled written information from three larger FSC-certified forestry companies combined with semi-structured interviews with forest management personnel at regional offices to map what data and information the companies collect and use. We examined to what extent obtainable information from the forest companies captures composition, structure, and function of boreal ecosystems at patch, stand and landscape scale. This was done using 47 indicators compiled from literature and grouped into five categories based on nationally identified deficiencies in the managed boreal forest compared to unmanaged forest. We found that the recording of data describing different aspects of the forest ecosystem were separated in two largely uncoordinated systems, Ecological Landscape Plans and stand registers. While there is a need for conservation-oriented data across scales, collected statistics was largely production-oriented and related to the stand scale. We also identified information gaps regarding different ecosystem structures and their spatial distribution such as dead wood and habitat networks. The knowledge base available to future management decisions also seems to lack information on connectivity in the landscape, habitat at smaller spatial scales and the effectiveness of reserved areas. To reach the ecological goals of sustainable forest management, there is a need to further coordinate existing data and information but also to fill gaps in particular regarding cross-scale information.

AB We used hoverflies as an indicator group to assess the role of open spaces in maintaining biodiversity within plantation forests. We set out to investigate the factors correlated with hoverfly biodiversity in open spaces in plantation forests, and to make recommendations for planning and management of open spaces in plantation forests to enhance biodiversity. The majority (nearly 80%) of the species we recorded are associated with open space habitats rather than closed-canopy forest. The species richness of the fauna associated with large open spaces was slightly, but significantly, higher in unplanted glades compared to forest roads. The species richness of the open space fauna was positively correlated with forest road width but did not show any relationship with overall amounts of open space. Species with larvae feeding on the foliage of trees and shrubs were associated with the presence of broad-leaved woody vegetation. Species with larvae developing in surface water habitats were associated with wet habitat features. Planning and management for hoverfly biodiversity in Irish conifer plantations should focus on the open space component, and should encourage broad-leaved trees and shrubs and wet habitat features. Wide forest roads or unplanted glades should be included to allow the maintenance of well-developed open space habitat in mature spruce forests. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Sustainable forest management advocates the retention or creation of open space within plantation forests to enhance biodiversity. However, the biodiversity value of these open spaces will depend on the habitat type chosen, as well as open-space size and shape. The present study investigated ground-dwelling spider assemblages in glades, rides and forest roads of various sizes in 12 mature Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis) plantations across Ireland. Spiders were sampled along a transect from the open space into the forest using pitfall traps. Species richness and abundance declined along the open-forest transect with the open-space supporting a unique spider fauna, absent within the forest. Total species richness and richness of species associated with open habitats was significantly greater in the glades. There were few significant linear relationships between species variables and open-space width or area, however roads and rides < 15 in wide did not support an open spider fauna due to the influence of the canopy. No such 'threshold' area was found for glades, probably because the glades investigated did not cover a low range of areas. Open-space habitat type is an important determinant of spider assemblage structure, although open spaces' with high shrub cover or implanted broadleaves did not differ in assemblage structure from those within the plantation. At a large scale the total amount of open space within 200 in of sampling plots was positively correlated with species richness and abundance. Forest management plans should encourage the retention of a range of habitat types in non-linear open space (glades), whereas the biodiversity value of linear open space (rides and roads) will be enhanced if wider than 15 m.

AB We analyzed the dynamics of crop yields and soil organic carbon content (SOC) in a long-term fertilization experiment carried out in the Huang-Huai-Hai Plain of China. The experiment with crop rotation of winter wheat and summer maize started in 1990 and had seven treatments receiving N, P, and K at the same rates if it was applied. The treatments were inorganic fertilization (NPK, NP, PK, NK), organic fertilization (ON), half amount of N from inorganic fertilizer and another half from compost (1/2ON), and no fertilization as control (CK). On average, over 14 years (1990-2003), both wheat and maize yields were the highest and most stable in the NPK treatment. Average wheat and maize yields were 23.7% and 18.0% lower in ON, respectively, and slightly but significantly lower (1.9% and 1.5%, respectively) in 1/2ON than those in NPK. Unbalanced inorganic fertilization without K (NP) was not sustainable for achieving high yields. There was a significant logarithmic relationship between roots and compost input and SOC content in 0-20 cm in 2003. Over the time of the study SOC storage in 0-20 cm increased by 12.2 Mg C ha(-1) in ON, 7.8 Mg C ha(-1) in 1/2ON, and 3.7 Mg C ha(-1) in NPK, and decreased by 1.6 Mg C ha(-1) in NK and 1.4 Mg C ha(-1) in CK. Measured dynamics of SOC and model simulation predictions showed that the SOC in NPK, ON and 1/2ON almost reached equilibrium in 2003. These results indicate that although the balanced application of chemical fertilizers of N, P, and K maintains the crop production in the region, it is not an ideal practice from the point view of carbon sequestration in soil. Application of compost alone has a reverse effect on crop yields and carbon sequestration in soil. Therefore, mixed application of organic and inorganic fertilizers is a compromise between food security and soil carbon sequestration in the region. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.

AB Soil erosion by water is one of the major causes of land degradation in Lebanon. The problem has not yet been treated in detail although it affects vast areas. This study elaborates a model for mapping soil erosion risk in a representative area of Lebanon at a scale of 1: 100,000 using a spatial database and GIS. First, three basic maps were derived: (1) runoff potential obtained from mean annual precipitation, soil-water retention capacity and soil/rock infiltration capacity; (2) landscape sensitivity based on vegetal cover, drainage density and slope; and (3) credibility of rock and soil, Then two thematic maps were derived: potential sensitivity to erosion obtained from the runoff potential and landscape sensitivity maps, and erosion risk based on the potential erosion and erodibility maps. The risk map corresponds well to field observations on the occurrence of rills and gullies. The model used seems to be applicable to other areas of Lebanon, constituting a tool for soil conservation planning and sustainable management. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Hard-rock acid headwater catchments typically exhibit a rapid streamflow response and concomitant rapid mobilisation of soil-derived solutes, such as aluminium, into the aquatic environment during storm events. The rapid stream responses are paradoxically associated with pre-event water dominating the storm hydrograph, however the sources and mechanisms by which 'old' water enters the stream channel and interacts with the soil horizons are stilt poorly understood. To investigate these processes a detailed and novel field study was established in the riparian zone and lower hillstopes of the Hafren catchment at Plynlimon, mid-Wales. This study showed that shallow bedrock groundwaters; discharge into the stream channel. Pressure wave propagation in response to recharge further upslope caused a rapid displacement of shallow groundwaters up into the soils in the near-stream hiltstope. A lateral fast flow horizon transported water down slope as interflow at the soil-bedrock interface such that the upper soil horizons remained largely unsaturated. Only where there was a discontinuity in the lateral fast flow horizon was water forced up as an ephemeral spring discharge at the soil surface. At this site, the major zone of soil water-groundwater coupling was in a narrow (20-25 m) strip next to the stream channel. The zone of soil water-groundwater interaction next to the stream channel is likely to depend on the nature of the lateral flow pathways and the hiltstope characteristic. This study has shown the importance of the near-stream environment as a locus for soil waters that are bedrock groundwater derived; these groundwaters; dominate processes in the deepest soil horizons from where soil components such as aluminium are sourced. Understanding these physical processes is fundamental for understanding upland catchment functioning and has important implications for solute transport modelling and for the sustainable management of surface water systems and stream ecology in these headwater regions.

AB Many recent advances in the theory of the optimal economic exploitation of renewable fish resources have been gained by applying optimal control theory. However, despite these successes, much less is known about how seasonal environments affect the maximum sustainable yield (MSY) (or population persistence) and any effects of relations between intensity and frequency of harvesting. Assuming that fish populations follow Beverton-Holt equations we investigated impulsive harvesting in seasonal environments, focusing on both economic aspects and resource sustainability. We first investigated the existence and stability of a periodic solution and its analytic formula, and then showed that the population persistence depends on the intensity and frequency of harvesting. With the MSY as a management objective, we investigated optimal impulsive harvesting policies. The optimal harvesting effort that maximizes the sustainable yield, the corresponding optimal population level, and the MSY are obtained by using discrete Euler-Lagrange equations and product formulae, and their explicit expressions were obtained in terms of the intrinsic growth rate, the carrying capacity, and the impulsive moments. These results imply that harvest timing is of crucial importance to the MSY Since impulsive differential equations incorporate elements of continuous and discrete systems, we can apply all results obtained for Beverton-Holt equations with impulsive effects to periodic logistic equations with impulsive harvesting.

AB The world has recently been waking up to the urgent need to move away from fossil fuels and towards a low-carbon economy. To achieve this, we need a way of producing electricity that is efficient, widely applicable and cheap. At the same time, there has recently been an appreciation of the tremendous scope for making entirely new types of devices, and even seeing new physics, by structuring matter at the nanoscale. Furthermore, the occurrence of self-assembly in nature suggests that a range of types of nanoscale structures could be made simply and cheaply. The application of nanostructures to photovoltaics combines a field of almost limitless possibilities with a problem of vital urgency. In this paper, some of the newer ideas emerging from this trend are described, along with how they challenge our ideas on what a solar cell looks like. We are at the beginning of a time of radically rethinking the design of the solar cell, which may lead to the exploitation of completely new physical ideas in achieving a sustainable energy future.

AB The pre-industrial natural carrying capacity is believed to have limited the human population in Iceland to a maximum of fifty to sixty thousand inhabitants. Since AD 1800 the Icelandic population has gradually grown up to nearly 300 thousand in 2005. In this paper a simple approach is used to evaluate the potential population size that the pre-industrial Icelandic environment could possibly sustain. A dynamic model was constructed that simulates the population size according to potential biological production available for livestock. Biological production was determined by the extent of the total potential vegetation cover based on the Degree-Day concept. Fluctuations in the mean annual temperature causes changes in the potential vegetation cover and as a consequence change the biological production sustaining livestock and ultimately human population. The simulation's results indicate that the potential population that the Icelandic environments could sustain during the pre-industrial period fluctuated between 40 and 80 thousand. The results further indicate that the severe land degradation experienced after the Viking settlement period in AD 900 had a marginal impact on the population size. The pre-historical population did however overshoot the natural sustainability on several occasions. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We develop optimal conjunctive use water management strategies that balance two potentially conflicting objectives: sustaining irrigated agriculture during droughts and minimizing unnecessary spills and resulting water losses from the reservoir during wet periods. Conjunctive use is specified by a linear operating rule, which determines the maximum surface water release as a function of initial reservoir storage. Optimal strategies are identified using multiobjective interannual optimization for sustainability and spill control, combined with gradient-based annual profit maximization. Application to historical conditions in the irrigated system of the Yaqui Valley, Mexico, yields a Pareto curve of solutions illustrating the trade-off between sustaining agriculture and minimizing spills and water losses. Minimal water losses are obtained by maximizing surface water use and limiting groundwater pumping, such that reservoir levels are kept sufficiently low. Maximum agricultural sustainability, on the other hand, results from increased groundwater use and keeping surface water reservoir levels high during wet periods. Selected optimal operating rules from the multiobjective optimization are tested over a large number of equally probable streamflow time series, generated with a stochastic time series model. In this manner, statistical properties, such as the mean sustainability and sustainability percentiles, are determined for each optimal rule. These statistical properties can be used to select rules for water management that are reliable over a wide range of streamflow conditions.

AB The drumfilter effluent from a recirculation aquaculture system (RAS) can be used as substrate for heterotrophic bacteria production. These bacteria can be reused as aquatic feed. In RAS drumfilter effluents are organic carbon deficient for bacteria production. This is due to nitrogen accumulation in the system water. In the present experiment, a bacteria growth reactor (3.51) was connected to the drumfilter (filter mesh size 60 gm) outlet of a recirculation system. To counteract carbon deficiency, different supplementation levels of molasses (organic carbon) were tested (carbon fluxes of 0.0, 3.2, 5.8, 7.8, 9.7 gC molasses/l/d; C:N ratios: 3.4, 6.4, 9.4, 13.0 and 16.5). The hydraulic retention time in the bacteria reactor was 6 It. For the maximum flux, the VSS and crude protein productions were about 168 gVSS and 95 g crude protein per kg feed. The maximum conversion of nitrate and ortho-phosphate was 24 g NO3-N and 4 gP/kg feed. This equals a conversion of 90% of the inorganic nitrogenous waste and 98% of the ortho-phosphate-P. Furthermore the maximum substrate removal rate and the K, for molasses were determined (1.62 gC/l/h and 0.097 gC/l respectively). The maximum specific removal rate was 0.31 gC/gVSS/h and the related half saturation constant was 0.008 gC/l. The observed growth rate reached a maximum for C fluxes higher than 8 g/l/d. The present integration of heterotrophic bacteria production in RAS represents, therefore, an innovative option to reduce waste discharge by conversion. If the bacteria are reused as feed, system's ecological sustainability increases. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The assessment of clam yield potential and the identification of suitable sites for clam rearing are a necessary step to improve the economic and environmental sustainability of the exploitation activities in a regulated fishery. We discuss the development, validation and application of a method for estimating the clam yield potential of a northern Adriatic lagoon (Sacca di Goro, Italy) by combining logistic and ordinary regression. Clam yield potential was derived on the basis of six environmental parameters, namely sediment type, dissolved oxygen, salinity, hydrodynamism, water depth and chlorophyll "a". Density data were positively skewed and contained a substantial proportion of zero values due to the patchy-distribution of Tapes philippinarum. The original data set was divided in two parts: one indicating if T philippinarum was present or not and the other indicating the abundance of the species when it was present. The presence data was modelled by using logistic regression and the abundance data was separately modelled by using ordinary regression. The two models were then combined to identify suitable sites, to compute the expected clam yield potential in the Goro lagoon and to define the role of each environmental parameter in determining clam presence and abundance. ne two-part model was then validated on a further data set (R-2=0.87), Data on environmental parameters gathered in 15 sampling sites were interpolated via a nearest neighbour algorithm so as to derive maps of each environmental parameter for the whole lagoon. Finally, the two-part model was applied to derive the thematic maps of suitable sites for clam rearing and the corresponding yield potential.
   We claim that this reasonably rapid and cost-effective approach provides a rigorous framework for a fair partition of harvesting concessions among competitive users and for a substantial improvement of transparency in the decision-making process. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Natural populations of two species of Angelica, viz. A. glauca and A. archangelica in subalpine and alpine regions of Garhwal Himalaya were surveyed for the determination of threat status and evaluation of germplasm for domestication and cultivation. The study revealed that frequency of both species was more than 50% in nature. However, density of individuals and area occupied were low compared to other species of alpine and subalpine region, indicating habitat loss and heavy exploitation. Status was determined on site-to-site basis as well as for entire Garhwal region of Western Himalaya. Based on species occurrence in selected areas, both species were identified as critically endangered to endangered in different areas. The results also revealed that natural distribution of these species was narrowing down due to habitat destruction. The number of mature individuals was also very low for both species of Angelica and therefore, status was again assigned as critically endangered for each site. Immediate remedial measures are needed for the conservation of natural sites to ensure sustainable mode of utilization. Efforts were also made to evaluate germplasm for domestication on the basis of morphological variations and yield of rhizomes under natural conditions as well as on the basis of phenotypic traits.

AB Background: People in transitional life stages, such as occupational retirement, are likely to gain weight and accumulate abdominal fat mass caused by changes in physical activity and diet. Hence, retirees are an important target group for weight gain prevention programmes, as described in the present paper.
   Methods/Design: A systematic and stepwise approach ( Intervention Mapping) is used to develop a low-intensity energy balance intervention programme for recent retirees. This one-year, low-intensity multifaceted programme aims to prevent accumulation of abdominal fat mass and general weight gain by increasing awareness of energy balance and influencing related behaviours of participants' preference. These behaviours are physical activity, fibre intake, portion size and fat consumption. The effectiveness of the intervention programme is tested in a cluster randomised controlled trial. Measurements of anthropometry, physical activity, energy intake, and related psychosocial determinants are performed at baseline and repeated at 6 months for intermediate effect, at 12 months to evaluate short-term intervention effects and at 24 months to test the sustainability of the effects.
   Discussion: This intervention programme is unique in its focus on retirees and energy balance. It aims at increasing awareness and takes into account personal preferences of the users by offering several options for behaviour change. Moreover, the intervention programme is evaluated at short-term and long-term and includes consecutive outcome measures ( determinants, behaviour and body composition).

AB Agricultural productivity and sustainability are continually challenged by emerging and indigenous pathogens. Currently, many pathogens can be combated only with biocides or environmentally dangerous fumigants. Here, we report a rapid and pathogen-specific strategy to reduce infection by organisms that target plant roots. Combinatorially selected defense peptides, previously shown to effect premature encystment of Phytophthora capsici zoospores, were fused to maize cytokinin oxidase/dehydrogenase as a display scaffold. When expressed in tomato roots, the peptide-scaffold constructs were secreted and accumulated to sufficient concentrations in the rhizosphere to induce zoospore encystment and thereby deter taxis to the root surface. Pathogen infection was significantly inhibited in roots expressing bioactive peptides fused to the maize cytokinin oxidase/dehydrogenase scaffold. This peptide-delivery technology is broadly applicable for rapid development of plant defense attributes against plant pathogens.

AB Tillage systems may affect many soil properties, which in turn may alter the soil environment and consequently impact on root growth and distribution, and crop yield. In 1993, a long-term field experiment on sustainable crop rotation and ley farming systems was initiated on a Colombian acid-savanna oxisol to test the effects of grain legumes, green manures, intercrops and leys as possible components that could increase the stability of systems involving annual crops. In the present study, five agropastoral treatments ( maize monoculture, maize-soybean rotation, maize-soybean green manure rotation, native savanna, maize-agropastoral rotation) under two tillage systems ( no tillage and minimum tillage) were investigated. Lower bulk density and higher total porosity for all treatments and soil layers were found in no-tillage compared to the minimum tillage system. Between the two tillage systems, significantly higher maize grain yields (p < 0.1) were obtained under no-tillage agropastoral treatments compared to the same treatments under minimum tillage. Maize yields on native savanna soils were markedly lower than in the rest of the treatments, indicating the need for improved soil conditions in subsoil layers for root growth of maize.

AB Biofertilizers are an alternative to mineral fertilizers for increasing soil productivity and plant growth in sustainable agriculture. The objective of this study was to evaluate possible effects of three mineral fertilizers and four plant growth promoting rhizobacteria ( PGPR) strains as biofertilizer on soil properties and seedling growth of barley ( Hordeum vulgare) at three different soil bulk densities, and in three harvest periods. The application treatments included the control ( without bacteria inoculation and mineral fertilizers), mineral fertilizers (N, NP and P) and plant growth promoting rhizobacteria species ( Bacillus licheniformis RC04, Paenibacillus polymyxa RC05, Pseudomonas putida RC06, and Bacillus OSU-142) in sterilized soil. The PGPR, fungi, seedling growth, soil pH, organic matter content, available P and mineral nitrogen were determined in soil compacted artificially to three bulk density levels (1.1, 1.25 and 1.40 Mg m(-3)) at 15, 30, and 45 days of plant harvest. The results showed that all the inoculated bacteria contributed to the amount of mineral nitrogen. Seed inoculation significantly increased the count of bacteria and fungi. Data suggest that seed inoculation of barley with PGPR strains tested increased root weight by 9-12.2%, and shoot weight by 29.7-43.3% compared with control. The N, NP and P application, however, increased root weight up to 18.2, 25.0 and 7.4% and shoot weight by 31.6, 43.4 and 26.4%, respectively. Our data show that PGPR stimulate barley growth and could be used as an alternative to chemical fertilizer. Soil compaction hampers the beneficial plant growth promoting properties of PGPR and should be avoided.

ID EUTROPHICATION
AB In this paper the Basic Water Quality Model (BWQM) for the central part of River Neckar is used to analyse the oxygen budget and to assess the potentials of various measures to prevent or mitigate critical dissolved oxygen (DO) declines. It is shown that the oxygen budget is mainly governed by phytoplankton dynamics. The excessive growth of algae and the sudden break down of the resulting algal blooms may cause episodic DO depressions. Therefore, to stabilise the oxygen budget in a sustainable way, eutrophication has to be controlled within the central part of River Neckar and the upstream regions. The only feasible way to reach this goal appears to be a further drastic reduction of phosphorus emissions. In addition, it is indispensable to hold the very high standards of biochemical oxygen demand and ammonium retention at the wastewater treatment plants. A worse performance of the treatment plants would dramatically aggravate critical DO declines which may be caused by algae dynamics. As long as the oxygen budget is not completely stabilised, weir and turbine aeration can be used to mitigate DO depressions. It could be shown that the potentials of these measures suffice to keep DO at a tolerable level. However, due to the long travel times in River Neckar, it is important to start aeration up to several days before the DO minimum is reached.

AB Farm-to-school (FTS) programs have garnered the attentions and energies of people in a diverse array of social locations in the food system and are serving as a sort of touchstone for many in the alternative agrifood movement. Yet, unlike other alternative agrifood initiatives, FTS programs intersect directly with the long-established institution of the welfare state, including its vestiges of New Deal farm programs and public entitlement. This paper explores how FTS is navigating the liminal terrain of public and private initiative, particularly the ways in which it interfaces with neoliberalism as both a material and discursive project. It examines the political emergence of school food programs and finds that FTS is strikingly similar to traditional school programs in objectives, but differs in approach. Yet, in their efforts to fill in the gaps created by political and economic neoliberalization, FTS advocates are in essence producing neoliberal forms and practices afresh. These include those associated with contingent labor relationships, private funding sources, and the devolution of responsibility to the local, all of which have serious consequences for social equity. The paper also discusses how FTS programs are employing the rhetoric of neoliberal governmentality, including personal responsibility and individual success, consumerism, and choice. While these may be tactical choices used to secure funding in a competitive environment, they may also contribute to the normalization of neoliberalism, further circumscribing the possibilities of what can be imagined and created to solve social problems.

TI Sustainable agriculture and free market economics: Finding common ground
   in Adam Smith
SO AGRICULTURE AND HUMAN VALUES
LA English
DT Article
DE Adam Smith; economic viability; environmental stewardship;
   self-interest; social justice; sustainable agriculture
AB There are two competing approaches to sustainability in agriculture. One stresses a strict economic approach in which market forces should guide the activities of agricultural producers. The other advocates the need to balance economic with environmental and social objectives, even to the point of reducing profitability. The writings of the eighteenth century moral philosopher Adam Smith could bridge the debate. Smith certainly promoted profit-seeking, private property, and free market exchange consistent with the strict economic perspective. However, his writings are also consistent with many aspects of sustainable agriculture. For example, Smith argued that people ought to exercise restraint in their pursuit of self-interest, and he believed in balancing economic with environmental and social considerations. If both sides of the debate more fully regard the work of Adam Smith, then proponents of the strict economic perspective might be more appreciative of the concerns raised within the sustainable agriculture community, while advocates of sustainability might be more effective in achieving the objective of a sustainable agriculture.

   from an exploratory analysis

   social justice; social sustainability; sustainable agriculture
ID STANDARDS
AB Much of the attention by social scientists to the rapidly growing organic agriculture sector focuses on the benefits it provides to consumers (in the form of pesticide-free foods) and to farmers (in the form of price premiums). By contrast, there has been little discussion or research about the implications of the boom in organic agriculture for farmworkers on organic farms. In this paper, we ask the question: From the perspective of organic farmers, does "certified organic'' agriculture encompass a commitment to "sustainability'' that prioritizes social goals? Specifically, we aim to broaden our understanding of the relationship between social sustainability and organic agriculture by drawing attention to issues affecting farmworkers, whose labor and contribution tends to elude most discussions of organic agriculture. We present findings from a survey of organic farmers in California about the possible incorporation of social standards into organic certification criteria. Our findings suggest that, at best, lukewarm support for social certification within organic agriculture exists among certified organic farmers in California. They also question expectations that organic agriculture necessarily fosters social or even economic sustainability for most of the farmers and farmworkers involved. However, we also find exceptions to the patterns evidenced in our survey. In-depth interviews with select organic farmers demonstrate that there are individuals whose practices are atypical and demonstrate that, under some circumstances, an organic production system can be at once environmentally, economically, and socially sustainable.

AB Sustainable agriculture and ways to achieve it are important issues for agricultural policy. However, the concept of sustainability has yet to be made operational in many agricultural situations, and only a few studies so far have addressed the implementation process of sustainable agriculture. This paper provides an assessment of the Territorial Farming Contracts (TFC)-the French model for implementing sustainable agriculture - and aims to give some insights into the ways to facilitate the development of sustainable farming. Using a systems approach, the founding concept of the TFC model, an analysis has been made of the TFCs signed in the Midi-Pyrenees Region in south-western France. The results show that the first aspect of sustainability apparent in farmers' projects referred to economic objectives. The environmental and social aspects were not foremost in the farming changes undertaken. In addition, the territorial dimension of the TFC was under-addressed. The majority of TFCs reveal a moderate or even low convergence with territorial priorities. These results are explained partly by the dominance of professional farming organizations in the implementation of TFC, and they imply that the organizational social dimensions of sustainability must not be neglected.

ID FARMER FIELD SCHOOLS
AB Multiplicity and continual change characterize the Peruvian agricultural knowledge and information system (AKIS), reflecting changes in the agricultural sector as a whole. The evolution of these changes can be traced back to the pre-Columbian era when a relatively stable and well-organized system based on indigenous knowledge prevailed. During colonial (1532-1821) and early Republican times (beginning 1821) several changes affecting the agricultural sector contributed to a weakening of indigenous knowledge systems. During the 20th century extension services provided by the government and a variety of private organizations began to play an important role in the dissemination of information, albeit in an erratic way. Since the 1970s the system increased in complexity with the emergence of non- governmental institutions. Today government participation is limited and there is a more important participation by a number of NGOs and private organizations. This diversity of actors using different approaches has generated disarray in the information system owing to the lack of coherent policies to guide the interaction among actors. This paper uses the case of potato pest control-related information to illustrate changes in local knowledge systems. It differentiates pest control based on indigenous knowledge, chemical control, and integrated pest management (IPM) and explains how changes in the system have influenced the use of these three types of information in AKIS. Currently, the coexistence of different types of potato pest control information promoted and used by diverse and usually unconnected sets of organizations and individuals presents a challenge and requires inter-institutional action guided by clear policies to promote sustainable agriculture.

AB This paper presents the results of a large-scale study designed to monitor the impact arising from the introduction of insect-resistant Bt cotton in the Makhathini Flats, Republic of South Africa. Bt cotton provides a degree of resistance to cotton bollworm complex (Lepidoptera). Data were collected on the use of insecticides (type and quantity) as well as the farm-level economics of production from over 2200 farmers in three growing seasons (1998/1999, 1999/2000 and 2000/2001). and the results are discussed within the context of environmental impact brought about by insecticide. Over the three seasons of the study it was clear that Bt cotton provided benefits in terms of higher yield and gross margin relative to farmers growing conventional (non-Bt) cotton, and the benefits were particularly apparent for the smallest producers. Bt growers also used significantly less insecticide than growers of non-Bt cotton. Once quantities of insecticide applied to Bt and non-Bt cotton were converted into a Biocide Index and an Environmental Impact Quotient (EIQ) in order to allow for differences in terms of toxicity and persistence in the environment, it was apparent that the growing of Bt had a less negative impact on the environment. While this points to beneficial impacts on agricultural sustainability there are wider concerns regarding the vulnerability of resource-poor farmers in an area with limited (as yet) marketing options for their product and options for livelihood diversification both within and outside agriculture. Cotton producers in Makhathini are vulnerable as they rely on just One company for inputs (including, credit) and for their market. While Bt cotton provides benefits it does not in itself address some of the structural limitations that farmers face. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID STOMACH CARCINOGENESIS; INFECTION; RISK; ASSOCIATION
AB Aim To conduct a retrospective multicentre study at 31 medical centres in Japan, to investigate the association between the eradication of Helicobacter pylori and the development of new gastric cancer after endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) for early gastric cancer.
   Methods Patients included those in whom early gastric cancer had been removed by EMR, and who had received follow-up endoscopic treatment. All patients underwent follow-up endoscopic treatment at least once a year after the initial EMR. The rate of new gastric cancer development was compared among those patients for whom H. pylori had been successfully eradicated and those with persistent H. pylori infection.
   Results The study included 2835 patients with a median follow-up period of 2 years (range 0.5-12 years). Helicobacter pylori was eradicated in 356 patients (13%). Metachronous gastric cancers developed in eight (2%) patients among those who had been successfully treated for H. pylori, compared with 129 patients (5%) among those with persistent H. pylori infection (P = 0.021; OR = 0.42; 95% CI = 0.20-0.86).
   Conclusion Although longer term, prospective randomized controlled trials are needed to better estimate the extent and sustainability of possible benefits, this study suggests that the eradication of H. pylori may help reduce the incidence of metachronous gastric cancer.

AB Production and consumption of food and in a rural area over the last 400 years were reconstructed for a parish in south east Sweden. This was based on a number of different data sources, including historical maps and official demographic and agricultural statistics. Changes in population (and thus consumption) and the production from arable land and livestock were calculated and used to provide an estimate of the area's supply and demand over time, and of the historical sustainability of the area. Overall food productivity was remarkably constant over time, at approximately 0.04 kgC m(-2) y(-1), despite recent changes in population size and the area of cultivated land. The empirical results from the past and the present, together with the future land changes due to shoreline displacement were used to predict the situation in the future. These final estimates can be used in the assessment of risk for exposure to contaminated food for the future population in the area.

DE sustainability planning; community practice; outcomes based funding;
   United Way planning
AB This paper provides a historical case study of efforts to implement and sustain "outcomes based funding" in a large United Way system in Central Ohio. The case study describes how community practitioners employed specific strategies to promote sustainability. The use of these strategies corresponds to several techniques suggested in the sustainability literature. This case study is offered as a means of considering how practitioners helped sustain the shift to outcomes based funding within the United Way system. In addition, this case study demonstrates how skills related to implementation and sustainability might be transferred to other situations where practitioners are interested in promoting change within large organizations and/or communities. The authors suggest that skills related to implementation and sustainability are essential to community practice.

TI Designing a sustainable national registry for stroke quality improvement

AB Several studies have shown wide variations in the delivery of hospital-based care to patients with acute ischemic stroke. The findings of these studies suggest that recommendations drawn from published evidence-based or consensus-based guidelines are implemented inconsistently. Although rates of adherence to stroke quality indicators can be increased through the use of targeted quality improvement (QI) efforts, stroke QI programs are still in their infancy. Current stroke QI programs are often highly variable and poorly coordinated, rely on differing definitions of key data elements and/or indicators, and are challenging to implement and sustain in resource-constrained healthcare environments. Key barriers to long-term success of these programs include inadequate funding at the local and national level, lack of infrastructure to support electronic data capture for QI as part of the process of patient care, lack of a single clearinghouse for uniform data definitions and performance indicator descriptions, competing survey instruments to monitor hospitalized stroke care, and constraints on inpatient and post-discharge data collection imposed by the new Federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act Privacy Rule. In addition, the competing needs of registry activities (e.g., complete case ascertainment) versus QI efforts (e.g., incremental tests of change) must be balanced. Potential solutions include: (1) financial incentives to healthcare providers and institutions for participation in QI initiatives; (2) financial incentives to healthcare providers and institutions for measurable improvements in care; (3) mandatory data reporting on key measures of stroke care; and (4) promotion of active and sustainable collaborations among key stakeholders including healthcare providers (e.g., physicians, nurses), healthcare organizations (e.g., hospitals, physicians' groups), quality improvement organizations, health payers and insurers, public health departments, and state and federal health agencies to create a single national stroke registry for stroke QI.

AB In this article we extend the theory of community prediction by presenting seven hypotheses for predicting community structure in a directionally changing world. The first three address well-studied community responses to environmental and ecological change: ecological communities are most likely to exhibit threshold changes in structure when perturbations cause large changes in limiting soil or sediment resources, dominant or keystone species, or attributes of disturbance regime that influence community recruitment. Four additional hypotheses address social-ecological interactions and apply to both ecological communities and social-ecological systems. Human responsiveness to short-term and local costs and benefits often leads to human actions with unintended long-term impacts, particularly those that are far from the site of decision making or are geographically dispersed. Policies are usually based on past conditions of ecosystem services rather than expected future trends. Finally, institutions that strengthen negative feedbacks between human actions and social-ecological consequences can reduce human impacts through more responsive (and thus more effective) management of public ecosystem services. Because of the large role that humans play in modifying ecosystems and ecosystem services, it is particularly important to test and improve social-ecological hypotheses as a basis for shaping appropriate policies for long-term ecosystem resilience.

AB The development process which humanity passed through favored a series of conquests, reflected in the better quality of life and longevity, however, it also provoked upsets and severe transformation in the environment and in the human food security. Such process is driving the ecosystems to be homogeneous, and, therefore, the nutrients' supply, via nourishment. To change this panorama, the present work discusses the gains of incorporating the stonemeal technique as a strategic alternative to give back the essential fertile characteristics to the soils. This technology has the function of facilitating the rejuvenation of the soils and increasing the availability of the necessary nutrients to the full development of the plants which is a basic input for the proliferation of life in all its dimensions.

AB During the second half of the 20th century, the introduction of new chemical agriculture technologies brought about a revolution in food production, but this has also cause deep deterioration in our relationships with the natural environment. In developing tropical countries, record yields were accompanied by rural exodus, widespread deforestation and loss of topsoil. The stonemeal research described herein is an alternative to such practices as it is an environmental friendly and socially responsible technology based on soil rejuvenation and conservation by means of the addition of natural rock powders that are rich in phosphorous, calcium, magnesium, potassium and micronutrients. The research adopted an inter-disciplinary approach and was conducted among small farmers of a rural community located in the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil. The major goal was to demonstrate that there is a harmless cheap and simple alternative to fertilizing degraded or impoverished soils, which allow farmers to sustain high productivity and to remain on their plots of land. Results have confirmed the economic, environmental and productive feasibility and advantage of the stonemeal technique for corn, rise, manioc, sugar cane and horticultural species, when compared to the use of chemical fertilizers. The fertilization of the soil with rocks, allows the understanding of the natural processes, which maintain production levels while building a sustainable fertile soil.

AB Japanese Islands are covered with weathered volcanic rocks and soils. Terraced rice field are located in green-tuff areas which are very fertile but where landslides occur associated to strong earthquakes. The Xray diffraction and X-ray fluorescence analyses of the soils in landslide area identified predominant smectite and Mg, Al, Si, K, Ti, Mn and Fe are main components. The rice leaf showed that S, Cl, K and Ca play important roles for nutrients in the area. Drainpipe systems have set up in the green-tuff areas to reduce the risks of landslides. Reddish brown microbial mats inhabited bacteria and diatom in the drainpipe outlets. The microbial mats are rich in Fe and PO43-. The iron bacteria in the ground water have a high metabolic rate suggesting that the weathering materials were produced by not only physical and chemical influence but also by microorganism. Many microorganisms attach to mineral surfaces and show their high impact in the water mineral chemistry in the landslide area. Bacteria in the green-tuff over landslide area play important roles for sustainable agriculture including rice nutrition.

SO ANNALS OF PHARMACOTHERAPY
LA English

DE community pharmacy services; Portugal
ID PHARMACEUTICAL CARE
AB OBJECTIVE: To describe the status and outline the trends of community pharmacy services in the Portuguese healthcare system.
   FINDINGS: The legal framework for Portuguese pharmacies includes geographic and demographic criteria for opening pharmacies and restricting ownership to pharmacists. Since 1975, pharmacy owners have been organized under one association, the Portuguese National Pharmacy Association, which has dealt with pharmacy development over the past 20 years. Securing the economic sustainability of pharmacies was the first milestone. Investing in information software and communication technologies and modernizing the architecture of pharmacies was the next step. Then, professional services such as point-of-care measurements, drug waste management, and needle exchange services were developed. The methadone substitution program was introduced at a later date. Finally, major comprehensive services, including disease management/pharmaceutical care programs, were implemented.
   DISCUSSION: All Portuguese pharmacies are independent, which means that the decision to provide different services and the extent to which they are attained vary from pharmacy to pharmacy. Recent political changes seem to reinforce the need to pursue the strategies already defined-to expand the traditional scope of pharmacy business to a wider range of health services.
   CONCLUSIONS: Achievements that have been accomplished and strategies that are in place reflect a high level of organization and unity among Portuguese pharmacies. From a global perspective, pharmacies are reorganizing to be able to compete against other possible agents and are preparing to expand their scope of intervention.

AB A diverse soil microbial community is an important measure of sustainable land use. Turfgrasses are usually managed as a monostand, which may result in reduced soil microbial diversity. However, there is little information on the structure and diversity of soil microorganisms in managed turfgrass systems. We examined the soil microbial community in a turfgrass chronosequence (i.e., 1, 6, 23 and 95 years), established from native pines, to address (1) the degree to which microbial diversity is achieved and maintained in turfgrass soils and (2) the relative importance of turfgrass management versus land-use change (i.e., native pines to turfgrass) in structuring the soil microbial community. Soil microbial communities were fingerprinted using phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) composition, and also by the pattern of sole C source utilization (i.e., community-level physiological profiles, CUP). The relative diversities of soil microbial communities as a function of land use and turfgrass ages were compared using the Shannon index. Multivariate analysis was used to detail variations in soil microbial communities. Despite the differences in land use and turfgrass age, microbial biodiversity was generally similar for the various soils, with the exception that diversity was lower in soils taken from 5 to 15 cm depth of the two youngest turfgrass systems. This reduction was correlated with low soil C, and suggests that soil organic matter (OM) is a primary determinant of microbial community diversity. Both CLPP- and PLFA-based principal component analyses (PCA) revealed distinct groupings of soil microbial communities based on land use but not on turfgrass age. There was a preferential use of phenolic compounds and carboxylic acids by the microbial community in native pine soils, whereas carbohydrates were the preferred C source for microbial communities in turfgrass soils. This difference in catabolic function was mirrored by a compositional change of phospholipid fatty acids. Cluster analysis of community structure indicated that microbial communities in older turfgrass systems (23 and 95 years old) diverged from younger systems (1 and 6 years old), implying some effect of management on composition and structure of the soil microbial community. Our study concludes that a diverse soil microbial community was achieved and maintained in turfgrass systems, and that shifts in soil microbial community structure were attributed primarily to the change of land use rather than the length of turfgrass management.

AB A sustainable semi-intensive pond aquaculture technology including major carp species as cash-crop and small indigenous fish species (SIS) as food for the farmers' families is being optimized in Bangladesh. The inclusion of silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix), a cheap large species affordable by poor farmers, is now being considered. As part of a study on the effects of this filter feeder on polycultures including the large carps rohu (Labeo rohita), catla (Catla catla) and common carp (Cyprinus carpio) and the SIS punti (Puntius sophore) and mola (Amblypharyngodon mola), an experiment was carried out to test the effects of silver carp and of each SIS species on the growth, survival and yield of the large and small fish and on pond ecology.
   The ecology of the ponds was dominated by changes in time, strongly related to the development of a surface plankton scum at the beginning of the culture season and weather conditions. The surface scum increased decomposition processes and decreased algal development in the water body, promoted photosynthesis and ammonium release and-reduced nitrification. Over those effects, the presence of silver carp in the ponds decreased algal biomass through grazing and promoted nitrification providing and resuspending particles in the water column. These effects were also produced by mola, but were evident only in the absence of silver carp. Punti stirring on the pond bottom increased nutrient flow from the sediments into the water column and promoted nitrification, but were also evident only in the absence of silver carp. The addition of 10 silver carp over the 99 large carps stocked in the 100m(2) fishponds did not affect punti and mola reproduction in the ponds, negatively affected rohu and catla growth and yield by about 20-25% but not their survival did not affect common carp performance, reduced punti harvested biomass by 10%, reduced mola performance by about 50%, and silver carp's own biomass increased total yield and total income in about 20% each.
   The addition of 250 mola or punti to the large carp polycultures did not affect the performance of any of the large carps. The decreased income from selling the more expensive large carps was more than compensated by that obtained from silver carp, which increased total income by 13-24% as compared to the corresponding treatments without silver carp. This allows the option to the farmer of selling part of the silver carp to complete the cash income that would have been obtained from large carps only if silver carp would not be stocked, and consume the rest with the family.

AB Predation of cultivated mussels by diving ducks can threaten the viability of mussel farms. Conventional scaring tactics have had limited success at deterring ducks from feeding on cultivated mussels, because of rapid habituation and 24-h feeding cycles of some waterfowl species. We tested a socking material containing a biodegradable protective layer against predation by diving ducks on experimental blue mussel (Mytilus edulis) aquaculture sites in Prince Edward Island, Canada. We also assessed the effect of this new socking material on mussel growth and survival. Results showed that the protective socking has the potential to reduce losses to ducks, but did not perform well for all mussel seed sizes used by the industry. The protective layer also did not biodegrade fast enough, trapping a portion of mussels inside the sock, affecting growth and survival of these mussels. Improvements are needed to make this solution effective for all mussel sizes used by the industry and to make its production more cost effective.

AB Is it possible, desirable or even sensible to do away with the flush-drains of the Verbois dam? Seen in the perspective of sustainable development what are the stakes attached to a change of modus operandi regarding sediments? In other words, what would be the ensuing long term environmental, social and economical advantages or drawbacks? Those are the central questions that were debated during the Rhone Congress held in Geneva on June 15 and 16, 2006. This article gives an overview of the historical, technical and human dimensions of the problematic involved: a complex local problem with multiple stakes. It concludes by stressing the necessity to reinforce the Franco-Swiss cross-border cooperation and to extend the ''Rhone Plan, a project of sustainable development'', set up in France, to the whole river, from its source at Gletsch in Switzerland down to its mouth in the Mediterranean.

DE sediment management; gravel transit; river bed slope; sediment flushing
   Rhone river; Geneva; Chevres dam; Verbois dam; monitoring
AB Historical data put in evidence that the main aim of flushing events on the Rhone river downstream of Geneva since 1900 was to deal with huge quantities of gravel carried by the Arve river River (80000 m(3)/year). Since the early 30's, with the decrease of gravel, input the aim of flushing became the evacuation of fine grained sediments, deposited from suspension, to preserve sufficient bed slope to evacuate gravel in the case of return of bed load. Indeed, such a situation is likely to occur, as the extraction of gravel quarries on the Arve river stopped in 1983. Today, the Verbois reservoir morphology still guarantees the evacuation of gravel. However, the absence of any further flushing could limit the transit of the gravel on the long term.
   Gravel and suspended sediment management can be performed by different ways modifying water level, discharge and direct modifications in the Rhone river bed, such as dredging. Also, the choice of the best sediment management method is difficult because of the complexity of the ''Rhone system''. Multicriteria analysis helps to select the best possible solution. A monitoring to define scientifically the state of the Rhone river and the Verbois reservoir is currently set up. The selected method will allow to measure in an objective way the consequences of reservoir management according to the criteria of sustainable development.

AB In the current economic situation regarding electric generation and conservation of the environment, it is essential to develop sustainable technologies. From this point of view, hydropower is an excellent resource with a consequently high value. The system presented herein aims to optimize the use of this energy while bringing a solution both economic and respectful of the environment. The studied submerged flow current turbines, consist of an assembly of two turbines immersed which converts the kinetic energy of the flow current into electric power without needing any weir structure, contrary to the traditional exploitation of the potential energy in a run-off-river plant. The designer chose Switzerland and more particularly the Rhone River as pilot project site for the first feasibility study in Europe. The study confirms the technical feasibility of the system.

AB The River Rhone Plan gathers together a number of participants for a project of sustainable development of the river Rhone during the next 20 years. This Plan is composed of six themes: flood prevention - water quality - energy - transportation - culture - tourism. The concept of ''river-heritage'' testifies to the gathering of many actors. The interregional agreement project implementing the Plan from 2007 to 2013 translates this gathering into programmes.

AB The Charter of water management in the Lemanic region was drawn up within the scope of a process involving citizens and a group of experts, and was adopted by the participants to the ''Etats generaux de I'eau'' conference held at Geneva on October 25, 2005. Many persons and communities have joined since. The Charter comprises 13 clauses which sum up the basic principles of the sustainable development of water. Its application should facilitate the evolution of the present state of management of that precious resource to be carried out within the limits of sustainable development. This article puts forward possible actions that can be taken by communes to put these principles into practice. The ultimate object is to promote the sustainable development of water at the Lemanic scale.

AB The speakers and the participants of the Congres du Rh (o) over cap ne (organised by the Industrial Services of Geneva in June 2006) seem to agree that holistic approaches (i.e., basin-scale strategies) are necessary for an effective management of the Rhone ecosystem within a framework of sustainable development. The ultimate success of such strategies depends, however, on some factors which have not been discussed in sufficient depth during the ''Congres''. These factors include (but are not necessarily limited to): a better interdisciplinary cooperation among the different interested parties; a better appreciation of the temporal scales at which natural environmental processes occur; a recognition that sustainable development cannot come without some associated socio-economical costs; and a correction of the anthropocentric vision of nature. Some considerations on these issues are offered in the present essay as a contribution for developing effective, equitable and socially acceptable, long-term management strategies for the Rhone river basin.

AB The Congress on the Rhone River stemmed from the debate on the flushing out of the sediments accumulated behind the dam of Verbois (Geneva). This practice has been criticised by the fishermen and the ecologists, because of the damage caused to the fish population and to the riverbed.
   The Congress revealed the complexity of the Rhone basin and the numerous initiatives taken to deal with it. It showed a strong willingness of the Swiss and French partners to work together It revealed that the Rhone River is a good model for the theoretical study, and for the implementation of the notion of sustainable development.

AB Understanding how hypobaria can affect net photosynthetic (P-net) and net evapotranspiration rates of plants is important for the Mars Exploration Program because low-pressured environments may be used to reduce the equivalent system mass of near-term plant biology experiments on landers or future bioregenerative advanced life support systems. Furthermore, introductions of plants to the surface of a partially terraformed Mars will be constrained by the limits of sustainable growth and reproduction of plants to hypobaric conditions. To explore the effects of hypobaria on plant physiology, a low-pressure growth chamber (LPGC) was constructed that maintained hypobaric environments capable of supporting short-term plant physiological studies. Experiments were conducted on Arabidopsis thaliana maintained in the LPGC with total atmospheric pressures set at 101 (Earth sea-level control), 75, 50, 25 or 10 kPa. Plants were grown in a separate incubator at 101 kPa for 6 weeks, transferred to the LPGC, and acclimated to low-pressure atmospheres for either 1 or 16 h. After 1 or 16 h of acclimation, CO2 levels were allowed to drawdown from 0.1 kPa to CO2 compensation points to assess P-net rates under different hypobaric conditions. Results showed that P-net increased as the pressures decreased from 101 to 10 kPa when CO2 partial pressure (pp) values were below 0.04 kPa (i.e., when ppCO(2) was considered limiting). In contrast, when ppCO(2) was in the nonlimiting range from 0.10 to 0.07 kPa, the P-net rates were insensitive to decreasing pressures. Thus, if CO2 concentrations can be kept elevated in hypobaric plant growth modules or on the surface of a partially terraformed Mars, P-net rates may be relatively unaffected by hypobaria. Results support the conclusions that (i) hypobaric plant growth modules might be operated around 10 kPa without undue inhibition of photosynthesis and (ii) terraforming efforts on Mars might require a surface pressure of at least 10 kPa (100 mb) for normal growth of deployed plant species.

AB In this overview paper, the following questions are addressed:
   1) What are the challenges facing the European Union nuclear fission research community in the short (today), medium (2010) and long term (2040)?
   2) What kind of research and technological development (RTD) does Euratom offer to respond to these challenges, in particular in the area of reactor systems and fuel cycles?
   In the general debate about energy supply technologies there are challenges of both a scientific and technological (S/T) as well as an economic and political (E/P) nature. Though the Community research programme acts mainly on the former, there is nevertheless important links with Community policy. These not only exist in the specific area of nuclear policy.
   It is shown in the particular area of nuclear fission, to what extent Euratom research, education and innovation ("knowledge Triangle: Education, Research, and Innovation") respond to the S/T challenges: (1) sustainability, (2) economics, (3) safety, and (4) proliferation resistance.
   At the European Commission (EC), the research related to nuclear reactor systems and fuel cycles is principally under the responsibility of the 2 Directorates Generals (DG) DG Research (RTD, located in Brussels), which implements and manages the programme of "indirect actions", and the DG Joint Research Centre (JRC, headquarters in Brussels and 7 scientific institutes in 5 Member States) which carries out "direct actions" in their own laboratories.
   In this HTR-2006 introductory paper, the emphasis is on the indirect and direct actions of the 6(th) Euratom research framework programme 2003-2006, FP-6, with special emphasis on V/HTR Generation IV research.

AB Objectives: To explore the local service delivery level when information technology (IT) was introduced into a non-profit residential aged care facility.
   Methods: Theoretical sampling provided participants from occupational groups staffing day-to-day work activities. Twenty-two participants were interviewed about the compulsory use of computers in daily routines, and the role of IT in service delivery.
   Findings: Analysis of interview data identified five themes. Three related to local service delivery issues that stemmed from the restructuring of daily work practices. Two themes, which enforced the change at local level, related to the idea of sustainability.
   Conciusion: IT was regarded as part of the new focus in aged care towards outcome-related goals such as efficiency, fiscal sustainability and quality. Nonetheless, these outcomes were perceived by the staff to be separate from the care given to the residents, indicating that staff could not yet reconcile the new procedural requirements with their caregiving practice.

DT Article

   YOUTH; TIME
AB Objective: To describe the prevalence and distribution (by demographic characteristics and body mass index [BMI] category) of sedentary behaviour among Australian adolescents aged 11-15 years.
   Method. Cross-sectional representative population survey of school students (n=2,750) in New South Wales, conducted in 2004. Students' self-reported time spent during a usual week in five categories of sedentary behaviour (small screen recreation [SSR], education, cultural, social and non-active travel). Height and weight were measured.
   Results: Grade 6, 8 and 10 students spent approximately 34 hours, 41 hours and 45 hours/week of their discretionary time, respectively, engaged in sedentary behaviour. Urban students and students from Asian-speaking backgrounds spent significantly more time sedentary than students from rural areas or other cultural backgrounds. SSR accounted for 60% and 54% of sedentary behaviour among primary and high school students, respectively. Overweight and obese students spent more time in SSR than healthy weight students. Out-of-school hours educational activities accounted for approximately 20% of sedentary behaviour and increased with age. Girls spent twice the time in social activities compared with boys. Time spent in cultural activities declined with age.
   Conclusion: Sedentary behaviours among young people differ according to sex, age and cultural background. At least half of all time spent in sedentary behaviours was spent engaged in SSR. BMI was significantly associated with sedentary behaviour among some children, but not consistently across age groups.
   Implications: A clear understanding of young people's patterns of sedentary behaviour is required to develop effective and sustainable intervention programs to promote healthy living.

AB Objective:: Clinical educators in nursing perform a crucial role in facilitating effective learning for students of nursing. They have the potential to act as a catalysing agent for learning - motivating students to make links between theory and practice, moving students safely from the known to the unknown, developing clinical skills and reflective practice. Whilst their role is extremely important, clinical educators in Australia are undervalued and under-supported. They are isolated and fragmented, and lack a unifying professional body and infrastructure to assist them in education, research and practice development. This paper reports on a study to explore what educational solutions could help to resolve the problem.
   Design: A qualitative design utilising snowball sampling and semi-structured interviews was conducted.
   Setting:. The study took place in Queensland and thus results are limited to the needs identified in this region of Australia.
   Subjects: Ten participants provided their views about educational innovations.
   Conclusions: There is strong support for a curriculum focused on clinical education and centred on the concept of a learning community in order to provide community and build capacity in the specialty group so that they become self-reliant and their achievements and contributions are sustainable.

ID LOCAL-GOVERNMENT; GOVERNANCE; POLICY
AB The management of community infrastructure by local governments has emerged as a significant policy issue in Australia as evidence mounts of a funding shortfall to maintain ageing physical assets. In 2003 the Victorian government introduced a new infrastructure management policy to focus local government decision-making on service potential and financial sustainability rather than political interests or community preference. However, the policy relies on a model of local government as a service provider that is inattentive to new interests in community building and governance and takes limited account of the wider social value of community facilities. This article backgrounds debates over infrastructure, particularly at local level, and critically analyses the new policy direction set by the Victorian government.

AB This paper demonstrates that Federal spending is not inherently financially constrained and does not have to be facilitated via prior taxation or debt-issuance. It also refutes the claim that budget deficits result in higher interest rates in the future, with lower levels of capital formation and economic growth as a consequence. These misconceptions together lead to the nonsensical claim that by running surpluses now the Government will be better able (because it has 'more funds stored away') to cope with future spending demands. The paper thus challenges the conventional view, such as that espoused in the 2002 Australian Treasury Intergenerational Report, that the ageing population will place unsustainable demands on the Federal budget.

AB Stochastic uncertainty is a common feature of many control engineering problems, and is also present in a wider class of applications, e.g. finance and sustainable development. Recent work proposed a constrained MPC approach that took explicit account of the distributions of uncertain model parameters but used terminal equality constraints to ensure stability. The present paper reformulates the problem in order to relax the stability constraints by invoking appropriate terminal inequalities. The application of the proposed strategy and its advantages over earlier work are illustrated by means of a numerical example. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Control of diseases caused by fungi in both medicine and agriculture is heavily dependent on the use of triazoles. As a consequence, resistance to triazoles is a threat to both human health and the sustainability of agricultural production systems. in human pathogens, particularly Candida albicans, mutations encoding alterations in the target cytochrome P450 sterol 14 alpha-demethylase (CYP51; where CYP is cytochrome P450) enzyme are the primary determinants of triazole resistance. in fungal pathogens of cereals, CYP51A1 modifications, some at positions known to contribute to a resistant phenotype in human pathogens, have also been identified in isolates with altered triazole-sensitivity. However, unlike medicine where resistance to triazoles is a major clinical problem, failures of triazoles to control crop diseases in the field are rare with mean population sensitivities generally remaining low, perhaps due to differences in the selection pressures imposed on human and cereal pathogen populations. Nonetheless, the biological potential for resistance exists, and the question remains as to whether widespread triazole resistance can develop in an important cereal pathogen.

AB This paper reports the outcomes of a novel inter-twining of long-term monitoring data and population modelling to assess the accuracy of predictions of a Population Viability Analysis (PVA) model. In particular, the relative effectiveness of different management options for reserving areas from timber harvesting was assessed for two forest-dependent arboreal marsupials, the greater glider (Petauroides volans) and Leadbeater's Possum (Gymnobelideus leadbeateri). We used data from 7 years of monitoring conducted at 161 sites to assess and modify, where appropriate, previous population models of the two species of arboreal marsupials. The results indicated that the importance of food resources for both had been underestimated in past work. Despite this, the modified models that included increased importance of food availability did not change the predicted risks of decline substantially, particularly for Leadbeater's Possum. Importantly, past conclusions about the optimal sizes of patches to reserve within the forests used wood production were robust to changes in the model. This is a valuable finding because the work we report is one of the first to empirically test the robustness of the relative predictions of a PVA model. Nevertheless, the new insights we derived from this study have implications both for: (1) the implementation of our ongoing long-term monitoring study, in particular the value of what can be termed 'adaptive monitoring', and, (2) the establishment of a new silvicultural experiment designed to better create habitat for arboreal marsupials within logged and regenerated sites.

TI Home gardens in western Nepal: opportunities and challenges for on-farm

AB Home gardens are defined as a system of production of diverse crop plant species, which can be adjacent to household or slightly further away and is easily accessible. Species composition and management systems of Nepalese home gardens are poorly known. The study was conducted to develop an inventory on composition of crop species and varietal diversity to characterise the home gardens of Rupandehi and Gulmi of western Nepal, and to observe the species change over the time for last 10-15 years. Semi-structured Interviews, Direct Observation and Focus Group Discussions were employed to collect primary data. Shannon-Weaver index (SWI) was used to determine the species richness. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was employed to characterise the home gardens. Mid-hill SWI (H' = 4.41) revealed the higher species diversity (131 species) as compared to terai (123 species). This species richness was significantly higher (p = 0.001) in the mid-hill area. The vegetable species constitute the major component followed by fruits and fodder species that also contributed to the species diversity. The size of home gardens and species richness was positively correlated (r (s) = 0.29, p = 0.001). Twenty crop species have been lost during the last 10-15 years and eleven species were threatened in the studied home gardens. Inaccessibility of local seed crops and deforestation were the major causes reported accounting for this trend. Self-saved seed was the major source of planting material in home gardens. There is a need to study the seed supply system for these home gardens. Therefore, a challenge is to make these home gardens self-supporting through creating a mechanism on strengthening local seed supply systems for long term sustainability of home garden in agrobiodiversity management.

AB Management of pests and diseases remains a key issue for agricultural profitability and environmental health. Moves towards sustainability require a reduction in chemical toxicity loadings and conservation of natural enemies to maintain pest control. There is a lot of information from laboratory tests regarding the effects of chemicals on beneficial predators and parasitoids but very few translations of these effects into field impacts particularly under commercial conditions. To address this issue we calculated a chemical toxicity score for 19 commercial vineyards based on IOBC toxicity ratings and application number, and compared this to extensive field collections to determine if natural enemy populations can be related to predicted toxicity loadings. Invertebrates were sampled four times during the growing season using canopy sticky traps and ground level pitfall traps. Ordination analyses using non-metric multidimensional scaling indicated community structure in vineyards correlated to site chemical use, while principal components analyses identified the taxa involved. One ordination axis from canopy data and two axes from ground level data were correlated to overall IOBC ratings for the vineyards. Principal components analyses indicated that spiders, lacewings, carabids and parasitoids were all affected by chemical use. IOBC rating based on laboratory studies therefore correlated with chemical effects on field populations of natural enemies in commercial vineyards where complexes of pesticides were applied. The use of chemicals with low toxicity to beneficials as predicted by IOBC ratings will contribute to preservation and maintenance of natural enemies in vineyard ecosystems. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

AB There are significant opportunities for expansion of a forest bioenergy industry in Australia based on distributed electricity generation and production of liquid fuels (ethanol and bio-oil). If the large amounts of forest residues already available annually could be utilized, this would deliver useful greenhouse benefits, assist regeneration of new forests that have increased environmental values, and benefit silvicultural management. Creation of new forests in low rainfall environments for both environmental and commercial reasons will also provide residues in the future that could be used for energy production, thus enhancing overall viability of such ventures. Currently, there are several serious impediments to realising the potential. These include: center dot Large reserves of accessible coal, and low cost of electricity generated in coal-fired power plants. center dot Uncertain greenhouse and renewable energy policy (specifically that relating to implementation of the Mandated Renewable Energy Target (MRET)). center dot Lack of proven efficient small-scale technology to enable distributed electricity generation that would reduce transportation costs for delivery of biofuels. center dot Controversy over the sustainable use of native forest residues for renewable energy generation. center dot Lack of markets for environmental credits (carbon, salinity, biodiversity). center dot Lack of efficient processes for producing ethanol from wood, inadequate commercial products from lignin, and the need for further development before diesel engines can be run on bio-oil for stationary power generation and transport. In Australia, apart from the use of firewood for domestic heating, forest bioenergy has developed only to a very limited extent, despite the existence of significant opportunities. A major impediment to expansion is lack of public acceptance and support, especially for the use of native forest residues which are the main available biomass source. A concerted effort at several levels is needed to address this issue. (c) 2006 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB It is necessary to assess the effects of removing nutrient-rich harvest residues (brash) from clearfell sites because there is a growing market for this brash as bioenergy. The aim of this study was to use stable isotope techniques in a model system to trace nutrients released by decomposing brash. Labelled biomass was obtained by growing Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis (Bong.) Carr.) seedlings with a generous or poor nutrient supply containing elevated (15)N, (41)K, (26)Mg, and (44)Ca. This biomass was used in two subsequent studies. In this study (Part I of II), the above-ground biomass was harvested and placed on soil in a pot containing a newly planted seedling. Soils from two forests, Ae and Teindland, of contrasting nutritional status were used. A full destructive harvest was undertaken after one growing season. Enriched (15)N, (41)K, (26)Mg, and (44)Ca were recovered in the new seedlings. The percentage contribution from labelled biomass to new tree growth was small, but discernible. The N contribution from labelled biomass to new trees was greater in Ae soil, but the base cation contribution was greater in Teindland soil. Results are discussed with reference to the initial nutrient concentrations of each soil. The elevated (15) N, (41)K, (16)Mg and (44)Ca in new seedlings indicate that nutrients in brash can make a direct contribution to new tree growth. The success of this model system will provide guidance for the application of similar techniques in field experiments. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The decomposing roots of harvested trees are a potential source of nutrients for new trees on both conventional and whole-tree harvested clearfell sites. Roots contain significant reservoirs of nutrients, but little is known about the magnitude and rate of their release. The aim of this study was to use stable isotope techniques in a model system to trace nutrients released by decomposing roots. Labelled biomass was obtained by growing Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis (Bong.) Carr.) seedlings with a generous or poor nutrient supply containing elevated (15)N, (41)K, (16)Mg and (44)Ca. Labelled trees were re-potted in sand and in two contrasting soils types to remove them from the enriched isotope supply. After re-potting, the labelled above-ground biomass was harvested, removed and used in a separate study described previously (Part I of II). In the study described here (Part II of II), new Sitka spruce seedlings were planted alongside the labelled root systems. A full destructive harvest was undertaken after one growing season. Enriched (15)N, (41)K, (26)Mg, and (44)Ca were recovered in the new seedlings in both sand and soils. The elevated amounts of (15)N, (41)K, (26)Mg and (44)Ca recovered in new seedlings indicate that nutrients released from decomposing roots can make a direct contribution to the growth of new trees on restock sites. The success of this model system will provide guidance for the application of similar techniques in field experiments. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Significant efforts have been made in Lithuania to enhance the utilization of bioenergy since the early 1990s. While opportunities are large and signs of development visible, bioenergy still needs technical, institutional and policy-related support for further development side by side with other industries. This paper discusses the existing bioenergy potential in Lithuanian forests, biofuels market formation in the region and possible roads to boost development. The retrofitting of heat plants, forest management and policies ate reviewed as a way to identify opportunities to promote bioenergy in the country. It is shown that the interplay between national and regional forces can promote technological and managerial improvements in the forest industry while also enhancing the biomass supply and sustainability of bioenergy systems.

AB Bioprospecting has frequently been cited as a sustainable use of biodiversity. Nevertheless, the level of bioprospecting in biodiversity-rich tropical regions falls below its potential, with the result that bioprospecting has produced only limited economic benefits. We present a bioprospecting program that, in addition to promoting drug discovery, provides economic benefits to and promotes conservation in Panama through the sustainable use of biodiversity. The program was initiated using insights from 20 years of nonapplied ecological research to enhance the likelihood of finding treatments for human disease. Samples are not sent abroad; rather, most of the research is carried out in Panamanian laboratories. Panama has received immediate benefits for the use of its biodiversity in the form of research funding derived from sources outside Panama, training for young Panamanian scientists, and enhanced laboratory infrastructure. Over the long term, discoveries derived from bioprospecting may help to establish research-based industries in Panama.

TI National survey of doses from CT in the UK: 2003
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF RADIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID PEDIATRIC CT; MULTISLICE; REDUCTION; SIZE
AB A review of patient doses from CT examinations in the UK for 2003 has been conducted on the basis of data received from over a quarter of all UK scanners, of which 37% had multislice capability. Questionnaires were employed to collect scan details both for the standard protocols established at each scanner for 12 common types of CT examination on adults and children, and for samples of individual patients. This information was combined with published scanner-specific CT dose index (CTDI) coefficients to estimate values of the standard dose indices CTDIw and CTDIvol for each scan sequence. Knowledge of each scan length allowed assessment of the dose-length product (DLP) for each examiniation, from which effective doses were then estimated. When compared with a previous UK survey for 1991, wide variations were still apparent between CT centres in the doses for standard protocols. The mean UK doses for adult patients were in general lower by up to 50% than those for 1991, although doses were slightly higher for multislice (4+) (MSCT) relative to single slice (SSCT) scanners. Values of CTDIvol for MSCT were broadly similar to European survey data for 2001. The third quartile values of these dose distributions have been used to derive UK national reference doses for examinations on adults (separately for SSCT and MSCT) and children as initial tools for promoting patient protection. The survey has established the PREDICT (Patient Radiation Exposure and Dose in CT) database as a sustainable national resource for monitoring dose trends in CT through the ongoing collation of further survey data.

DE sustainable building; GBTool; HK-BEAM; questionnaire survey
AB In Hong Kong, there has been increasing public demand for developers to pay greater attention to the development of sustainable buildings. A creditable assessment scheme that provides targets and methods and recognition of the efforts that are made in this direction is considered to be an effective way to achieve the goal of construction sustainability. GBTool is by far the most comprehensive building environmental assessment framework and has been developed over the past 6 years through the efforts of 21 national teams. This study aims to address the customization of GBTool as a scheme to assist in the development of more sustainable buildings in Hong Kong. The general principle of triangulation is adopted in the customization process and the initiatives of the Hong Kong government and of voluntary bodies are reviewed. The gaps between the Hong Kong situation and the philosophy of GBTool are identified and a questionnaire survey and a series of in-depth interviews to elicit the attitudes of the parties involved toward the inclusion of additional issues into the customized scheme are conducted. The correlation of several major issues and the weightings across issues and criteria are identified. The results form a good basis for the development of a building sustainability assessment scheme for Hong Kong. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

   construction industry institute; Hong Kong (CII-HK)
AB Project partnering has gained popularity in the Hong Kong construction industry since its adoption on the North District Hospital project in 1994. An increasing trend in the use of project partnering in building and construction has been observed over the past decade, with a proven track record of success. In order to critically investigate and examine the effectiveness and performance of project partnering as applied in the local building and construction industry, the Construction Industry Institute, Hong Kong (CII-HK) initiated an industry-driven research study in March 2003 to compare the implementation and outcomes of project partnering practices amongst the public, private and infrastructure sectors as well as between building and infrastructure works. This paper summarizes the key findings derived from the CII-HK funded research study completed in late 2004. Based on the case study of six selected projects, a 'best practice' partnering framework is developed. While it has been demonstrated that project partnering can provide extensive benefits to the industry across different sectors, it should be noted that partnering is not a panacea to solve all kinds of problems. What it does is to provide an avenue for people to communicate better thus eliminating unnecessary misunderstanding. It is recommended that partnering be adopted across a wider spectrum of the construction industry during the 21st Century to reap sustainable benefits for construction excellence.

ID NORTHERN GHANA; PUBLIC-HEALTH; KASSENA-NANKANA; MORTALITY; INNOVATION;
   FERTILITY; PROJECT; AFRICA
AB Objective To determine the demographic and health impact of deploying health service nurses and volunteers to village locations with a view to scaling up results.
   Methods. A four-celled plausibility trial was used for testing the impact of aligning community health services with the traditional social institutions that organize village life, Data from the Navrongo Demographic Surveillance System that tracks fertility and mortality events over time were used to estimate impact on fertility and mortality.
   Results. Assigning nurses to community locations reduced childhood mortality rates by over half in 3 years and accelerated the time taken for attainment of the child survival Millennium Development Goal (MDG) in the study areas to 8 years. Fertility was also reduced by 15%, representing a decline of one birth in the total fertility rate. Programme costs added US$ 1.92 per capita to the US$ 6.80 per capita primary health care budget.
   Conclusion. Assigning nurses to community locations where they provide basic curative and preventive care substantially reduces childhood mortality and accelerates progress towards attainment of the child survival MDG. Approaches using community volunteers, however, have no impact on mortality. The results also demonstrate that increasing access to contraceptive supplies alone fails to address the social costs of fertility regulation. Effective deployment of volunteers and community mobilization strategies offsets the social constraints on the adoption of contraception. The research in Navrongo thus demonstrates that affordable and sustainable means of combining nurse services with volunteer action can accelerate attainment of both the International Conference on Population and Development agenda and the MDGs.

TI Gimme shelter: The importance of crevices to some fish species

AB Federal law governing fisheries management recognizes the role habitat plays in structuring fish assemblages and achieving sustainable fisheries. However, in most instances it is not known which aspects of habitat are important to the lives of fish species. In 2004, we examined the importance of sheltering sites (crevices) to fishes living along low ledges in deeper waters off Anacapa Island, southern California. We found that patterns of fish-habitat relationships varied among the eight most abundant species. Three species, bocaccio (Sebastes paucispinis), vermilion (S. miniatus), and flag (S. rubivinctus) rock- fishes, had densities one to three orders of magnitude greater in the deep crevice habitat compared to low relief rock or shallow crevice habitats. Density and mean size of the two most abundant fishes, halfbanded (S. semicinctus) and squarespot (S. hopkinsi) rockfishes, generally increased as complexity of rock habitat increased. Not all species had the highest densities in deep crevice habitat. Greenspotted rockfish (S. chlorostictus) and blackeye goby (Rhinogobiops nicholsii) showed no significant difference in density among rock habitats. Pink seaperch (Zalembius rosaceus) were absent in the deep crevice habitat and abundant only in low relief rock habitats. Our study implies that it is not sufficient to distinguish only between soft and hard bottom types when using habitat to guide fisheries management strategies. Finer-scale investigations of fish-habitat relationships, paired with habitat mapping and groundtruthing, aid in the design and positioning of Marine Park Areas (MPAs) and are necessary to facilitate understanding of how a particular MPA may contribute to fisheries management.

AB This article examines current priorities of non-financial reporting among large, publicly traded European corporations to assess how companies disclose on corporate social responsibility. It analyzes 90 multinational companies' social, environmental, and sustainability reports; identifies what they report on relations with stakeholders; and examines differences among reporting tools. There are two key findings. Companies differ in the way they deal with non-financial reports along a continuum between a monitoring approach and a managerial approach. Second, companies tend to focus on specific CSR-relevant themes that reflect the priorities of multiple stakeholders. The latter include safety for workers and of products, product quality and innovation, environmental protection, dialogue with communities and stakeholders in general, attention to skill development, and responsible citizenship.

AB Proactive corporations have typically invested in increasingly ambitious sustainability initiatives. However, managers need to identify the circumstances favoring the generation of both public benefits and corporate profits. For some firms, better utilization of resources may result from some environment- related investments. For others, obtaining ISO 14001 certification or having some eco-labeled products can enable them to pursue competitive advantage. However, no one generic strategy makes business sense for all firms. This article presents a framework for categorizing generic types of competitive environmental strategies in order to help managers define and prioritize areas of organizational action, thus optimizing the overall economic return on environmental investments and making them into sources of competitive advantage.

AB Thirty-two select line pigs for lean growth efficiency and 32 control line pigs (average. 20 kg) were used in each of the two experiments to assess the effect of dietary amino acid restrictions during the grower phase on serum cholesterol, triglycerides, total protein, albumin, and glucose concentrations. In each experiment, 16 pens with two gilts and 16 pens with two castrated males per pen were assigned within the genetic line to grower (6.1 or 11.1 g lysine kg(-1)) and finisher diets (6.1 or 8.9 g lysine kg(-1)) in a 2 x 2 x 2 factorial arrangement in exp. 1, or grower diets (5.0, 7.0, 9.0, or 11.0 g lysine kg(-1)) in a 2 x 4 factorial arrangement of treatments in exp. 2. Pigs were offered common finisher diets in exp. 2. Serial blood samples were collected in both experiments. Serum cholesterol at the end of the grower phase was greater in the select line pigs in exp. 1 (P = 0.009) and pigs fed diets low in amino acids in exp. 2 (P = 0.005, 0.026, and 0.039 for linear, quadratic, and cubic, respectively). Serum cholesterol was correlated negatively with lysine intake (r = -0.38; P = 0.039) and serum urea nitrogen (r = -0.39; P = 0.032) in exp. 1 and positively with ultrasound backfat (r = 0.78; P = 0.001) in exp. 2. Serum cholesterol, however, may not reflect the cholesterol content of tissues or pork, except liver. At the end of the grower phase, pigs fed grower diets high in amino acids had greater serum total protein in exp. 2 (P = 0.040 and 0.093 for linear and quadratic, respectively) and albumin concentrations in exp. 1 (P = 0.001) and exp. 2 (linear, P = 0.001), and, at the end of the finisher phase, they had greater serum albumin in exp. I (P = 0.001) and seemed to have more total protein in exp. 2, even though there was a trend for the grower diet x genotype interaction (P = 0.095). The carryover effects of the grower diet during the realimentation phase seem to be contrary to the expected positive metabolite status of pigs exhibiting compensatory growth after a period of early dietary amino acid restrictions. On the other hand, higher serum total protein in exp. 2 (P = 0.041 and 0.001 at the end of the grower and finisher phases, respectively) and albumin concentrations at the end of the finisher phase in exp. 1 (P = 0.016) and exp. 2 (P = 0.059) in pigs selected for lean growth efficiency may be an indication that pigs utilized amino acids more efficiently for growth and protein accretion. Exploring fully the effect of dietary manipulations and genotypes on serum metabolites is obviously important, and the results of the present research may contribute to the development of the environmentally friendly, optimal feeding strategies for successful and sustainable pig production.

AB A long-term multidisciplinary study of pasture agroecology is currently being conducted in Nova Scotia, Canada. The objective is to examine the relationship between above-ground and below-ground functional diversity, and the effects on agreecosystem productivity. The experimental design consists of four treatments of decreasing land use intensity, applied in the context of management intensive grazing. Treatments include: (1) clipping and harrowing following each grazing rotation (intensive); (2) clipping only once following the first defoliation; (3) grazing every second rotation; (4) grazed only once a year (extensive). Samples were taken from each treatment once during May, July, and September 2005. Edaphic characteristics and plant diversity were measured, as well as microarthropod, nematode, protist, and bacterial functional group diversity and abundances. Significant (P < 0.05) effects of treatment were observed on percentage of bare soil, plant species and functional diversity, and bacterial functional diversity. There were also significant (P < 0.05) negative correlations observed between treatment, and both testate amoebae and flagellate abundances. The information obtained from this study over 5 yr will be used to test the relationship between biodiversity and land-use intensity, and how productivity is affected in the pasture.

AB Association studies designed to identify the genetic determinants underlying complex disease increasingly require sustainable high-quality DNA resources for large-scale single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping. Recent studies have shown that genomic DNA (gDNA) suitable for SNP genotyping can be obtained from buccal cells and from dried blood spots on Guthrie cards. Further, successful SNP genotyping has been done using the reaction product of multiple displacement amplification of gDNA. We evaluated genotype consistency on the Illumina genotyping platform for 717 to 1,744 SNP loci between replicate samples of gDNA and whole genome amplified DNA (wgaDNA) from a variety of sources. Nine healthy adults provided peripheral blood via venipuncture and buccal cells by mouth rinse. DNA was also obtained from urothelial cells in urine samples from five of the nine subjects. gDNA was extracted from all samples, wgaDNA was generated from each gDNA, and all samples were genotyped. To assess SNP genotyping accuracy of DNA obtained from dried blood spots, gDNA was extracted, amplified, and genotyped from peripheral blood samples and paired Guthrie card samples were obtained from eight childhood leukemia patients. Call rates and replicate concordances for all sample types, regardless of amplification, were > 97%, with most sample types having call rates and replicate concordances > 99%. Using the gDNA from blood samples as the reference for concordances calculated for all other sample types, we observed concordances > 98% regardless of sample type or amplification. We conclude that highly multiplexed Illumina genotyping may be done on gDNA and wgaDNA obtained from whole blood, buccal samples, dried blood spots on Guthrie cards, and possibly even urine samples, with minimal misclassification.

AB Stomach contents of Podocnemis unifilis sampled in white water varzea forest during the dry, season in the Mamiraua Sustainable Development Reserve (Middle-Solimoes River) had plant material in 100% of cases, with Poaceae and Bombacaceae the most frequently recorded. Poaceae leaves (67.7% frequency) and seeds (21.5% frequency) were common, as were fibers of the fruit Pseudobambax munguba (Bombacaceae; 38.5% frequency), with fruits in general contributing 45.9% of volume. Animal material wits consumed in much lesser quantities-only 0.8% of total volume-but had a 37% frequency.

AB Traditional asthma education has been found to be time-consuming and limited in terms of availability. Our goal was to improve asthma care by meeting special needs of children with asthma and by building on their skills in using new technologies. Multimedia asthma education occurred through the viewing of short, animated vignettes on an exam room computer. Evaluation of 228 children showed significant improvement in days of asthma symptoms (p < .01), in emergency room visits (p < .05), in school days missed (p < .05), and in days of activity limitation from baseline to the year-end follow-up (p < .05). Effective multimedia education, if integrated into pediatric practice to supplement existing asthma care, can improve clinical outcomes.

AB There are abundant coastal wetlands in South China and their main characters are the tidal flats, mangroves and coral reefs. In this paper, the status quo of coastal wetlands in South China is introduced and their degradation trends in the last decades are analyzed based on the existing literatures and information. Their degradation trends are characterized by reduction of coastal wetlands' area, pollution of seawater environment, degeneration of ecological environment, sharp decrease of biodiversity in the wetlands and so on. At the same time, the causes resulting in the above-mentioned degradations are discussed, mainly concluding imperfect systems of management and legislation, deficient property and assessment systems of the wetlands, weak consciousness of protecting coastal wetlands, shortage of basic study and backward management level and so on. Some countermeasures are put forward for the sake of a sustainable use of the coastal wetlands of South China, mainly including establishing and perfecting administrative and legal systems for the coastal wetlands, developing the study on assessment of coastal wetland, heightening the consciousness of public participation, and strengthening scientific research and establishment of wetland nature reserves.

AB Environmental issues have evolved considerably over the last two decades. The main contributing factors, to name a few, have been the changing values of modern societies, the globalization of trade and its linkage to en-vi ronment, evolution and accessibility of information/communication technologies, better educated populations, climate change, long-range transport of toxics, and the increasing influence of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and multistakeholders.
   As well, environmental management of mining operations had to he realigned in order to meet these new realities and to respond to more elaborated regulations oriented towards sustainability, Environmental management systems (EMS) have been introduced not to meet the assurance of conformance to regulations but also to prevent pollution and to apply continuous improvement of mining processes. EMS models have been developed and certification to international standards (e,g. ISO 14 001) is a common practice.
   Globalization has imposed challenges anti additional requirements to environmental management. Developing a mine in emerging countries implies dealing with international agencies, local communities, and a variety of government infrastructures to obtain a "license to operate," This paper presents the structure of Cambior's EMS and how it was adapted and implemented in the company's operations in South America.

AB The purpose of this study was to optimize forest management for a forest region (the total area of forest and scrub land 1.54 mill. ha) under changing climate by using the large-scale forestry scenario model MELA and sample plot data from the geo-referenced National Forest Inventory (NFI). The MELA model is based on integrated simulation and optimisation; in the simulation it utilises empirical tree-level models into which the impacts of climate change were introduced by transfer variables derived by using the physiological model FinnFor. Six scenarios with differences in climate and forest management were defined. In simulations, the accelerating tree growth caused by climate change resulted in an increase in maximum sustainable removal of trees at regional level. Changes in regionally optimized forest management were also detected during the analysis period of 30 years; the proportion of thinnings increased because the stands fulfilled the thinning requirements earlier than in the current climate. This study was the first attempt to solve endogenously maximum sustainable timber production and corresponding forest management at the regional level under different climate scenarios. When implemented in the MELA system, which is widely used in Finnish forestry, the transfer variables offer means of disseminating the results from physiological studies to planning of adjustment and mitigation measures under changing climate.

AB We developed and characterized a stable Vero cell line constitutively expressing Peste des petits ruminants virus (PPRV) hemagglutinin (H) protein and assessed its potential use as diagnostic antigen in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). PPRV H gene of the vaccine strain (Sungri-96) was amplified by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR, cloned into a eukaryotic expression vector (pTarget), and subsequently transfected and expressed in Vero cells. A stable Vero cell line was developed after 20 repeated passages by using G418 antibiotic selection pressure (400 to 600 mu g/ml). The integration of PPRV H gene in the Vero cell genome and its genomic transcription were confirmed by PCR and RT-PCR assays, respectively, and the 70-kDa PPRV H protein was characterized by sodium dodecyl sulfate-pollyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotting. The recombinant protein reacted specifically with PPRV anti-H neutralizing monoclonal and polyclonal antibody in competitive, sandwich, and indirect ELISA, respectively, indicating that the native form of the protein was expressed. Evaluation of the protein in competitive ELISA and indirect ELISA vis a vis whole virus was done using 306 and 146 goat field serum samples, respectively; comparable results were obtained with high degrees of relative diagnostic specificity (93.53% and 100%, respectively) and sensitivity (99.04% and 79.16%, respectively). This study shows that the PPRV H protein could be a sustainable source of safe antigen in countries of nonendemicity without the need to handle infectious virus for serodiagnosis.

AB Chatnelea gallina is an infaunal bivalve, widespread in sandy bottoms along Mediterranean coasts. It is an important economic resource for fisheries in the Adriatic, although in recent years over-fishing, and other concurrent factors, have dramatically decreased clam harvesting. In this context, it is of great interest to gain information on seasonal variations in the physiological performance of clams, for an overall evaluation of their well-being. In this study, laboratory experiments were performed to define allometric relationships and effects of temperature on clearance and respiration rates of C gallina. The mean values of b coefficients were calculated and used to correlate physiological measurements to 'standard' body mass, when seasonally collected clams were analysed. The highest clearance rate (0.42 L h(-1)) was measured in clams collected in July 2000; the highest respiration rate (12.22 mu mol O-2 h(-1)) was observed in July 2001, leading to a negative scope for growth (-2.8 J h(-1)). The influence of environmental and endogenous factors, mostly reproduction, was discussed. Survival in air and condition indices, showing higher stress conditions in December 2000 and July 2001, were in good agreement with the other physiological measurements. The physiological responses examined in this study appear to be suitable for providing detailed indications on the well-being of C gallina and may be useful for future studies aimed at eco-sustainable management of the resource.

TI Salal (Gaultheria shallon) harvest: A plant architecture model
SO COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
LA English
DT Article
DE sustainable harvest; simulation; object-oriented model
ID BIOMASS ALLOCATION; GROWTH
AB Salal (Gaultheria shallon Pursh) is an evergreen shrub whose foliage is commercially harvested. An L-systems model of salal growth was developed to illustrate the effects of internode growth and axillary bud development on the architecture of individual salal plants. A Java program was then used to create an object-oriented salal model from the L-system structure. The object-oriented Java model was better able to construct the shoot parent-child relationships required for implementation of salal harvesters' decision-making criteria than was the L-system approach which was better suited for modelling the plant growth and visualization. The visualization capabilities illustrated model performance that was consistent with field experiences, but relationships of salal growth to self-shading as well as overstory conditions require quantification before harvest effects on sustainability can be fully determined.

Focus lies on the learning phase, the handling of different types of data, the creation of new concepts in order to provide better measurable information. In this system, numeric financial data are combined with categorical data creating symbolic data, distinguishing the phase of model generation from examples, and the phase of model classification and interpretation. The system has been implemented in vector spaces. Our data are benchmarking surveys on concurrent engineering (CE), measuring the usage of in total 302 best practices in Belgian manufacturing companies. The general purpose for implementing a best practice is the statement that the company will improve its product processing, and that in this way the company will establish its economical existence on the market. Our model processes a limited number of predefined steps, generating value factors for the 302 best practices. The best practices are grouped into 30 subjects, the value factors combined in linear combinations. These value factors and their linear combinations are then subject to pattern interpretation relating CE performance to the past financial state of the company and, also to the economical well-doing of the company in the longer term i.e., we also refer to the sustainability of the company in the market.

AB Studies evaluating effects of human activity on wildlife typically emphasize short-term behavioral responses from which it is difficult to infer biological significance or formulate plans to mitigate harmful impacts. Based on decades of detailed behavioral records, we evaluated long-term impacts of vessel activity on bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops sp.) in Shark Bay, Australia. We compared dolphin abundance within adjacent 36 kin 2 tourism and control sites, over three consecutive 4.5-year periods wherein research activity was relatively constant but tourism levels increased from zero, to one, to two dolphin-watching operators. A nonlinear logistic model demonstrated that there was no difference in dolphin abundance between periods with no tourism and periods in which one operator offered tours. As the number of tour operators increased to two, there was a significant average decline in dolphin abundance (14.9%; 95% CI = -20.8 to -8.23), approximating a decline of one per seven individuals. Concurrently, within the control site, the average increase in dolphin abundance was not significant (8-556; 95% CI = -4.0 to + 16.7). Given the substantially greater presence and proximity of tour vessels to dolphins relative to research vessels, tour-vessel activity contributed more to declining dolphin numbers within the tourism site than research vessels. Although this trend may not jeopardize the large, genetically diverse dolphin population of Shark Bay, the decline is unlikely to be sustainable for local dolphin tourism. A similar decline would be devastating for small, closed, resident, or endangered cetacean populations. The substantial effect of tour vessels on dolphin abundance in a region of low-level tourism calls into question the presumption that dolplyin-watching tourism is benign.

TI Methodology for the integral assessment of the fertility state of the
   soils in a cattle region of Havana
SO CUBAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
DE grassland; soil; fertility; indicators; methodology
AB A methodology is proposed according to fertility indicators of the soil (organic matter total nitrogen, assimilable phosphorous, calcium, pH, resistance to penetration, leaf litter, infiltration and biological activity) previously selected in grasslands of six cattle units of Havana province. It is based on radial figures that represent, according to the value scale, the state of each indicator and allow estimating the general fertility state of the soil of the cattle unit. Results showed that, with higher frequency, infiltration and leaf litter were the less favourable indicators. The possible relations between the obtained points and the: characteristics of the plants and the type of soil ate discussed. The proposed methodology allows a more integral interpretation of the soil fertility and could be a favourable tool for the selection of sustainable techniques to improve the less favourable indicators. It is recommended to widen the validation of this methodology.

ID RESISTANCE; BIOFILMS
AB Biofouling and microbiologically influenced corrosion are processes of material deterioration that originate from the attachment of microorganisms as quickly as the material is immersed in a nonsterile environment. Stainless steels, despite their wide use in different industries and as appliances and implant materials, do not possess inherent antimicrobial properties. Changes in hygiene legislation and increased public awareness of product quality makes it necessary to devise control methods that inhibit biofilm formation or to act at an early stage of the biofouling process and provide the release of antimicrobial compounds on a sustainable basis and at effective level. These antibacterial stainless steels may find a wide range of applications in fields, such as kitchen appliances, medical equipment, home electronics, and tools and hardware. The purpose of this study was to obtain antibacterial stainless steel and thus mitigate the microbial colonization and bacterial infection. Copper is known as an antibacterial agent; in contrast, niobium has been demonstrated to improve the antimicrobial effect of copper by stimulating the formation of precipitated copper particles and its distribution in the matrix of the stainless steel. Thus, we obtained slides of 3.8% copper and 0.1% niobium alloyed stainless steel; subjected them to three different heat treatment protocols (550 degrees C, 700 degrees C, and 800 degrees C for 100, 200, 300, and 400 hours); and determined their antimicrobial activities by using different initial bacterial cell densities and suspending solutions to apply the bacteria to the stainless steels. The bacterial strain used in these experiments was Escherichia coli CCM 4517. The best antimicrobial effects were observed in the slides of stainless steel treated at 700 degrees C and 800 degrees C using an initial cell density of approximately 10(5) cells ml(-1) and phosphate-buffered saline as the solution in which the bacteria came into contact with copper and niobium-containing steel.

AB Purpose of review
   Birdshot chorioretinopathy is the disease with the strongest link to a human leukocyte antigen class I allele. Current research aims at understanding its immunogenetic mechanisms, focusing on the A29 allele, its subtypes, and on other loci of the human leukocyte antigen region. Research criteria can be applied to define birdshot chorioretinopathy. Its heterogeneous presentations and its multiple consequences on visual function are being delineated.
   Recent Findings
   HLA-A*2902 is the most frequent subtype in Caucasians and in patients with birdshot chorioretinopathy. The condition has also been observed, however, in a few HLA-A*2901 Caucasian patients, but remains absent or extremely rare in Asia where HLA-A*2901 is the most prevalent subtype. Birdshot chorioretinopathy affects visual acuity, color vision, contrast sensitivity or visual field and pigmentation of birdshot spots could be a marker of disease severity. Electroretinography has been used to monitor the course of the disease; abnormalities may be due to altered outer retinal function or to inner retinal dysfunction. Various therapeutic regimens have been tested and most studies confirm that corticosteroids alone are not a sustainable treatment for patients with birdshot chorioretinopathy.
   Summary
   Progress has been made in understanding the spectrum of manifestations of birdshot chorioretinopathy. The disease remains of unknown cause and many decisions regarding the management of patients are still empirical.

TI Violence and complex humanitarian emergencies: implications for

DT Article
DE complex humanitarian emergencies; coping; livelihoods; sustainable
   livelihoods framework; violence

AB This paper explores the nature of the violence that characterises complex humanitarian emergencies and the related implications for modelling livelihoods systems. While noting the importance of livelihoods approaches in complex humanitarian emergencies, it deliberates the limitations of sustainable livelihoods frameworks when applied in environments marked by protracted instability. Adaptations to the model are discussed, with a particular focus on the relationships among violence, assets and liabilities within livelihoods systems. Political economy of violence theories intimate that the assets on which livelihoods systems are constructed in peaceful times may instead become life-and livelihood-threatening liabilities in periods of conflict. Adaptations to livelihood systems in violent settings require that analysts consider violence from policy, institutional and process perspectives. It is suggested that vulnerability should be re-conceptualised as endogenous to livelihoods systems in violent settings. Building on the work of others, a livelihoods model adapted for complex humanitarian emergencies is presented.

AB Uncertainties are great handicaps to basin water resources management. At present, adaptive management is a basic approach to solve the problem of uncertainties. Adaptive management is introduced firstly in the paper. On the base of analysis of uncertainties of water resources management, a method of basin water resources adaptive management is propounded and its framework is built. It provides an effective and feasible way to realize health and sustainable development of water resources system. Finally, some crucial problems to be solved are discussed.

AB Economy-Environment system is a complex system. The result that the environment affects economy is complex black-box-problem. Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a new machine learning method based on Statistical Learning Theory (SLT). It has good performances in dealing with non-linear modeling and high dimensional problems, and the learning results possess stronger robustness. In this paper, key indicators of environment are selected to forecast GDP of Hebei province by non-linear Support Vector Regression (SVR). Compared with neural network, linear SVR and Statistical Program for Social Sciences (SPSS), non-linear SVR has simple mathematical model and high forecast precision in solving the problem of the forecast model for sustainable development of Economy-Environment system. Thus we can draw a conclusion that environment plays an important role in the sustainable development of economy.

AB Reverse supply chain is one of the significant tactics to achieve the sustainable development of the manufacturing industry. The scientific product recovery forecasting is the prerequisite and foundation correctly making a strategic decision. This paper gives some discussions on genetic algorithms that are applied to the problem of the model choice of product recovery forecast. The model in the model base is coded to the population of the genetic operations. Then, new models or combinations of the models created by cross and mutate on operation. Furthermore, the generated models will be self-adaptive and self-learning. They can be scored by some evaluations that are regarded as the individual fitness to be the choice operation of the genetic algorithm. Finally, a better model of recovery forecast is produced to forecast the product recovery amount. As an example, the forecast analysis of the discarded product recovery is illustrated.

AB Marine reserves are an increasingly important tool for the management of marine ecosystems around the world. However, the effects of proposed marine reserve configurations on sustainability and yield of populations are typically not estimated because of the computational intensity of direct simulation and uncertainty in larval dispersal and density-dependent recruitment. Here we develop a method for efficiently assessing a marine reserve configuration for persistence and yield of a population with sedentary adults and dispersing larvae. The method extends the familiar sustainability criteria of individual replacement for single populations based on eggs-per-recruit (EPR) to spatially distributed populations with sedentary adults, a dispersing larval phase, and limited carrying capacity in the settlement-recruit relationship. We refer to this approach as dispersal-per-recruit (DPR). In some cases, a single DPR calculation, based on the assumption that post-settlement habitat is saturated (i.e., at maximum recruitment), is sufficient to determine population persistence, while in other cases further iterative calculations are required. These additional calculations reach an equilibrium more rapidly than a full simulation of age- or size-structured populations. From the DPR result, fishery yield can be computed from yield-per-recruit (YPR) at each point. We assess the utility of DPR calculations by applying them to single reserves, uniformly distributed systems of reserves, and randomly sized and spaced systems of reserves on a linear coast line. We find that for low levels of EPR in fished areas (e.g., 10% or less of the natural, unfished EPR when post-settlement habitats are saturated by 35% of natural settlement), a single DPR calculation is sufficient to determine persistence of the population. We also show that, in uniform systems of reserves with finite reserve size, maximal fisheries yield occurs when the density of reserves is such that all post-settlement habitat is nearly saturated with settlers. Finally, we demonstrate the application of this approach to a realistic proposed marine reserve configuration.

AB The theory of Post-Normal Science is now approaching obsolescence; it needs to be renewed and enriched. In historical perspective, PNS evolved from a criticism of Probabilistic Risk Analysis, and put the essentially political idea of Extended Peer Community at its core. Establishing the legitimacy of the EPC requires a review of the methodology of science in the policy process. The time is not ripe for a modification of PNS, and so the best move for-ward is to raise the issue of Sustainability. For that I sketch a theory of complex systems, with special attention to pathologies and failures. That provides the foundation for a use of 'contradiction' as a problem incapable of resolution in its own terms, and also of 'characteristic contradiction' that drives a system to a crisis. With those materials it is possible to state the characteristic contradiction of our modern industrial civilisation, and provide a diagrarri with heuristic power. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

AB This paper discusses the epistemological predicament associated with the formal modeling of the behavior of complex adaptive systems. This is a class of systems which: (i) express functions and structures on multiple levels and scales; and (ii) become "something different" in time, because of evolution.
   The paper addresses four points. (#1) The pre-analytical definition of "what is observed and how" is essential in determining any quantitative output of mathematical models. Scientists have to learn how to acknowledge and to deal better with the fact that the observer always affects what is observed when defining the descriptive domain. This influence of the observer occurs even before there is interaction with the observed in the process of gathering empirical data. (#2) The peculiar human ability to share a commensurate experience involves the concept of semiotic identity. The generation of knowledge is possible only because of the co-existence of a semiotic reality and physical systems. (#3) The special organization of living systems depends on their ability to establish and maintain a semiotic coupling between functional and structural types. This coupling is associated with the concept of holon and explains why it is impossible to formalize in substantive terms organizations recognized as holons. Holons can only be handled in semiotic terms. (#4) A strong serniotic identity entails an uncontested selection of an appropriate sampling procedure for validating the choice of the formal identity used in the model. On the contrary, a weak semiotic identity entails a tautology in the modeling relation. The formal identity used to represent the serniotic identity in the model has also to be used to decide about the relative sampling used for validation. The distinction between strong and weak serniotic identities places a limit on the power of modeling. A sound modeling relation requires strong serniotic identities, whereas the typical issues associated with science for governance imply perceptions and representations based on weak serniotic identities.

AB Throughout human history, food production has had to adapt to continuously changing environmental circumstances. In most cases, these challenges are met without any great hardship. In other cases, seemingly small environmental problems (such as droughts or floods) have devastating consequences. This suggests some food systems are more vulnerable than others. Assessing and identifying which regions are vulnerable to environmental problems, however, is challenging because food systems represent constantly evolving systems where farmers continually make decisions that help adapt to changing circumstances. Many existing theoretical frameworks to assess vulnerability fall along a continuum from those that are too macro (because they are based on large-scale generalizations that ignore local contextual issues) or are too micro (because they are so site specific that they obscure general trends). A landscape ecology approach offers an interesting compromise whereby scholars have used a small number of local variables (such as the diversity of species present in the system and the extent to which individuals in the system are connected to other individuals) to characterize the vulnerability of ecosystems to shocks such as wildfires and pest outbreaks. However, preliminary research suggests this approach may not work particularly well on human managed ecosystems. As such, this paper uses a range of historical examples (such as the Irish Potato Famine and El Nino induced famines in the late 18th century) to integrate these frameworks to help identify vulnerability within food systems to environmental changes.

AB Natural resource consumption has increased considerably in the past 200 years despite more efficient technology advancements. This correlation between increased natural resource consumption and increased efficiency is known as jevons' Paradox. Since all the inputs to economic production come from the environment, increased resource consumption and ecosystem destruction should be of concern. Furthermore, the expenditure of natural resources to provide energy and other consumer goods is an irreversible process, worsening the human condition instead of improving human welfare as neoclassical theory would have one to believe. Therefore, sustainable development policies need to be considered to end the continued excess consumption, beyond sustainable levels, of natural resources and the potential resulting conflicts. To design environmentally sustainable policies, the effect of economic activity, of resource utilization, and increased efficiency must be understood. In this paper, we attempt to illustrate how human consumption of natural resources alters the natural state of the economy and the environment. Further, using energy data from the Energy Information Administration we develop models that provide some empirical support that jevons' Paradox may exist on a macro level. Finally, we examine the resulting policy implications and the applications for an ecological economic approach. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper examines two paths by which the work of Herbert Simon has influenced the development of ecological and evolutionary economics: bounded rationality and hierarchical complexity. it argues that there is scope for further consideration of the implications of these ideas, particularly their inter-relation. This is illustrated through some recent ideas on the co-evolution of technologies and institutions. This is related to understanding transitions of technological systems, and how these might be steered or modulated towards greater sustainability. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The Amazon forest has been converted to a matrix of pristine and modified habitats. Landscape-scale biodiversity conservation requires an understanding of species' distributions over this matrix to guarantee both effective protection and use for present and future generations. In this study, we evaluated how much of the existing and future planned protected areas (PAs) would be contributing to the conservation of Brazilian Amazon mammals (N = 399), including threatened species (N = 51). Currently, almost 37% of Brazilian Amazon is protected and that may increase to 46% if planned PAs are implemented. In the current PA system, 22% are indigenous land and 11% are sustainable use units, e.g., production forests. Only one-fifth of the whole range of mammal species occurring in Brazilian Amazon is actually protected by Brazilian PAs. However, considering only the part of the ranges within the Brazilian Amazon, and therefore under the scope of Brazilian actions, Brazilian PAs assume an important role in the protection of 39% of mammal distribution ranges, particularly the threatened species (39%). These results suggest that an integrated network of protected areas among Amazon countries would be necessary to increase their efficiency in mammal conservation. The need for strengthening of the forest sector and good management practices in Brazil appears critical for the maintenance of large extents of forest and species conservation. Under such a scenario, the contribution of developed nations and international agencies must assume an important role for the maintenance and enlargement of the protected area network in Amazon region.

AB Institutions and organizations are considered key elements for the successful management of natural resources. However, much of the work in this field has focused mainly on regulations. This paper identifies other factors, i.e., normative, cultural-cognitive, and psychological, affecting institutional performance, management, and feedback. Using the case of Zanzibar, Tanzania, it is illustrated through the analysis of the Bwana Dikos, which are public officials placed in villages and landing sites for monitoring purposes, how a well-designed organization and clear regulations might be necessary, but not sufficient, to achieve successful management. Through triangulation of interviews, document reviews, and participant observation, it was found that four dilemmas, i.e., kinship, loyalty, poverty, and control, interfered with institutional performance, thereby decreasing efficiency. Poverty was the main driving factor explaining the Bwana Diko's performance, but loyalty elements crosscut the other dilemmas as well. Psychological aspects were important and deserve further research. The control dilemma refers to the institutional mismatches in spatial and cognitive terms. Lack of institutional replication at the proper spatial scales negatively affected the resilience of the whole institutional setting. Furthermore, the importance of embeddedness, coproduction, and windows of opportunities to improve the institutional setting and the poverty condition of the Bwana Diko is discussed. This paper shows that a broad view of institutions is urgently needed to understand the complexity of social-ecological systems, achieve sustainability goals, tackle development, and meet our fundamental challenge, poverty alleviation.

AB Despite their dual importance in the assessment of endangered/threatened species, there have been few attempts to integrate traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) and evolutionary biology knowledge (EBK) at the population level. We contrasted long-term aboriginal TEK with previously obtained EBK in the context of seasonal migratory habits and population biology of a salmonid fish, brook charr, (Salvelinus fontinalis) inhabiting a large, remote postglacial lake. Compilation of TEK spanning four decades involved analytical workshops, semidirective interviews, and collaborative fieldwork with local aboriginal informants and fishing guides. We found that TEK complemented EBK of brook charr by providing concordant and additional information about (1) population viability; (2) breeding areas and migration patterns of divergent populations; and (3) the behavioral ecology of populations within feeding areas; all of which may ultimately affect the maintenance of population diversity. Aboriginal concerns related to human pressures on this species, not revealed by EBK, also help to focus future conservation initiatives for divergent populations and to encourage restoration of traditional fishing practices. However, relative to EBK, the relevance of TEK to salmonid biodiversity conservation was evident mainly at a smaller spatial scale, for example, that of individual rivers occupied by populations or certain lake sectors. Nevertheless, EBK was only collected over a 4-yr period, so TEK provided an essential long-term temporal window to evaluate population differences and persistence. We concluded that, despite different conceptual underpinnings, spatially and temporally varying TEK and EBK both contribute to the knowledge base required to achieve sustainability and effective biodiversity conservation planning for a given species. Such integration may be particularly relevant in many isolated regions, where intraspecific diversity can go unrecognized due to sparse scientific knowledge or undocumented TEK, and where governmental agencies and local communities increasingly seek to find common ground on which to address biodiversity issues.

AB Integrated natural resource management (INRM) helps resource users, managers, and others to manage resources sustainably by considering, reconciling, and synergizing their various interests and activities. Although many social and environmental problems have to be tackled at a range of scales to be resolved successfully, INRM has particular relevance at the landscape level at which the interests of local people first intersect those of the outside world. We propose eight guidelines for building successful INRM programs: focus on multiscale analysis and intervention; develop partnerships and engage in action research; facilitate change rather than dictating it; promote visioning and the development of scenarios; recognize the importance of local knowledge; foster social learning and adaptive management; concentrate on both people and their natural resources, including biodiversity; and embrace complexity. Reviewing these guidelines in the light of experiences from three separate studies shows that most are being done, though more as a product of happenstance than design. The guidelines form a mutually reinforcing framework for building INRM, primarily through empowering local stakeholders to be more articulate advocates and active participants in their own development and conservation efforts.

AB To harvest biological resources sustainably, it is first necessary to understand what "sustainability" means in an ecological context, and what it means to the people who use the resources. As a case study, we examined the extractive logging of the mangrove Rhizophora mangle in the Rio Limon area of Lake Maracaibo, in western Venezuela. The ecological definition of sustainable harvesting is harvesting that allows population numbers to be maintained or to increase over time. In interviews, the harvesters defined sustainable harvesting as levels permitting the maintenance of the mangrove population over two human generations, about 50 yr. In Rio Limon, harvesters extract a combination of small adult and juvenile trees. Harvesting rates ranged from 7-35% of small adult trees. These harvesting levels would be sustainable according to the harvester's definition as long as juvenile harvesting was less than 40%. However, some harvesting levels that would be sustainable according to the harvesters were ecologically unsustainable, i.e., eventually causing declines in mangrove population numbers. It was also determined that the structure of mangrove forests was significantly affected by harvesting; even areas harvested at low, ecologically sustainable intensities had significantly fewer adult trees than undisturbed sites. Western Venezuela has no organized timber industry, so mangrove logs are used in many types of construction. A lagging economy and a lack of alternative construction materials make mangrove harvesting inevitable, and for local people, an economic necessity. This creates a trade-off between preserving the ecological characteristics of the mangrove population and responding to human needs. In order to resolve this situation, we recommended a limited and adaptive mangrove harvesting regime. We also suggest that harvesters could participate in community-based management programs as harvesting monitors.

AB Because they are occurring at an accelerated pace, changes in the livelihoods of local coastal communities, including nutritional aspects, have been a subject of interest in human ecology. The aim of this study is to explore the dietary changes, particularly in the consumption of animal protein, that have taken place in Puruba Beach, a rural community of caicaras on the Sao Paulo Coast, Brazil, over the 10-yr period from 1992-1993 to 2002-2003. Data were collected during six months in 1992-1993 and during the same months in 2002-2003 using the 24-hr recall method. We found an increasing dependence on external products in the most recent period, along with a reduction in fish consumption and in the number of fish species eaten. These changes, possibly associated with other nonmeasured factors such as overfishing and unplanned tourism, may cause food delocalization and a reduction in the use of natural resources. Although the consequences for conservation efforts in the Atlantic Forest and the survival of the caicaras must still be evaluated, these local inhabitants may be finding a way to reconcile both the old and the new dietary patterns by keeping their houses in the community while looking for sources of income other than natural resources. The prospect shown here may reveal facets that can influence the maintenance of this and other communities undergoing similar processes by, for example, shedding some light on the ecological and economical processes that may occur within their environment and in turn affect the conservation of the resources upon which the local inhabitants depend.

TI Cultural or ecological sustainability? The effect of cultural change on

   management
AB Sabal palm has been used for thatching the traditional Maya house for over 3000 yr. The great importance of this resource has promoted its management within home gardens. Although traditionally managed populations in home gardens are capable of ecological long-term persistence, the impact of cultural change on sustainable resource management is poorly understood. By means of interviews in 108 households, we obtained information about Sabal management practices, leaf demand, and sociocultural data. Density and size structure of the palm populations in the respective home gardens were also measured. By means of principal components analysis, the sociocultural data were summarized into a cultural change index, which was then statistically related to palm density, size structure, leaf demand, and management practices. Leaf demand along the cultural change gradient was estimated. Sabal populations were affected by the cultural change index. Palm density and the proportion of harvestable individuals were higher in the more traditional households. The number of management practices decreased, and the probability of felling adult palms increased with cultural change. As a result, the percentage of the total leaf demand satisfied by home garden production diminished from 118.2-69.4% as cultural change increased. Traditional practices seem oriented to increasing the palm availability. Seed sowing and the protection of seedlings and adults affect the life stages with the largest impact on the population growth rate, as measured through sensitivity analysis. This means that abandoning traditional practices and felling adults more frequently should reduce rapidly, which is consistent with the low palm density observed in less traditional households. The application of demographic models to Sabal tells us that traditional management warrants the persistence of the resource as long as the current conditions remain unchanged. In contrast, our data show that Sabal management may not be sustainable from a cultural perspective, since the cultural attitudes that affect palm management and demand change over time. Both approaches assess the same problem from different viewpoints reaching different but complementary conclusions. In this study, we propose new methods that integrate the ecological and cultural processes, which affect the sustainable management of the natural resources.

   commercializing non-timber forest products on livelihoods

AB Commercialization of non-timber forest products (NTFPs) has been widely promoted as a means of sustainably developing tropical forest resources, in a way that promotes forest conservation while supporting rural livelihoods. However, in practice, NTFP commercialization has often failed to deliver the expected benefits. Progress in analyzing the causes of such failure has been hindered by the lack of a suitable framework for the analysis of NTFP case studies, and by the lack of predictive theory. We address these needs by developing a probabilistic model based on a livelihood framework, enabling the impact of NTFP commercialization on livelihoods to be predicted. The framework considers five types of capital asset needed to support livelihoods: natural, human, social, physical, and financial. Commercialization of NTFPs is represented in the model as the conversion of one form of capital asset into another, which is influenced by a variety of socio-economic, environmental, and political factors. Impacts on livelihoods are determined by the availability of the five types of assets following commercialization. The model, implemented as a Bayesian Belief Network, was tested using data from participatory research into 19 NTFP case studies undertaken in Mexico and Bolivia. The model provides a novel tool for diagnosing the causes of success and failure in NTFP commercialization, and can be used to explore the potential impacts of policy options and other interventions on livelihoods. The potential value of this approach for the development of NTFP theory is discussed.

AB Over the past several decades, significant donor funding has been directed to sustainable forest management in the tropics, in the hope of combining forest conservation with economic gains through sustainable use. To date, this approach has produced only modest results in terms of changed silvicultural and land-use practices in this area. Direct payments for environmental services (PES) have been suggested as a promising alternative but still remain widely untested in the tropics. This paper first provides a conceptual assessment of PES, comparing the main features of this practice with those of other conservation instruments. Second, the paper discusses a series of critical questions that have been raised about both the environmental and livelihood impacts of PES. It is concluded that some ex ante judgments about the effects of PES may have been overly critical, and that, based on preliminary assessments, there is good reason to continue experimental PES implementation for purposes of consolidating our knowledge.

AB The challenge confronting those seeking to understand the institutional dimensions of global environmental change and patterns of land-use and land-cover change is to find effective methods for analyzing the dynamics of socio-ecological systems. Such systems exhibit a number of characteristics that pose problems for the most commonly used statistical techniques and may require additional and innovative analytic tools. This article explores options available to researchers working in this field and recommends a strategy for achieving scientific progress. Statistical procedures developed in other fields of study are often helpful in addressing challenges arising in research into global change. Accordingly, we start with an assessment of some of the enhanced statistical techniques that are available for the study of socio-ecological systems. By themselves, however, even the most advanced statistical models cannot solve all the problems that arise in efforts to explain institutional effectiveness and patterns of land-use and land-cover change. We therefore proceed to an exploration of additional analytic techniques, including configurational comparisons and meta-analyses; case studies, counterfactuals, and narratives; and systems analysis and simulations. Our goal is to create a portfolio of complementary methods or, in other words, a tool kit for understanding complex human-environment interactions. When the results obtained through the use of two or more techniques converge, confidence in the robustness of key findings rises. Contradictory results, on the other hand, signal a need for additional analysis.

AB Giesta (Cytisus) is the dominant or only woody plant on about one-quarter of the land area of the high granite mesas of interior Beira Alta, Portugal, wherefor at least the past 800 years the main cereal crop has been rye. During this nine, a substantial fraction of this crop has been sold and taken to cities to feed the urban population, carrying with it nitrogen in the proteins of the grain. These farms have remained sustainable for nitrogen in the face of this outflow because farmers have allowed and even encouraged giesta, which is a nitrogen fixer to occupy a substantial fraction of the land area,from which it is harvested and buried in the cultivated soil to restore its fertility. Stable N15 analysis and ecological techniques estimate quantitatively the importance of this practice.

AB Twenty breadfruit cultivars growing in afield genebank at Kahanu Garden, National Tropical Botanical Garden, Hana, Maui, Hawaii, were evaluated for sensory attributes and nutrient composition. A taste panel scored eight flavor/aroma attributes, five textural attributes, and color. There were significant differences (P <= 0.01) in aroma, visual texture, flavor intensity, sweetness, starchiness, moistness, stringiness, firmness, and color The greatest differences were in color and texture. Nutrient analyses showed significant differences (P <= 0.05) for energy, carbohydrates, ash, crude protein, potassium, magnesium, sodium, iron, copper, and zinc. Considering the versatility of breadfruit as a food, its ease of production, and its nutritional value, the numerous good quality flavorful cultivars available should be more widely grown for sustainable agriculture and food security.

AB The land-use history of an ecosystem influences current structure and possibly response to modern disturbances and stresses. In semiarid systems the nature of land-use legacies is poorly understood, confounding efforts to establish sustainable management approaches. We compare previously cultivated and non-cultivated lands in Owens Valley, California, where cultivation once extended to 34% of the valley floor but was largely discontinued by 1940, to measure the influence of past disturbance on modern vegetation. We combined historic maps of cultivated and non-cultivated land with an extensive vegetation survey, historic aerial photographs, and satellite measurements of vegetation response to precipitation variability to examine the importance of land-use history in determining the sensitivity of vegetation to annual variations in precipitation. Remote sensing analysis showed that total plant cover on previously cultivated lands was lower and fluctuations in cover were marginally more dependent on precipitation compared with plant cover on non-cultivated lands. We then compared modern plant assemblages within cultivated and non-cultivated land to determine if compositional differences could explain the current patterns of vegetation cover. We found lower species richness on previously cultivated parcels, and higher frequency and cover of perennial grasses on non-cultivated lands. Therefore, we showed differences in land-cover patterns, isolated a mechanism that could account for the differences (species differences), and developed a method for remotely analyzing land regions that have experienced historic anthropogenic disturbance.

AB The present and future well-being of the world's forest dwelling populations depends on their ability to gain livelihood resources from their immediate environment. Sustainable extraction of non-timber forest products has been promoted by conservationists and development agencies as a feasible strategy for forest dwellers that does not compromise the resource base. Yet surveys of actual resource use suggest that for poorer resource-dependent communities without access to markets, non-timber forest products can only ever represent a safety-net activity and a supplementary income source. Others argue that resource availability, in terms of the diversity and productivity of the forest, is the key parameter in realizing a contribution of forest products to well-being. This paper examines the scope and heterogeneity of forest product use to reveal whether resource availability necessarily provides the context for significant contributions to well-being of forest dwellers. We present data from an area of tropical rainforest, close to Iquitos in Peru, which was previously shown to have high potential value. We find, through a census survey of households within a forest reserve area, that non-timber forest products provide only a relatively small portion of income and that only a small proportion of available products are actually commercialized, despite apparent market availability. We show that the low rates of commercialization can be explained by unequal access capital assets used for extraction, to natural resources themselves, and to product markets. They are also explained by the concentration of capital-poor households on subsistence gathering activities. The value of destructive uses of forests, both logging and agriculture, remain higher than returns from non-timber products. This research demonstrates that although non-timber forest products are an important livelihood source, market integration and commercialization is not everywhere an appropriate or realistic strategy.

DE exergy; primary energy; methodology
AB The consumption of primary energy is often used to compare energy systems from a sustainability viewpoint at regional, national or even world level. For such comparisons to be "fair" and meaningful, this implies, however, to define primary energies in a coherent way for all the various possible sources (coal, oil, gas, nuclear, renewables). This paper stems from the acknowledgement that the definitions presently used in the framework of energy policy studies do not really fulfill this requirement, and suggests approaches to correct such a methodological flaw. It is emphasized that exergy is a key concept in this context. The authors' reflections on this matter originated from the recent adoption by the Board of the Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology, soon followed by the Swiss Advisory Committee for Energy Research, of the objective to achieve a "2 kW-society" 2 kW year/(cap year) in Switzerland by 2050. This target, which is about 2.5 times below today's consumption according to official statistics, invites to have a closer look to its concrete meaning. The concept of useful energy is also briefly discussed and linked to the only really pertinent consideration for the end-user in such a context, i.e. the expected services (comfort, transport, (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Several Combined Heat and Power (CHP) system options have been considered for evaluation with respect to the end-user requirements. These included Internal Combustion Engines (Otto and Diesel), Gas Turbines, Steam Turbines and Combined Cycles covering a wide range of electrical output. Data have been obtained from literature and the CHP systems have been evaluated using different criteria such as overall efficiency, investment cost, fuel cost, electricity cost, heat cost, CO2 production and footprint. A multi-criteria method is used with an agglomeration function based on the statistical evaluation of weight factors. The technical, economic and social aspects of each system have been evaluated in an integrated manner and the results have been compared by means of the Sustainability Index. Based on the above criteria and depending on the user requirements, the best CHP system options have been established. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The need for large-scale storage, when the energy source is subject to periods of low-energy generation, as it would be in a direct solar or wind energy system, could be the factor which justifies the choice of hydrogen, rather than electricity, as the principal energy carrier. It could also be the 'Achilles heel' of a solar-based sustainable energy system, tipping the choice to a nuclear breeder system. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

DE sustainable development; hydropower; Turkey
AB Turkey is not rich in petroleum and natural gas resources and is dependent on energy. Electricity generation in Turkey from its own domestic resources is, at present, about 40% and is expected to be at 20% by the year 2020. It has been planned that the maximum capacity for hydraulic and other national resources will be reached by the year 2020. This means that the total electricity generated by domestic resources is to be 245 TWh/yr, and the remaining electricity demand of about 302 TWh/yr for the year 2020 must be ensured by imported resources. In Turkey, hydropower projects are part of integrated water resources development. Most new powerplants will be developed as build, operate and transfer (BOT) or build, own and operate (BOO) projects with the private sector. It is expected that many foreign investors and financiers will also be interested in the Turkish hydropower market. For a sustainable development the next investments should be made for clean technologies such as hydropower. Depending upon the latest technological developments, other economic and political factors will also affect the quality of the environment. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this study we propose some green energy strategies for sustainable development. In this regard, seven green energy strategies are taken into consideration to determine the sectoral, technological, and application impact ratios. Based on these ratios, we derive a new parameter as the green energy impact ratio. In addition, the green energy-based sustainability ratio is obtained by depending upon the green energy impact ratio, and the green energy utilization ratio that is calculated using actual energy data taken from literature. In order to verify these parameters, three cases are considered. Consequently, it can be considered that the sectoral impact ratio is more important and should be kept constant as much as possible in a green energy policy implementation. Moreover, the green energy-based sustainability ratio increases with an increase of technological, sectoral, and application impact ratios. This means that all negative effects on the industrial, technological, sectoral and social developments partially and/or completely decrease throughout the transition and utilization to and of green energy and technologies when possible sustainable energy strategies are preferred and applied. Thus., the sustainable energy strategies can make an important contribution to the economies of the countries where green energy (e.g., wind, solar, tidal, biomass) is abundantly produced. Therefore, the investment in green energy supply and progress should be encouraged by governments and other authorities for a green energy replacement of fossil fuels for more environmentally benign and sustainable future.

TI Toward an effective implementation of clean development mechanism

SO ENERGY POLICY

DT Article
DE clean development mechanism; capacity building; price of CERs
AB With the already huge and growing amount of greenhouse gas emissions and a great deal of low-cost abatement options available, China is widely expected as the world's number one host country of clean development mechanism (CDM) projects. But, making this potential a reality represents a significant challenge for China, because there has been a general lack of awareness by both the Chinese government and business communities, clear institutional structure, and implementation strategy. This has raised great concern about China's ability to compete internationally for CDM projects and exploit fully its CDM potential.
   This paper aims to address how CDM projects will be effectively implemented in China by examining the major CDM capacity building projects in China with bilateral and multilateral donors, the treatment of low-cost, non-priority CDM projects, and how a system for application, approval, and implementation of CDM projects is set up in China and what roles the main institutional actors are going to play in the system. We conclude that these capacity building assistances, the establishment of streamlined and transparent CDM procedures and sound governance, and the lessons learned and experience gained from the implementation of the CDM project in Inner Mongolia and the two Prototype Carbon Fund' projects will help China to take advantage of CDM opportunities. Moreover, in order to further capitalize on its CDM potential, there is a pressing need for the Chinese government to amend its current interim CDM regulations, in particular those controversial provisions on the eligibility to participate in CDM projects in China and the distribution of the revenues derived from CDM project between the project developer and the Chinese government. We believe that taking these capacity building projects and the recommended actions to clearly define the sustainable development objective of the CDM and disseminate CDM knowledge to local authorities and project developers as sectorally and geographically wide as possible, addressing those controversial CDM provisions with clearer guidance, and gaining experience from real practice will reduce the perceived project risks and lower the barriers to CDM project development in China. This is, in turn, likely to lead a much greater percentage of carbon credits to come from CDM projects in China over the next several years. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID CHOICES
AB An extensive survey on household expenditures in Ouagadougou, the capital of Burkina Faso, was used to analyze the factors determining urban household energy choices using a multinomial logit model. Wood-energy remains the preferred fuel of most urban households in the country; though rational, the choice is not sustainable as it portends a threat to the savanna woodlands and the economy. Many important policies have been adopted by public authorities to minimize household wood-energy consumption and to substitute it by alternative fuel. Despite the magnitude of all these policies, the depletion rate of the forest resource is increasing. A kind of inertia is thus observed for household preferences for cooking fuel. This model analyzes the sociological and economic variables of household energy preferences for cooking in Ouagadougou. The analyses show that the inertia of household cooking energy preferences are due to poverty factors such as low income, poor household access to electricity for primary and secondary energy, low house standard. household size, high frequency of cooking certain meals using woodfuel as cooking energy. The descriptive analyses show that the domestic demand for wood-energy is strongly related to household income. The firewood utilization rate decreases with increasing household income. In other words, this fuel appears as a "transition good" for these households which aim for other sources of energy for cooking that are more adapted for urban consumption. This implies that a price subsidy policy for liquid petroleum gas (LPG) and its cook stoves could significantly decrease the utilization rate of wood-energy. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

SO ENERGY POLICY

DT Article
DE Himalayas; hydropower; environment
ID SECTOR
AB Energy and development are closely intertwined. Yet, increasing fossil fuel-based energy consumption contributes significantly to environmental problems both locally and globally. This article explores the interlinkages between local livelihood and environmental benefits from the provision of energy to remote rural households through small hydropower development. The analysis is based on research carried out around a large development project designed to assist the Government of India in the optimum utilization of small hydropower resources in the Himalayan and sub-Himalayan regions. There are about 100,000 villages in India that are not connected to electricity supply, many of them in the hilly regions with ample hydropower potential. The project aimed to demonstrate the utility of and options for providing electricity to such villages through clean mini-hydro. The article addresses the nature of the impacts of the demonstration small hydel schemes on the local communities, to what extent they translate into environmental benefits both locally and globally, and the perceptions and participation of the local communities in these small hydro schemes. The study explores the impacts of the schemes on financial capital, natural capital, social capital, physical capital, human capital, and gender equity in the local communities. It further provides a discussion on the links between local and global environmental benefits. Overall, it is found that the schemes' impacts both on the local communities and the environment are mostly marginally positive or neutral, although achieving clearly demonstrable benefits would require major upscaling of the effort involving broader changes than possible under this project. Furthermore, it is argued that some of the assumptions behind the project design were faulty. Involvement of the local communities and direct livelihood benefits to them are essential for the long-term sustainability of the small hydro schemes. The discussion and conclusions are intended to provide guidance to programmes and projects that aim to promote environmentally sound energy in the rural areas of developing countries.

AB The goal of this study is to investigate how co-operation between industry and district heating companies can improve profitability of biofueled cogenerative investments in small to medium-sized applications. Currently advanced biomass gasification and gas turbine combined cycle has been found to be a promising cogenerative conversion technology for the recovery of heat present in biomass fuel. Increased biofuel based cogenerative power production in the future is clearly dependent on the improvement of both performance and investment costs of new high performance technology, and on the nature of policy instruments designed to promote the technology. The use of biofuels for cogeneration on a large scale is focused mainly on forest industry sites, where considerable quantities of biomass are available. While cogeneration provides several environmental benefits by making use of waste heat and waste products, air pollution is a concern any time fossil fuels or biomass are burned.

AB Renewable energy sources are essential paths towards sustainable development and CO2 emission reduction. For example, the European Union has set the target of achieving 22% of electricity generation from renewable sources by 2010. However, the extensive use of this energy source is being avoided by some technical problems as fouling and slagging in the surfaces of boiler heat exchangers.
   Although these phenomena were extensively studied in the last decades in order to optimize the behaviour of large coal power boilers, a simple, general and effective method for fouling control has not been developed. For biomass boilers, the feedstock variability and the presence of new components in ash chemistry increase the fouling influence in boiler performance. In particular, heat transfer is widely affected and the boiler capacity becomes dramatically reduced. Unfortunately, the classical approach of regular sootblowing cycles becomes clearly insufficient for them.
   Artificial Intelligence (AI) provides new means to undertake this problem. This paper illustrates a methodology based on Neural Networks (NNs) and Fuzzy-Logic Expert Systems to select the moment for activating sootblowing in an industrial biomass boiler. The main aim is to minimize the boiler energy and efficiency losses with a proper sootblowing activation. Although the NN type used in this work is well-known and the Hybrid Systems had been extensively used in the last decade, the excellent results obtained in the use of AI in industrial biomass boilers control with regard to previous approaches makes this work a novelty.

ID SUSTAINABILITY
AB Economic impacts that entry regulations have within the fishery industry are well documented in the economics literature. This study looks at how fishery regulations will impact other sectors of a regional economy. By developing integrated models of fishery bioeconomics and dynamic, inter-industry economic linkages, the paper estimates sector-wise economic gains and losses over time from an entry regulation. A case study from India shows that primary fishing and processing sectors realize significant wage and profit gains after a period of transition. Sizable losses in wage and industry profits are incurred by non-fishery sectors but are smaller than the profit gains in the primary sectors. The paper makes policy recommendations on how to ease the adverse regional impacts of fishery policies.

AB In order to identify new crop suitable for indigo production in Italy, seasonal variation in productivity of indigo precursors was studied in woad (Isatis tinctoria L., Family Cruciferae) and in dyer's knotweed (Polygonum tinctorium Ait., Family Polygonaceae), grown in central Italy under temperate climate. Indigo precursors, indoxyl-3-ketogluconate (isatan B) and indoxyl-beta-D-glucoside (indican), were measured in leaves by HPLC analysis under well watered versus rain fed field conditions, and the amount of indigo derived by stoichiometric calculations.
   Woad showed lower indigo potential than dyer's knotweed, evaluated as either amount of indigo either per leaf weight or per plant. However, in water stress conditions, woad appeared to be drought tolerant as opposed to dyer's knotweed revealed very sensitive. In fact, in dyer's knotweed leaf yield was over 50% reduced in water stress field conditions, characterizing central and southern Italy during July and August, as compared to some 30% in woad. Dyer's knotweed appears to be more productive, providing water is supplied appropriately, thus making proper irrigation plans necessary to achieve sustainable high yields. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

AB To support moves towards more sustainable modes of natural resource management, the research community has been engaged in an evaluation of paradigms, theories and methods which might provide useful and usable insights into such a complex problem set. A particularly influential family of theoretical models concerned with the processes and dynamics of species evolution has been adopted from the fields of biology and ecology. This paper scrutinizes the relevance of biological evolutionary theory to sustainable natural resource management beyond identification of the core analogy, namely that both natural resource management and ecological systems are characterized by multiple interacting elements requiring systemic interpretation. A review of the workings of co-evolutionary theory within its intellectual homeland of biology and ecology leads to a critical evaluation of its use as a descriptive model outside of these domains. Findings from this assessment identify a number of fractures in meaning as the co-evolutionary model is transferred between disciplinary fields, suggesting that the transposition has been conducted without sufficient rigour or consistency. A measured reinterpretation of the applicability of the co-evolutionary model to natural resources management is thereby undertaken. Using water management as a context, the paper posits a series of phenomena which might provide a focus for the application of the co-evolutionary model outside of biology and ecology. In conclusion, the paper argues that the research community needs to move beyond a consideration of the complex implications of co-evolutionary processes to the establishment of a firm, process-based definition of co-evolution as a type of change.

TI Socioeconomic constraints, environmental impacts and drivers of change
   in the Congo Basin as perceived by logging companies
SO ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION
LA English
DT Article
DE Congo Basin; drivers of change; environmental impacts; industrial
   logging; socioeconomic constraints
AB The external factors that influence the environmental, social and economic performance of logging companies were studied using a questionnaire submitted to 30 logging concessions in five countries of the Congo Basin. This paper analyses socioeconomic constraints and environmental impacts experienced by these concessions, as well as their response to major external drivers of change. Concessionaires considered investment and operating finance their main constraint, followed by insufficient technical and human capacities, and inconsistent application of official regulations. Environmental problems directly produced by concessions' operations represented around one-third of the total score for environmental problems reported. Damage caused by construction of logging roads and erosion were identified as the main issues. Induced problems (two-thirds of the total score) were dominated by hunting, with encroachment and illegal logging perceived as much less significant. Policies, infrastructure, markets and technology are key external drivers of change in concessions' practices, while regional and international forestry institutions reportedly have the least influence, reflecting an emerging scepticism about the proliferation of international institutions and initiatives promoting sustainable forestry.

AB One activity with potential to provide a direct incentive for reef conservation is scuba diving. In the absence of effective management, diving can also have negative impacts. This study shows how an understanding of diver specialization can be used to help manage diving and increase its effectiveness as an incentive-driven conservation activity. Surveys were used to assess motivations, satisfactions and dive history of divers in Phuket (Thailand) and categorize divers by degree of specialization. Highly specialized divers were more likely to be on a live-aboard trip than less specialized divers and placed greater importance on the characteristics of the dive itself rather than the trip. Less specialized divers put more emphasis on non-dive characteristics. Satisfaction levels differed significantly among specialization groups in terms of overall satisfaction with the dive experience, satisfactions compared with motivations and satisfactions with specific trip characteristics. Overall there was a decline in satisfaction levels with increasing specialization. These finding are compared to a wildlife tourism model that links impacts with client characteristics and suggests a displacement of specialists by generalists and changes in the limits of acceptable change (LAC) over time. The dive data supported this progression leading to increased industry competition and reduced opportunities to sustain a broad-based dive industry that will act as an incentive-driven mechanism for reef conservation. Specific actions related to reef access and zoning according to a diver opportunity spectrum (DOS), establishing LAC and monitoring programmes, enforcing safety and environmental regulations are suggested to promote a more sustainable approach to dive management. Social science insights can be used to aid reef management strategies and increase the potential for diving to contribute towards reef conservation.

SO ENVIRONMENTAL ETHICS

DT Article
AB Suggestions made by Luce Irigaray in her book, An Ethics of Sexual Difference, may offer a solution to a problem in environmental ethics which has much in common with the gender problem: the tendency of the masculine to exploit the Other as "a-place-to-be-in." If humans are to achieve the ethicality of mutually beneficial, sustainable relating with all beings, we need to initiate an economy of desire which has regard to a reciprocity-of receptivity-activity, as a way of safeguarding a clear space open to the kind of relating that makes possible a "permanent becoming" together of all beings. We need to live in a psychic No-Place, to experience our environment as the potentially infinite "Open" of "our-between."

AB The debate about whether global environmental change is real is now over; in its wake is the realization that it is happening more rapidly than predicted. These changes constitute a profound challenge to human health, both as a direct threat and as a promoter of other risks. We call on health care providers to inform themselves about these issues and to become agents of change in their communities. It is our responsibility as clinicians to educate patients and their communities on the connections between regressive policies, unsustainable behaviors, global environmental changes, and threats to health and security. We call on professional organizations to assist in educating their members about these issues, in helping clinicians practice behavior change with their patients and in adding their voices to this issue in our statehouses and Congress. We call for the development of carbon- and other environmental-labeling of consumer products so individuals can make informed choices; we also call for the rapid implementation of policies that provide tangible economic incentives for choosing environmentally sustainable products and services. We urge the environmental health community to take up the challenge of developing a global environmental health index that will incorporate human health into available "planetary health" metrics and that can be used as a policy tool to evaluate the impact of interventions and document spatial and temporal shifts in the healthfulness of local areas. Finally, we urge our political, business, public health, and academic leaders to heed these environmental warnings and quickly develop regulatory and policy solutions so that the health of populations and the integrity of their environments will be ensured for Future generations.

TI Environmental justice in indian country: Dumpsite remediation on the
   swinomish indian reservation
SO ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) defines environmental justice as the "fair treatment for people of all races, cultures, and incomes, regarding the development of environmental laws, regulations, and policies." The last decade has focused considerable national attention on the environmental pollution inequity that persists among the nation's poorest communities. Despite these environmental justice efforts, poor communities continue to face adverse environmental conditions. For the more than 550 Native American communities, the struggle to attain environmental justice is more than a matter of enforcing national laws equitably; it is also a matter of a federal trust duty for the protection of Indian lands and natural resources, honoring a promise that Native American homelands would forever be sustainable. Equally important is the federal promise to assist tribes in managing their reservation environments under their reserved powers of self-government, an attribute that most distinguishes tribes from other communities. The PM Northwest, Inc. (PMNW) dumpsite is located within the boundaries of the Swinomish Indian Reservation in Washington State. Between approximately 1958 and 1970, PMNW contracted with local oil refineries to dispose of hazardous wastes from their operations at the reservation dumpsite. Almost two decades would pass before the Swinomish tribe was able to persuade EPA that a cleanup action under Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) was warranted. This article reviews the enduring struggle to achieve Indian environmental justice in the Swinomish homeland, a process that was dependent upon the development of the tribe's political and environmental management capacity as well as EPA's eventual acknowledgement that Indian environmental justice is integrally linked to its federal trust responsibility.

TI Perceived conflicts between pastoralism and conservation of the kiang
   Equus kiang in the Ladakh trans-Himalaya, India
SO ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
DE Equus kiang; conflicts; pastoralism; nomads; livestock; Ladakh
ID WILDLIFE; WAR
AB An emerging conflict with Trans-Himalayan pastoral communities in Ladakh's Changthang Plateau threatens the conservation prospects of the kiang (Equus kiang) in India. It is locally believed that Changthang's rangelands are overstocked with kiang, resulting in forage competition with livestock. Here, we provide a review and preliminary data on the causes of this conflict. Erosion of people's tolerance of the kiang can be attributed to factors such as the loss of traditional pastures during an Indo-Chinese war fought in 1962, immigration of refugees from Tibet, doubling of the livestock population in about 20 years, and increasing commercialization of cashmere (pashmina) production. The perception of kiang overstocking appears misplaced, because our range-wide density estimate of 0.24 kiang km(-2) (+/- 0.44, 95% CL) is comparable to kiang densities reported from Tibet. A catastrophic decline during the war and subsequent recovery of the kiang population apparently led to the overstocking perception in Ladakh. In the Hanle Valley, an important area for the kiang, its density was higher (0.56 km(-2)) although even here, we estimated the total forage consumed by kiang to be only 3-4% compared to 96-97% consumed by the large livestock population (78 km(-2) stop). Our analysis nevertheless suggests that at a localized scale, some herders do face serious forage competition from kiang in key areas such as moist sedge meadows, and thus management strategies also need to be devised at this scale. In-depth socioeconomic surveys are needed to understand the full extent of the conflicts, and herder-centered participatory resolution needs to be facilitated to ensure that a sustainable solution for livelihoods and kiang conservation is achieved.

TI Sustainable water quality management framework and a strategy planning
   system for a river basin
SO ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB In Taiwan, the authorities have spent years working on remedying polluted rivers. Generally, the remediation planning works are divided into two phases. During the first phase, the allowed pollution discharge quantity and abatement quantity of each drainage zone, including the assimilative capacity, are generated based on the total river basin. In the second phase, the abatement action plans for each pollution source in each drainage zone are respectively devised by the related organizations based on the strategies generated during the first phase. However, the effectiveness of linking the two phases is usually poor. Highly integrated performances are not always achieved because the separate two-phase method does not take system and management thinking into consideration in the planning stage. This study pioneers the use of the Managing for Results (MFR) method in planning strategies and action plans for river water quality management. A sustainable management framework is proposed based on the concept and method of MFR, Management Thinking, and System Analysis. The framework, consisting of planning, implementation, and controlling stages, systematically considers the relationships and interactions among four factors: environment, society, economy, and institution, based on the principles of sustainable development. Based on the framework, the Modified Bounded Implicit Enumeration algorithm, which is used as a solving method, is combined with Visual Basic software and MS Excel to develop a computer system for strategy planning. The Shetzu River, located in northern Taiwan, is applied as a case study. According to the theoretical, practical, and regulatory considerations, the result-oriented objectives are defined to first improve the pollution length of the Shetzu River in specific remediation periods to finally meet regulated water quality standards. The objectives are then addressed as some of the constraints for the strategy planning model. The model objective is to pursue the maximum assimilative capacity (environmental phase) subjected to the constraints of water quality standards (institutional phase), social equity (social phase), and proper available technology (economic phase). The pollution quantity abatement and allocation, which are named the top strategies, of each drainage zone for different scenarios can be obtained based on each water quality standard. The middle as well as lower strategies and action plans, which consist of pollution quantity abatement and allocation of each class (domestic, industrial, livestock, and non-point pollution sources) and their individual pollution sources in each drainage zone, are then generated based on the top strategies. The performance indicators and measure plans are proposed based on the action plans to promote the comprehensive effectiveness of river water quality management. The authorities have begun to develop a budget based on the strategies and action plans developed in this study. The analytical results indicate that the objectives, strategies, and action plans developed based on the sustainable management framework and strategy planning system can effectively help the related authorities to fulfill the tasks of water quality management for a river basin.

AB A program has been developed in Excel and written in Visual Basic for Applications, which enables a decision maker to examine the robustness of a solution obtained when using multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA). The distance-based and stochastic uncertainty analysis approaches contained in the program allow a decision to be made with confidence that the alternative chosen is the best performing alternative under the range of probable circumstances. The uncertainty analysis methodology overcomes the limitations of existing sensitivity analysis techniques for MCDA by enabling all of the input parameters to be varied simultaneously within their expected ranges. The Weighted Sum Method (WSM) and PROMETHEE are the MCDA techniques available for the user to select in the program. The program is illustrated by applying it to a sustainable water resource development problem in the Northern Adelaide Plains, South Australia. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All fights reserved.

AB Separation processes using ion exchange materials are ubiquitous regarding the selective removal of contaminants of environmental concern. Recently, highly regulated contaminants, such as arsenic, have gained notoriety on account of carcinogenic effects and subsequent promulgation of new drinking water standards by the United States Environmental Protection Agency. Other nonregulated compounds such as hardness (e.g., Ca2+, Mg+), pose a particular concern to avoid scaling in beat-transfer equipment, foulingz in membranes, and high consumption of detergents and sequestering chemicals in cooling and wash water. In general, ion exchange processes used to remove hardness generate concentrated brine or mineral acid as a waste regenerant stream. Residuals management and long-term sustainability issues will continue to be major concerns with these processes. The subject paper reports and discusses the results and attributes of two new separation processes using ion exchange fibers (IX-fibers). The first process involves the selective removal of arsenic using hybridized IX-fibers that contain dispersed hydrated ferric oxide (HFO) nanoparticles. Anion-exchanger-supported HFO particles offered a high arsenic removal capacity; less than 10% of influent arsenic broke through after 30,000 bed volumes. Hybrid fibers were also amenable to efficient regeneration with 2% NaOH and 2% NaCl and capable of simultaneous removal of both arsenic(V) and arsenic(III). The second process involves the environmentally benign removal of hardness. Most importantly, this process uses harvested snowmelt (or rainwater) sparged with carbon dioxide as the regenerant. Consequently, the spent regenerant does not contain a high concentration of aggressive chemicals such as sodium chloride or acid like traditional ion-exchange processes nor does the process produce voluminous sludges as does lime softening. The bulk of carbon dioxide consumed during regeneration remains sequestered in the aqueous phase as alkalinity. For both treatment strategies, IX-fibers form the heart of the process. They are essentially thin cylindrical polymeric strands 10-20 mu m in diameter with functional groups residing near to the fiber surface. Low intraparticle diffusional resistance is the underlying reason why calcium loaded weak acid IX-fibers are amenable to efficient regeneration using either snowmelt or rainwater sparged with carbon dioxide. Additionally, for hybrid IX-fibers, enhanced adsorption kinetics may offer the possibility for certain point of use applications, which are unavailable to their resin counterparts.

AB Introduction of the EU Landfill Directive is having a significant impact on waste management in the UK and in other member states that have relied on landfilling. This paper considers the length of the aftercare period required by the municipal solid waste streams that the UK will most probably generate following implementation of the Landfill Directive. Data were derived from literature to identify properties of residues from the most likely treatment processes and the probable management times these residues will require within the landfill environment were then modelled. Results suggest that for chloride the relevant water quality standard (250 mg l(-1)) will be achieved with a management period of 40 years and for lead (0.1 mg l(-1)), 240 years. This has considerable implications for the sustainability of landfill and suggests that current timescales for aftercare of landfills may be inadequate.

AB Objective: Community-based participatory research is recommended for research on health disparities and to improve uptake of clinical research findings. We describe the development of a multicenter consortium designed to support a community agency-academic partner infrastructure to support community-based, health-services research on multiple sources of health and healthcare disparities in local communities.
   Design: We describe the development of the Los Angeles Community Health Improvement Collaborative (CHIC).
   Results: The CHIC partners examined the research capacity and health priorities of its partners and developed a research agenda focused on four tracer conditions (depression, violence, diabetes, and obesity) and four areas for development of research capacity: public participation in all phases of research; understanding community and organizational context for clinical services interventions; practical clinical services trial methods; and advancing health information technology for clinical services research. The partners pooled resources to develop these areas for the tracer conditions.
   Conclusions: The challenges of a participatory approach to community-based clinical services research go beyond the significant methodologic and operational issues for specific projects and include building a sustainable capacity for research, community programs, and partnership across diverse communities and stakeholder organizations even when funding sources are not fully aligned with these goals.

AB Objectives: To identify the components and impact of intervention programs aimed at reducing cardiovascular disparities.
   Methods: A MEDLINE literature search with key words "carcliovascular" and "African American" was conducted, and all documented interventions targeted at reducing racial disparities were selected for review. We identified the type of intervention, the populations targeted, the length of intervention, and its impact. Articles that documented scientific evidence and some case reports were reviewed.
   Results: Existing studies widely document cardiovascular disparities as they pertain to structure, process, and Outcomes. other factors affecting disparities pertain to patient, physician, system, or treatment factors. Documented programs tend to focus on lifestyle risk factors and attitudes toward those risk factors. The timelines in the studies are relatively short. and do not allow for recording clinical end-points. most of the studies (:to not hinge on comprehensive community support, and they lack a sustainability component.
   Conclusions: The impact of programs has been short lived, which points to the need for sustainability programs possibly through community partnerships.

ID CITY-CENTER
AB This paper discusses the evolution of city planning in Portugal with a special emphasis on revitalization of city centre. Five periods are identified as: the birth of city planning (before 1820), the constitutional monarchy (1820-1910), the dictatorship regime (1926-1974), the 'third wave' (1974-1985), and the European Union phase (1985-2003). I argue that even although there may not be direct temporal correspondence between historic developments, the four major international movements of the city beautiful, urban renewal urban enterprise, and the sustainable and creative city all made their debut in Portugal.

AB One of the most pressing problems confronting political scientists today is whether global governance has democratic legitimacy. Drawing on an analysis of the World Summit for Sustainable Development (WSSD) in Johannesburg in 2002, this article advances and empirically deploys an ideal-typical model of a new approach to key areas of global governance - 'stakeholder democracy'. This work is located in the context of the changing practices of global governance, in which concerns about legitimacy, accountability, and participation have gained prominence. Sustainability is an arena in which innovative experiments with new hybrid, pluri-lateral forms of governance, such as stakeholder forums and partnership agreements institutionalizing relations between state and non-state actors, are taking place. A central argument is that sustainability governance imperfectly exemplifies new deliberative stakeholder practices with general democratic potential at the global level. In examining these governance arrangements, we draw together the nascent elements of this new 'model', such as its distinctive takes on political representation and accountability.

ID MODELS
AB Few models have been developed for the integrated planning and scheduling of the inventory, production and distribution functions. In this paper, we consider a three-stage supply chain, for which a sustainable inventory-production-distribution plan over a multi-period horizon is constructed. The associated program takes the form of a general mixed-integer program, for which the sole reliance upon exact methods is shown to be insufficient. We use a solution algorithm based on the variable neighborhood decomposition search metaheuristics, that can be seen as a stagewise exploration of increasingly large neighborhoods. The stages are related to the decomposition scheme, i.e., the order on which integrality conditions are restored. Within each stage, a sequence of neighborhoods is defined relying on the variable neighborhood search metaheuristics, while the exploration of the successive neighborhoods is performed using a branch-and-bound algorithm. The methodology is validated through its application to a problem faced by a large supply chain. Empirical results show that (i) the methodology performs best when the decomposition scheme accounts for the possibility of resources bottleneck, (ii) the primary source of savings originates from the distribution function and (iii) congestion must be defined with respect to the availability of the distribution resources at the periods with high requirements.

TI Fighting tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS in Northeast Europe: sustainable
   collaboration or political rhetoric?
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH
LA English
DT Article
DE International Cooperation; Russia; Baltic States; Scandinavia;
   Communicable Disease Control
AB Background: In April 2000, the Council of the Baltic Sea States established the Task Force on Communicable Disease Control in the Baltic Sea region (the Task Force). A successor structure, the Northern Dimension Partnership in Public Health and Social Wellbeing, was established in autumn 2003. This article, a follow-up study to a series of evaluations of the Task Force evaluation, examines whether the Northern Dimension has succeeded in developing the achievements of the Task Force and ensuring the sustainability of regional health collaboration.
   Methods: The study is qualitative, relying on documentary analysis and semi-structured in-depth interviews with key actors. Relevant literature and key programme documents were consulted, and similar to 100 interviews were conducted.
   Results: The short history of the Northern Dimension Partnership shows that many of the problems encountered in the Task Force are reappearing. Interstate rivalry, most prominent between Nordic countries, still hampers progress, with resulting scarce funding. The Partnership emphasizes the need to anchor future collaboration in centrally placed agencies in all participating countries. This is a time-consuming process, and has the inevitable effect of slowing down project work.
   Conclusion: Although epidemiological data clearly illustrate the need for continued multinational support to communicable disease control in Northeast Europe, the above-mentioned factors impede progress in this respect. While there are good reasons for cultivating partnerships with Russian federal agencies in terms of sustainability, this focus does represent a loss of momentum that may be difficult to overcome.

ID PROFESSIONAL-DEVELOPMENT; GENERAL-EDUCATION
AB In special education, professional collaboration is viewed as a powerful tool for helping teachers serve students with disabilities. An underlying assumption is that general educators will improve practice if they have opportunities to participate in collaborative professional development aimed at improving instruction for students with disabilities. Although sustainability studies suggest that teachers benefit from such collaboration, evidence also demonstrates that they profit differently. This study examined how teachers who readily adapt and adopt strategies acquired in collaboration differed from those who do not. Findings revealed differences in knowledge of curriculum, pedagogy, student management, and student-centered instruction, as well as differences in ability to reflect on and adapt instruction. Implications for improving professional collaboration in schools are provided.

DT Article
AB We describe the evolution of public investment and public capital stocks in Europe over the past three decades. Against this background, we analyse the macroeconomic determinants of public investment, with a special focus on its long-term trend. We find that public investment has been determined by national income, the stance of budgetary policies and fiscal sustainability considerations. Neither the cost of financing nor the fiscal rules embodied in EMU have had a systemic impact on public investment. The significant downtrend that characterises the evolution of public investment in non-cohesion countries is chiefly determined by drawn-out episodes of fiscal consolidation, unrelated to EMU.

AB Supply-demand models, which are commonly used in food policy analysis, have been recently applied to generate projections of future fish supplies. However, these models routinely ignore stock dynamics; hence, threats to sustainability due to declining fish stocks are addressed, at best, by exogenous changes in resource productivity. Such a device is ad hoc, as it is unclear whether the assumed shifts are consistent with known patterns of population adjustment. On the other hand, bioeconomic models incorporate stock dynamics, but typically omit price adjustment arising from the interaction of demand and supply.
   An applied supply-demand model with stock dynamics combines the strengths of both approaches. However, data problems constrain the formulation of such a model. Instead, this study presents a prototype bioeconomic supply-demand model. Simulations show trends in fish supply that fail to appear in either supply-demand or bioeconomic models. Secular demand growth causes initial production growth, followed by stagnation, and then persistent decline. Moreover, under constant pressure from rising demand, capture production fails to recover completely from adverse population shock (such as may be induced by climate change). The prototype model highlights the potential usefulness of an applied bioeconomic supply-demand model for food policy and fisheries management, and provides a template for future work.

TI Impending trade suspensions of Caribbean queen conch under CITES: A case
   study on fishery impacts and potential for stock recovery
SO FISHERIES
LA English
DT Article
ID STROMBUS-GIGAS; MARINE RESERVES; POPULATION; ABUNDANCE
AB The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) Authority issued injunctions in 2003 and 2004 to halt export trade of Caribbean queen conch (Strombus gigas) from several countries and initiated reviews of a number of other conch-producing countries. The current regulatory framework for regional conch fisheries has obviously failed to protect stocks. I present a case study of the Belize conch fishery to examine fishing impacts, effectiveness of existing regulations, and potential for population recovery. Fishery-independent data from a no-take marine reserve indicated that unfished density and biomass were nearly an order of magnitude greater than in comparable fished areas. Size structure of the protected population showed that an average of 38% of the legal catch may consist of juvenile conch. The spawning potential ratio indicated that the fished stock is severely over-exploited, and furthermore, the protected population has not compensated to make the local fishery sustainable. Under these conditions, a moratorium under CITES may be warranted. Until stock assessment models are refined, action should be taken to reduce juvenile fishing mortality, extend closed seasons, and enforce a network of functional no-take reserves in essential habitat.

TI Toward sustainable open ocean aquaculture in the United States
SO FISHERIES
LA English
DT Article
AB In response to a request by American Fisheries Society President Christopher Kohler, we examined the current status of open ocean aquaculture in the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) of the United States, interest in open ocean aquaculture activities, the regulatory environment, and the potential for sustainable development. There is currently little interest in establishing facilities within the EEZ by the commercial sector, largely because of the lack of a formal regulatory structure, though that may be changing as Congress develops legislation on aquaculture in the EEZ. Current U.S. open ocean research and commercial activities are in state or territorial waters. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is poised to take the primary regulatory lead in the EEZ, with other federal agencies, such as the Minerals Management Service, Army Corps of Engineers, and Environmental Protection Agency participating. Under proposed legislation, coastal states would have the opportunity to comment on facilities in the EEZ adjacent to their jurisdictions. A variety of concerns pertaining to open ocean aquaculture development have been put forward that relate to environmental sustainability. We conclude that in the absence of large-scale facilities in the EEZ and associated research in conjunction with such facilities, the potential risks of open ocean aquaculture cannot be adequately evaluated. Data obtained from open ocean sites in other countries may or may not be applicable in this country's EEZ, but international cooperation in sharing environmental information from open ocean aquaculture operations can help researchers and regulators develop environmental safeguards and have them in place, if and when open ocean aquaculture becomes a commercial reality in the United States.

AB Spawning biology and migration of the mud crab, Scylla olivacea (Herbst), in the Andaman Sea were examined from November 2002 to March 2004 at Klong Ngoa Mangrove area, Ranong Province, Thailand. Mature females were dominant from July to November. The changes in monthly gonadosomatic index of females ranged from 1.9 (+/- 3.3) to 8.2 (+/- 5.8) and size at first maturity was 9.4 cm internal carapace width (ICW). Fecundity (F) correlated ICW according to F=3.02 xICW(2.98). A total of 1013 female crabs were double tagged with spaghetti and bottom tags. The recaptured rate was 36.7% and showed that females migrated from coastal area to the open sea during the spawning season. A closed season during the north-east monsoon season and a minimum legal ICW size of 10 cm are recommended for sustainable management of the fishery.

AB The pelagic thresher shark, Alopias pelagicus, is a cosmopolitan species and abundant in Taiwan waters. Some of its biological information has been documented yet its population dynamics are poorly known. The purpose of this study is to assess the pelagic thresher shark stock status in the eastern Taiwan waters. The whole weights (W) of 51,748 individuals of the pelagic thresher shark landed at Nanfanao and Chengkung fish markets, eastern Taiwan from 1990 to 2004 were converted to precaudal length (PCC) based on the W-PCL relationship (W = 2.25 x 10(-4) x PCL2.533, n = 2165). The sexes combined VBGE L-t = 189.5 x (1 - e(-0.10(t+6.47))) was used to estimate the age for each length group. Total mortality rates (Z) obtained with length-converted catch curves ranged from 0.208 to 0.277 year(-1). Natural mortality rate (M) estimated from Hoenig method was 0.132 year(-1), and exploitation rate (E) ranged from 0.069 to 0.127 for 1990-2004. Annual abundance was estimated to range from 97,551 in 2000 to 153,331 in 2003 from virtual population analysis, and the highest fishing mortality occurred in ages 8-18 years. There were four different scenarios being simulated in this study. Scenario I indicated that spawning per recruit (SPR) ranged from 23.07% in 2001 to 47.71% in 1990 with a mean of 36.41% for the period of 1990-2004. The mean SPR of pelagic thresher for 1990-2004 was below the BRP of SPR = 35% in scenarios 2-4 suggesting that this stock was slightly overexploited. Therefore, to ensure sustainable utilization of this stock, reduction of fishing effort and close monitoring on A. pelagicus are needed. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The life history of an increasingly important pelagic commercial and sport fish, the Talang queentish, Scomberoides commersonnianus, was studied in northern Australia to investigate the stock status and assess current management of the species using minimum legal lengths (MLL). Estimated von Bertalanffy growth parameters were L-infinity = 4404 mm FL, K = 0.10 year(-1) and t(0) = -1.21 year(-1). There was no significant difference in growth between sexes. Ages ranged from I to I I years with age composition differing between the commercial (mainly 6-7 years) and sport fishery (mainly 2-4 years). Females matured (L-50) at 635 mm FL and 4-5 years. Spawning occurred between August and March when mature females were estimated to produce 259,488-2,859,935 eggs per spawning. Natural mortality (M) was estimated as 0.16-0.26 year(-1), while the combined fishing mortality (F-current) from commercial and sport fisheries was 0.38-0.48 year(-1). Yield-per-recruit analyses revealed that under current MLL limits (no MLL or 45 cm TL) and natural mortality (M = 0.16, 0.2 and 0.26 year-1), F-current exceeded the reference points F-max (0.15-0.22 year(-1)) and F-0.1 (0.10-0.15 year(-1)), suggesting the stock may be growth overfished if the current situation remains unchanged. Although a stock-recruitment relationship is unknown, spawning stock biomass-per-recruit analysis indicates the stock may also be recruitment overfished since F-current exceeded the reference points F25% (0.19-0.24 year(-1)) and F40% (0.11-0.15 year(-1)). Increasing the MLL corresponding to L-50 of females (70 cm TL) will greatly improve the yield and long-term sustainability of the stock, and also enhance the sport fishery by increasing the number of larger trophy fish.

AB As the most abundant fish species in the Yellow Sea, anchovy (Engraulis japonicus) is decreasing rapidly. Therefore, it is urgent to use a more conservative management approach to protect this declining fish resource. Based on the stock-recruitment (SR) data from 1987 to 2002, the Bayesian method in which uncertainties are treated explicitly is used to assess the SR relationship, the age-structured production model is applied to calculate the biological reference points (BRPs). The Monte Carlo simulation method is performed to predict the expected outcomes in the future for a ran-e of harvest rate. Then, a conservative management approach is recommended.

TI Assessing mackerel scad, Decapterus macarellus, in Cape Verde: Using a
   Bayesian approach to biomass dynamic modelling in a data-limited
   situation
SO FISHERIES RESEARCH

ID FISHERIES STOCK ASSESSMENT; MANAGEMENT
AB The fisheries for mackerel scad, Decapterus macarellus, are particularly important in Cape Verde, constituting almost 40% of total catches at the peak of the fishery in 1997 and 1998 ( 3700 tonnes). Catches have been stable at a much lower level of about 2 100 tonnes in recent years. Given the importance of mackerel scad in terms of catch weight and local food security, there is an urgent need for updated assessment. Stock assessment was carried out using a Bayesian approach to biomass dynamic modelling. In order to tackle the problem of a non-informative CPUE series, the intrinsic rate of increase, r, was estimated separately, and the ratio B-0/X, initial biomass relative to carrying capacity, was assumed based on available information. The results indicated that the current level of fishing is sustainable. The probability of collapse is low, particularly in the short-term, and it is likely that biomass may increase further above B-msy, indicating a healthy stock level. It would appear that it is relatively safe to increase catches even up to 4000 tonnes. However, the marginal posterior of r was almost identical to the prior, indicating that there is relatively low information content in CPUE. This was also the case in relation to B-0/X There have been substantial increases in fishing efficiency, which have not been adequately captured by the measure used for effort (days or trips), implying that the results may be overly optimistic and should be considered preliminary.

AB A Management Strategy Evaluation framework is used to evaluate management strategies based on input controls for the fishery for two tiger prawn species (Penaeus esculentus and Penaeus semisulcatus) in Australia's Northern Prawn Fishery. Three "assessment procedures" are considered and two forms of decision rule. The performance of the management strategies is evaluated in terms of Whether stocks are left at (or above) the spawning stock size at which Maximum Sustainable Yield is achieved (S-MSY), the long-term discounted total catch and the extent of inter-annual variation in catches. The focus of the analysis is on management strategies based on the current method of stock assessment because an alternative method of assessment based on a biomass dynamics model is found to be highly variable. None of the management strategies tested is able to leave the spawning stock size of P. esculentus near S-MSY if the target effort level used in the management strategy is set to E-MSY. Accounting for stock structure through the application of a spatially-(stock-) structured assessment approach fails to resolve this problem. Since the assessment method is generally close to unbiased, the failure to leave the stocks close to S-MSY is because the measure of control is total effort and the two species are found (and caught) together. Reducing the target effort level to below E-MSY increases the final stock size, but the reduced risk comes at a cost of reduced catches. The best management strategy in terms of leaving both species close to Smsy is found to be one that changes the timing of the fishing season so that effort is shifted from P. esculentus to P. semisulcatus and sets more precautionary effort targets for P. esculentus.

In Lebanon, juvenile pelagic fishes are attracted to floating lights and captured using purse seine nets. At least 32 species were collected but only 11 (mainly Engraulis encrasicolus, Sardina pilchardus, Sardinella aurita and Scomber japonicus) represented most of the catches. Weight-length relationships and different condition indices for common species were calculated. Most landed fishes were juveniles with a mean size of 11.3 +/- 8.8 cm TL. Fish conditions exhibited a similar temporal pattern with a minimum recorded in July, probably due to interspecific food competition in the nurseries. The monitored fishing vessel landed about 15 tonnes of juvenile fishes during the 4-month fishing season while fishing effort remained constant. Size-ranges and length-frequency distributions showed that the dominant sizes ranged between 6 and 8 cm TL and that harvested fishes are smaller than the minimum size fished in neighbouring Mediterranean countries. The Lebanese purse seine fishery targets 0 age-class juvenile of many fishes in the nurseries, which is against sustainable fishing practices and has a potential impact on pelagic fish communities in the eastern Mediterranean.

AB Risk assessment has become a key part of management plans for wild capture fisheries. However, for data-deficient fisheries and those with limited knowledge of ecological interactions a qualitative risk assessment method is needed. This paper presents such a method. Using a risk analysis framework adapted from the Standards Australia/Standards New Zealand 4360 we used a multi-stage risk assessment process that consisted of risk context (defining the undesirable event to avoid for any component of the ecosystem), risk identification (sources of risk from the activities of a fishery) and risk characterisation (levels of risk for each species or component of the ecosystem). A qualitative risk matrix was developed to determine the risk from fishing for each component of the ecosystem. The matrix combined two independent factors (fishery impact profile and resilience) that described the factors that determined the likelihood (i.e. the risk) of an undesirable event. Specific issues arising from the risk assessment are then identified. These issues are used in the fishery management plan to generate specific responses that will lower risk levels. The strengths of this qualitative method include its adaptability to a range of different ecosystem components within a fishery (e.g. habitats and threatened species as well as target species) and its applicability to a wide range of different fisheries. The steps involved and the decision criteria used to determine risk levels are transparent and logical, thus are open to scrutiny by stakeholders.
   This paper seeks to demonstrate that a logical and systematic method for qualitative risk assessment provides effective estimates of risk for input into the management plans of any fishery lacking information about one or more of its ecological components. This qualitative risk assessment method provides an important tool to fishery managers and scientists in developing robust management plans where there are minimal data about and knowledge of the fishery. The method is adaptable, repeatable and robust. Differences between our method and that of [Fletcher, W.J., Chesson, J., Fisher, M., Sainsbury, K.J., Hundloe, T., Smith, A.D.M., Whitworth, B., 2002.

ID PRODUCTIVITY
AB Econutrition integrates environmental health and human health, with a particular focus on the interactions among the fields of agriculture, ecology, and human nutrition. Soil loss and degradation and human undernutrition are major barriers to economic development in Africa. A primary aim of the Millennium Villages Project in Africa is to meet the Millennium Development Goals by integrated multisectoral interventions in health and nutrition, agriculture, and environmental sustainability in hunger and poverty hot spots in Africa. Econutrition is only one example of how interdisciplinary approaches are not only critical to alleviating extreme poverty but also fundamental to linking basic science understanding in multiple areas. Human health and agricultural productivity gain, and the costs of the gains are lowered, when we take the opportunity to apply different disciplines through cross-sectoral, thematically linked interventions.

AB Background. There is a need to better understand the coverage of scaled-up multimicronutrient supplementation programs.
   Objective. The coverage of the distribution of multimicronutrient supplements in 26 urban communities among women and adolescent girls 12 through 44 years of age and children under 5 years of age was evaluated for purposes of scaling-up.
   Methods. Formative research and descriptive statistics were used to analyze the distribution of supplements.
   Results. Despite a delayed memorandum of understanding with the health sector and delayed delivery by the producer of the supplement, a high coverage rate of supplement distribution to the children (88% on average during the 3 months of supplementation) was still achieved as a result of the strong commitment of the community and the Integrated Food Security Program. The lower coverage rate among women and adolescent girls (47% on average) was the result of too short a period of enrollment in the program. There was no decrease of coverage during the 3 months of supplementation in both groups.
   Conclusions. Effective, sustainable, large-scale micronutrient supplementation programs require broad partnerships with commitments of governmental and nongovernmental organizations, communities, and the private sector. Availability of the supplements and communication materials must be secured well ahead of the supplementation campaign and distribution of the supplement.

AB Ownership parcelization of forest land and divestiture of industrial forest land is increasing throughout the U.S. This may affect (positively or negatively) the ability of forested landscapes to produce benefits that society values, such as fiber, biodiversity and recreation. We used a timber harvest simulator and neutral model landscapes to systematically study how parcelization and divestiture affect measures of forest composition and fragmentation. timber production and public access. We studied parcelization effects by systematically varying the probability that ownerships would be parcelized at three different spatial scales (9216, 256, 16 ha). We found that parcelization of industrial landscapes significantly increased most measures of forest fragmentation, but did not affect measures of forest composition. Parcelization did not reduce the volume of wood extracted or the area of land available for public recreation, but it did reduce the patch size of land open for recreational use. We studied divestiture effects by systematically varying the proportions of two industrial owners with concurrent changes in the proportion of non-industrial private forest owners (NIPF). We also simulated conversion of NIPF forest land to developed uses. The effect of divestiture depends on which owner is divesting, with the owner that has the most unique effect on a given response variable having the greatest influence. The industrial owner that emphasized even-aged silvicultural techniques had the greatest effect on age class characteristics. The industrial owner that practiced some conversion of other forest types to northern hardwood influenced some cover type characteristics. The proportion of NIPF had the greatest effect on the temporal trend of fragmentation because of conversion of some forest to developed uses. Divestiture of industrial land caused up to a 55% reduction in the volume of wood extracted and reduced the area and patch size of land available for public recreation. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB One controversial and contested issue concerning forest certification is whether this market-based instrument actually requires participating forestry operations to follow more sustainable practices. While previous studies have explored and compared the standards used by different certification systems, our research sheds additional light on this question by systematically assessing documented conditions and pre-conditions that forest companies seeking FSC certification in the United States were required to address in order to obtain, or maintain, their certificates. We examined the changes that 80 SmartWood-certified forestry operations were required to make to forest management, ecological, social, and procedural elements of their forestry practices as a requirement of the certification process. We found that systems elements such as Management Plans, Monitoring and Inventory most frequently required change (by 94%, 79% and 71% of certified operations, respectively), followed by ecological elements such as High Conservation Value Forests and Woody Debris, Snags and Legacy Trees (by 71% and 63% of operations, respectively). We also found regional differences in the number of changes operations are required to make during certification, and found that operations located in states with mandatory Best Management Practices (BMPs) are required to make fewer changes during the certification process than those in states where BMPs are voluntary. We found that small and large operations were given roughly the same number and type of conditions and preconditions. Overall the results show that even the early adopters of certification were required to make important changes as a result of the certification process. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Stated and revealed methods are widely used in the estimation of non-use benefits of ecosystem services and public goods. This paper presents an application of survey based on contingent valuation method for valuation of the non-use benefits of improvement in ecosystem services through Misi Rural Development Project (MRDP), which is integrated with environmental considerations, in Bursa-Turkey. MRDP objects to improve various non-use benefits such as forest and river ecosystems, which residents do not directly purchase in any markets for goods and services. The estimated value of MRDP was per head annually 67.94 USD. Generalizing this value to the households living around the Misi yields 2,306,474 USD/Year. The present value willingness to pay for 20 years is 19,636,313.00 and 461,294.80 USD using discount rates of 10% and 5%. Although this analysis supports the ensuring sustainability of ecosystem service in Misi settlement, multi-agency management systems have caused some issues in rural settlements based on natural resources' productivity in Turkey. Therefore, rural development projects, integrated with environmental considerations like MRDP will be a good chance to provide the sustainability of ecosystem services especially in developing countries.

AB Quantifying the pattern of conflicts including the identification of causes and resolution is prerequisite in developing workable and participatory sustainable forest management system. This study primarily focuses on the recognition, analysis and resolution of forestry conflicts between forest villages and state forest organizations in Turkey. An academic team of foresters, business administrators, economists and behavioral scientists was formed to develop a sound and applicable questionnaire with 49 questions and 69 variables for revealing the existence, the level of intensity and the causes of the conflicts. This study was implemented in three major forest or ecological regions in Turkey: Aegean-Mediterranean region, Western Black Sea region and Eastern Black Sea region and 1065 individuals, out of 1,522,032 populations. The data was statistically analyzed using correlations, reliability measures, Mann-Whitney U Test and Kruskall-Wallis Tests.
   A number of different conflict types were realized in forest villagers in Turkey, where they do not happen in high intensity and necessitates appropriate conflict resolutions mechanisms. Insufficient income level, illiteracy, land tenure conflicts, absence of negotiators, various interests, illicit cutting of trees, lack of collaboration, trespassing private land without permission, polluting the environment and lack of full participatory management structure were the causes of conflicts. The state forest organizations and the other parties of conflicts are either unaware of or pretend to be unaware of the conflicts, creating a dilemma in generating an effective resolution measurements. Almost all the conflicts, that the forest villagers are involved, are significantly related to each other. In conclusion, the traditional forest management system is no longer effective, necessitating certain level of power and full participation of communities in forest management decision making process.

AB The present study developed and used a forest resource accounting framework to correct wealth measures and indicators of economic performance derived from the SNA in Swaziland for the true contribution of plantation forests. The study revealed that the economic importance of plantation forestry and its contribution to wealth accumulation in Swaziland is highly underestimated and hence current measures of sustainable growth are seriously distorted. The study showed that accounting only for net accumulation of timber and carbon stocks in plantation forests improves measures of genuine savings for the country by 112%, which was about 7.9% of the country's GDP. Although the study does not account for the many other omissions of environmental values of forests and other natural resources, it demonstrates the substantial magnitude of error in signals to policy making and sustainable development planning conveyed by conventional measures of economic performance derived from the current SNA and illustrates the importance of environmental accounting for prudent use of natural and environmental resources for economic development.

AB Community based natural resource management (CBNRM) has received considerable attention in recent years and is being actively encouraged across the world as a successful strategy in promoting natural resource governance. Its efficacy in the field, however, is highly variable. The present study, based on an empirical analysis of the Joint Forest Management program in Tamil Nadu, India, explores the variation in the perceptions of collective action among community members, and analyzes the factors influencing perceptions of its performance. The results underline the need for a shared understanding of the collective action among community members for the joint venture's success and sustainability. Further, the analysis highlights the role of costs and benefits entailed in collective action in influencing the perceptions of its performance. The authors suggest careful consideration of differences in community members' understanding of the collective action and its impacts, before and during the implementation of CBNRM strategies.

AB Understanding indigenous knowledge of soils has come to be seen as essential in understanding the local realities of farmer and may be critical for the success or failure of agricultural development. However, little effort has been made to capture the indigenous knowledge of upland farmers in northern Laos where many projects are working to develop sustainable crop production systems as alternatives to slash-and-burn systems. This paper discusses the indigenous knowledge of Loum and Khamu slash-and-burn farmers in relation to soil quality and cropping practices. Most farmers interviewed distinguished two or more soils in their field. When farmers were asked to describe their soils, farmers took a holistic view and not only discussed the soil (primarily color or texture) but also the occurrence of weeds on the soil and the quality of burn. Glutinous rice, their staple food, tended to be planted on good soils, while non-glutinous rice and cash crops (i.e. Job's tears and sesame) were planted on poor soils. Farmers' classification of soils showed good correlation with soil chemical and physical analysis and agronomic performance. For example, color was the most common descriptor of soils. Black soils, which farmers ranked highest in preference, had higher pH, total N, total C and CEC levels than the other color soils. Also, upland rice yields were significantly higher on black soils compared to other soils. Such information can facilitate collaboration between farmers, extension workers and researchers to improve crop production systems and the use of soil and natural resources. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

AB Studies on soil strength and rooting characteristics of crops are important for water and nutrient budgeting and also for deciding the adoption of suitable soil management practice for sustainable crop production. In the present field trial, the variation of soil penetration resistance (PR) with soil water content (SWC (w/w)) and bulk density (BD) changes under bed and conventionally planted wheat was studied on a sandy loam soil of research farm of Indian Agricultural Research Institute, New Delhi. The differences in root characteristics of both systems were also compared. The results showed that, in general for all SWC, with increase in BD from 1.2 to 1.6 Mg m(-3), PR increased but the increase was more sharp in conventional than in bed planting system. It was further seen that, at all BDs, the critical soil strength of 2 MPa arrived at higher SWC in conventional as compared to bed planting. It thus indicated that root growth continued normally at relative lower SWC in bed planting as compared to conventional planting.
   Multiple regression analysis of soil penetration resistance as a function of BD, SWC and soil depth showed that SWC alone accounted for 59% variation and along with BD accounted for 93-96% variation in PR. Addition of depth did not improve the correlation.
   Sensitivity analysis of multiple regression equation predicting penetration as a function of SWC and BD indicated that PR was more sensitive to SWC changes than BD changes. Lower sensitivity indices for both SWC and BD in bed planting than in conventional planting indicated relatively lesser change in PR per unit change in SWC or BD in bed system.
   Computer aided root length scanning system 'RHIZO' was used to study rooting characteristics. Analysis showed that root characteristics including root length density, average root diameter, surface area density and volume density of roots of wheat up to 30 cm were significantly higher in bed over conventional system. In both systems, nearly 70% of root length density and 76-82% of root surface area was confined in upper 30 cm. It was further seen that more than 70% of total root length was in root diameter range below 0.3 mm.
   Hence, it was concluded that sowing of wheat on beds reduced mechanical impedance and increased root growth in upper 30 cm of soil, which ultimately resulted in higher crop yield. (c) 2006 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Mobilisation of nutrients and dissolution of minerals are of key importance for plant growth and soil formation, as well as long term ecosystem sustainability. The effects of Pinus sylvestris seedlings, ectomycorrhizal colonisation and potassium supply on the mobilisation of Al, Fe, K and Si were studied in a soil column experiment. Budgets were constructed considering amounts in drainage water, accumulation in plants and changes in the pools of exchangeable ions (BaCl2 extractions). Drainage was the most important sink under the experimental conditions imposed, but the other two pools were also of quantitative significance. Plants had a significant positive effect on the total quantities of all elements mobilized. Mycorrhizal colonisation had limited quantitative impact on the mobilization, probably because the chosen mycorrhizal fungi did not cause any growth promotion in this experiment. Despite this, a multivariate analysis (PCA) showed a clear separate grouping of mycorrhizal, non-mycorrhizal and no-plant treatments, and in particular Si and K mobilization was related to soil biological variables which in turn were affected by the presence of mycorrhiza. When K was omitted from the watering solution, plants were able to mobilise significantly more K, which was reflected in plant uptake and a potential replenishment of the exchangeable pool. Up-scaling of total Al, K and Si mobilization to field conditions resulted in rates between equal to and up to 10 times higher than the average historical weathering rate. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

AB The relationship between population mobility and farming is complex and has been the focus of numerous studies. Despite differing perspectives on the subject, there is an increasing realization that migration sustains farming in many rural communities, but with contradictory effects. Notwithstanding this conclusion, there is a paucity of village level studies that explain the precise ways in which migration in its various forms affects the survival of small farms. This paper reports on the results of a village level study of migration and small farming in the Rio Grande Valley of Jamaica. Apart from highlighting the various ways in which migration affects small farming at the local level, the study confirms the contradictory impact of migration on small farming in this remote agricultural community. It is noted, however, that the net effect is positive and the capital and labour resources, which are made available as a result of migration, play pivotal roles in the survival of small-scale farming as an economic activity in the area.

TI A Conceptual Model of Community Capacity for Biodiversity Conservation

ID AUSTRALIA
AB In Australia an unprecedented level of attention is being paid to improving the sustainable management of agricultural lands. As of 2005, the Australian government had committed over four billion dollars to land, water and biodiversity management programmes. Most is being allocated to regional community groups. Central to programme delivery is attention to community capacity and the desire to build capacity to implement changes in land and water management. This paper addresses the fundamentally important question 'what is community capacity?' through developing and refining a conceptual model of community capacity to deliver biodiversity conservation outcomes. Model development was based on a literature review and synthesis, with subsequent refinement using interviews. From the literature, community capacity was described as five forms of capital: natural, social, human, institutional and produced economic. The model was refined using interviews with Greening Australia (an environmental non-government organisation) field staff. Their responses identified all five forms of capital as important elements of community capacity. Social and human capital were mentioned by almost all respondents, with limited mention being made of the other capitals. Social capital included cognitive and structural dimensions. Knowledge, skills and experience were part of human capital. These results provide researchers and practitioners with assurance that social and human capital indicators can be confidently sought to describe capacity. There is also sufficient guidance from these results to progress indicator selection for the remaining forms of capital provided that selection is accompanied by continuing refinement of our descriptions of these forms.

AB The Australian ski industry represents a 'canary in the coalmine'. Globally, it is one of the first and most visibly impacted industries by the risk of climate change. This study explores the perceptions of people associated with the operations of ski resorts in south-eastern Australia. It was hypothesised that ski resorts, given the value of their assets, would anticipate and respond to the threat of climate change. The responses demonstrate how representatives of the Australian ski industry perceive climate change issues, and the measures that are being taken to address this issue at particular resorts. These responses provide insights into how other firms and industries might respond to the biophysical impacts of climate change. Using in-depth interviews, the study compares the perceptions and responses of resort managers and government representatives with those from previous studies. The analysis draws on and improves the model of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and its development as a policy framework for adaptation. The major findings of this study are that a physical meltdown may not lead to a financial meltdown, that business responses to climate changes are more varied than has been represented in the literature to date and that the tension between competing firms on the one hand and industry cooperation on the other strongly influences the types of response that may develop.

TI Temporal Patterns and Effects of Surface-Water Diversions on Daily Flows
   and Aquatic Habitats: Bega-Bemboka River, New South Wales, Australia
SO GEOGRAPHICAL RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
DE Environmental flow; abstraction; extraction; irrigation; MOVE.1
AB An understanding of the nature and magnitude of hydrological, physical habitat and physico-chemical effects resulting from surface-water diversions in river systems is essential for effective management of water resources. For most coastal-draining rivers in New South Wales, however, there are few data available on irrigation diversions, their hydrological impacts and environmental effects. This paper therefore presents an analysis of mean daily surface-water diversions for pasture irrigation from approximately three years of metered data and the resultant effects on daily flows and aquatic habitats in the Bega-Bemboka River. The period of analysis of the hydrological effects of irrigation diversions is extended to the full length of record (approximately five years) for gauging stations most affected by irrigation diversions, using Maintenance of Variance Extension Type 1 (MOVE. 1) modelling techniques. The annual mean, median and peak daily rates of water diversion by metered surface-water licences used to irrigate 925 ha of dairy pasture are 10.5 Ml d(-1), 7.3 Ml d(-1) and 41.5 Ml d(-1), respectively. Diversion effects on flow duration statistics are such that the measured 90th and 95th daily flow duration percentiles at the gauging station most affected by upstream irrigation diversions are equivalent to the 97th and 99th flow duration percentiles, respectively, under MOVE. 1 modelled natural flow conditions. While diversions for irrigation over the three-year data period account for only 6.6% of total flow volumes, diversions as a proportion of daily surface-water inflows increase exponentially under decreasing flow rates. Median and maximum daily diversion rates attain 91% and 118%, respectively, of total surface-water inflows to the diversion-affected reach when upstream inflows range from 15 to 20 Ml d(-1). This exponentially-increasing relationship between daily diversion rates and declining surface-water inflows suggests that 'rule of thumb' guidelines on sustainable diversion limits based on mean or median annual percentage diversion volumes need to be applied cautiously to river systems with no or limited capacity to manipulate flows to meet downstream consumptive demands.

TI Seeking common ground for people: Livelihoods, governance and waste
SO HABITAT INTERNATIONAL

DT Article
DE solid waste management; informal waste workers; poverty; Pakistan
AB Jam Chakro is a large International Donor-funded landfill site in Karachi, when opened in 1996 it was intended to be carefully managed by the Karachi municipal authorities. However, within weeks of opening it was overtaken by informal-sector waste workers. They are mostly poor rural migrants who have gravitated towards urban areas seeking work. Their waste sorting and recycling work, which involves burning waste, is now responsible for serious environmental degradation and poor waste management.
   Nearby residents are being affected by the smoke, and wish to see an end to the burning. Local authorities are under pressure to manage the waste better and wish to see an end to the recycling activities. However, initial attempts to stop these activities and relocate people, sometimes involving force, have been unsuccessful. The workers complain that they depend on the waste work for their survival.
   This paper is concerned with the problems caused by the informal-sector recycling work at Jam Chakro, and the need for finding environmentally and financially sustainable solutions which respect the interests of all stakeholders. It is based on fieldwork which involved detailed stakeholder identification and consultation, to ensure that different perspectives were heard and accounted for. In the light of research findings, the paper discusses some of the proposed options for integrating informal-sector livelihoods into the formal operation of the landfill site. These are based around organising waste reclamation and recycling work and enabling it to take place without burning waste.
   The paper proposes that the problems at Jam Chakro can in part be attributed to not having accounted for the poor in planning, necessary for developing sustainable solutions to the problems.

TI People and their waste in an emergency context: The case of Monrovia,
   Liberia
SO HABITAT INTERNATIONAL
LA English
DT Article
DE solid waste; participatory planning emergency planning Liberia
AB Liberia has gone through civil crisis for over a decade which has resulted in the destruction of infrastructure and disruption of basic services delivery particularly in Monrovia, the capital city. Most of the 1.3 million people living in Monrovia are without adequate environmental sanitation and waste management services which situation poses a serious health risk to the residents. The current waste management service coverage is less than 20% and disposal is by indiscriminate open dumping. In 2003, there were series of outbreaks of cholera epidemics in the city during which time a total of 26,651 cases were reported with many dying.
   The waste management plan was initiated as an exit strategy of UNICEF following an intervention response programme to assist the Monrovia City Corporation (MCC) whose capacity in this area had been crippled as a result of years of war, through the provision of support in solid waste collection and disposal.
   The objectives of the plan were to:
   (a) Improve waste management services delivery in the city. (
   b) Strengthen the ability of the MCC to plan and manage the waste services delivery.
   (c) Enhance cooperation of service beneficiaries through comprehensive and effective health education and service promotional campaign.
   (d) Enhance revenue generation and community participation through the promotion of private sector and CBOs/NGOs active involvement in the waste management service delivery.
   The general methodology adopted for the assignment entailed the following:
   Desk study and review of existing reports on Water and Environmental Sanitation (WES) in Monrovia and other relevant literature, consultation with stakeholders, site visits and participatory planning which aimed at soliciting the opinions of the various stakeholders involved with the respective components to capture their aspirations and experiences. It also covered collection and analysis of available information and data to facilitate the plan preparation and facilities design.
   The three-phased strategy (short, medium and long term) covering a period of 10 years (August 2004-December 2014), recommended a combination of technical options for collection based on the pursuit of staged development to allow for the adoption of realistically attainable standards within a framework of continuous and systematic improvements as economic conditions improved and new knowledge gained through practice. The plan sought to blend the capacity within the City Corporation with that of the private sector and NGOs/CBOs to respond to the diverse service demands of the city taking into consideration housing and infrastructural conditions, service costs and cost recovery to ensure sustainability. It also identified sources of financing and allocated financing responsibilities to facilitate effective plan implementation. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Solid waste collection by the private sector: Households' perspective -
   Findings from a study in Dar es Salaam city, Tanzania

   countries; solid waste management; solid waste collection; NGOs; CBOs
AB The issue of poor solid waste management (SWM) is a challenge throughout the world, in both developed and developing countries. People always generate solid waste through their daily activities. This solid waste needs to be properly managed in a way that minimises risk to the environment and human health, which means storage, collection and proper disposal. At the same time solid waste creates livelihoods for the urban poor in terms of employment and business. This paper looks into one aspect of SWM, namely collection service.
   The importance of SWM is now recognised at international, national and community level. The Agenda 21 declaration of the United Nations [UN. (1993). The global partnership for environment and development: A guide to agenda 21 (pp. 88-94). New York: United Nations] addresses the issue of environmentally sound management of solid waste, with emphasis on the extension of solid waste service coverage to all urban and rural areas worldwide.
   SWM is a service for which local governments are usually responsible. However, due to inadequate capacity in the public sector, in many developing countries the private sector has stepped in to fill the gap in service provision. Dar es Salaam (DSM), Tanzania, is one such developing country city in which the private sector has become involved in solid waste collection services. The sector comprises Non-Government Organisations (NGOs), Community-Based Organisations (CBOs), and local private companies [Kassim, S. M., & Ali, S. M. (2003). Private solid waste collection SERVICE, Dar es Salaam Tanzania. In Proceedings of the 29th WEDC international conference: Towards millenium development goals. Abuja Nigeria, Water and Engineering Centre WEDC]. The private sector in solid waste collection in DSM has been promoted by Sustainable DSM Programme (SDP) through Environmental Planning and Management (EPM) [UNCHS. (1994a). Sustainable Human Settlements Development: Implementing Agenda 21; UNCHS. (1994b). UNCHS (Habitat) Activities; New Envoy to UNCHS from the United Republic of Tanzania. Habitat News, 16, 1-3].
   Contracting out of solid waste collection services to the private sector has emerged to fill the gap in service delivery. In 1991 the city was generating 1400 tonnes of solid waste per day out of which only 5% was being collected. Currently daily solid waste generation is estimated at about 2500 tonnes and approximately 48% of the total waste generated is collected. At present, privatisation covers 44 out of 73 city wards, and 451 active registered private companies are involved [Chinamo, E. B. M. (2003). An overview of solid waste management and how solid waste collection benefits the poor in the city of Dar es Salaam. Solid waste collection that benefits the poor, Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, Collaborating Working Group on Solid Waste Management in Low and Middle-Income Countries (CWG)]. This paper presents the findings of a study that explored the households' perspective on solid waste collection services provided by the private sector. The study showed that the solid waste collection service by the private sector is greatly influenced by households' attitudes and behaviour. Their participation, demand for service, awareness, satisfaction level and views on cost recovery are important in the sector. The study concludes that the above factors would be superior if customers (households) were more involved in the planning and decision-making. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Many thousands of people in developing country cities depend on recycling materials from waste for their livelihoods. With the focus of the Millennium Development Goals on poverty reduction, and of waste strategies on improving recycling rates, one of the major challenges in solid waste management in developing countries is how best to work with this informal sector to improve their livelihoods, working conditions and efficiency in recycling.
   The general characteristics of informal recycling are reviewed, highlighting both positive and negative aspects. Despite the health and social problems associated with informal recycling, it provides significant economic benefits that need to be retained. Experience shows that it can be highly counterproductive to establish new formal waste recycling systems without taking into account informal systems that already exist. The preferred option is to integrate the informal sector into waste management planning, building on their practices and experience, while working to improve efficiency and the living and working conditions of those involved. Issues associated with integrating informal recycling into the formal waste management sector are discussed. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The paper investigates recently launched plans to privatize solid-waste management in Cairo, focusing on its adverse effects on the sustainability of the associated recycling economy and urban settlement system of the garbage collectors communities (Zabaleen) located within the Muqattam mountain area which is adjacent to Cairo's old historical quarters. According to official development strategy, the privatization of solid-waste services is regarded as fundamental to overall government plans for Old Cairo's rehabilitation. The objectives of the rehabilitation programme tend to favour tourist-orientated projects, whilst ignoring the local population's interests through the removal of informal Zabaleen settlements in Muqattam mountain, and through the clearing of the Eastern Cemetery of its tomb dwellers and shanty town buildings.
   The study examines the consequences of recent official intervention in the sustainability of the Muqattam Zabaleen settlement in terms of physical and demographic growth, infrastructural development, and changes in land tenure system. The paper takes into consideration early 1980s programmes funded by the World Bank to improve the Zabaleens' environment and to upgrade their settlement. These aimed to maintain the existing informal settlement pattern and to develop urban service delivery systems.
   The empirical study adopts a qualitative analysis employing ethnographic techniques of informal discussions with secondary stakeholder agencies (local municipality, planners, NGOs activists). A field survey of the primary stakeholder group (garbage collectors) involved in-depth interviews with householders and with community leaders in the Zabaleen settlement. The analysis explores narratives expressed by members of the Zabaleen community in response to the threat of enforced eviction resulting from potential state-controlled gentrification programmes for urban development and land speculation in the area.
   The findings emphasize the significance of local participatory mechanisms in restructuring solid-waste collection and in developing the recycling industry whilst putting vacant and under-used areas into productive use. These mechanisms would support the management of built environment and local resources and would build local capacity through developing new channels for co-operation and partnership between the garbage collectors' association (Gamm'yya) and grass roots organizations together with the local authorities and multi-national companies. In order to promote sustainable livelihoods and better opportunities for the urban poor the study concludes that there is a need to draw on the sustainable flow of local resources within low-income garbage collectors groups, whilst seeking new means of supporting land acquisition and its development for improved housing standards, basic services and environmental quality.

DE environmental sanitation; waste management; sustainability; India
AB Inadequate environmental sanitation in many cities is a major cause of diseases and is a drain on the economy by way of lost workdays, cost of treatment and cleanup activities. Municipal authorities and policymakers need to act fast to address this issue. Sustainable waste management provides a comprehensive inter-disciplinary framework for addressing the problems of managing urban solid waste, in the resource constrained developing countries where quality of such services are poor and costs are high often with no effective means of recovering them. Upgrading the coverage of waste management and services and increasing their efficiency is a precondition for improving the environmental quality of cities. This paper highlights the fact that the involvement and participation of all the stakeholders such as the waste generators, waste processors, formal and informal agencies, non-governmental organisations and financing institutions is a key factor for the sustainable waste management.

TI Community-based household waste management: Lessons learnt from EXNORA's
   'zero waste management' scheme in two South Indian cities
SO HABITAT INTERNATIONAL
LA English
DT Article
DE integrated solid waste management; recycling; community management;
   India
AB This paper presents two case studies on the efforts by a community-based organisation to promote a sustainable integrated waste management system in Indian mega cities. This effort was initiated in 1989 by a local non-governmental organisation (NGO) called EXNORA and is based on a 'zero waste management scheme' set up, run and financed by the residents themselves. As this model has been widely quoted as successful, the study aims at learning from two communities implementing this model.
   Results are reported from a survey of the two schemes that used various tools to assess both their performance and sustainability in selected residential areas of two Indian cities, Chennai and Hyderabad. The results indicate limited success of the schemes both in saving a significant fraction of the generated waste from dumping, and in rehabilitating the local poor. However, they show that motivated individuals can successfully set up and manage waste collection systems that lead to overall environmental improvements. The differences in the two schemes reflect how the local assets and contexts impact on the success of the scheme. The scheme in a rich neighbourhood of Hyderabad was less ambitious in its overall objectives and focussed on the provision of a waste management service, using the opportunity to provide local employment to a socially deprived fraction of the population. The scheme in a middle-class area of Chennai, although pioneering in its approach, suffered from diseconomies of scale and lack of social integration, making it less viable in the medium to long term. Both schemes suffered from a lack of community involvement, motivation and political support, which threatens the long-term sustainability of the enterprise. The research concludes that the role that communities can realistically play in management of their own waste depends on the local context. The system advocated by EXNORA seems to require significant local resources, and political and technical support which are hard to find and sustain without strong local leaders. Another model set up in the city of Visakhapatnam is finally introduced as an alternative. This is based on triangular contracts between the municipality, the residents and micro-enterprises and may provide a good solution in dealing with the technical and commercial aspects which communities find difficult.

AB Chile's economic development model changed drastically in 1973. Public policy liberalization ended and the market became the principal entity for regulating growth, including urban growth. The implementation of this new model resulted in unprecedented urban growth, markedly impacting the landscape. In mid-sized cities, this spatial growth has been especially significant. Two examples of such mid-sized cities are Chillan and Los Angeles, located in the Biobio Region, in the so-called Central Valley. This research analyzed the land use/cover change in Chillan and Los Angeles from 1978 to 1998, identified the patterns of urban growth and the fragmentation of the urban space, applying GIS and remote sensing tools. The main driving forces of the urban changes were analyzed and the model to predict the land use/cover changes was applied. Our results show the importance of monitoring and modeling rapid urban growth for attaining sustainable mid-sized cities in developing countries that are strongly dependent on export of natural resources. Monitoring and modeling could also help to avoid a repetition of the errors that produced the unsustainable growth characteristic of large Latin American cities. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

   urban transport strategy formulation
AB Almost 10 years ago the World Bank and UNDP expressed grave concerns about the likely future adverse impact of motorization on middle-sized cities in Asia and the Pacific region.(1) They claimed that, while many mega and primary cities in the region have an acknowledged transport crisis that has attracted major planning efforts, and extensive large-scale investment, the middle-sized cities (with only a fraction of the resources available to them) remain neglected and as result will reach their own crisis points unless effective policies are developed and implemented. Both agencies argued that catching the problems at an early stage would offer the advantage of developing a more systematic approach to tackling problems associated with unabated motorization and the opportunity to develop a generic method that could be applied to many medium-sized cities throughout the region. With this in mind, the World Bank, through UNDP and ESCAP, completed a study in 1998 directed by the author which sought to establish what generic strategic steps should be taken to prepare proactive measures to confront the challenges that motorization poses for such cities. The study drew extensively on the urban development and motorization experiences of three middle-sized cities in Asia-Kanpur in India, Ningbo in China and Solo in Indonesia-and recommended building blocks of a generic sustainable transport strategy for the region. Seven years on from the completion of this study, this paper examines the validity of the original motorization fears, re-examines the study's key findings and recommendations, and concludes that many still have resonance today.

TI Quality of life and sustainability issues as seen by the population of
   low-income housing in the region of Campinas, Brazil
SO HABITAT INTERNATIONAL

DE quality of life; housing; low income; sustainability; site-planning
AB This paper presents a study on quality of life and sustainability indicators relating to site-planning parameters for low-income public housing projects in the region of Campinas, Brazil. The study is based on a post-occupancy-evaluation (POE), conducted in five housing developments. Most of these housing projects are based on a repetitive model and are devoid of urban infrastructure. Users act on their own in providing for some elements considered necessary to create an identity and community spirit. Results show that the population relates quality of life to economic factors and sustainability is associated to reduce utility bills. Houses are preferred to apartments and satisfaction with the present housing conditions is high, despite low feelings of security in the neighbourhood. This work is part of a broader study, which aims to develop design evaluation tools. Most sensitive quality of life and sustainability indicators related to site-planning should permeate these tools and establish design guidelines. The inclusion of a large number of qualitative design issues into the decision-making process and the questioning of existing standardized solutions are seen as essential means to increase local housing quality.

AB This article provides a critique of the controlling legal paradigm in Australia from related scientific and quality management perspectives. It shows key legal requirements are prescientific and hinder attainment of community health and sustainable development goals. It discusses regional arrangements which appear necessary to achieve national aims and the potential of a duty of care regulatory approach, in which dispute resolution is conceptualised as community service, like health or education provision.

TI Valuing hospital investment in information technology: Does governance
   make a difference?
SO HEALTH CARE FINANCING REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
ID HEALTH-CARE; SYSTEMS; COSTS; PRODUCTIVITY; PHYSICIANS; ADOPTION; PARADOX
AB This article examines the investment of patient care information technology (IT) systems by a nationwide sample of U. S. short-term acute care hospitals and the resulting impact these systems have in the productivity of institutions from 1990-1998. Of particular interest is the extent to which for-profit and not-for-profit hospitals obtain different results from the adoption of IT systems. We find that the marginal effect of IT on for-profit hospital productivity is to reduce the number of days supplied, while in not-for-profit hospitals the marginal effect of IT is to increase the quantity of services supplied. This resulting effect is consistent with the differing objectives of not-for-profit and for-profit hospitals and demonstrates the positive marginal value of IT as a sustainable and prudent investment.

TI Setting physicians' prices in FFS Medicare: An economic perspective
SO HEALTH CARE FINANCING REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
ID REGIONAL-VARIATIONS; CARE; DEMAND
AB Recent policy discussions by the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC) regarding physician prices in the traditional fee-for-service (FFS) Medicare Program reflect movement toward a market pricing model. Earlier objectives such as sustainable levels of spending have given way to concerns over the relationship between fees and actual costs, access to care, and the importance of demand and supply in local markets. An important objective in other policy settings is economically efficient distribution of services. We explain the meaning of economic efficiency for Medicare physician prices and explore difficulties one might encounter in pursuing economic efficiency, as well as the cost of not pursuing it.

AB Physical activity levels begin to decline in childhood and continue falling throughout adolescence, with girls being at greatest risk for inactivity. Schools are ideal settings for helping girls develop and maintain a physically active lifestyle. This paper describes the design and implementation of 'Lifestyle Education for Activity Program', or LEAP. LEAP used a health team approach with participatory strategies to provide training and support, instructional capacity building and opportunities to adapt school instructional program and environmental supports to local needs. The social-ecological model, based on social cognitive theory, served as the organizing framework for the LEAP intervention and elements of the coordinated school health program model as intervention channels. For the 12 intervention schools, LEAP staff documented 191 visits and interactions with 850 individuals over the 2-year period. Teachers reported successful implementation of most components of the intervention and demonstrated optimism for sustainability. These results indicate that a facilitative approach to intervention implementation can be used successfully to engage school personnel, and to change instructional programs and school environments to increase the physical activity level of high school girls.

TI Emerging health issues: the widening challenge for population health
   promotion
SO HEALTH PROMOTION INTERNATIONAL
LA English
DT Article
DE sustainability; transitions; globalization; health promotion
ID CLIMATE-CHANGE; ECOLOGY; DISEASE; LINK
AB The spectrum of tasks for health promotion has widened since the Ottawa Charter was signed. In 1986, infectious diseases still seemed in retreat, the potential extent of HIV/AIDS was unrecognized, the Green Revolution was at its height and global poverty appeared less intractable. Global climate change had not yet emerged as a major threat to development and health. Most economists forecast continuous improvement, and chronic diseases were broadly anticipated as the next major health issue.
   Today, although many broadly averaged measures of population health have improved, many of the determinants of global health have faltered. Many infectious diseases have emerged; others have unexpectedly reappeared. Reasons include urban crowding, environmental changes, altered sexual relations, intensified food production and increased mobility and trade. Foremost, however, is the persistence of poverty and the exacerbation of regional and global inequality.
   Life expectancy has unexpectedly declined in several countries. Rather than being a faint echo from an earlier time of hardship, these declines could signify the future. Relatedly, the demographic and epidemiological transitions have faltered. In some regions, declining fertility has overshot that needed for optimal age structure, whereas elsewhere mortality increases have reduced population growth rates, despite continuing high fertility.
   Few, if any, Millennium Development Goals (MDG), including those for health and sustainability, seem achievable. Policy-makers generally misunderstand the link between environmental sustainability (MDG #7) and health. Many health workers also fail to realize that social cohesion and sustainability-maintenance of the Earth's ecological and geophysical systems-is a necessary basis for health.
   In sum, these issues present an enormous challenge to health. Health promotion must address population health influences that transcend national boundaries and generations and engage with the development, human rights and environmental movements. The big task is to promote sustainable environmental and social conditions that bring enduring and equitable health gains.

TI What makes for sustainable Healthy Cities initiatives?- a review of the
   evidence from Noarlunga, Australia after 18 years
SO HEALTH PROMOTION INTERNATIONAL
LA English
DT Article
DE healthy cities; health promotion programs; sustainability; evaluation
AB This paper examines the factors that have enabled the Healthy Cities Noarlunga (HCN) initiative to be sustainable over 18 years (1987-2005). Sustainability related to the ability of the initiative to continue to operate continuously in a manner that indicated its existence was accorded value by the community and local service providers. The analysis is based on a narrative review of 29 documents related to HCN, including a number of evaluations. Nine factors emerged as important to ensuring sustainability: strong social health vision; inspirational leadership; a model that can adapt to local conditions; ability to juggle competing demands; strongly supported community involvement that represents genuine engagement; recognition by a broad range of players that Healthy Cities is a relatively neutral space in which to achieve goals; effective and sustainable links with a local university; an outward focus open to international links and outside perspectives; and, most crucial, the initiative makes the transition from a project to an approach and a way of working. These sustainability factors are likely to be relevant to a range of complex, community-based initiatives.

ID MEDIA ADVOCACY; STRATEGY; LESSONS
AB Facilitating community action is a key goal of health promotion. This paper describes a public health advocacy framework. It then presents a case study of its application for planning community action by a community alliance concerned about increased heavy traffic on roads through a small regional city in the South West region of Western Australia. The case study illustrates defining the public health problem, the solution and the target for action; and the implementation of a comprehensive range of strategies including a media advocacy strategy to attract public attention, to reframe media messages, and to provide a policy alternative to government and industry. The campaign was evaluated in terms of process and outcomes, and was successful in putting pressure on key stakeholders and achieving the alliance's two main goals. The case study demonstrates the value of a well-planned campaign and including public health advocacy in public health practice, as an important strategy to facilitate the creation of healthy environments through healthy public policy.

TI Sowing the seeds for sustainable change: a community-based participatory
   research partnership for health promotion in Indiana, USA and its

DE community-based participatory research; healthy communities;
   sustainability
AB Community-based participatory research (CBPR) increasingly is being used in both developed and developing countries to study and address community-identified issues through a collaborative and empowering action-oriented process. In 2003-2005, a study was undertaken to document the impacts of CBPR on healthy public policy in the US. From an initial review of 80 partnership efforts, 10 were selected as best capturing the range and diversity of projects meeting the study criteria, and were the subject of in-depth case study analysis. This article presents and analyzes one of these cases, a collaboration between researchers at the Indiana University School of Nursing and the Healthy Cities Committee of New Castle, IN, USA. With its action component still underway a decade after the formal study's completion, the partnership was selected to enable an examination of sustainable change through CBPR. Beginning with a participatory door-to-door health survey of 1000 households using a non-probability quota sampling strategy, the project involved community members in many stages of the research process. A smoking rate of twice the national average was among the study findings that helped to galvanize the community into action. A variety of health promoting environmental and 'small p policy' changes were undertaken ranging from a bill restricting indoor smoking in public places to an initiative to develop a system of trails throughout the county to promote physical fitness and decreased reliance on automobiles. This article examines the evolution of the original CBPR partnership, its research methods and findings, and the environmental changes it sought to promote healthier lifestyles. Success factors, barriers and sustainability benchmarks are discussed. The case study offers an example of the potential of CBPR for helping to lay the groundwork for long-term sustainable change in support of healthier communities.

TI WHO Health Promotion Glossary: New terms
SO HEALTH PROMOTION INTERNATIONAL
LA English
DT Article
DE health promotion; health education; terminology
AB The WHO Health Promotion Glossary was written to facilitate understanding, communication and cooperation among those engaged in health promotion at the local, regional, national and global levels. Two editions of the Glossary have been released, the first in 1986 and the second in 1998, and continued revision of the document is necessary to promote consensus regarding meanings and to take account of developments in thinking and practice. In this update 10 new terms that are to be included in the Glossary are presented. Criteria for the inclusion of terms in the Glossary are that they differentiate health promotion from other health concepts, or have a specific application or meaning when used in relation to health promotion. The terms defined here are: burden of disease; capacity building; evidence-based health promotion; global health; health impact assessment; needs assessment; self-efficacy; social marketing; sustainable health promotion strategies, and; wellness. WHO will continue to periodically update the Health Promotion Glossary to ensure its relevance to the international health promotion community.

ID GLOBALIZATION
AB This article questions the assumption that increasing competition among higher education institutions is the best method of achieving a strong higher education sector in developing countries. It notes that there has been increasing emphasis on the importance of higher education institutions for sustainable development, particularly because of their importance to the global knowledge economy. For the same reason, the appropriate management of the relationship between the state and higher education institutions is vital to a strong and dynamic future for these institutions. This paper proposes a menu of options for higher education governance, grouped around 'state-centric' and 'neo-liberal' models of development. The 'state-centric' model proposed is based on a variety of examples of high performing Asian economies, in particular, while the 'neo-liberal' model is based on emerging trends in higher education management in countries such as Australia, the United States and the United Kingdom. The paper suggests that despite pressure across the globe to encourage a market among universities, this may not always be the most efficient use of resources, or the best way to integrate universities in a country's drive for economic growth.

AB Over the last two decades, demands by fish harvesters for greater input into policy-making, combined with government cutbacks to fisheries management agencies, have resulted in a proliferation of community-based fisheries comanagement projects in many countries. One such example is found on Newfoundland's Eastport Peninsula, where a group of lobster harvesters have formed a unique partnership with federal government bureaucrats and university researchers in an effort to protect local lobster stocks from increasing fishing pressure. This paper draws upon interviews with lobster harvesters and others with close ties to the Eastport project in exploring the reasons for the development of this initiative and identifying existing and potential obstacles to its long-term success.

TI Ecohydrology and water resources management: a pilot study in Trinidad
SO HYDROLOGICAL SCIENCES JOURNAL-JOURNAL DES SCIENCES HYDROLOGIQUES
LA English
DT Article
DE Caribbean; ecology; hydrology; instream flow; sustainability
AB An area of rainforest in Trinidad (10 degrees N, 61 degrees W) is remarkably rich in biodiversity, and receives the highest amount of rainfall in the island due to its orography and the dominant northeast trade winds. However, a year-round transfer of water from its pristine rivers is likely in the future, with ecological consequences. The results of a pilot study are presented, based on a simple, and graphical, segment-scale multi-objective methodology for the estimation of the optimal instream flow of the 13 rivers in this area. This methodology is based on a dimensionless ecohydrological factor, A, which enables the required hydraulic mean depth at a river cross-section to be expressed in terms of the average species length at maturity for a target group of amphibians, birds, fish, mammals and reptiles. Moreover, the methodology considers the socio-economic cost of ecological degradation brought about by streamflow abstraction, as well as the economic benefit of the same. An example illustrates the estimation of optimal instream flow for a value of A and, thereby, the corresponding optimal river intake operating rule, based on the hydraulic characteristics of a 0.1 km segment of one of the rivers, for the 20-year average dry (January-May) and wet (June-December) seasons. The limitations of the pilot study, and areas for further research, are also highlighted with a hope that it will ultimately evolve into a decision-making tool for water resources management.

AB objective. To assess the performance and limitations of a reprocessing protocol for nonlumen electrophysiology catheters by testing the sterility of reprocessed devices and defining the maximum number of reprocessing cycles sustainable by the device in hygienically safe conditions.
   design. Simulated use, reprocessing, and testing of the catheters.
   setting. Microbiology and virology department of a public health diagnostic laboratory.
   interventions. Seventy-three catheters were collected after clinical use on patients. The first group of devices was tested for sterility after 1 cycle of reprocessing. By the repetition of simulated use ( blood inoculated with bacteria) and reprocessing ( decontamination, cleaning, and hydrogen peroxide gas plasma sterilization), we obtained 39 sample devices reprocessed 2 times, 26 reprocessed 3 times, 28 reprocessed 4 times, 36 reprocessed 5 times, and 22 reprocessed 6 times. Devices were cultured for 28 days in trypticase soy broth.
   results. We tested 208 catheters with 6 cycles of reprocessing and 4 inoculated bacteria species. No devices tested positive for the inoculated strains until the fourth cycle of reprocessing. One of 35 catheters showed the growth of the inoculated strain Bacillus subtilis after 5 cycles of reprocessing, and 1 of 22 catheters showed growth of this organism 6 cycles. After the second reprocessing, 7 of 36 devices showed growth of gram-negative bacteria other than the strain inoculated.
   conclusions. Reprocessing according to the reprocessing protocol was insufficient to guarantee device sterility after 5 reuses. Cleaning with enzymatic solution revealed good cleaning properties with efficient bioburden reduction. Storage intervals of longer than 24 hours during reprocessing should be avoided to limit contamination or bacterial overgrowth. Technical considerations suggest the introduction of reprocessing procedures only in hospitals with considerable workloads.

ID CENTER DESIGNATION; SHAFT FRACTURES; VOLUME; CARE; MANAGEMENT; SYSTEM
AB Trauma centre accreditation originated as a North American initiative in the 1970's with the aim of standardising and improving care for injured patients. This system of grading a hospital's ability to receive serious trauma has subsequently spread, most notably to Australasia. Many studies have focussed on determining whether this accreditation results in improved patient outcomes. We review the evidence to date, which suggests significant mortality reductions albeit from mainly Class III studies and reflect on the future sustainability of this initiative given mounting financial pressures.

   simulation games
ID SIMULATION
AB Forest planning and management concepts can sometimes be difficult to grasp. Games provide an effective way to demonstrate different concepts and facilitate deeper understanding of approaches and practices to sustainable forest management. In this paper we describe a game devised to demonstrate alternative ways to set allowable harvest levels in large (> 10,000 ha) native forest planning units. The game requires minimal materials (photocopies of relevant maps and a few hundred beer bottle tops), and can be played and debriefed in 2-3 hours. The game focuses on the principles underlying area control and volume control of timber harvesting, and provides a basis for discussion of inventory and monitoring needs. The game has been popular and effective in courses for forestry professionals in developing countries, and for students in an undergraduate forestry course.

LA English
DT Article
DE sustainable forest management; continuous forest inventory; continuous
   forest cover; wood lot licence; annual allowable cut
AB The application of data from a continuous forest inventory, CFI, system over fifteen years to a wood lot licence in British Columbia is described. The B.C. Forest Service is responsible for forest management based on an annual allowable cut where the cut calculation has been related to the silvicultural system of clear cutting, based on computer modelling to predict growth and yield. Public pressure toward selection cutting and retention has developed and clear cutting is being partly replaced by retention to create a continuous forest cover system in which CFI could be applied.
   Canada and its provinces have been working towards CFI, coordinated through the Canadian Forest Inventory Committee whose objective is to measure. record and report on Canada's forest inventory and to monitor change and the forest's sustainability. This approach may also be useful to the National Forest Strategy Coalition.

AB In this study we present an energy and exergy modelling of industrial final macaroni (pasta) drying process for its system analysis, performance evaluation and optimization. Using actual system data, a performance assessment of the industrial macaroni drying process through energy and exergy efficiencies and system exergy destructions is conducted. The heat losses to the surroundings and exergy destructions in the overall system are quantified and illustrated using energy and exergy flow diagrams. The total energy rate input to system is 316.25 kW. The evaporation rate is 72 kg h(-1) (0.02 kg s(-1)) and energy consumption rate is found as 4.38 kW for 1 kg water evaporation from product. Humidity product rate is 792 kg h(-1) (0.22 kg s(-1)) and energy consumption rate is found about 0.4 kW for 1 kg short cut pasta product. The energy efficiencies of the pasta drying process and the overall system are found to be as 7.55-77.09% and 68.63%. The exergy efficiency of pasta drying process is obtained to be as 72.98-82.15%. For the actual system that is presented the system exergy efficiency vary between 41.90 and 70.94%. Copyright (c) 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB In this paper from the Xiangshang Forum 2006, we propose the Wisdom project, an international network initiative on developing the next generation of management and entrepreneurial systems based on knowledge and wisdom rather than data and information. This is a major challenge especially for China which must aspire to become wise and ethical rather than just efficient or effective. Major topics of the project include knowledge management, wisdom systems, added value measures, entrepreneurial university, and management as a profession. These topics are the key ones for developing sustainable competitive advantage of any globally aspiring economy or enterprise.

AB As environmental issues have become serious, the significance of product life cycle is recognized to establish a sustainable society, and Inverse manufacturing concept is discussed for product life cycle. To realize the inverse manufacturing system the prime problem is how to improve the rate of reusing the product modules. Therefore analyzing the life-time of the disassembled modules is very important before the reassembling process. In this paper, first a cumulative damage model is proposed to discuss the failure of the product that is assembled by reuse modules. It is supposed that modules suffer damage due to shocks and fails when the cumulative damage level exceeds the failure level, and compute the probability of failure. Then maintenance costs will be analyzed in order to minimize the expected maintenance cost-rate. The optimal maintenance time T and optimal number of damages N will be also discussed in this cumulative damage model, and the probable safe life-time of module reuse will be explored by the T and N. Finally a numerical example is given for some exponential cases to confirm the validity of the proposed model.

AB This paper discusses aspects of information technologies for health care, in particular on transinstitutional health information systems (HIS) and on health-enabling technologies, with some consequences for the aim of medical informatics. It is argued that with the extended range of health information systems and the perspective of having adequate transinstitutional HIS architectures, a substantial contribution can be made to better patient-centered care, with possibilities ranging from regional, national to even global care. it is also argued that in applying health-enabling technologies, using ubiquitous, pervasive computing environments and ambient intelligence approaches, we can expect that in addition care will become more specific and tailored for the individual, and that we can achieve better personalized care. in developing health care systems towards transinstitutional HIS and health-enabling technologies, the aim of medical informatics, to contribute to the progress of the sciences and to high-quality, efficient, and affordable health care that does justice to the individual and to society, may be extended to also contributing to self-determined and self-sufficient (autonomous) life. Reference is made and examples are given from the Yearbook of Medical Informatics of the international Medical Informatics Association (IMIA) and from the work of Professor Jochen Moehr.

AB Over 600,000 tons of used tires are annually disposed of in Germany. Given the legal framework and the limited landfill capacities, particular attention has been given to the environmental impacts of tire recycling. Dedicated life cycle assessments point out tire remanufacturing, also called retreading, as the most sustainable recovery alternative. Nevertheless, retreading still remains only one alternative among others with a fraction varying from 1% up to 80% market share depending on the tire type. Thus, the primal purpose of this case study is twofold: to ascertain the reasons for such discrepancy and to investigate to what extent remanufacturing activities could be extended. This first requires an analysis of the present situation in both car and truck tire markets. In the following, we apply an OEM-centered decision model in order to analyze potential future scenarios concerning their ability to raise remanufacturing rates. We find out that retreaded truck tires have exhausted their remanufacturing potential whereas a customer-sided bottleneck hinders further development in the car tire market. Finally, we conclude that the question whether an OEM should add retreaded tires to his current product mix mostly depends on a product's nature, either functional or psychosociological. Only functional products have enough remanufacturing potential to justify an extension of supply chain planning towards recovery. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB There has been considerable debate about how best to define sustainable development. In this commentary, I argue that Amartya Sen's concept of 'development as freedom' is the appropriate theoretical framework for understanding sustainable development. Environmentalists should consider defining their goal as 'sustainable development as freedom,' the achievement of the greatest possible level of freedom without restricting the access of future generations to these same freedoms. The adoption of this framework has implications for the work of environmental NGOs, which are briefly discussed.

AB The study used a combination of fairly standard and often overlapping participatory tools and techniques as well as SWOT analysis in the context of the sustainable livelihoods approach (SLA), which is emerging as a potentially useful way of looking at policies and institutions to address poverty. The adoption of fisheries co-management in Aby Lagoon in Cote d'Ivoire has contributed to improving the sense of ownership, empowerment and access of fishers and other stakeholders to resources. The fishers and other stakeholders attest that the arrangement has also contributed in enhancing the sustainable livelihoods and coping mechanisms against the incidence of poverty in the communities. Fishers would like legal empowerment to enforce fisheries regulations devised by themselves and also assistance to improve their work in collection of information and adaptive research upon which to base their plans. The co-management arrangement in Aby Lagoon is still evolving. However, the study testifies to the existence of many competent actors and to a great wealth and depth of relevant experience and lessons which other actors involved in poverty reduction strategies in small-scale fishing communities can draw on.

AB Since the publication of Agenda 21 agricultural sustainability has become an internationally important goal. Whereas in the past issues of food security and sustainability centred on the developing world only, where large sections of the population are undernourished, it is today increasingly recognised that the developed world also has a 'food problem'. Indeed, with rising levels of obesity and environmental damage, goals of sustainable agriculture are now as pertinent in the developed world as the developing. This paper seeks to explore the policies of two competing visions for food and agricultural sustainability. One vision seeks to break the productionist hegemony with policies to promote, inter alia, organic and local food. The other vision seeks to continue the productionist hegemony in only a slightly modified fashion; emphasising biotechnology and technological panaceas. This paper contends that the modified productionist vision is flawed and political will is now required to promulgate radical agricultural policies that break the productionist hegemony.

AB The article formulates the need to measure sustainable development. It stresses the importance of the geographical and ecological components of sustainability, first of all, in terms of a general methodology and geoecology. It introduces such basic categories as development, sustainability, sustainable development, the Sustainable Development Concept (SDC), Development Sustainability Measurement (SDM), and several others. The authors maintain that today it is necessary to consider somewhat uncertain factors of sustainable development. They lay down basic principles for solving the problems of sustainable development measurements. They show the complex nature of the methodology involved in measuring sustainable development and cite the experience that exists in sustainability indicator elaboration. Methodological principles of development measurements are proposed and practical examples are given. The article characterizes the importance of the geoinformation environment for implementing sustainable development tasks.

TI Participation: rHetoric and reality. The importance of understanding
   stakeholders based on a case study in Upper East Ghana
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WATER RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB Based on the views of a number of stakeholders involved in the development of small reservoir systems in the Upper East Region of Ghana in West Africa, this paper examines the importance of understanding the stakeholders whom the international development community wants to include in its participatory approaches. The paper also aims to show that terms such as 'participation', 'participatory approach' and 'participatory planning' are often used in project proposals, but that in reality the extent to which stakeholders are actually able to participate in projects is limited. This limitation is often due to a lack of understanding by the project organization of the interests and views of the stakeholders, which are then not incorporated in the project process. A stakeholder analysis could provide more insight in the interests, goals and views of all stakeholders involved in a project, as well as in the differences between the stakeholders. In the development of water resources, the long-term sustainability of a project's work is dependent on the manner in which relevant ( often local) stakeholders continue the process after the official time of the project has ended. Thus, since the project is dependent on the involvement of relevant stakeholders, the formulation of adequate and appropriate forms of stakeholder engagement that will ensure information exchange and participation is essential. However, as the case study shows, such analyses were not always carried out, thus leading to a number of problems with project implementation and also with transplantation from one region, district or community to another.

TI Assessment of the contributions of traditional qanats in sustainable
   water resources management
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WATER RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB Qanats (Kanats) have been an ancient, sustainable system facilitating the harvesting of water for centuries in Iran, and more than 34 additional countries of the world. These subterranean channels have been used for the transference of snowmelt water from the mountainous terrain for thousands of years. Agricultural, industrial and urban demands for fresh water have brought about increasing demands for water, the elixir of life. In response, the harvesting of water via deep groundwater wells throughout arid zones has disturbed the aquifers, and resulted in the abandonment of some qanats. Qanats in the province of Yazd City are witnessing this depletion. This paper introduces qanats, objectives causing their creation, construction materials, locations and their importance in different times, as well as their present role in Iran. Further, current qualitative and quantitative analyses of the qanats in Tehran are identified.

TI Cooperation in a hydro-geologic commons: New institutions and pricing to
   achieve sustainability and security
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WATER RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
ID RIGHTS; LAW
AB Current water use in the areas of Israel, Gaza, West Bank and Jordan is not consistent with a sustainable water supply: growing demands relative to supplies threaten underground aquifers, and water quality problems diminish the health and welfare of current residents and impair future water supplies. A hydro-geologic system can be viewed as a commons that provides a stream of benefits to an entire geographic area over time. Sustainability requires the design of new institutions with appropriate boundaries and rules. This paper proposes a regional cooperative management system, combining aspects of a regional utility and a joint commission, which would use price incentives for management purposes. The non-profit regional water utility would establish limits on water use, determine water prices and make investments from system revenues. For efficiency, surface water, groundwater and recovered water of the same quality should receive the same price. Withdrawal limits based on sustainability would be sufficient to establish prices through the interaction of supply and demand. Equity issues could be addressed by a guaranteed water provision with a relatively low price for the guaranteed level. Security in terms of adequate groundwater storage could be achieved through appropriate investment. A representative body of water users would help the utility determine appropriate limits and guarantees. The conceptual basis for this institutional design is temporal efficiency. While a traditional market could improve spatial allocation, it would not necessarily address sustainability or provide for investment in recycling and other technologies to improve water supply. Furthermore, the proposed system bypasses the issue of property rights required for full market exchange.

TI Sustainable groundwater allocation in the Great Lakes Basin
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WATER RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
ID WATER-RESOURCES MANAGEMENT
AB Outdated groundwater allocation policies have resulted in unrestrained abstraction of groundwater in the Great Lakes Basin. Continuing on this course will lead to more frequent conflicts and further degradation of the Basin's ecosystem. Alternative approaches must focus on achieving sustainable groundwater allocation. The authors present two alternative institutions, local collaborative planning for groundwater allocation, and a regional watershed board. Collaborative institutions responsible for local groundwater planning should be established according to practical geographical units, have access to sound scientific information, utilize adaptive management and engage in open deliberation. The regional watershed board should establish a comprehensive and unified inventory of all groundwater resources in the Basin, designate critical groundwater areas, monitor groundwater management by respective jurisdictions, and make recommendations on best practices.

TI A country on the move: International migration in post-communist Albania
SO INTERNATIONAL MIGRATION REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
AB Albania is a country on the move. This mobility plays a key role in household-level strategies to cope with the economic hardship of transition. With the relaxing of controls on emigration at the beginning of the 1990s, international migration has exploded, becoming the single most important political, social, and economic phenomenon in post-communist Albania. Based on the 1989 and 2001 population censuses we estimate that over 600,000 Albanians live abroad, mostly in nearby Greece and Italy, with the vast majority coming from a limited number of districts located at the coastal and transport gateways to these destination countries, as well as Tirana. The available data also suggest that a similar number have considered migrating, and of these, half have tried and failed. Almost one-half of the children who since 1990 no longer live with their parents are now living abroad, a number of almost exodus proportions. This article also identifies clear patterns of temporary migration, with Greece being by far the most important destination and rural areas from the Center and North-East of the country being the primary origins of these flows. Although migration, with the resulting remittances, has become an indispensable part of Albanian economic development, there is increasing consensus on the necessity to devise more appropriate, sustainable strategies to lift households out of poverty and promote the country's growth.

TI Mental health and psychosocial aspects of disaster preparedness in
   Bhutan
SO INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF PSYCHIATRY
LA English
DT Article
AB Bhutan has taken the initiative in developing a comprehensive guideline on disaster risk preparedness and management in response to several minor disasters, namely earthquakes and flash floods in the country during the last couple of years. It is now widely accepted that the psychological symptoms of trauma resulting from devastation to lives and livelihood of affected people remain much longer and sometimes throughout their entire life span unless taken care of. Therefore, it is important to include psychosocial components of mental health protection and treatment of the affected persons in disaster risk preparedness and management to make it a comprehensive package. A four-tier system of mental health intervention and counselling has been proposed in line with the existing healthcare system and resources available in the country to make it sustainable. At the core of this programme is the mobilizing and training of volunteers from the community on psychosocial intervention, counselling and rehabilitation, backed up by three layers of trained health workers and mental health professionals.

AB Many aquatic crustaceans pass through a complex life cycle comprising a benthic juvenile-adult and a pelagic larval phase. In the study of aquatic ecology, meroplanktonic larvae are therefore considered as principal components of benthic-pelagic coupling processes. As a consequence of radical transitions of life style, larvae differ from conspecific adults in their ecology, behaviour, nutrition, morphology, and physiology. Ontogenetic changes of these traits, as well as carry-over effects of larval condition on postmetamorphic fitness of benthic juveniles, are subjects of the interdisciplinary field of larval biology. Larval biology is thus not only an intrinsic part of life-history studies, but contributes essential information also to various other biological disciplines, including the broad area of crustacean research. For economically important species, it provides critical information for the development of aquaculture techniques or for the management of sustainable fisheries. Inferring from heritable ontogenetic patterns, comparative studies of larval morphology also aid the identification of phylogenetic relationships within and among higher taxa ("Evo-Devo" perspective). On the other hand, larval traits may be modified by environmental factors, which link larval ecology to developmental biology ("Eco-Devo" approach). Patterns of larval dispersal, mortality, and recruitment are crucial for the stability of benthic; populations and communities. These aspects of "supply-side ecology" have also consequences for patterns of biogeographic distribution, population connectivity, genetic diversity, and the formation of metapopulations. In addition, the spread of introduced species in recipient regions may be explained or predicted through developmental and ecophysiological traits of their larvae. In evolutionary biology, knowledge of reproductive and developmental adaptations is crucial for the understanding of limnic and terrestrial invasions by originally marine crustaceans.

AB For assessing the potential and need to reuse surface drainage and groundwater for sustainable crop production in the Shandong province of the Yellow River basin, inventories were made on the quality of alternative sources of irrigation and on the yields achieved by farmers using those waters for irrigation. Drainage and groundwater quality (EC < 2 dS m(-1)) in most parts of Huimin and Yangxin counties favors their use for irrigation but there can be some limitations in Wudy as the salinity increases towards the sea. Yield-soil salinity functions were developed for both maize and wheat; for the latter, functions depend upon the number of irrigations applied. Simulations using the SWAP model showed that yields of wheat and maize could be sustained with the reuse of drainage water having a salt content up to 4 mg cm(-3). There is a clear benefit from using drainage water for the last two wheat irrigations relative to deficit irrigation despite water salinity. Monsoon rainfall should help to maintain a favorable salt balance, thus to avoid salt build-up along the soil profile. Results indicate that the reuse of drainage waters offers opportunities for improving irrigation water management in wheat for areas facing water shortage. Copyright (c) 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Objectives: Determine outcome differences between orphaned and non-orphaned children receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART).
   Design: Retrospective review of prospectively recorded electronic data.
   Setting: Nine HIV clinics in western Kenya
   Population: 279 children on ART enrolled between August 2002 and February 2005.
   Main Measures: Orphan status, CD4%, sex- and age-adjusted height (HAZ) and weight (WAZ) z scores, ART adherence, mortality.
   Results: Median follow-up was 34 months. Cohort included 51% males and 54% orpbans. At ART initiation (baseline), 71% of children bad CDC clinical stage B or C disease. Median CD4% was 9% and increased dramatically the first 30 weeks of therapy, then leveled off. Parents and guardians reported perfect adherence at every visit for 75% of children. Adherence and orphan status were not significantly associated with CD4% response. Adjusted for baseline age, follow-up was significantly shorter among orphaned children (median 33 vs. 41 weeks, P = 0.096). One-year mortality was 7.1% for orphaned and 6.6% for non-orphaned children (P = 0.836). HAZ and WA-Z were significantly below norm in both groups. With ART, HAZ remained stable, while WAZ tended to increase toward the norm, especially among non-orphans. Orphans showed identical weight gains as non-orphans the first 70 weeks after start of ART but experienced reductions afterwards.
   Conclusions: Good ART adherence is possible in western rural Kenya. ART for HIV-infected children produced substantial and sustainable CD4% improvement. Orphan status was not associated with worse short-term outcomes but may be a factor for long-term therapy response. ART alone may not be sufficient to reverse significant developmental lags in the HIV-positive pediatric population.

AB The global biosphere has begun to change fundamentally as a consequence of human actions. This change can be understood as a consequence of a major transition in the evolution of life on Earth, the emergence of human language, which opened up new pathways of biological information transmission. The challenge facing the humans species now is to not just suffer the consequences of this change, but to develop a science of Earth system analysis that will allow the collective, globally networked reflective capacity of humans to chart paths into the future that are sustainable. Global observation and computer modelling are important elements of this process. Such models for the biosphere predict large-scale reorganisation of the functional composition of the terrestrial biosphere under strong anthropogenic climate change. Considering the advent of humans and of global change on the background of the past evolution of life on Earth, it is obvious that the co-evolution between geosphere and biosphere that has characterised Earth history in the past has expanded to include the anthroposphere as a third interacting element.

ID EPIDEMIOLOGIC TRANSITION THEORY
AB It is clear that in making the concept of sustainable development concrete, one has to take into account a number of practical elements and obstacles. There is little doubt that integrated approaches are required to support sustainable development. Therefore, a new research paradigm is needed that is better able to reflect the complexity and the multidimensional character of sustainable development. The new paradigm, referred to as sustainability science, must be able to encompass different magnitudes of scales (of time, space, and function), multiple balances (dynamics), multiple actors (interests) and multiple failures (systemic faults). To illustrate the above, we described potential health transitions in a globalised world.

AB Purpose: To assess the effects of a long-term intervention for tobacco use prevention that targets adolescents (Tobacco Free Duo).
   Methods: School-based community intervention combined with repeated cross-sectional surveys over 7 years. The intervention was performed in the County of Vasterbotten, Sweden, where survey data were collected in grade seven to nine schools on an annual basis for 7 years. Data for comparison were collected in grade nine on the national level in Sweden. In the intervention area, the annual number of seventh to ninth grade students participating in the study varied between 1300 and 1650. In the reference data, the number of participating ninth grade students approximated 4500 annually.
   Results: A significant decrease of nearly 50% was seen in smoking prevalence in the intervention area. The decrease was evident in grades eight and nine (ages 14-15 years) in both boys and girls. At the start of the intervention, smoking prevalence in grade nine was 16.1% in the intervention area and 23% in the national reference group. Although the prevalence in the national sample remained stable, there was a decrease to 9.0% in the intervention area at the end of the study period.
   Conclusions: These results suggest that the Tobacco Free Duo program contributed to a reduction in adolescent smoking among both boys and girls. Using a multi-faceted intervention that includes adolescent-adult partnership can reduce adolescent smoking uptake, and the intervention has been proven to be sustainable within communities.

AB For the long-term sustainability of the dairy industry in the Northeastern USA, manure nutrient application rates should not exceed crop nutrient removal once above-optimum soil fertility levels are reached. Dairy producers have shown a growing interest in brown midrib (BMR) forage sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench.) x sudan-grass (Sorghum sudanense Piper) hybrids (S x S) as a more environmentally sound alternative to maize (Zea mays L.) but data on S x S nutrient removal rates are scant. Our objectives were to determine N, P, K, Ca and Mg removal with harvest as impacted by N application rate, using six N rate studies in New York. One of the six sites had a recent manure history. Although site-to-site differences existed, N application tended to decrease P and K and increase N, Ca and Mg concentrations in BMR S x S forage. Nutrient removal and yield were highly correlated for all sites except one location that showed a K deficiency. The crop removed large amounts of P and K in the manured site, suggesting that BMR S x S is an excellent scavenger of these nutrients. If manure is applied mid-season, forage K levels are likely too high for feeding to non-lactating cows.

AB Stylosanthes guianensis is a popular pasture legume and cover crop. The legume possessed strong allelopathic potential and suppressed spontaneous growth of paddy weeds. In a bioassay, aqueous extract of S. guianensis remarkably inhibited germination and growth of barnyardgrass and monochoria. Application of 1 ton ha(-1) upland parts of S. guianensis significantly reduced paddy weed biomass by 80% and increased rice yield by 40% when compared with the control. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis reveals the presence of several allelochemicals in S. guianensis including phenolic acids, coumarin and long-chain fatty acids. Stylosanthes guianensis may be used as a source of natural herbicide for reducing the dependency on synthetic herbicides in agricultural production.

TI Development folklife: Human security and cultural conservation
SO JOURNAL OF AMERICAN FOLKLORE
LA English
DT Article
AB Addressing the potential for development folklife as a subfield within the discipline of folklore, this article argues that folklorists need to expand not only their development work outside arts agencies, but also their definition of development. Analyzing cultural tourism as the dominant development model used by folklorists, this article locates it within export-oriented economic growth strategies that do not challenge the dominant, neoliberal discourse of development as economic growth. The transformation of culture into a value-added commodity for preservation happens when folklore-based cultural tourism projects ignore the intersection of traditional culture with public policy, human rights, environmental management, global capitalist economics, and the human and livelihood security issues produced. In this way, folklorists' tourism efforts support capturing cultural resources for state-defined economic growth strategies and the historical separation of culture from development. The article introduces a rights-based or human security-based development paradigm that allows folklorists to collaborate with communities to improve their capacity to address political, economic, environmental, and other changes that affect the sustainability of their cultures.

AB The recent dramatic decline in farmland biodiversity is often attributed to agricultural intensification and structural changes in the agricultural landscape. One suggested farm practice seen to benefit biodiversity and reverse declines is organic farming. Because organic farming is viewed as a more sustainable form of agriculture it is currently subsidized by European agri-environment schemes. However, the efficiency of agri-environment schemes to preserve biodiversity has recently been questioned, partly because their uptake has been highest in extensively farmed more heterogeneous landscapes.
   We investigated the effect of farming practice on butterfly species richness and abundance along cereal field headlands and margins on 12 matched pairs of organic and conventional farms in contrasting landscapes (homogeneous and heterogeneous landscape diversity).
   Both organic farming and landscape heterogeneity significantly increased butterfly species richness and abundance. There was also a significant interaction between farming practice and landscape heterogeneity, because organic farming only significantly increased butterfly species richness and abundance in homogeneous rather than heterogeneous landscapes.
   An analysis of the distribution of organic farming in Sweden in relation to productivity of the arable land (yield of spring barley, kg ha(-1)) indicated that the distribution of organic farms was skewed towards extensively farmed agricultural areas.
   Synthesis and applications. The species richness and abundance of butterflies can be enhanced by actions aimed at both promoting organic farming and increasing landscape heterogeneity. However, the beneficial effect of organic farming was only evident in intensively farmed homogeneous landscapes. Currently, the majority of organic arable land in Sweden is located in heterogeneous landscapes where changing the type of farming practice adds little to the existing biodiversity. We therefore propose that the interaction between landscape heterogeneity and farming practice must be considered when promoting farmland biodiversity, for example in Europe by developing context-based agri-environment schemes to increase the amount of organic farming in intensively farmed landscapes. We also propose that in homogeneous agricultural landscapes, organic farming could be used as a more efficient tool to restore landscape heterogeneity if the creation of semi-natural landscape elements was mandatory in the regulations associated with organic agri-environment schemes.

AB 1. Commercial forests represent an important but often neglected biological resource. This study related the understorey plant species composition of a coniferous plantation forest managed by clearfelling to environmental factors (stand structure, soil pH and previous land use) and ecological patterns (abundance-occupancy relationships, species dispersal and life history).
   2. Plant species richness and composition were recorded in 326 managed stands of different ages, soil types and land-use histories in a 185-km(2) lowland forest planted onto heath and arable land.
   3. Stands replanted in the last 10 years had the greatest species richness, typically containing in the order of 18 plant species. Stands on soils of high pH had greater plant species richness, as did those on previously arable land.
   4. Less than a quarter (23%) of all species persisted in the above-ground vegetation throughout the growth cycle. The majority recolonized forest stands during the cycle, by physical dispersal or from the seed bank, largely after canopy opening in mature stands (26%) or after felling (47%). Annual species and species with plumed seeds were most abundant in early growth stages, while shrubs with berries were more abundant in mature stands.
   5. We found a strong positive interspecific relationship between frequency of stand occupancy and mean abundance within occupied stands. For species not persisting above-ground throughout the forestry cycle (i.e. patch colonizers), the slope of the abundance-occupancy relationship was steeper for those with a long-distance dispersal mechanism than for those lacking such a mechanism.
   6. Synthesis and applications. Rotational clearfelling of plantations may be an appropriate form of forest and conservation management in forests planted on former open areas such as heaths, where the conservation interest is not in old-growth species but in earlier successional species. Maximizing representation of young growth stages will help maximize plant diversity in such cases. These prescriptions contradict guidance for sustainable forestry; however, it is appropriate to vary guidelines according to land-use history and species composition. Our findings confirm the importance of dispersal to species persistence within landscapes comprising successional patch networks.

AB 1. Tropical rainforests are potential reservoirs of insects that could enhance crop pollination, but only a few instances of the provision of such services by tropical rainforest insects have been reported. Our field study aimed to determine the relative importance of such insects to the pollination of macadamia Macadamia integrifolia and longan Dimocarpus longan crops on the Atherton Tableland, north Queensland, Australia.
   2. We quantified initial fruit set, a measure of pollination success, in treatments designed to assess the relative importance of the possible modes of pollination. The treatments were applied in orchards that varied in distance from rainforest, in order to compare the effects of the contrasting pools of available pollen vectors. We also recorded the insect species present and estimated the number of visits each made to flowers in crops near and far from rainforest.
   3. For both crops there was an interaction between pollination treatment and distance from rainforest. Maximum fruit set was only achieved when pollen vectors had access to flowers and orchards were close to rainforest. Exclusion of pollinators near rainforest reduced initial fruit set to a greater extent than exclusion of pollinators far from rainforest.
   4. We confirmed that pollen transfer in macadamia is by autogamous self-pollination and by pollen vectors, but our design did not distinguish among pollen vectors. The only abundant insects in macadamia orchards were honeybees Apis mellifera. There were more honeybee visits to macadamia flowers in orchards near rainforest than far from rainforest, but we detected no relationship between honeybee visits and initial macadamia fruit set in our sample of observations on a per raceme basis. More detailed studies are needed to identify the pollen vector responsible for enhanced pollination of macadamia near rainforest.
   5. We established for the first time that pollen transfer in longan is by a combination of autogamous self-pollination, wind and bees. Longan flowers were visited by stingless bees and honeybees but only stingless bees had a positive relationship with initial longan fruit set and higher visitation rates near rainforest than far from rainforest. This suggests that enhanced pollination in longan near rainforest resulted primarily from a more abundant supply of stingless bees from the rainforest.
   6. Synthesis and applications. By demonstrating that tropical rainforest can act as a reservoir of pollen vectors that benefit crops, our study highlights the existence of a largely unrecognized resource available to agriculture. At the same time our results make a significant contribution to the growing database of studies that underscore the importance of tropical rainforest conservation. Policy and management aimed at sustainable use of this resource would satisfy the goals both of agriculturalists, to improve crop yields, and conservationists, to conserve tropical rainforest.

TI The effect of tapping for frankincense on sexual reproduction in
   Boswellia papyrifera

AB 1. In the Horn of Africa, frankincense (an aromatic hardened wood resin) is obtained by tapping Boswellia papyrifera. World-wide, frankincense is of great economic and social importance as an important element of incense and perfumes. The production is declining as a result of poor natural regeneration of the Boswellia woodlands, possibly as a result of the low production of viable seeds. We hypothesize that this is because of the current intensive tapping regime, which might favour allocation of carbohydrates for synthesis of resin at the expense of allocation for generative growth.
   2. Investigations were carried out at sites in different agro-ecological zones with annually tapped trees and with trees that had not been tapped for several years. Seed viability and germination success were determined for 200 randomly collected seeds in each site. For three stands, the sexual reproduction (number of flowers, fruits and seeds) was determined for different sized trees subjected to three experimental tapping intensities (no, normal and heavy tapping).
   3. At the stand level, non-tapped trees produced three times as many healthy and filled seeds as tapped trees. Germination success was highest in stands with non-tapped trees (> 80%) and lowest for those with tapped trees (< 16%).
   4. At the tree level, sexual reproduction decreased with increasing tapping regime irrespective of tree size. Overall, large trees tended to produce slightly heavier seeds than small trees, and seeds from non-tapped trees were heavier than those from tapped trees. In the stands where tapping was prohibited changes in tapping regimes had the greatest effect on sexual reproduction. Trees subjected to annual tapping always showed the lowest sexual reproduction.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Tapping for frankincense results in limited flower and fruit production, and low production of mainly non-viable seeds in B. papyrifera. We argue that tapping causes competition for carbohydrates between frankincense production, and fruit and seed setting. Consequently, the current tapping regimes will cause tree exhaustion and eventually a decline in vitality. Tapping may potentially reduce natural regeneration of the species. New tapping regimes are suggested that include periods of time in which tapping is prohibited in order for trees to recover and replenish their stored carbon pool, and a reduction in the number of tapping points per tree. This is important in view of the long-term sustainability of frankincense production, an internationally highly valued resource.

AB Current landings of Caspian sturgeon fell from a peak of about 30,000 tonnes in 1977 to about 1,000 tonnes in 2002. Maximum Sustainable Yield ( MSY) of Caspian sturgeon is unknown but may be in the range of about 22,500 t/yr. Total Allowable Catches ( TACs) fell from about 15,000 t/yr in 1992 to = 500 t/yr in 20022004. It is widely believed that Illegal Unreported and Unregulated ( IUU) sturgeon fishing accounts for 90% of real sturgeon landings, but estimates of IUU landings were not included in any TAC assessments. FAO ( 2004) reported that assessments were not transparent. Rough estimates of stock recovery based on 2002-04 landings and a doubling time of about 14 years suggest that, even in the unlikely event of a total moratorium on legal and ( IUU) fishing for about 50 years, stocks could only provide sustainable landings of 4,000 to 8,000 t/yr. Clearly, total recruitment was insufficient to support total effort expended by legal and IUU fishing. In November 1995, after several years of preliminary work and regional consultations, CITES established a ban on international trade in Caspian sturgeon products.
   Accurate biological data on sturgeon exist in most ex-Soviet countries, but cannot be accessed. Available data on mortality and recruitment do not support dynamic pool, VPA, yield per recruit or stock/recruitment models; catch and effort data are available from Iranian waters from 1990, but can presently not support surplus production modelling of important Caspian wide stocks. It is therefore impossible to apply any of the usual assessment methods to Caspian sturgeon stocks. Nevertheless it is clear that these are depleted, face extinction, and require proactive management starting in the immediate future if they are to be conserved. Accessible data and "guesstimates" have been used in an attempt to identify new scenarios and to inform management. A simple bio-economic model based on available information and "guesstimates" about key parameters was used to estimate Recovery Rates ( RR, %MSY/year) needed to provide Internal Rates of Return ( IRR) of 5%-20%. RRs of around 1.0-2.0% MSY/year are needed to support commercially bankable IRRs of = 10% over 25-50 years. The model suggests that a private sector investment of about _ 500,000,000 in restocking, repayable over 50 years, may be feasible. Resulting benefits of such an investment would include from around US 500$ 1.0 Billion/year for the foreseeable future. Private sector funding will become available only when a transparent and well structured institutional architecture is provided for Coastal Zone Management ( CZM) of the fishery, so that IUU fishing can be controlled. Issues not addressed by the model that must also be resolved include rehabilitation of spawning and nursery grounds, pollution control, careful control of genetic problems associated with restocking, access to sufficient brood stock and full implementation of the Caspian Framework Convention and all of its protocols. Challenges and limitations of such a project are discussed.

TI Survey augmentation using commercial vessels in the Mid-Atlantic Bight:
   Sampling density and relative catchability
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED ICHTHYOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID CATCHING EFFICIENCY; CAPTURE EFFICIENCY; TRAWL GEAR; ABUNDANCE
AB A series of side-by-side tows was conducted between a survey vessel and a commercial vessel in two seasons, spring and fall ( autumn), to examine the use of commercial vessels to increase sampling density in trawl-based stock surveys. Both vessels caught more fish offshore in the spring. The commercial vessel caught more fish than the survey vessel in both seasons. Catches of nearly all species were contagiously distributed in the spring. Most were contagiously distributed in the fall; however, somewhat more species were characterized by random or even distributions. The variance-to-mean ratio was consistently higher for most species for commercial vessel catches, regardless of season. As both vessels sampled in the same region at the same time, the increased predilection for the survey vessel to assess the distribution pattern as less patchy than the commercial vessel must accrue from some difference in sampling dynamics rather than variation in species distribution. A simulated decrease in sampling effort from 59 to 30 or 15 hauls increased the variance-to-mean ratio. Reduced sampling effort increased the tendency for occasional large catches to vary the estimate of domain biomass. The sampling program included an onshore-offshore gradient in station density. Domain biomass was considerably underestimated with reduced station density for six species characterized by large catches offshore in that portion of the survey domain characterized by low station density. In this study, a factor of two variation in domain biomass became more likely in 40% of species when sampling effort was reduced to 15 hauls from 59. A factor of two in biomass may distinguish a sustainable. fishery from one in which a species is over. shed. As survey sampling effort in this area was 18 hauls, increasing sample number by inclusion of commercial vessel tows would be advantageous. A regression between paired tows failed to adequately predict catches of one vessel from catches of the other. Standardization of vessel catches by the ratio-of-mean catches provided a more realistic comparison because large catches accounted for a significant fraction of domain biomass; however, a single conversion coefficient between boats could not be used for both sampling periods. The underlying impediment in developing a general conversion factor between the two vessels seems to be rooted in the differential in variance-to-mean ratios of the catches; this differential exists despite sampling of the same distribution of fish.

DE rock art; conservation; heritage tourism; heritage management
AB Rock art conservation has developed hand-in-hand with the increased pace of tourism, yet the two activities tend to remain in opposing camps. Policies and guidelines have been developed for cultural heritage and cultural tourism and there is a widely accepted range of principles in place, but a theory of sustainable rock art tourism is only in its infancy. To mature, the discipline needs research into the interaction of key elements that affect the long-term conservation of frequently visited rock paintings and engravings in their original setting, as well as consideration of social and economic factors that drive tourism and the public interest in rock art.

DE ecohydraulics; hydrodynamics; mussel culture; mathematical model;
   Thermaikos Gulf
AB A preliminary study for the interaction between mussel culture and hydrodynamics is presented. The study was based on the use of a mathematical simulation in combination with field data of weather parameters and recorded extreme biological events related to mussel cultures. More specifically, the application of a mathematical model was realized for the calculation of currents that prevailed in the coastal region of north-west Thermaikos Gulf in July 1998, a period with mass mortality phenomena of mussels. The model runs revealed the correlation of unfavorable phenomena with the wind conditions and the hydrodynamics in the coastal area. The use of such models may contribute effectively to the sustainable management of the mussel cultures in relation to the hydrodynamics and the ecohydraulics of the aquatic environment in which they are settled.

DE corporate social responsibility; sustainability; banking firm; social
   performance
AB Banking firms are becoming increasingly aware that their clients' management of environmental and social risks may in term threaten their own business as lenders and investors. In addition, stakeholders are requiring banks to improve their social performance. As a result, some banks are developing corporate social responsibility (CSR) policies and management systems to reduce potential risks and improve their performance. In the Spanish financial system, half of the banking firms are savings banks, most of which have always used some Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) criteria in their management. Private Banks have only recently started to integrate social aspects in their performance. However, no formal analysis has been carried out on the impact of CSR strategies. Various initiatives have been launched nationally and internationally to include the social dimension in management systems. The purpose of this research is to analyse the social performance of the main Spanish financial companies through public data such as social or sustainability reports and media sources. In order to do this, we need to determine which CSR criteria most greatly affect banking firms and to choose the most accurate quantitative and qualitative indicators to measure social performance.

AB The cottonwood leaf beetle, Chrysomela scripta, is the most damaging insect affecting the production of Populus, an important source of sustainable forest products and biomass. Currently, there is no simple method for monitoring C. scripta populations, and nothing is known about potential chemical attractants for trapping. We conducted laboratory assays on sources of attraction to C. scripta adults. In olfactometer trials, beetles were attracted to volatiles released from conspecifics feeding on foliage. There was also significant, but lesser, attraction to odor from unwounded foliage, C. scripta alone, and frass. The latter two results indicate the presence of a pheromone. Wounding of foliage by C. scripta, but not by artificial means, enhanced its attractiveness compared to unwounded foliage, even when C. scripta by-products were removed. In direct comparisons, responses to odor from beetle-wounded foliage were not different from responses to odor from beetles feeding on foliage. We tested the attractiveness of volatiles emitted by adults feeding on foliage in the field using modified boll weevil traps. Results confirm that these volatiles are sufficient to increase trap catches in the field. Color is also important, with yellow baited traps catching more beetles than black baited. We propose that original landing by C. scripta is mediated by host odors and visual cues and that subsequent aggregation is enhanced by chemical cues associated with feeding by conspecifics. This may partially explain clustering in the field and likewise be incorporated into sampling schemes needed for integrated pest management.

DE environmental sustainability; risk assessment; IUCN redlist
AB Aquaculture is a rapidly growing industry that has the potential to provide significant economic benefit but also to cause substantial environmental harm. In general, monitoring programs have focused at the scale of individual farms and do not address issues associated with off-site or regional scale effects of aquaculture. The establishment of Regional Environmental Sustainability Assessments (RESA's) as a core component of environmental monitoring systems will ensure the ecological sustainability of aquaculture industries. RESA's are underpinned by risk assessments, which aim to identify the major environmental risks, associated with any given farming venture. Environmental risks may include on-site or off-site impacts caused directly by the farming venture but also indirect or flow-on effects to ecosystems. Risk assessments depend upon an assessment of both the likelihood and consequence of given risk events. In particular, assessments of the consequences of environmental impacts need to consider the spatial scale, temporal scale and conservation status of impacted habitats or species. IUCN redlist criteria can be useful in assessing consequences of impacts. Appropriate use of this system will increase confidence for industry, government and the community through the establishment of appropriate sets of operating guidelines for the industry.

SO JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
DE sustainable coastal development; coastal livelihoods; conflict
   resolution
AB This is the third in a series of articles exploring South Africa's new approach to coastal management. Based on a critical analysis of South Africa's coastal policy experience, it presents a generic set of lessons for coastal management. These lessons are grouped into four themes consistent with the main objectives of the policy formulation process: (i) promote meaningful public: participation; (ii) improve knowledge and understanding by promoting scientific integrity; (iii) advance integrated coastal management; and (iv) build a practical foundation. These lessons are presented as strategic imperatives to inform and where appropriate guide future coastal management efforts. Whilst these lessons are directly relevant to future coastal management efforts in South Africa, they are likely to be of more general interest and relevance to those seeking to promote sustainable coastal development. The South African experience reveals, however, that this pursuit is a 'field of struggle' that must be forged across persistent power imbalances, fractured social relationships and strong vested interests.

DE aggregate extraction; data processing; sand banky; bathymetry
AB Exploitation of aggregates from sandbanks off the Belgian coast has been growing over the two last decades. The authorities are now clearly facing the question of the sustainability of that activity. Ten to fifteen years of bathymetric measurements along reference tracks are available today. From those data, time series of volumes above a given reference level are computed and submitted to trend analysis techniques. The analysis indicates that the volume is decreasing (with a high level of confidence) almost everywhere. Estimated volume decrease is then compared to available exploitation data. Despite all the shortcomings of the procedure, the two quantities appear to be close to each others. Exploitation seems however not being the single component of the observed decrease.

AB Based on the thesis project of the Social Scientist Helga Leal (Environmental Science/UFF/2004) that aims to investigate the relation of the coastal population with the strange universe (for that population) of the coastal waters, as well as based on a prior experience of living on aboard a sail boat during two years sailing around the south and east coast of Australia, the project Adventure on the Brazilian Coastal ABC of Diffusion the Coastal Waters Management, is a round-trip expedition along the Brazilian coast, a sailing cruise on board Helga 11, a classic sail boat ketch rigged. The cruise will follow the Brazilian coast line, north and south bound, continuously back-and-fro (during a minimum time frame of five years) and anchoring at approximately 203 locations, building awareness on the coastal waters management, raising environmental education debates, integrating the academic and scientific community's works with the general public, through local outdoor seminars (on each city of anchorage using a specific methodology developed for this project), a literature developed exclusively and frame worked as "I use the sea", "I manage the sea" and/or "I enjoy the sea", and a national campaign called "ecological microprojects". The ABC Adventure on the Brazilian Coastal is supported by Fundacao Universidade de Rio Grande/Museu Occanografico, Marinha do Brasil (Brazilian Navy), PNUMA-Brasil, Ministerio do MeioAmbiente/GERCOM and Forca Aerea Brasileira (Brazilian Air Force); the project funding is to be made by private enterprises and individuals.

DT Article
DE sustainable coastal development; integrated coastal management
AB This is the second in a series of three articles exploring the adoption of a new approach to coastal management in South Africa, perceptions of the coastal policy formulation process, and lessons learned from this experience. South Africa has adopted a new policy that promotes sustainable coastal development through integrated coastal management. Formulated through the Coastal Management Policy Program (CMPP), it represents a 'sea-change' in thinking compared to the earlier autocratic and biophysical approach to coastal management that virtually ignored issues of justice, democracy and poverty. The main objectives of the CMMP were to: (i) Promote meaningful public participation (ii) Foster scientific integrity to improve knowledge and understanding (iii)Advance integrated coastal management, and (iv) Build a practical policy. To what extent were these objectives achieved? Two surveys were conducted to answer this question. The first focused on stakeholders who participated in the CMPP, and the second on CMPP team members who designed and managed the program. The survey results reveal that the CMPP succeeded admirably in achieving each of its main objectives. Overall, 93.4% of stakeholder respondents were 'supportive' or 'very supportive' of the policy proposals, and 77.7% were 'satisfied' or 'very satisfied' with their CMPP experience. CMPP team members reinforced this view. Much, however, remains to be done to secure the necessary political will and build the capacity to move towards the elusive ideal of sustainable coastal development.

AB According to the European Strategy for Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM), approved in May 2002, each state-member needs to define and implement a national strategy for ICZM for the next years. In order to define this strategy it is necessary to evaluate the last 10 years of national policies in the management of the Portuguese coast. The aim of this paper is to provide an assessment of the territorial planning system in Portugal according to the present situation of national policies and the local results of their implementation. The approach is illustrated with the use of the Portuguese Proposal System of Indicators of Sustainable Development from national Directorate-General of the Environment. The paper concludes with a discussion of the application of the indicators and shows the next steps for the Costal Zones Strategies.

AB Seashore inhabitants do not know the environment they live nowadays, ignoring surrounding natural and cultural phenomenon, mainly their limitations knowledge. Technical and scientific formal education using materials ignoring integration between human and his environment does not solve sensibility process to behavior changing relating to sustainability of the ecosystems where he lives in. This time formal education is against human free expression decreasing creative potential and does not search an integration with the environment. Environmental education happens due to educative rules and actions in order to acquire knowledge, attitudes and values which recognize the conservative ideology exposure (BoLOS, 1992). As well artistic expression needs seems to be as biological, universal and durable, as feeding necessities (CAVALCANTI, 1981). The "Sea atelier - program to environment education", has with objective, to provide knowledge and sea coast valuation, through different integrated activities supporting fundamental, medium schools as well as local special education or other distinct groups. The development of the programe have succession of 4 stages: Contacting the Environment, Audiovisual Information, Contact Aquarium and Interpretation Atelier. The Sea atelier allows that all ages and social classes are contemplated and there are cases that elderly people showed artistic gifts that they did not know because of lack of opportunity. The Sea atelier fundaments (living, feelings and creation) revels grate didactic-pedagogy to environment education.

DE tamandare; tourism planning; impact mitigation; ecosystem conservation
AB The municipalization as a government strategy has grown in the last decade in Brazil. As part of this process, the creation of environmental councils has been stimulated by the government as well as multilateral agencies. The city of Tamandare is a coastal municipality located 120 kms south of Recife, the capital of Pernambuco state. The coastal zone of Pernambuco has a high population density and a diversity of ecosystems of great importance for local economy such as mangroves and coral reefs, Tourism is important to local economic and much effort has been put by the government to promote and develop the activity. The existence of three partially overlapped protected areas in this region reflects its importance and need for protection. Also, the fact that two of them are under the sustainable use category, where resource extraction is allowed, indicates potential user conflict and the need for management. The present work relates the experience of the Tamandare Municipal Council of Environment, created in May 1999, focusing in the interactions with the Tourism Development Project for the Northeast. Predicted infrastructure developments included basic water supply and sewage plants as well as roads to allow access to more remote areas. By the year 2000 the road construction had caused impacts to several coastal ecosystems and the Council of Environment decided to launch a civil action through the Public Ministry. The construction was interdicted in the following year and a negotiation process started including mitigation actions, environmental compensation and participation in further planning for the area. The case of Tamandare represents a practical example of participatory management of a coastal area with a high conflict potential and reinforces the importance of community organization and development planning.

   groups; conflicts
AB Fisheries sustainability is one of the major challenges concerning the ocean use rationalization, especially in the coastal zone. The increasing conflicts between users, many different interests on common resources and the failure of traditional policy strategies, create a demand for consultative approaches that could orientate the incorporation of human values into coastal management. A consultative process of local experts perceptions on management issues of Southeastern Brazil coastal fisheries were undertaken between 1999 and 2002. Sardine overfishing and management issues addressed during the survey are here analyzed with the aim to: (1) highlight the factors that a panel of experts believe have the greatest importance towards sustainability, (2) map the discourse and arguments of key social actors within the fishery sector, and (3) provide an understanding of the perception of different interest groups. "Experts" were considered individuals regarded as qualified by their colleagues in a "snow-ball" perspective. Respondents were classified into 4 categories, such as artisanal, industrial, scientists, and government technicians. Topics include management performance, reasons explaining catch decline and overfishing, and sector's myths and perspectives. Each category showed distinct discourse and conceptualization but consensus was identified in several topics. Accordingly to the survey, present regulatory system does not seem to be appropriate to actual needs and do not facilitate communication between actors and decision-making. In the face of stocks declining and fishery diversification, future challenges will include the integration of diverse voices and a new adjustment of institutions, policies and research concerning the management of coastal fisheries ecosystems in practice.

AB There is a world consensus that sustainable development should be embraced by all productive sectors. Shrimp fanning has grown so much in the last 5 years that it has attracted the attention of both national and international environmental groups. A significant environmental impact in socio-economic terms is being witnessed in surrounding communities. At the moment, Brazil is one of the largest producers of marine shrimp in the world making use of technology developed in various countries which has been adapted to local conditions. In Brazil the industry and the government have attempted to create policies to increase productivity while assuring sustainability. The objective of this paper is evaluate the benefits from the application of the Norm NBR ISO 14001 on the productive, administrative and processing sectors of Atlantis Aquacultura, a company which produces marine shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei with emphasis on the setting of objectives and environmental management programmes, The results obtained indicate that the process of adapting to the Notrn were beneficial in economic, environmental, social, and legal aspects. With the Norm the company had also made a commitment for continuous improvement to their environmental system of management. This commitment contemplates a revision of planning to satisfy their environmental policy as well as monitoring, measuring and evaluating their environmental performance, beyond what had been proposed and implement future measures to optimize production sustainably.

AB This paper presents a regional perspective on the barriers and importance of managing the resources in the Caribbean Sea using an integrated approach and how the use of a marine model can help to determine quantitatively, the impacts of present and future development trends on the resources. The Caribbean Sea is a semi-enclosed sea surrounded by a twenty-five island archipelago and other mainland territories. The resources are managed country specific within each territorial jurisdiction, hence resource degradation and concomitant environmental problems continue. This Geographic Information System model proposes to quantify the resource consumption and waste assimilation of a given population in terms of productive marine areas using three Caribbean Small Island States as case studies.

DT Article
DE remote sensing; geoenvironmental monitoring; multitemporal analysis
AB The study area is inserted on the region of Macau in the northern coast of the Rio Grande do Norte State, composed of tertiary and quaternary sediments. This region is characterized by the intense action of coastal processes, causing the morphologic instability in the area beyond the interference of human activities, petroliferous industry, salt companies and the expansion of shrimp farms. This situation justifies the integration of scientific multidisciplinary and multitemporal studies to the evaluation of the changing behavior of this coastal environment. This study of environmental characterization is a basic tool to the identification of areas for protection and recovery, mainly those that suffer huge social-economic intervention. The main goal of this paper is the geoenvironmental monitoring by the analysis of multitemporal images (from years 1989, 2000 and 2001) of georeferencing orbital sensors, from the topographic maps (SUDENE SB-24-X-D-II Macau and SB-24-X-D-III Sao Bento do Norte, both with 1: 100.000 scale) and photos from low altitude aerial surveys. These sensors products had been analyzed by through digital image processing techniques to produce index maps (land use, geology, geomorphology and soil) and environmental vulnerability to the social-economic occupation, aiming to determine sensitive and/or damaged areas. The thematic maps had been produced on 1: 50.000 scale and stored in georeferencing database composed in a GIS, being used as source of consultations in a decision making to the environmental sustainable of the region and on Oil-Spill Environmental Sensitivity Maps of the CoastAreas. The application of these techniques in the area allowed the optimization and/or implantation of social-economic activities causing low environmental impact, avoiding environmental protected areas and benefiting the investors with better productivity and security in areas selection.

SO JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH

DE sustainable coastal development; environmental conflict; consensus
   building
AB Efforts to promote sustainable development are paradoxically degrading the natural systems essential for life on earth. Furthermore, despite these efforts, global poverty and inequality persist. The result is a cruel dilemma that is manifested in pervasive environmental conflict. This dilemma is readily apparent in coasts around the world. Increasing attention is being focused on Integrated Coastal Management as a means to promote coastal sustainability. But the sustainable development dilemma persists. A transformational practice of consensus building is proposed as a solution to this dilemma. Three distinguishing characteristics of environmental conflict are identified and a transformational practice of consensus building is proposed to: (i) promote meaningful public participation through participatory democracy; (ii) advance knowledge and understanding through 'post-normal' science and social learning; and (iii) build collaborative, coevolving institutions and foster a stewardship ethic. The South African coastal management experience is briefly summarized because it reveals the transformational potential of this approach. It demonstrates that conceptualizing coastal management as a transformational practice of consensus building has the potential to resolve coastal conflict and foster coastal sustainability. This article is the first in a series exploring the adoption of this new approach to coastal management in South Africa.

SO JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH

DT Article
DE fishery industry; seafood by-products; corporate social responsibility
AB This document aims to characterize quantitative and qualitatively the organic solid residues produced by the fish processing industry in Itajai and Navegantes cities Santa Catarina State, Brazil. According to 73% of the 22 companies interviewed, the fish processing reaches an average of 60,000 t/year, generating approximately 30,000 t/year of residues. Of these industries, 68% declared that their residues are sent to fish flour industries, 23% of industries sent their residues to the city landfill, and 9% threw their residues directly into the Itajai-Acu river, causing a significant impact on that environment. Such residues could be a rich nutritional source of food for humans and animals, once the average protein content, in dry matter, for the residue and fish flour are high (53.6% and 58.6% respectively), as well lipids (20.1% and 11.1%). Considering that 49% of the analyzed residues was within the limits established to Staphylococcus aureus and 58% to fecal coliforms, there would be a volume between 14,700 and 17,400 tons/year of residues able to be turned into by-products that require good sanitary quality. The purpose of this study was to show the real potential to transform fish residues into by-products, since sanitary quality required was maintained. In this sense, applying industrial rates to 6 seafood categories, global scenaries of residues generation were also predicted. These actions correlated to Corporate Social-Environmental Responsibility Programme, can contribute to the fishing sector and improve the social and environmental quality in coastal areas, implementing fishery sustainability principles and ensuring the Food Security Programs like "Fome Zero", from Brazilian Government.

AB Most economic growth research has been aimed at explaining cross-country differences in average growth rates. However, it is well known that growth experiences differ over time within a country almost as much as they differ among countries. This paper builds on Pritchett's (2000) [Pritchett, Lant, Understanding patterns of economic growth: searching for hills among plateaus, mountains, and plains, World Bank Economic Review, May 2000, 14 (2), 221-250.] observation that the growth process can be thought of as transitions between different growth regimes and proposes a framework for systematic analysis of such regimes and the dynamics of the transitions. I estimate a Markov-switching regression to characterize four distinct growth regimes and transitions between them. The results show that countries switch among regimes of stable growth, "miracle' catch-up, stagnation and crisis with the transition probabilities determined by the quality of institutions. Better institutions appear to improve long-run growth by making episodes of fast growth more persistent. Low average growth rates in countries with weak institutions are a result of these countries spending more time in stagnation regimes rather then being incapable of fast growth at all. Weak institutions do not rule out growth takeoffs but limit their sustainability. The approach directs attention to shifts in growth performance and highlights the fact that identical average growth rates can mask very distinct growth paths. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

ID RESOURCE; INVESTMENT; SUSTAINABILITY; SIMULATION
AB Capital accumulation has been a major issue in fisheries economics over the last two decades, whereby the interaction of the fish and capital stocks were of particular interest. Because bio-economic systems are intrinsically complex, previous efforts in this field have relied on a variety of simplifying assumptions. The model presented here relaxes some of these simplifications. Problems of tractability are surmounted by using the methodology of qualitative differential equations (QDE). The theory of QDEs takes into account that scientific knowledge about particular fisheries is usually limited, and facilitates an analysis of the global dynamics of systems with more than two ordinary differential equations. The model is able to trace the evolution of capital and fish stock in good agreement with observed patterns, and shows that over-capitalization is unavoidable in unregulated fisheries.

AB The banana aphid, Pentalonia nigronervosa Coquerel (Hemiptera: Aphididae), infests banana (Musa spp.) worldwide. Pentalonia nigronervosa is the vector of Banana bunchy top virus (family Nanoviridae, genus Babuvirus) the etiological agent of Banana bunchy top disease (BBTD). BBTD is currently the most serious problem affecting banana in Hawaii. Despite the importance of this vector species, little is known about its biology or ecology. There are also no sampling plans available for P. nigronervosa. We conducted field surveys to develop a sampling plan for this pest. Ten plots were surveyed on seven commercial banana farms on the island of Oahu, HI, for the presence of P. nigronervosa on banana plantlets. We found aphids more frequently near the base of plants, followed by the newest unfurled leaf at the top of the plant. Aphids were least likely to be located on leaves in between the top and bottom of the plant. Aphid infestation on surveyed plots ranged from 8 to 95%. We developed a sequential binomial sampling plan based on our surveys. We also discovered that the within-plant distribution of P. nigronervosa is an important factor to consider when sampling for this pest. Our sampling plan will assist in the development of sustainable management practices for banana production.

TI Sustainability and economics of the advanced high-temperature reactor
SO JOURNAL OF ENERGY ENGINEERING-ASCE
LA English
DT Article
AB The advanced high-temperature reactor is a new reactor concept that combines four technologies in a new way: coated-particle nuclear fuels traditionally used for helium-cooled reactors, Brayton power cycles, passive safety systems and plant designs from liquid-cooled fast reactors, and low-pressure liquid-salt coolants. The new combination of technologies may enable the development of a large high-efficiency, lower-cost high-temperature (700 to 1,000 degrees C) reactor for electricity and hydrogen production. As the peak reactor coolant temperatures approach 700 degrees C, several technologies (Brayton cycles, passive reactor safety systems, available materials, etc.) work together to improve total system performance while significantly reducing costs relative to those for other reactors. A window of performance and lower capital costs exists between these temperatures and the practical temperature limits of materials. The higher temperatures and efficiency of the Brayton power cycle greatly reduce the total heat rejection compared with that achieved in current light-water reactors and may allow economic heat rejection with dry cooling towers, thus radically reducing the water consumption used in energy production. The option for dry cooling is facilitated by the characteristics of Brayton cycles, which reject heat over a temperature range of 40 to 50 degrees C and thus match the requirements of dry cooling systems.

AB Circulating fluidized bed (CFB) boiler has entered electric power industry field because of burning a wide range of fuels, while still achieving strict air emissions requirements. This study focuses on a 300 MW CFB boiler, which will be one of the largest CFB boiler in the world. In a CFB boiler, fuels were burned with the addition of limestone to capture SO2 in a solid form. Therefore, the volume of ashes, both bottom ash and fly ash, discharged from a CFB boiler is much higher than the ashes discharged from a pulverized coal-fired (PC) boiler at the same capacity of the boiler CFB boiler ash cannot be used as a cement replacement in concrete due to its unacceptably high sulfur content. The disposal in landfills has been the most common means of handling ash in circulating fluidized bed boiler power plants. However for a 300 MW CFB boiler power plant, there will be 600,000 tons of ash discharged per year and will result in great volumes and disposal cost of ash byproduct. It was very necessary to solve the utilization of CFB ash and to decrease the disposal cost of CFB ash. The feasible experimental study results on the utilization of the bottom ashes of a 300 MW CFB boiler in Baima power plant in China were reported in this paper The bottom ashes used for test came from the discharged bottom ashes in a 100 MW CFB boiler in which the anthracite and limestone designed for the 300 MW CFB project was burned. The results of this study showed that the bottom ash could be used for cementitious material, road concrete, and road base material. The masonry cements, road concrete with 30 MPa compressive strength and 4.0 MPa flexural strength, and the road base material used for base courses of the expressway, the main road and the minor lane were all prepared with milled CFB bottom ashes in the lab. The better methods of utilization of the bottom ashes were discussed in this paper.

DE ecological impact; grasslands; military training; disturbance
AB Sustainable use of military training lands requires understanding and prediction of the effects of military vehicles on vegetation. We examined the initial impacts of an 8-wheeled, light armored vehicle (LAV) on grassland vegetation at Fort Lewis, Washington. The LAV drove replicate spiral paths at two starting velocities, 10.3 and 5.1 ms(-1). The disturbed width (width of ground impacted by the tires) increased as turning radius decreased, but was unaffected by vehicle velocity. An inverse-exponential model predicted disturbed width (r(2) = 0.68) at all turning radii for both velocities combined. In low-velocity spirals, and for straight tracking (turning radius > 40 in) and moderate turns (radius 20-40 m) in high-velocity spirals, all vegetation damage was imprint (plants flattened by wheels). During sharp (radius < 20 m), high-velocity turns, most or all of the disturbed width was scraped free of surface vegetation and soil, which was piled to the outside of each tire track. Total plant cover (all species) was not affected by track curvature in low-velocity spirals, but decreased in the order straight tracking > moderate turns > sharp turns in high-velocity spirals. In low-velocity spirals, post-tracking cover of several plant growth forms (non-native species, perennial species, sod-forming grasses) was similar to pre-tracking cover, but in high-velocity spirals, post-tracking cover of these growth forms decreased in the order straight >= moderate = sharp. Cover of native species and forbs decreased more in high- than in low-velocity spirals, but was unaffected by curvature. Pre- and post-tracking cover of annual species, bunchgrasses, and shrubs was <= 3%. The most severe vegetation damage caused by operation of wheeled LAVs on grasslands is associated with sharp, high-velocity turns. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A model-based analysis of the effect of prescribed burning and forest thinning or clear-cutting on stand recovery and sustainability was conducted at Fort Benning, GA, in the southeastern USA. Two experiments were performed with the model. In the first experiment, forest recovery from degraded soils was predicted for 100 years with or without prescribed burning. In the second experiment simulations began with 100 years of predicted stand growth, then forest sustainability was predicted for an additional 100 years under different combinations of prescribed burning and forest harvesting. Three levels of fire intensity (low, medium, and high), that corresponded to 17%, 33%, and 50% consumption of the forest floor C stock by fire, were evaluated at 1-, 2-, and 3-year fire return intervals. Relative to the control (no fire), prescribed burning with a 2- or 3-year return interval caused only a small reduction in predicted steady state soil C stocks (<= 25%) and had no effect on steady state tree wood biomass, regardless of fire intensity. Annual high intensity burns did adversely impact forest recovery and sustainability (after harvesting) on less sandy soils, but not on more sandy soils that had greater N availability. Higher intensity and frequency of ground fires increased the chance that tree biomass would not return to pre-harvest levels. Soil N limitation was indicated as the cause of unsustainable forests when prescribed burns were too frequent or too intense to permit stand recovery. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Confronting flood risk: Implications for insurance and risk transfer
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
DE United Kingdom; flood risk management; risk transfer; insurance industry
ID MANAGEMENT; UK
AB The UK floods in late 2000 reinforced an emerging awareness which questioned the long-term sustainability of an exclusive reliance on hard-engineered flood defences to protect the UK population against increased flood risk. The debate has subsequently focused on a broader interpretation of the risks associated with flooding. This paper explores the notion that, although social and technical issues are already being integrated to understand and manage flood, practitioners are now realising the importance of accommodating public hazard understanding and perception of risk into their management models, and there remains a need to fit such ideas to the insurance-based system of flood management in the UK.

TI Sustainability of ground water quality considering land use changes and
   public health risks
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT

DT Article
ID AQUIFER SUSCEPTIBILITY; NITRATE; BASIN
AB One of the major environmental issues of concern to policy-makers is the increased vulnerability of ground water quality (GWQ). Another issue of equal interest is the sustainability of natural resources for future generations. To understand the sustainability of the natural resources such as water in general, one needs to understand the impact of future land use changes on the natural resources. This work proposes a methodology to address sustainability of GWQ considering land use changes, aquifer vulnerability to multiple contaminants, and public health risks. The methodology was demonstrated for the Sumas-Blaine aquifer in Washington State. The land transformation model predicted that nearly 60 percent of the land use practices would change in the Sumas-Blaine Aquifer by the year 2015. The accuracy of the LTM model predictions increased to greater levels as the spatial resolution was decreased. Aquifer vulnerability analysis was performed for major contaminants using the binary logistic regression (LR) method. The LR model, along with the predicted future land use, was used to estimate the future GWQ using two indices-carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic ground water qualities. Sustainability of GWQ was then analyzed using the concept of 'strong' sustainability. The sustainability map of GWQ showed improvements in many areas where urbanization is expected to occur. The positive impact of urbanization on GWQ is an indication of the extensive damage caused by existing agricultural activities in the study area. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Electricity generation from landfill leachate was examined by using both a dual-chamber microbial fuel cell (MFC) and a single chamber MFC. Experimental results showed that the maximum power density of 2060.19 mW/m(3) in the dual-chamber MFC and that of 6817.4 mW/m(3) in the single chamber MFC were obtained. It was recognized that the difference in internal resistance for two MFC systems was the main reason for resulting in the difference of power generation. Power generation as function of chemical oxygen demand (COD) in single chamber MFC showed a Monod-type relationship with P-max of 5920.96 mW/m(3) and K-s of 251.39 mg/L at an external resistance of 500 Omega. Cyclic voltammetry showed that electrons were directly transferred onto the anode by bacteria in biofilms, rather than self-produced mediators of bacteria in the solutions. At low COD concentration, electricity generation was limited by the anode due to kinetic limitation; while at high COD concentration, the cathode was shown to have more significant effects on the electricity generation than the anode. COD in leachate could be removed when it increases, mainly because oxygen diffused from the cathode was substantially reduced by aerobic or anoxic bacteria in the anode chamber, leading to the substrate loss. Removal of ammonium-nitrogen was not observed in the single chamber MFC. This novel technology provides an economical route for electricity energy recovery in leachate treatment.

TI AN INSIDE LOOK AT LEED: EXPERIENCED PRACTITIONERS REVEAL THE INNER
   WORKINGS OF LEED
SO JOURNAL OF GREEN BUILDING
LA English
DT Article
AB LEED is leading the building industry towards a greener future. A clever acronym for Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design, the LEED Rating system is a voluntary, consensus-based, national standard for developing high-performance, sustainable buildings. The U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC), a non-profit organization, developed the LEED Rating System in the late 1990s, and it has quickly grown to be the most recognized green building assessment tool in the United States, While there are over 20,000 LEED Accredited Professionals nationwide, on, a small percent, have worked closely on a LEED project. For this reason, the inner-workings of LEED remain somewhat mysterious.
   This paper seeks to demystify the LEED process by outlining it in a systematic approach. The information herein will serve as a good tool and reference for individual who are, or intend to, work on a project pursuing LEED in the near future.

TI REDUCING THE COST OF GREEN
SO JOURNAL OF GREEN BUILDING
LA English
DT Article
AB There is a general perception that building green will cost more. Here, we want to examine to what extent this is true, what are the factors influencing increased costs, and, perhaps most important, look for ways of controlling these costs. A few studies have tracked the cost of LEED Certified buildings in the last few years, and the general finding as well as the consensus is that a LEED Certified building does not involve significantly more cost, whereas LEED Silver, Gold, and Platinum designations do-the higher the certification achieved, the greater the extra cost. The average additional costs seem to be in the range of 2-5% for Silver, 5-10% for Gold, and 10% or more for Platinum. However, at the individual project level the answer is not quite so simple. Most of us have been involved in, or know of, projects that abandoned the quest for green recognition because of budget restraints. However, as green building becomes increasingly popular, there are numerous ways to achieve the most sustainability while keeping costs within feasible boundaries.

TI DELIVERING GREEN BUILDINGS: PROCESS IMPROVEMENTS FOR SUSTAINABLE
   CONSTRUCTION
SO JOURNAL OF GREEN BUILDING
LA English
DT Article
DE High performance; sustainable building; process; model; improvement
AB The demand for high performance "green" or "sustainable" buildings is rapidly becoming the most significant trend in the building industry. As the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) industry develops the strategies and technologies for these projects, an increased emphasis must be placed on the processes and competencies required to deliver high performance buildings. This paper defines an emerging research and education program at Penn State called the Lean and Green Initiative. Focused on understanding all aspects of the delivery of high performance projects, this program is underpinned by established process-based theories and structured around a systematic methodology designed to minimize waste, maximize value, and reduce cost. Current research and educational activities are described in the paper including nine primary research thrusts and their respective goals. Initial results of each research thrust are also provided, providing an early look at the benefits of a process improvement approach to the delivery of high performance buildings.

TI CONSTRUCTION AND THE ENVIRONMENT: RESEARCH FOCI FOR A SUSTAINABLE FUTURE
SO JOURNAL OF GREEN BUILDING
LA English
DT Article
AB A workshop was sponsored by the National Science Foundation that united many professionals and researchers from both the construction and the environmental fields to outline initial recommendations regarding the interaction of the built environment with the natural environment to develop research foci for a sustainable future. The workshop entitled Construction and the Environment: Research Foci for a Sustainable Future produced a final report identifying three main research focus areas:
   1. Data collection and monitoring of the impact and effectiveness of sustainable construction with the development of ubiquitous sensors and monitoring devices.
   2. Development of improved or novel construction materials with a focus on the full life-cycle of,these materials. Included with this would be a national program for information collection and dissemination.
   3. Development of decision making tools and models. These models should include both sustainable designs incorporating human factors and also model representing the interactions between the natural and built environment. The intention is to develop methods that reduce negative interactions and promote positive ones.
   All these research foci must include a widespread educational component and should embrace substantial collaborative efforts between the social, physical and applied sciences and engineering communities, as well as the construction industry, government agencies and regulatory communities.

TI Early initiation of and exclusive breastfeeding in large-scale
   community-based programmes in Bolivia and Madagascar
SO JOURNAL OF HEALTH POPULATION AND NUTRITION
LA English
DT Article
DE Breastfeeding; infant-feeding practices; community-based studies;
   Bolivia; Madagascar
ID INTERVENTIONS
AB About one-fourth to one-half of all infant deaths in developing countries occur in the first week of life. Immediate breastfeeding within the first hour, followed by early exclusive breastfeeding, improves the health and survival status of newborns. The aim of this study was to demonstrate that breastfeeding practices, crucial to infant health, can be improved at scale in developing countries. During 19992003, the LINKAGES Project, funded by the United States Agency for International Development, implemented its community-based model to bring about rapid change in individual. behaviours and community norms regarding early and exclusive breastfeeding, at a scale [LINKAGES' definition of 'scale' was adapted from a CORE Group background paper on 'Scaling-up' maternal, newborn, and child health services, 11 July 2005] that could achieve significant public-health impact. 'Scale' was defined as bringing improved infant-feeding practices to more people over a wider geographic area, more quickly, more equitably, and with sustainability as a goal. During this time, country-specific programmes were designed and implemented in Bolivia and Madagascar, with catchment populations of one million and six million respectively. These country programmes were implemented with multiple local government, private voluntary organizations, and partners of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) through existing health and nutrition activities. Breastfeeding was an entry point to work at all levels of the healthcare system and, within communities, using policy/advocacy and training for healthcare workers, with a particular emphasis on front-line health workers and community members. Harmonized messages and materials, including mass media, were developed and used by partners. Timely initiation of breastfeeding was one indicator measured. Data collected through rapid assessment surveys showed statistically significant increases (p < 0.001) in timely initiation of breastfeeding in both the countries. In Bolivia, timely initiation of breastfeeding went from 56% in 2000 to 69% in 2001 and reached 74% by the end of 2003. In Madagascar, the initiation rate went from 34% at baseline in 2000 to 69% in 2001, 76% in 2002, and rose to 78% in 2004. Exclusive breastfeeding during the first month of life was also measured. At baseline in Bolivia, the rate of exclusive breastfeeding for the first month of life was 81% (2000), decreased slightly in 200 1, and then increased to 88% by the end of the Project in 2003. In Madagascar, it started high at 86% in 2000, increased during the implementation of the programme, and by 2004, was 91%. These results were achieved quickly and sustained over the course of the intervention.

ID TOOLS
AB Sustainable management of materials and products requires continuous evaluation of numerous complex social, ecological, and economic factors. A number of tools and methods are emerging to support this. One of the most rigorous is life-cycle assessment (LCA), But LCAs often lack a sustainability perspective and bring about difficult trade-offs between specificity and depth, on the one hand, and comprehension and applicability, on the other. This article applies a framework for strategic sustainable development (often referred to as The Natural Step (TNS) framework) based on backcasting from basic principles for sustainability. The aim is to foster a new general approach to the management of materials and products, here termed "strategic life-cycle management." This includes informing the overall analysis with aspects that are relevant to a basic perspective on (1) sustainability, and (2) strategy to arrive at sustainability The resulting overview is expected to help avoid costly assessments of flows and practices that are not critical from a sustainability and/or strategic perspective and to help identify strategic gaps in knowledge or potential problems that need further assessment. Early experience indicates that the approach can complement some existing tools and concepts by informing them from a sustainability perspective-for example, current product development and LCA tools.

ID SCIENCE; CONSERVATION; STRATEGIES; PROTECTION; BIOLOGY
AB As industrial ecology (IE) solidifies conceptually and methodologically, and as it gains visibility and legitimacy in academia, industry and government, it is important that the IE community periodically evaluate the status of its emerging institutional arrangements. At the same time, industrial ecologists should assess the political relations developing between the field and the larger world. We analyze four institutional criteria: professional legitimacy, viable clientele, entrepreneurial acumen, and occupational opportunities, as well as a more controversial fifth measure-political relevance. Drawing a comparison with the field of ecology, we argue that efforts to foster IE institutionally can, ironically, conflict with the objective of seeing IE become "the science and engineering of sustainability" The article concludes by reflecting on the importance of this kind of critical appraisal and on why many observers of the field remain hopeful.

TI The eco-efficiency of lead in China's lead-acid battery system
SO JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL ECOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
DE element flow analysis; environmental impact; lead emissions; lead
   recycling; societal services; substance flow analysis
AB Improving eco-efficiency can contribute to sustainable development. This article defines the societal services and environmental impacts of the lead-acid battery (LAB) system and offers definitions of eco-efficiency, resource efficiency, and environmental efficiency in the context of LAB systems. Based on the actual lead-flow in the LAB system, we develop a model that considers changes in production, the time interval between production and disposal, direct linkages between the final product and the societal service it provides, and the fiscal year as the statistical period. From this model, equations for eco-efficiency are derived and changes in eco-efficiency are predicted.
   The results show, not surprisingly, that increased lead recycling and reduced lead emissions will both improve eco-efficiency. The resource and environmental efficiencies for LAB in China are 1 19 and 13 1 kilowatt-hour-years per metric tonne (kWh (.) yr/t), respectively, versus a value for both of 15,800 kWh (.) yr/t in Sweden. The difference results from a lower lead recycling rate (only 0.312 tonne/tonne, which means that nearly 70% of the old lead scrap is not recycled based on official statistics) and higher lead emissions (0.324 tonne/tonne, which means that nearly 33% of the lead inputs used in the LAB system were lost into the environment) in China. Further analysis shows that these problems result from inefficient management of lead scrap, poor quality lead ore, and an abundance of small-scale lead-related plants. Ways to improve eco-efficiency are proposed.

TI Ecological footprint analysis applied to mobile phones
SO JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL ECOLOGY

DE bioproductive area; electronic products; environmental indicator;
   industrial ecology; information and communications technology (ICT);
   natural capital accounting
AB Ecological footprints (EF) have been used for more than 15 yr as an aggregate measure of sustainability of geographical regions, but also for certain products and activities. EF analysis measures the bioproductive areas required to produce resources such as crops and timber, the directly occupied areas for infrastructure, and areas for absorbing waste flows (mostly limited to carbon dioxide) in a given year for a defined population. The need to extend ecological footprint analysis to electronic products arose because so far, mobile phones have mainly been evaluated using life-cycle assessments with a focus on toxicity, end-of-life management, and energy use, thus ignoring the wider sustainability implications. This article presents the footprint results from three mobile phone case studies. To establish the land areas consumed by the mined materials used in electronic products, a database was developed based on literature data and on approximations from the density and overburden of materials. The relationship between abundance and overburden values was used in a regression analysis to estimate energy requirements in materials extraction where other data were not available. Using a life-cycle assessment approach, environmental burdens for producing and using a mobile phone were calculated and transformed into the instantaneous rate of resource consumption. Key results were that different electronic products have different ecological footprints and that the methodology proved sensitive enough to reveal differences in small electronic products and for monitoring technologies that use bioproductive space efficiently.

DE by-product synergy; cascading; cogeneration; industrial ecosystem;
   recycling; water reuse
ID ECOLOGY
AB As a subdiscipline of industrial ecology, industrial symbiosis is concerned with resource optimization among colocated companies. The industrial symbiosis complex in Kalundborg, Denmark is the seminal example of industrial symbiosis in the industrial ecology literature. In spite of this, there has been no in-depth quantitative analysis enabling more comprehensive understanding of economic and environmental performances connected to this case. In this article some of the central industrial symbiotic exchanges, involving water and steam, in Kalundborg are analyzed, using detailed economic and environmental data. It is found that both substantial and minor environmental benefits accrue from these industrial symbiosis exchanges and that economic motivation often is connected to upstream or downstream operational performance and not directly associated with the value of the exchanged by product or waste itself. It is concluded that industrial symbiosis, as viewed from a company perspective, has to be understood both in terms of individual economic and environmental performance, and as a more collective approach to industrial sustainability.

AB Collaboration and community partnership have become buzzwords in academic settings, which have received little direction regarding how to make these efforts successful and sustainable. This study attempted to discern the factors involved in setting up one successful community-campus partnership. Four years after opening an all-volunteer free health clinic in Laramie, Wyoming, we interviewed community members and university faculty who were involved in the initial partnership. Analysis of these interviews identified several dynamic tensions that kept the group together and moving toward its goal.

AB This review highlights interventions and delivery mechanisms to alleviate macro- and micronutrient deficiencies in preschool children. These deficiencies can be addressed through an integrated combination of improved dietary intake, supplementation, commercial and home-based fortification of complementary foods. Several developed and developing countries have implemented successful approaches to eliminate protein-energy malnutrition and micronutrient deficiencies with sustained impact. These include provision of oral Supplements in capsule, tablet or syrup form. Certain micronutrients (eg, vitamin A) can be provided as high-dose supplements twice per year. Most other vitamins and minerals (eg, iron, zinc, iodine) need to be provided in daily doses. Fortified complementary foods provided through public feeding programmes and commercially marketed foods have also made a positive impact. There is growing evidence of the impact of home-based fortification of complementary foods using premixes in single-serving sachets. The fortification of commercially marketed staple foods such as cereal flours, cooking oils and dairy products could have a small but significant impact on preschool children. Cereal flours with iron, folic acid and other nutrients have expanded rapidly, with evidence of impact. A key need is to deliver micronutrients to remote and impoverished populations in an affordable and sustainable manner. Government commitment, clear policy and programme direction, advocacy and communication combined with a strong public-private partnership is essential for Successful programmes. Often a period of voluntary fortification needs to be followed by mandatory requirement to ensure full compliance and sustained impact. The review concludes that proven technologies, communications and infrastructure can be harnessed to ensure that the nutrient needs of preschool children are met. When administered systematically with the commitment of and participation by the public and private sectors, most of the major deficiencies can be bridged on a sustained basis, contributing to improved health and well-being of millions of children around the world.

AB Introduction: It has been shown that the length of an intestinal segment may be doubled by applying gradual mechanical stretching. This study evaluated whether the lengthened intestinal segment retained the structure and function after the stretching device was removed.
   Methods: A 1.5-cm jejunal segment was separated from intestinal continuity in 20 rats. After advancing a screw into the isolated jejunal segment by 5 mm 3 times a week until it was stretched by 3 cm, the screw was removed. Three weeks later, the jejunal segments were retrieved for analyses. Comparisons were made between the lengthened jejunal segments.
   Results: The jejunal segment doubled its length after gradual stretching and retained this length 3 weeks after the screw removal (3.1 +/- 0.8 vs 3.2 +/- 0.4 cm, P >.05). The villous height, the muscular thickness, and the total alkaline phosphatase and lactase activities of the stretched jejunal segments were also unchanged 3 weeks after the screw removal.
   Conclusions: Mechanical force induced the sustained lengthening of isolated jejunal segments in rats. The histologic and enzymatic alterations also persisted 3 weeks after the mechanical force was removed. This phenomenon may provide a novel method for the treatment of short bowel syndrome.

AB g Current of food-systems research A strong holds that local food systems are preferable to systems at larger scales. Many assume that eating local food is more ecologically sustainable and socially just. We term this the local trap and argue strongly against it. We draw on current scale theory in political and economic geography to argue that local food systems are no more likely to be sustainable or just than systems at other scales. The theory argues that scale is socially produced: scales (and their interrelations) are not independent entities with inherent qualities but strategies pursued by social actors with a particular agenda. It is the content of that agenda, not the scales themselves, that produces outcomes such as sustainability or justice. As planners move increasingly into food-systems research, we argue it is critical to avoid the local trap. The article's theoretical approach to scale offers one way to do so.

AB Ecological soil functions are protected in Germany. Thus, for the sustainable use of urban soil resources data on the function of soils to serve as a habitat are required. Soil microbial biomass and activities were studied in two surface horizons in two consecutive years at nine sites in Stuttgart, Germany, differing in land use. Microbial biomass (chloroform-fumigation extraction, substrate-induced respiration) and microbial activities (potential N mineralization, potential ammonium oxidation, and enzyme activities of dehydrogenase, urease, arylsulfatase, and phosphatase) were determined in 2001 and 2002. DIN/ISO standard methods were applied as far as they were available. Furthermore, soil chemical properties were determined in the 2001-samples. Large differences in chemical and microbiological properties among surface horizons were found. Concentrations of microbial biomass and microbial activities were, however, often comparable to agricultural or forest surface soils. The lowest microbial biomass and activities were observed at a highly disturbed railway area where vegetation was missing and total organic C (TOC) had been altered by anthropogenic organic particles. In contrast, microorganisms were promoted at vegetated sites and where organic impurities were negligible. As TOC was altered by obscure organic matter, total N (TN) and not TOC closely correlated with soil microbiological properties. Biomass and activity generally decreased with depth, but mixing of organic matter resulted in more uniform depth distribution of microbial properties in one garden soil. In 2002, microbial biomass and activity were often lower compared to 2001, but interpretation of this difference hampered as the number of samples taken was probably not sufficient to address the spatial variability in soil properties. Additional studies are needed to develop simple and cost-effective procedures for the evaluation of ecological quality of urban soils by combined efforts of city planners and soil scientists.

AB In cowpea, efficient N-2-fixing genotypes are being selected to promote sustainable cropping systems in southern Cameroon (SC). However, N-2 fixation and growth of these genotypes are largely hampered by low levels of soil plant-available P. To evaluate the genotypic variation in N2 fixation and P uptake among cowpea (Vigna unguiculata L.) genotypes, field experiments were conducted over two years on two acid soils low in available P. The experiments were laid out in a split-block design with four replications on typic (TK) and rhodic (RK) Kandiudult soils with seven cowpea genotypes. Phosphorus (P) fertilizers were applied on the main plots with 0 kg P, 30 kg P ha(-1) as triple superphosphate (TSP) and 90 kg P ha(-1) as Togo phosphate rock (PR). Nodule dry matter (DM), shoot DM, grain yield, and P uptake of cowpea significantly varied with site, P application, and genotype (p < 0.05). The N2 fixation of the cowpea genotypes ranged from 29 to 51 kg N ha(-1) on both TK and RK soils and was significantly increased with P application. Significant genotypic variations in N-2 fixation were observed with superior ability of the genotypes IT89KD-391 and IT90K-59 to fix N-2. The harvest index (HI) did not significantly differ between soils and P application levels (p > 0.05). Four genotypes were selected to investigate root mechanisms responsible for efficient P acquisition in pot experiments. The results suggest that a better root infection by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) in genotype IT90K-59 and root morphological and physiological characteristics in IT89KD-391 were the most important factors for increasing P uptake.

AB The rising cost of healthcare causes many injustices, and is not sustainable. Cost inflation is partly caused by the nature of medicine. When doctors save lives, the lives we save are usually people with chronic illnesses. Decreases in the mortality rate often lead to increases in the prevalence rate of chronic diseases and duration of chronic diseases, which are expensive to treat. As a result of advances in medical sciences, more and more people live with chronic illnesses, and therefore healthcare costs are rising. This is consistent with the conclusion that the more money a society like the USA spends on medical care, the more expensive medical care becomes. This is the dark side of medicine, which counterbalances the well-known breakthroughs of medical science. Spiritual people seek a balanced view of health that includes both viewpoints.

AB Drawing on the resource-based view of the firm, this study addresses the dynamic capability-generating capacity of market orientation on firm performance. Whereas prior literature has examined environmental turbulence as a contextual condition shaping the market orientation-firm performance relationship, this study takes an internal approach by focusing on existing stocks of resources within the firm while controlling for environmental conditions. A conceptual model is developed that explains how market orientation can be transformed into dynamic capability when complemented by transformational (reconfigurational) constructs, such as innovativeness. The empirical results support the authors' theory that the effect of market orientation on firm performance is strengthened when market orientation is bundled together with internal complementary resources, such as innovativeness. The authors discuss the findings in the context of varying stages of the product life cycle and at different levels of market development.

TI From congestion to sprawl - Planning and health in historical context
SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN PLANNING ASSOCIATION
LA English
DT Article
AB Why haven't planners and public health professionals worked together consistently throughout the last century? This article puts their relationship in historical perspective, arguing that while the fields have always been connected, the bond has been stronger when upheld by converging theories and commonly perceived problems. Under such a conceptual umbrella, the two fields can collaborate. In this article, I address whether the concept of sprawl is rich enough to foster sustainable, long term connections between the fields.

AB Health disparities that affect whole communities may involve factors like housing quality that lie at least partly within planners' realm of policy influence. This article demonstrates a link between housing and childhood asthma. The magnitude of the childhood asthma epidemic in Harlem in New York City and the commitment of engaged community partners led to an interdisciplinary, participatory, and multifaceted approach to the planning, implementation, and evaluation of the Harlem Children's Zone Asthma Initiative. Here we present the first year's data on environmental triggers in the homes of program participants, showing that intensive, community-based programs can reduce both home environmental triggers and adverse childhood asthma outcomes. This provides an ex ample of a community-wide public health intervention that informs public policy and planning, and may provide a sustainable model for reducing childhood asthma in impoverished communities.

AB Recognition is growing that fisheries must be both ecologically and commercially sustainable. The bioeconomic models proposed herein constitute an analytic framework capable of integrating the ethics and societal values associated with fisheries preservation. Specifically, we focus on the normalized optimal (equilibrium) fish population, z*, a dimensionless variable representing biomass as a proportion of environmental capacity. We model z* as a function of (a) the dimensionless "bionomic growth ratio", gamma, which is the ratio of the discount rate to the intrinsic population growth rate, and (b) the preservation coefficient, Q, which is the ratio of the preservation value (a measure of society's value for the stock) to price, assuming that the population growth rate and intrinsic growth rate are fixed. It is shown that increasing Q significantly impacts z*, particularly for moderate values of gamma (2 <= gamma <= 4). Finally, stochastic population models are used to analyze the risk of a fish stock collapse due to harvesting pressures. The bioeconomic models and simulations herein described improve the accuracy and reliability of maximum sustainable yield management.

AB A systematic technique is proposed for assisting in the design and implementation of policy and addressing the need to minimize or resolve disputes that may arise in the enforcement of regulations. The Graph Model for Conflict Resolution is a methodology that facilitates the modeling and analysis of interactive multiple participant-multiple objective decision problems. In the problems considered here, decision makers and policy planners engaged in capacity building typically have different viewpoints over appropriate ways of developing options and enforcing policy choices. Incompatible understandings of resource potentials and limits, and disparities in utilization of these resources, exasperate stakeholders and make the capacity building process counterproductive and even conducive to conflict. A systematic conflict resolution technique is invaluable to policy makers and practitioners in defusing confrontations and reaching out for consensus among participants. In support of current approaches to policy planning and regulation, the Graph Model provides accurate predictions and strategic insights into short- and long-term opportunities in multiple participant-multiple objective decision situations. A conflict among the government of Canada, the Mi'kmaq First Nation, and commercial fishermen over the sharing of a natural resource in New Brunswick, Canada, is used to illustrate the advantages of this technique in practical problems.

ID SPECIATION
AB Species of the genus Mecyclothorax Sharp, 1903 from the island of Molokai, Hawaii are taxonomically revised. The Molokai fauna constitutes 43 recognized species, 24 newly described: M. polhemusi, new species; M. dunbarorum, new species; M. impunetatus, new species; M. debiliceps, new species; M. convexus, new species; M. subsinuatus, new species; M. subater, new species; M. trisetifer, new species; M. annae, new species; M. joni, new species; M. lisae, new species; M. lissopterus, new species; M. arcuatus, new species; M. latus, new species; M. abax, new species, M. ewingi, new species; M. latissimus, new species; M. punctatostriatus, new species; M. flavolateralis, new species; M. obscurus, new species; M. comma, new species; M. stenolophinus, new species; M. granulatus, new species; and M. cymindoides, new species. Mecyclothorax quadratus Britton is newly synonymized with M. argutor (Sharp). Various species are congruently distributed on Kamakou Volcano, allowing recognition of two areas of endemism, one to the west encompassing Kamakou and Olokui peaks, the second to the east spanning the areas from Wailau and Puu Lua to Puu Ohelo and Kainalu Gulch. Representatives of several hypothesized species pairs mutually occupy the two areas of endemism adding rigor to definition of the areas. Whereas the western Kamakou-Olokui area of endemism encompasses the State of Hawaii's Pun Alii and Olokui Natural Area Reserves and the Kamakou Preserve of The Nature Conservancy of Hawaii, the eastern Wailau-Puu Ohelo area of endemism is not comprehensively managed for conservation. Twelve of the 14 species residing in the eastern area of endemism are newly described, indicating the preliminary state of knowledge regarding the fauna of this area. Of those 12 new species, 9 are geographically restricted to the eastern area. This level of endemic richness is proposed as a criterion that justifies establishment of a comprehensive conservation plan for eastern Molokai, thereby ensuring sustainability of its distinct native forest communities. Two of the species, M. lissopterus and M. arcuatus, are cryptic sibling species, diagnosable only by configurations of the male aedeagal median lobe and female bursa copulatrix. The magnitude of the male median lobe in the two species is positively associated with size of the bursa copulatrix in females of the two species. Acdeagal and bursal Configurations do not vary infraspecifically. Available evidence points most parsimoniously to origin of derived states in one of these species via developmental changes in genitalic anlagen common to the sexes, differentially expressed in males and females. Such a mechanism assumes homologous transformation of the male aedeagal median lobe and female bursa copulatrix, and removes the need to invoke more complicated hypotheses involving sexual selection.

TI Economic analysis of Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) production in
   Tanzania
SO JOURNAL OF THE WORLD AQUACULTURE SOCIETY
LA English
DT Article
AB In Tanzania, Nile tilapia culture is a promising aquaculture enterprise. Information on production costs could assist fish farmers in economic and financial planning. Economic profitability of small-scale Nile tilapia production in Tanzania is analyzed using a model that simulates individual fish growth and takes into account fish population dynamics in the pond. The results suggest that the current practiced mixed-sex tilapia culture without predation is not economically sustainable. Extension efforts should be geared toward developing a Nile tilapia production system that is based on a hand-sexed all-male tilapia. Meanwhile catfish can be introduced in ponds to control overcrowding in mixed-sex tilapia culture without predation. Studies to determine optimal pond sizes, availability of feed, and a quality fingerling supply chain are also fundamental for developing a sustainable Nile tilapia production system in Tanzania. Under improved Nile tilapia production systems, returns are high enough to justify investment through borrowed capital from formal institutions.

AB Roads and traffic have a multitude of impacts on wildlife populations. Wildlife existing within the confines of fragmented reserves are particularly susceptible to fatalities on roads, especially those situated within urban and semirural matrices. The sustainability of many wildlife populations within reserve fragments are tenuous as roads further subdivide reserved areas and increase the frequency of animal-vehicle contact. Although many studies have assessed the quantity and diversity of fatalities from collisions, few studies have examined the long-term viability of wildlife populations living adjacent to roads. We chose to examine the effects of disturbances, including fatalities on roads, on a population of swamp wallabies (Wallabia bicolor) within the Royal National Park on the urban fringe of Sydney, Australia. Despite having an extensive range, researchers suspect that many local populations of this sole member of Wallabia are in decline. We used a combination of population modeling and sensitivity analysis to assess the impact of disturbances on the population. Under current conditions, the forecast of the population was to decline over the next 100 years with the possibility of becoming extinct. We found that female reproduction and breeding were most influential on the population model. Of the range of management options investigated, by far the most rewarding was the reduction of fatalities on roads, as only a 20% decrease in female fatalities on roads has the potential to reverse the current decline and represents the best option for maintaining long-term viability. We suggest that documentation and subsequent management of road impacts, within the context of other threats, is essential to the conservation of similar species in road-affected environments.

   environmental attributes and shellfish aquaculture
SO JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT

AB Shellfish aquaculture is an expanding industry in coastal British Columbia, Canada, and occurs in important wintering areas for surf scoters (Melanitta perspicillata) and white-winged scoters (M. fusca). We quantified habitat use by scoters in relation to natural environmental attributes and habitat modifications associated with shellfish aquaculture. We found that, despite the extensive clam and oyster farming in our study area, densities of wintering surf scoters and white-winged scoters were related primarily to natural environmental attributes, particularly intertidal area, clam density, and sediment type; shellfish aquaculture variables were generally poor predictors of bird densities. We conclude that current levels and forms of shellfish aquaculture in our study site were not an important determinant of scoter distribution and abundance, suggesting that winter scoter populations and the shellfish aquaculture industry may be mutually sustainable. We caution that intensification or further industrialization of shellfish aquaculture in British Columbia could eventually lead to detrimental effects if some threshold level of habitat modification is exceeded.

DT Article
DE inverse manufacturing; reuse; lifecycle; life-time; module; damage model
AB As environmental issues have become serious, the inverse manufacturing concept is discussed to establish a sustainable society. To realize the inverse manufacturing system the prime problem is how to improve the rate of reusing the product modules. Therefore analyzing the life-time of the disassembled modules is very important before reassembling process. In this paper, a cumulative damage model is proposed to discuss the quality of the product that is assembled by reuse modules. It is supposed that modules suffer damages due to shocks and fails when the cumulative damage level exceeds the failure level. Then maintenance cost will be analyzed in order to minimize the expected maintenance cost-rate by optimal maintenance time T and optimal number of damages N in this cumulative damage model. The probable safe life-time of module reuse will be explored. Finally numerical examples are given to confirm the validity of the proposed model.

TI Trauma interventions and systems change in rural areas: The role of the
   juvenile court judge in collaboration with mental health professionals
SO JUVENILE AND FAMILY COURT JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
AB This article will focus on the evolution of the collaborative work of the Louisiana Rural Trauma Services Center (LRTSC), a Center within the National Child Traumatic Stress Network, and the 23rd Judicial District, a jurisdiction in south Louisiana serving three rural parishes. We will describe how the collaboration and joint efforts, and the changes that have been made in terms of availability of evaluation and treatment resources, seem to be influencing both the educational and judicial systems in St. James Parish and potential sustainability of some of the identified resources. The article will examine how the court and the LRTSC work together with emphasis on the evaluation, reporting and recommendation processes, outcomes and benefits to date, and challenges for the future.

AB The cellulose-based, Electroactive Paper (EAPap) has recently been reported as a smart material with the advantages of lightweight, dry condition, biodegradability, sustainability, large displacement output and low actuation voltage. However, it requires high humidity. This paper introduces an EAPap made with a cellulose solution and lithium chloride (LiCl), which can be actuated in room humidity condition. The fabrication process, performance test and effect of LiCl content of the EAPap actuator are illustrated. The bending displacement of the EAPap actuators was evaluated with actuation voltage, frequency, humidity and LiCl content changes. At a LiCl/ cellulose content of 3:10, the displacement output was maximized at a room humidity condition. Even though the displacement output was less than that of a high humidity EAPap actuator, the mechanical power output was not reduced due to the increased resonance frequency, which is promising for developing EAPap actuators that are less sensitive to humidity.

ID CAROLINA; MANDATES; FLORIDA
AB The concentration of people and infrastructure along the nation's coastline has increased our vulnerability to severe coastal storms and other natural hazards, as evidenced by the substantial social, economic and environmental impacts,of recent hurricanes. Competing policy objectives and stakeholder interests pose,challenges to planners' and public officials' attempts to increase resilience using land development-based approaches. This paper describes theses issues for researchers outside the urban and regional planning discipline. It presents the typical approaches to hazard mitigation and the primary land-use tools used to manage coastal development. It strives to inspire interdisciplinary visioning of sustainable coastal development patterns needed to advance resiliency.

AB In 74 women with polycystic ovary syndrome, treated for 4 years with metformin (MET) and diet, we prospectively assessed whether, and to what degree, weight loss, reduction of insulin resistance, and amelioration of coronary heart disease risk factors could be sustained. We hypothesized that response to MET-diet would not differ by pretreatment body mass index (BMI) classes < 25 (normal), >= 25 to < 30 (overweight), >= 30 to < 40 (obese), and >= 40 (extremely obese).
   [GRAPHICS]
   Metformin-diet was successful in producing stable similar to 8% weight reduction for all 4 years (trend P < .0001). Percentage of reductions in weight on MET-diet was significant (P < .05) and did not differ among the 3 highest BMI categories (>= 40, >= 30 to < 40, >= 25 to < 30), but were not significant in the normal-weight category (BMI, < 25). On MET-diet, median homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) was 33% lower than entry at 1 year, 50% at 2 years, 51% at 3 years, and 50% at 4 years (trend, P < .0001). On MET-diet, median low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) was 6% lower than entry at year 1, 6% at year 2, 7% at year 3, and 11% at year 4 (trend P < .0001). On MET-diet, median high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) was 3% higher than entry at year 2, 8% higher at year 3, and 11% higher at year 4 (trend P < .0001). Percentage of reductions in HOMA-IR, LDL-C, triglyceride, and systolic blood pressure, and increments in HDL-C did not differ (P > .1) in the 4 BMI categories. By stepwise regression, weight loss was a significant (P <= .01) positive explanatory variable for reduction in HOMA-IR for all 4 follow-up years. Metformin-diet in women with polycystic ovary syndrome effectively and safely reduces weight and LDL-C while raising HDL-C, and maintains these outcomes stable over 4 years. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

AB Objective: to explore reasons for enrolment in the first bachelor of midwifery programme in Jordan, and to describe midwifery students' evaluations of the programme.
   Design: a cross-sectional survey design.
   Setting: The Faculty of Nursing at Jordan University of Science and Technology, Irbid, Jordan.
   Participants: 16 diploma-prepared midwifery students enrolled in the 2-year bachelor-completion programme.
   Measurements and Findings: an open-ended question explored students' reasons for enrolling in the midwifery programme. For programme evaluation, a 13-item Midwifery Programme Evaluation Questionnaire (MPEQ) was developed and used. Total score ranged from 39-61, with a mean of 51.2 (SD = 6.7).
   Conclusion: midwifery students reported five reasons for enrolling in the midwifery programme, which was favourably evaluated. Implications for practice: encouragement and sustainability of student enrolment in the JUST Bachelor of Midwifery programme are recommended to improve midwifery education and enhance midwifery as a profession.

TI Access to electricity as a human right
SO NETHERLANDS QUARTERLY OF HUMAN RIGHTS
LA English
DT Article
AB This article reviews existing and emergent international human rights law and general international law to identify an individual interest in accessing electricity. The analysis includes the reports of States parties submitted pursuant to several human rights instruments, the opinions of their monitoring Committees, the decisions of national courts and international tribunals, the views of several UN Special Rapporteurs, national legal frameworks and the energy programmes of several States. The emergence of a human right to access electricity under international law is corroborated by the requirements of international humanitarian law, policy trends within the sustainable development agenda and contemporary regulatory efforts to extend electricity services to vulnerable social groups. An authoritative judicial or intergovernmental pronouncement formally recognising this right as an independent one would be timely and appropriate. The paper concludes by suggesting the contours of the right to access electricity and outlining the possible roles and responsibilities of primary actors.

AB OBJECTIVE: Medically refractory cluster headache (CH) is a debilitating condition for which few surgical modalities have proven effective. Previous reports involving short-term follow-up of CH patients have reported modest degrees of pain relief after radiosurgery of the trigeminal nerve ipsilateral to symptom onset. With the recent success of deep brain stimulation as a surgical modality for these patients, it becomes imperative for the long-term risks and benefits of radiosurgery to be more extensively delineated. To address this issue, we present our findings from the largest retrospective series of patients undergoing radiosurgery for CH with extended follow-up periods.
   METHODS: Between 1997 and 2001, 10 patients with CH underwent gamma knife radio-surgery at our institution. All patients fulfilled clinical criteria for treatment, including complete resistance to pharmacotherapy (usually methysergide, verapamil, and lithium), pain primarily localized to the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve, and psychological stability. The mean age at radiosurgery was 40.3 years (range, 26-62 yr), and the average CH duration was 11.3 years (range, 2-21 yr). Patients received 75 Gy to the 100% isodose line delivered to the most proximal part of the trigeminal nerve where the 50% isodose line was outside the brainstem (4-mm collimator), with a mean follow-up period of 39.7 months (range, 5-88 mo). Pain relief was defined as excellent (free of CH with minimal or no medications), good (50% reduction of CH severity and frequency with medications), fair (25% reduction of CH severity and frequency with medications), or poor (less than 25% reduction of CH severity and frequency with medications).
   RESULTS: After radiosurgery, pain relief was poor in nine patients and fair in one patient. Six patients with poor to fair relief initially experienced excellent to good relief (range, 2 wk-2 yr after treatment) before regressing. Five patients (50%) experienced trigeminal nerve dysfunction, manifesting predominantly as facial numbness after treatment.
   CONCLUSION: Although some patients may experience short-term pain relief, none had relief sustainable for longer than 2 years. The results from this series indicate that radiosurgery of the trigerninal nerve does not provide long-term pain relief for medically refractory CH.

AB This paper describes how a new framework for clinical nursing education was introduced at Counties Manukau District Health Board (CMDHB), New Zealand. The project was initiated in response to the significant legislative and post registration nursing education changes within New Zealand. The journey of change has been a significant undertaking, and has required clear management, strong leadership, perseverance and understanding of the organisation's culture.
   The approach taken to managing the change had four stages, and reflects various change management models. The first stage, the identification process, identified the impetus for change. Creating the vision is the second stage and identified what the change would took like within the organisation. To ensure success and to guide the process of change a realistic and sustainable vision was developed. Implementing the vision was the third stage, and discusses the communication and pilot phase of implementing the nursing education framework. Stage four, embedding the vision, explores the process and experiences of changing an education culture and embedding the vision into an organisation. The paper concludes by discussing the importance of implementing robust, consistent, strategic and collaborative processes - that reflect and evaluate best educational nursing practice.

   SURVIVAL; DISPERSAL; BIRD; DETERMINANTS; RECRUITMENT; RATES
AB The understanding of how variation of demographic rates translates into variation of population growth is a central aim in population ecology. Besides stochastic and deterministic factors, the spatial extent and the isolation of a local population may have an impact on the contribution of the different demographic components. Using long-term demographic data we performed retrospective population analyses of four little owl (Athene noctua) populations with differential spatial extent and degree of isolation to assess the contribution of demographic rates to the variation of the growth rate (lambda) of each local population and to the difference of lambda among populations. In all populations variation of fecundity contributed least to variation of lambda, and variation of adult survival contributed most to variation of lambda in three of four populations. Between population comparisons revealed that differences mainly stem from differences of immigration and juvenile local survival. The relative importance of immigration to lambda tended to decrease with increasing spatial extent and isolation of the local populations. None of the four local populations was self-sustainable. Because the local populations export and import individuals, they can be considered as open recruitment systems in which part of the recruited breeding birds are not produced locally. The spatial extent and the degree of isolation of a local population have an impact on local population dynamics; hence these factors need to be considered in studies about local population dynamics and for deriving conservation measures.

DE home based economic activities; social networks; traditional spaces
AB Traditional environments consist not only of physical buildings and spaces but also the people and their activities which take place within them. This paper examines some aspects of the interrelationship between people and places. Traditional social values ore believed to be undermined by the harsh imperatives Of survival in the expanding urban areas of the developing world. The collaborative nature of many rural societies con be contrasted with the hard, individualistic and competitive character of life in developing cities. Unregulated, urban, economic processes in particular are assumed to be antagonistic towards gemeinschaft ideals because the logic of the market has little respect for nonmonetary values.
   However one of the key characteristics of many informal economies is the ability of participants to draw creatively and flexibly on all potential resources: human, material and spatial. This is particularly evident in households and settlements where 0 significant proportion of the economic activity is within micro scale, home-based enterprises (HBEs). By blurring and re-configuring the spatial and conceptual boundaries between work and home, between production and reproduction, many households are able to generate income to sustain themselves. Intrinsic to these processes ore the linkages and exchanges between neighbours and residents, many-of which ore based on cultural and religious value systems which con be supportive of the economic activities taking place.
   This paper will explore aspects of the interrelationship between economic and social processes through the use of empirical data collected during periods of participant observation in a consolidated informal urban settlement (kampung) in the city of Surabaya, Indonesia. Detailed household case studies will be used to illustrate how income generation activities are embedded within social networks and how in many cases traditional collaborative cultural values directly reinforce economic production. This is echoed in the use of space, particularly the overlapping and shared use of streets and alleyways. The paper concludes that despite severe economic constraints many traditional values facilitate survival in times of crisis and con be conducive to longer term sustainability.

AB In this article, the authors analyze some of the developments and weaknesses in organizational environmental studies and make an effort to evaluate the fields current status, role, and future prospects. During recent years, the field of management and organizational studies has witnessed environmental research gaining a secure foothold, especially in quantitative terms. It is questionable, however whether it is actually organizational environmental studies that has arrived or whether the discourse is in fact only a minor annex or a slight modification of the same old themes in management and organizational studies. This is because of the fact that it is still too early to say that organizations and natural-environment-related research would have been able to develop its own theory base and legitimate posture in relation to the management and organizational studies.

AB Organizations and environment (O&E) researchers focus on either organizational outcomes or environmental outcomes. In this article, the authors argue that these are significantly different approaches to O&E research. The first aims to contribute to organization theory and performance; the latter aims to improve environmental performance. With a starting position that most research published in influential general management journals is of the organizational outcomes variety, the authors reviewed O&E research published from 1995 to 2005 to test this theory The authors found, in fact, that most research is directed at environmental outcomes. This finding suggests that the most influential general management journals are receptive to environmental research that does not fit neatly into the organizational boxes. Yet, the authors also find that there is room for O&E research to have considerably more impact than there has been so far This is a call for more high-quality O&E research in general management journals.

AB The appeal of voluntary environmental programs (VEPs) lies in their promise to mutually serve government, industry, and environmental interests because they can reduce administrative burdens, provide flexibility to decide how to implement environmental improvements, and work toward superior environmental performance. In practice, however one interest may be served to the exclusion of others, and this is a charge that often has beef? leveled at VEPs in the United States. If VEPs are used to serve some interests at the expense of others, they are likely to lose their value as alternative policy instruments. This article details a framework involving procedural, substantive, and practical tests to determine whether the common interest has been served. This assessment framework is applied to two different VEPs in the United States: the Forest Stewardship Council Certification and the Sustainable Slopes Program.

AB Although wetlands (locally called dambos) are considered extremely vulnerable to poor agricultural practices, rising population pressures have caused their agricultural use to become increasingly important. Intensification of dambo use by way of chemical fertilizer and pesticide applications poses serious challenges to their ecological sustainability. This study evaluated gliricidia (Gliricidia sepium) leafy biomass as a possible alternative to commercial fertilizer, and Tephrosia (Tephrosia vogelii) leaf extract, commercial formulations of neem seed extract (Achook) and Bacillus thuringiensis (Thuricide) as alternatives to chemical pesticides in the production of cabbage in dambos. The study showed that soil fertility management practices can significantly influence the time to harvest the cabbage crop and its yield. Vegetables grown using gliricidia biomass produced significantly higher yields compared with the no-input option. The population density of diamondback moth (Plutella xylostella) larvae, the percentage of plants infested by cabbage webworm (Hellula undalis) and cabbage aphid (Brevocoryne brassicae) was significantly lower in cabbage treated with sprays of Tephrosia leaf extract and Achook. It is concluded that gliricidia leafy biomass as a soil fertility management practice combined with Tephrosia leaf extract and neem seed extract as a crop protection practice could increase the productivity of cabbage and ensure sustainable utilization of dambos.

DE Paddy irrigation; Monetary value
AB Paddy rice is the staple food in Taiwan, where rice farming always plays an important role in agricultural activities. The paddy fields and irrigation activities hold diversified functions, such as production, eco-environmental and living-associated functions. This paper is to provide information regarding the potential magnitude and monetary value of seven functions of paddy fields in Taiwan, including flood mitigation, fostering water resources, preventing soil erosion, purifying water, cooling air temperature, refreshing atmosphere and recreation. For quantification of the above values, replacement cost method (RCM), contingent valuation method (CVM), and the travel cost method (TCM) are adopted. In addition, the ratio of monetary value and their rice production commodity value (R) was also estimated. The results indicated that the flood mitigation function had a monetary value of US$ 389 million each year, and the ratio to the rice production value R was estimated at 37%. Water resource fostering function was US$ 501 million and R at 47%; soil erosion reduction function was US$ 433 million and R at 41%; water quality purification function was US$ 3 million and R at 0.3%; cooling air temperature function was US$ 961 million and R at 91%; refreshing air function was US$ 196 million and R at 19%, health and recreation function was US$ 987 million and R at 93%, respectively. Due to the significant importance of these externalities, it is recommended that the government should properly take into account the multifunctionalities in policy making to ensure sustainable development of agriculture.

DT Article
AB Pakistan has 17 agro-ecological zones and in 11 of these rainfed agriculture prevails. The present paper gives an account of the experimental evidence demonstrating the potential importance of mungabean in the rainfed cropping systems with the goal to develop a sustainable agriculture at a higher level of productivity and profitability. Agro-economic studies of mungbean-wheat and fallow-wheat cropping systems revealed that water requirement for mungbean growth cycle varied depending upon seasons, potential evapotranspiration (ETo) and crop coefficients. Under agro-ecosystem of Islamabad, rainfall is surplus than water requirements of mungbean. The study also showed that the response of wheat growth, development and yield differ significantly when followed after mungbean crop as compared to fallow. Net monetary benefits of Rs.5820 per hectare could be obtained by sowing Mungbean in wheat based cropping system.

DT Article
DE bacterial diversity; rhizoplane; wheat; water stress
AB Bacterial diversity plays a key role in agricultural environments and is promising for its potential use in sustainable agriculture. The present study was conducted to assess the influence of moisture stress on bacterial diversity in the rhizoplane of wheat line WL-1076. Healthy seeds were grown in potted soil maintained at moisture contents equivalent to 133% (L1), 100% (L2), 80% (L3) and 55% (L4) of field capacity. Soil closely adhering to the roots of the plants was removed at heading, grain filling and maturity stage. For each soil sample, one gram of soil was taken for evaluating bacterial population by cultivation method. Moisture stress caused reduction in the bacterial population from 7.13 x 10(8) cfu g(-1) (control) to 1.03 x 10(8) cfu g(-1) (L4: moisture) suggesting that the imposed stress directly affects population dynamics of bacteria in rhizoplane. The Population size in normal soil was higher at grain formation stage than at heading or maturity stage and the same trend observed in soil with different moisture stress levels. Moisture deficit changed markedly the structure of soil bacterial communities. Cluster analysis revealed that bacterial community in rhizoplane was represented by mixed population of nine species Staphylococcus aureus (30%), Bacillus subtilis (25%), Enterobacter aerogenes (11%), Bacillus megaterium (8%), Klebsiella aerogenes (8%), Escherichia coli (6%), Kluyvera cryocrescens (6%), Providencia rettgeri (3%) and Proteus vulgaris (3%). Staphylococcus aureus (30%) and B. subtilis (25%) were relatively abundant in rhizoplane and generally present at all growth stages and moisture levels, indicating, their resistance to water stress. Bacterial diversity in rhizoplane (some of which are known to produce exo-polysaccharides) might have provided optimum moisture to the roots to keep them alive and could thus be partly responsible for water deficiency tolerance in wheat.

SO PERIODICUM BIOLOGORUM
LA English
DT Article
DE virgin forest; selective management; stand structure
AB Background and Purpose: The purpose of the research was to compare the basic structural indices of the Dinaric beech-fir virgin forest with beech-fir management stands and a normal model of a management beech fir stand. The respective distributions of the tree number and volume were also compared.
   Material and Methods: The research was carried out in beech-fir forests of the Plitvice Lakes National Park. A system sample of sixty-eight plots was established in the Cor ova Uvala virgin forest, on intersections of the Gauss-Kruger system, upon a ruling screen of 100 in. In the neighbouring management stands of Cor ova Uvala and Krivi Javor two plots were laid out. On all plots a total survey of the basic taxation parameters was carried out: tree number frequency per species and diameter degrees and the height per tree species. The observed volume distributions per diameter degrees and tree species were fitted by Gauss distribution. The tree number distributions per diameter degrees were fitted by Meyer density function.
   Results: The results show the application of normal Gauss distribution as a model for fir-beech volume fitting per diameter degrees, and the application of Meyer's density function as the model for fitting the distribution of the number of trees per diameter degrees in the comparative structure analysis of beech-fir virgin forests and management forests of the same species.
   Conclusion: The virgin forest of Cor ova Uvala is characterised by a singletree structure and a descending distribution of the tree number: The value of the linear progression coefficient (q) does not indicate that the virgin forest has a typical selection structure. The normal volume distributions of beech and fir (are rather separated) (differ significantly?). The increasing management intensity causes the distributions to become closer(?). The normal volume distribution of the management stand Krivi favor-80 most resembles the management forest model. Selection management supports the growth of young trees and sustainability in selection stands.

ID MOUNTAIN FORESTS; INDICATORS; MANAGEMENT
AB Background and Purpose: Forest management and the selection of its methods should be adjusted to social needs. All forests are potentially multipurpose, but some forest uses are compatible, others are not (e. g., timber production and nature conservation). During a given time period, we use in monitored forests the functions that have been defined as necessary. The principle of equal and non-equal values requires the division of forest into different categories, depending on the combination of forest function and their role, and on set management targets.
   Material and Methods: This paper identifies the values and value principles apllied in evaluation of naturalresources. The processed data are related to the Management Unit >> Gaj >> of the forest management branch of Nasice, Croatia. Using the potential method and the eigenvector method, we analyzed the biological parameters that participate in calculation of total value of the natural forest resources. The premise was that current methods have not been sufficiently exact, so that the new dynamic model should be used in the attempt to establish forest value.
   Results: The results obtained by using the potential method and the eigenvector method coincided considerably, suggesting that the use of the two methods results in similar values for an analyzed forest entity. The obtained values are within the limits of the previously calculated values of generally beneficial forest functions of the analyzed polygon, which amounted to about 200, 000 Kuna/ha (the data for year 2000). Using comparisons and estimates, experts in individual fields ranged the parameters for the establishment of natural resource values.
   Conclusion: The developed dynamic model for evaluating a management unit considers the forest potential properties, and monitors the dynamics of the development of stand conditions, supporting the models of sustainable forest management. The method supports modern evaluation trends in forestry, using available computer program for developing dynamic models.

DE Lathyro-Quercetum petraeae; the Pozega hills; releves; festucetosum
   drymeiae; sustainability; biological diversity
AB Background and Purpose: The association Lathyro-Quercetum petracae was recorded and described in the area of the Pozega hills only several years ago (13). In order to make its final definition and systematization, the association was analyzed in detail and compared with the stands from the rest of Pannonian Croatia. The result was an all-inclusive phytocoenological representation of this particularly valuable community.
   Materials and Methods: Ten localities in the Pozega hills were phytocoenologically processed and the resulting releves were compared with 30 phytocoenological releves from other parts of Pannonian Croatia. Forest vegetation was investigated according to the principles of the Zurich Montpellier School. All phytocoenological releves were entered in Turboueg database. Numerical analysis was made with SYN-TAX 2000 software.
   Results: Synecological-vegetational research confirmed the presence of the associations Lathyro-Quercetum petraeae in the study area. They occupy the warmest, southern, eastern and western positions in the upper parts of the slopes and ridges. Although they do not cover large areas, they are important from a variety of aspects. A total of 80 species were registered, of which thermophilic species of the order Quercetalia pubescentis dominated.
   Conclusions: Two groups of releves were clearly identified with synthetic processing and multivariate statistical analysis. The first group consists of releves from the Pozega hills, Moslavacko Gorje and Kalnik - the sub-association festucetosum drymeiae, while the second is made up of releves from the northwest of Croatia - the subassociation typicum. The association has a distinctly independent, southern European and partially sub-Mediterranean character, as well as a transitional character from thermophilic towards acidophilic sessile oak stands. It has a protective role and enables forest sustainability in difficult ecological conditions. Its greatest value is reflected in biological diversity.

AB Patients with end-stage heart failure have a trajectory of illness characterized by an overall gradual decline in function punctuated by periods of symptom exacerbation followed by a return nearly to their baseline. These exacerbations are not predictable. Death may come suddenly and unexpectedly for each patient, even though predictive models can draw an accurate survival curve by averaging the experience of a substantial number of people with heart failure. Heart failure patients often have treatable symptoms, such as dyspnea, fatigue, and generalized pain. In this article, we explain the trajectory of patients with heart failure, illustrate the importance of advance care planning for these patients, discuss the impact of choices to use or forgo new technologies, and suggest ways to improve the care system. Only by reexamining our health care spending priorities can we create a sustainable care system that allows patients to live both long and comfortably, reaching a balance that serves them and their communities well.

AB Realizing the potential of spaceborne multispectral measurements in providing spatial information on natural resources, and of Geographic Information System (GIS) in integrating such information with the socio-economic data and other collateral information to arrive at derivative information, we report here the results of a study which was taken up in a watershed in Charkhari block of Mahoba district, northern India, to generate the information on natural resources from Indian Remote Sensing Satellite (IRS-1B) Linear Imaging Self-scanning Sensor (LISS-II) images through a systematic visual interpretation, and its subsequent integration with collateral information in a GIS environment to develop optimal land use plan/action plan for sustainable development of its land resources. Since permanent vegetation cover in the watershed has been dwindling due to population pressure, the need for establishing more vegetation cover has been stressed.

AB Sustainable biological control of the chestnut blight fungus Cryphonectria parasitica with hypovirulence depends on the production and dissemination of hypovirus-infected propagules of the pathogen. We investigated the ability of C. parasitica to sporulate and produce hypovirus-infected spores on recently dead chestnut wood in coppice stands in southern Switzerland where hypovirulence has been naturally established. The number and type (active, inactive, or none) of cankers was assessed on experimentally cut and stacked stems, firewood stacks, and natural dead wood. Hypovirus-free and hypovirus-infected strains readily survived for more than 1 year in the chestnut blight cankers of the stacked stems. Sporulation of C. parasitica was observed on the surface of preexisting inactive and active cankers, as well as on newly colonized bark areas and was significantly more abundant than on comparable cankers on living stems. On all types of dead wood, we observed more stromata with perithecia than with pycnidia; however, a large proportion of the stromata was not differentiated. All perithecia examined yielded only hypovirus-free ascospores. The incidence of pycnidia that produced hypovirus-infected conidia ranged from 5% on natural dead wood to 41% on the experimental stacks. The mean virus transmission rate into conidia was 69%. Our study demonstrates a considerable saprophytic activity of C. parasitica on recently dead chestnut wood and supports the hypothesis of a role of this saprophytic phase in the epidemiology of hypovirulence.

TI Reducing carbon dioxide emissions from UK road transport
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF CIVIL ENGINEERS-MUNICIPAL ENGINEER

DT Article
DE environment; transport management; transport planning
ID POLICY
AB Several cases of extreme local weather conditions since the storms of October 1987 have served as reminders of some of the possible consequences of global warming, recently more usually, although less precisely, referred to as 'climate change'. Carbon dioxide emissions have been identified as the principal likely culprit and road traffic is the only major source from the UK which is increasing in amount. Local authorities may feel impotent to make a significant contribution to a solution, but example is a worthwhile motive. A local authority can contribute in several ways: implementation of improved vehicle technologies; adopting road speed limits and upholding them; promotion of driving styles which are more sensitive to their environmental effects and of improved vehicle maintenance; policies to change mode of travel and transport and to reduce the amount of travel by several means, including fuller use of vehicles. Many of the ways of reducing carbon dioxide discharges locally will have other environmental benefits. The implementation of cleaner travel lags behind the science to allow it; local authorities have an important role to play in reducing the gap. Average vehicle loadings are low, especially for personal travel; there is much scope for improved environmental performance, and for public transport there are issues relating to value for public spending. Reductions in the amount of travel can also contribute to several government policies relating to social exclusion, promotion of sustainable communities and supporting town centre activities.

ID LAND-USE; HEALTH
AB This paper describes methodologies for assessing risk at conurbation and neighbourhood scales that have been developed in order to provide urban planners with a toolkit for the assessment of risk due to climatic hazards. The methodologies treat risk as a function of hazard, vulnerability and exposure, all three of which elements are influenced by climate change. These three elements are represented as geospatial data layers in a geographical information system (GIS), in order to provide a logical framework to assist planning and management for communities that are safer, more sustainable and more resilient in the face of climate change. The risk assessment methodologies have initially been developed and applied at two different scales: a conurbation scale, using a screening process to locate areas of high risk to assist with land use planning tasks, and a neighbourhood scale, focusing on the influence of the vulnerability of the building stock on this risk. However, using the two methodologies in tandem can refine the assessment further, so the potential development and application of a combined methodology is explored.

AB Throughout the world, the production, application, and disposal of metalworking fluid (MWF) must adhere to the requirements of nature and the environment. Plant-derived oils have been researched as the alternative to mineral-based cutting fluids as they are deemed to be more environmentally friendly and sustainable.
   This paper investigates different vegetable- and plant-derived oils in their pure state, as blends or as commercially available products within the industry, and measures their relative oxidation stability levels and their ability to perform as a lubricant. A set of standard techniques, such as pressure differential scanning calorimetry (PDSC), which measures the oxidation onset temperature and the oxidation induction time, four-ball tester, sliding resistance value (SRV), and micro tap methods, were utilized to analyse the tribological properties of the fluid.
   The results determined that the oxidation stability varies and is dependent on the chemical structure of the oil and its origins, and physiochemical processing during extraction and storage. In relation to oxidation stability being the sole limiting factor, the tribological performance of the oils was affected by their physical and chemical properties. It was apparent from the findings that the physical properties of the oil are also responsible for the low performance of the oil as a metal cutting fluid.

AB How can practicing psychologists help reduce excessive alcohol consumption among college students? Over 80% of college students consume alcohol, and a significant percentage drinks excessively with myriad problems. Brief interventions based on motivational interviewing (MI) have been identified for use with college populations. The authors randomly assigned 91 freshman students to a brief, classroom-based MI intervention or an assessment control condition. At the end of the semester, MI group participants reported fewer drinks per occasion and fewer episodes of intoxication compared to controls. A classroom-based, MI-style intervention might be an efficient, sustainable, and effective means of reducing heavy drinking among college students.

TI Clumsy solutions for a complex world: The case of climate change
SO PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION
LA English
DT Article
ID RISK
AB Successful solutions to pressing social ills tend to consist of innovative combinations of a limited set of alternative ways of perceiving and resolving the issues. These contending policy perspectives justify, represent and stem from four different ways of organizing social relations: hierarchy, individualism, egalitarianism and fatalism. Each of these perspectives: (1) distils certain elements of experience and wisdom that are missed by the others; (2) provides a clear expression of the way in which a significant portion of the populace feels we should live with one another and with nature; and (3) needs all of the others in order to be sustainable. 'Clumsy solutions' - policies that creatively combine all opposing perspectives on what the problems are and how they should be resolved - are therefore called for. We illustrate these claims for the issue of global warming.

AB Networks of local government support organisations (LGSOs) are critical to successful intergovernmental relations and effective local governance in democratic societies. Bulgaria had no such network of municipal associations when it began the transition from communist rule in the early 1990s. Using US and other external technical assistance, Bulgaria over the next decade overcame the impediments to collective action and established what appears to be an effective and sustainable system to back up its cities and towns. Important factors in mobilising support included a long-term focus on institutional development, non-partisanship, flexibility in implementation and a pragmatic orientation that focused on learning by doing.

AB Objective: To assess the efficacy of the Food and Agriculture Organization's global school-based nutrition education initiative, Feeding Minds, Fighting Hunger (FMFH), in improving nutrition-related knowledge levels of schoolchildren.
   Design: Adopting the cluster randomisation technique, five schools each in experimental and control groups were randomly chosen from the member schools of a voluntary organisation. Repeated measures of knowledge levels were carried out at three points in time to assess pre-, post-intervention and retention of knowledge gained during the intervention. Children from experimental schools were given nutrition education by teachers in the classroom setting using FMFH material.
   Subjects/settings: Schoolchildren (n=358 in the control group and n=312 in the experimental group) of grades VIII and IX from schools in Hyderabad, India.
   Results: The classroom-based intervention resulted in a significant improvement (P < 0.01) in nutrition knowledge levels of schoolchildren in the experimental group. Significant improvement in knowledge was also observed in the control group. The effect size indicated that the improvement in knowledge levels of schoolchildren in experimental schools over control schools was medium (d=0.40), indicating the efficacy of the FMFH programme in improving nutrition-related knowledge. No significant decrease (P > 0.05) in knowledge levels was observed after 2 months, indicating retention of the knowledge acquired through the intervention.
   Conclusion: The FMFH programme provides an opportunity for schoolchildren to learn more about nutrition through their teachers in a classroom setting if the lesson plans are adapted to the local circumstances. Furthermore, it has the potential to make nutrition education interactive, effective and sustainable.

AB Objective: To provide an overview of methodological issues in the design, delivery and evaluation of childhood obesity prevention programmes.
   Design: Review of existing literature.
   Setting: International.
   Results: Interventions have varied considerably with regard to their design, subject selection criteria, sample size, attrition rates, intervention components and duration of both the intervention and the follow-up phases. However, overall, there is only a limited body of consistent, high-quality evidence on which valid and generalisable conclusions can be drawn about best practices for the prevention of childhood obesity.
   Conclusions: Although the rationale for targeting children and adolescents through primary prevention is now compelling, effective obesity prevention remains elusive. There is increasing consensus that prevention of childhood obesity necessitates multifaceted health promotion interventions based on population health principles. By definition, such interventions Should have a range of outcome indicators of effectiveness, generalisability and sustainability, not just the traditional ones focused on individual lifestyle behaviour change. Given the complexity and intricacy of population-based intervention programmes, multiple methods of data collection which combine both qualitative and quantitative approaches will need to be fully exploited in order to move towards evidence-based practice in the future.

AB Olyective: As a qualitative problem solving method, to manage the accelerating phenomenon of overweight and obesity among children and adolescents as well as to promote the Mediterranean Diet and the diversity of the Mediterranean Food Cultures heritage, it is presented a creative interdisciplinary approach through art.
   Design: Taking into account that young generations are becoming the highest majority of the consumer population in the Southern and Eastern Mediterranean Countries, it is reported the artist practice and the creative community-based interdisciplinary experience of Plexus International, a network of artists and scientists of various nationalities and disciplines.
   Setting: Mediterranean Region and International.
   Subject: Young Populations.
   Results: Through the Ark of the Well Being project, artists and scientists have collaborate together, promoting The 2005 Rome Call for a Common Action in the Mediterranean and raising more attention on the erosion of the cognitive capacities of young generations by hunger and malnutrition.
   Conclusions: A creative interdisciplinary approach was developed to transmit through art Mediterranean food culture with the aim to achieve a broader nutritional well being.

ID PARTICIPATION
AB A growing number of scholars question the sustainability of liberal representative democracy and a welfare state dominated by the big organizations in both the public and private sectors. The state is over extended and democracy is stretched to its limits. Walzer proposes to democratize the means of distributing welfare services by greater citizen involvement, while Hirst calls for devolving many of the functions of the state to civil society. However, missing from such macro proposals is a micro perspective of citizens co-producers.
   The first part of this presentation introduces the concept of co-production, with a focus on greater citizen participation in the provision of public services. A review of the literature demonstrates several advantages of co-production, but also some major hurdles. The second part ties the concept of co-production to a discussion of parents' participation in the provision of childcare services in Europe.
   Finally, the importance of co-production for promoting the development and renewal of democracy and the welfare state is discussed.

AB The purpose of this work is to assess the impact on the Esteros del Ibera wetland ecosystem caused by the Yacyreta dam, a large hydroelectric power plant on the Parana River, Argentina, in comparison to other factors of environmental change. The project of the dam started around 1970. The power plant began operating in 1994. In 1989, the neighboring Ibera wetland ecosystem showed a substantial increase in the water level for which several different causes were conceivable, including climate chan e and the dam construction. We analyzed all existing hydrometeorological data and studied other changes that were observed in this ecosystem. A water balance model was used to analyze different scenarios. Increased groundwater inflow, generated since the construction of the dam, appears to be affecting the wetland more than any other factor. The study has implications for the assessment of global and regional consequences of building dams.

AB Over the next century, society will increasingly be confronted with the impacts of global change (e.g. pollution, land use changes, and climate change). Multiple scenarios provide us with a range of possible changes in socio-economic trends, land uses and climate (i.e. exposure) and allow us to assess the response of ecosystems and changes in the services they provide (i.e. potential impacts). Since vulnerability to global change is less when society is able to adapt, it is important to provide decision makers with tools that will allow them to assess and compare the vulnerability of different sectors and regions to global change, taking into account exposure and sensitivity, as well as adaptive capacity. This paper presents a method that allows quantitative spatial analyses of the vulnerability of the human-environment system on a European scale. It is a first step towards providing stakeholders and policy makers with a spatially explicit portfolio of comparable projections of ecosystem services, providing a basis for discussion on the sustainable management of Europe's natural resources.

AB Decisions on land-use sustainability are particularly critical in fragile semi-arid regions of the world, especially those involving the social factor: people and communities. Typical of such an area is the Middle East region, especially Jordan which is beset by climatic constraints. New land-use alternatives were introduced by the Jordan Arid Zone Productivity Project (JAZPP) to improve land productivity in the arid to semi-arid (transitional Badia) land in Jordan. These alternatives were verified within experimental stations under controlled conditions. Dissemination of these findings would be successful if they suit the needs and resources of farmers. Therefore, verification of the success of these techniques under a wide range of biophysical and socio-economic conditions was necessary to judge their suitability to the target area. Various interventions were implemented on 14 sites that represent different biophysical and socio-economic conditions over the study area. With close monitoring and follow-up, successful and encouraging results were reported during the first season, even with lower rainfall than average, suggesting that these techniques were biophysically suitable for the target area. During the second season, maintenance and guarding were assigned to the farmers. Seven out of the 14 sites failed for various reasons: multiownership regime, reluctance of farmers to adopt new land use and insufficient protection and/or guarding measures. The study highlighted the importance of the farmers' comments and discussion of their specific problems and needs. This helped to improve these interventions to suit the farmers' requirements and may be important in facilitating widespread adoption and sustainability of these new land-use alternatives in the Jordanian Badia as well as in other areas of similar environment.

AB Cost-effective, laborsaving, and environmentally sound weed management practices are needed for sustainable vegetable production. Organic production, in particular, precludes the use of synthetic herbicides and requires that organic farmers utilize practices that reduce harmful environmental impact. Although polyethylene film mulch is used extensively in vegetable production in Florida, its use has a number of drawbacks, among which is the susceptibility of opaque polyethylene mulch to penetration by yellow and purple nutsedge. Appreciable labor and disposal/environmental costs are associated with its removal. A durable mulch material that would effectively control nutsedge and other weeds but with no associated environmental and disposal costs is highly desirable. Hydramulch, a paper-like material applied as a slurry consisting of cotton waste, newsprint, gypsum and a proprietary adhesive, was tested as a biodegradable alternative to polyethylene mulch during the spring of 2003. Experiments were conducted in southeastern and north-central Florida to compare the effects of three hydramulch formulations, polyethylene mulch and a no mulch control on soil temperature, soil moisture and weed infestation. Soil temperature under hydramulch was 1-4 degrees C lower than that under polyethylene. In the absence of rain, the use of hydramulch resulted in soil moisture levels that were 1-4% lower than with polyethylene mulch. Higher soil moisture with hydramulch than polyethylene was coincident with rainfall. Hydramulch remained intact on most beds and suppressed broadleaf weeds and grasses, particularly at the north-central site where the mulch was applied at a greater thickness. However, purple nutsedge readily penetrated hydramulch. Therefore, hydramulch may be applicable for use for the suppression of broadleaf weeds and grasses at sites with little or no nutsedge pressure in fall or in crops for which cooler soils are desirable or crops that are rainfed or overhead irrigated.

AB Organic agriculture is regarded as one important approach to agriculture and food production that is environmentally sustainable and can generate several positive impacts to rural society. However, organic agriculture development is still limited in Taiwan and the major reason is lack of economic incentives to farmers. Hence, one approach to link organic agriculture with agro-ecotourism is proposed in this study to maximize the economic benefit of organic agriculture.
   Chrshang Township in Taiwan was selected as an example to develop such eco-organic tourism based on organic agriculture. First, five appropriate activities were designed according to the fundamental principles for guiding the development of eco-organic tourism. In addition, the maximum willingness to pay (WTP) method was employed to estimate potential revenues from eco-organic tourism and then the economic value could be compared with that of other economic activities. Under a conservative scenario, the total annual revenue from eco-organic tourism is about NT$421,293,559, which is about 20 times that of the rice production in the study area.
   In addition to the direct economic revenues, the following additional benefits can also be found: (1) the linkage can create additional value of organic agriculture; (2) organic agriculture can contribute to service economy and experience economy; (3) people can increase their confidence in organic products through better understanding; (4) a one-step relationship between organic producer and consumer can be established; and (5) local food supply will be connected with demands in the tourism industry. In summary, under a symbiotic relationship, organic agriculture is not only commodities and goods production, it can become one important service economy and even create experience economy within the tourism industry.

AB After decades of farm specialization, re-integrating crop and livestock farming systems is being reconsidered as a key step toward sustainable agriculture. The relative profitability of Maine farms integrating crops and livestock is compared to non-integrated or conventional farms. Crop and livestock integration in Maine occurs through either diversified on-farm integration or, more commonly, through coupled interactions between specialized crop and livestock producers. Potato and dairy systems coupled for only 2 years (short-term) had greater profitability compared to conventional systems. Profitability increased in the short term in two ways. First, potato farms grew more of their primary cash crop. Secondly, dairy farms expanded cow numbers, increasing profitability assuming increasing returns to scale. Coupled systems integrated for more than 10 years (long-term) had more favorable profitability than short-term couplers since greater manure-nutrient credits were taken for potatoes and silage corn. The advantages of potato-dairy integration were even greater if potato yields increased in the long term, as suggested by long-term rotation plot studies in Maine. Even if coupling is more profitable than non-integrated systems, it requires that farms be in close proximity and for farmers to have adequate working relationships and management skills. Despite these challenges to re-integrating crops and livestock, short- and long-term economic benefits may encourage farmers in appropriate areas to consider coupling with other producers.

SO RENEWABLE ENERGY

AB Within recent years, energy policies have imposed a number of targets at European and national level for rational use of energy (RUE), renewable energy sources (RES) and related CO2 reductions. As a result, a wide variety of policy instruments is currently implemented and hence the question arises: how can these instruments be designed in a way to reach the maximum policy target with the minimum public money spent?
   The objective of this paper is to derive a methodology for obtaining efficient policy portfolios promoting sustainable energy systems depending on the policy target and show corresponding results from case studies in Austria, Germany and Poland.
   The investigations were carried out by application of Invert simulation tool, a computer model developed for simulating the impacts of various promotion schemes for renewable and efficient energy systems. With this tool, the CO2 reductions and related public expenses have been calculated for various policy mixes.
   In the building-related energy sector, it turned out that in all investigated regions support schemes for supply side measures are the most cost-efficient instruments. However, their potential is restricted and for achieving higher levels of CO2 reduction, promotion of demand side measures is indispensable.
   The paper shows that for a comprehensive comparison of policy portfolios, there are always two dimensions to be considered: efficiency and effectiveness. The more effective, i.e. the higher the implementation rate of a scheme, the more essential becomes the efficiency criteria. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The ability for an economy to design useful products is tied to its productivity, thus economic growth and the population's standards of living. This paper investigates product design strategies and processes in Kenya in the country's informal, formal, and non-governmental sectors. In analyzing Kenyan 200+ products, patterns emerged to delineate four approaches to the detailed design acquisition of common-use products: imitated design, imported design, basic original design, and specialty design. A vast majority of product designs, 54 of 55 tracked in this research, originate outside the country or were imitated from imported products. Across sectors, there is emphasis on the detailed design and manufacturing phases of the design process. Factors specific to less industrialized economies (LIEs) like Kenya, such as corruption and an inadequate infrastructure, limit design activities relative to more industrialized economies. Design constraints observed in Kenya are believed to be similar to other economies at the same levels of industrialization. For product design to sustainably support economic development in LIEs, it is imperative that design process be consistent with local conditions and be user-centric in approach.

AB The EU Commission's Services asked TNO and CML to perform a study into the risks of the present uses of lead over time, as an input to a discussion on the need of a further reduction of the use of this material. The study was set up as a substance flow analysis to analyse trends in uses and emissions of lead in Europe between 2000 and 2030. The study showed among others that the flow to (final) landfill of lead is declining from about 290 ktpa in 2000 to 220 ktpa in 2003 for the EU15. Alloys, or more specifically lead in electronic equipment, contribute to about 5% of these flows.
   The study also compared current actual exposures in the environment, of workers, and the general public (adults and young children) to authoritative limit values set in the EU. From this, it appeared that under unfavorable conditions (high dust/soil intake via hand-mouth behavior) young children may exceed their tolerable daily intake (TDI). The study hence concluded that for children, there is a need for further information and/or testing.
   It has to be stressed, however, that this purely risk based approach leaves several questions about sustainable lead management unanswered. It gives a 'picture' at a given moment in time. Successes in lowering exposure were mainly reached by reducing direct emissions from various sources (e.g. emissions to air via leaded gasoline). However, it is also clear that the use and hence the economical stock of lead is growing, as is the stock in landfills and certain residues from Municipal Solid Waste Incinerators (MSWIs), which might be re-used. This led to a discussion driven by the fear for slow 'enrichment' of the economical and ecological system with lead, and hence a possible higher exposure in future. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

AB In most industrialized countries the recycling of waste materials has increased considerably over the last few decades; however, through a focus on how to increase the amount of recycled waste, the economic nature of recycling has sometimes been neglected. This paper proposes an integrative industry analysis for recycling schemes based on material and money flows. The latter analysis facilitates integrating economic characteristics into considerations with respect to recycling schemes in order to obtain a more comprehensive understanding of their current status as well as their historical developments. Thereby, the analysis departs from the perspective of the entire recycling industry or branch. Such meso-economic considerations can support, on the one hand, regional authorities in deciding how a recycling scheme should be handled in order to approach the overall goal of sustainable regional waste management and, on the other hand, the respective recycling industry to develop effective improvement strategies in order to succeed in the increasingly competitive regional waste markets. The proposed approach is utilized in a case study for centralized separate bio-waste transformation in Canton Zurich, Switzerland, to show its feasibility as well as its potentials and shortcomings. In the case study two quasi-stationary material and money flow analyses were calculated, and the profitability and competitiveness of the recycling industry were analyzed. Additionally, major consumers' requirements with regard to the solid transformation products were investigated in a questionnaire survey (N = 102). The case study shows that the proposed methodological approach is appropriate for integrating economic considerations into a comprehensive analysis of a recycling industry and for deriving potential improvement strategies for this industry. For achieving robust decisions for regional material flow management, the approach contributes in three highly relevant ways: (i) it integrates different system perspectives (e.g., material flows, consumer requirements, and money flows), (ii) it examines waste management comprehensively (e.g., inclusion of different waste management options), and (iii) it is transparent for the responsible decision makers and the affected stakeholders.

TI Due diligence assessment of non-financial risk: Prophylaxis for the
   purchaser
SO RESOURCES POLICY
LA English
DT Article
AB Most large mining companies grow by acquisition and conduct due diligence assessments in order to identify the opportunities and risks associated with potential acquisitions.
   Due diligence assessment is usually restricted to considering the financial aspects of an asset, and often overlooks the non-financial risks that may compromise the economic viability or operability of a project. However, experience has shown that neglecting non-financial risk areas such as environmental, socio-economic and sustainability performance may be problematic and, under extreme circumstances, potentially disastrous, particularly in a developing world context.
   This paper examines the due diligence process and identifies the limitations of conventional assessments based solely on financial risk. It presents practical recommendations on structuring due diligence assessments to consider non-financial risk so that the full risk profile of an asset can be identified. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

SO RESOURCES POLICY

DT Article
DE sustainability; green accounting; accounting prices; investment
AB Economic sustainability or intergenerational equity entails maintaining social well-being by decisions about investments in different types of assets. Under certain conditions, consumption can be sustained by depleting resources, or various kinds of natural capital, while building up other kinds of capital. Theoretically, the choices involve the use of a set of accounting prices. The question becomes one of finding and implementing accounting prices that express the roles of the various capital goods in achieving the objective of the economy.
   Hartwick's rule holds that an economy can be sustained if the value of the total, net investment in the economy, evaluated at those accounting prices, is zero. The rule applies to a special, abstract economic model which expresses a social objective different from the discounted-utilitarian objective on which national accounting is based. Different objectives give rise to different accounting prices. Because the prices may not be right, the zero net-investment rule using available national-accounting prices cannot generate a condition for sustaining an economy.
   Still, environmental accounting is a tool which, used prudently, can make an important contribution to social decision-making. This paper expands upon these ideas by discussing the incorporation of natural resource and intangible environmental costs and benefits into green accounting at the firm as well as the economy level. Common techniques of mine valuation and standard corporate accounting are the bases for this extension to the valuation of and accounting for decisions concerning the environment.

AB Water is a limited and unevenly distributed resource in China, with the per capita amount of water resource there only about one-fourth of the world's average. However, water is an essential resource for people's lives and economic development. Over the past two decades China has seen the fruit of its rapid economic growth; nevertheless, a severe water shortage is behind this prosperous scenario and is becoming worse. Efficient water supply is certainly essential for the sustainable development of human beings. This paper analyzes water efficiency by incorporating water as an input as well as using conventional inputs such as labor employment and capital stock. An index of a water adjustment target ratio (WATR) is established from the production frontier constructed by data envelopment analysis (DEA) including water as an input. The water efficiency of regions is obtained from a total-factor framework with both residential and productive water use. A U-shape relation is discovered between the total-factor water efficiency and per capita real income among areas in China. The central area has the worst water efficiency ranking and the total adjustment amount of water used there is around three-fourths of China's total. More efficient production processes and advanced technologies need to be adopted in the central area to improve its water efficiency, especially for its productive use of water.

AB This paper explains how the well-accepted concept of improved stakeholder participation during mineral policy development leads to a national mineral policy that accommodates the diverging views and interests that allows wide acceptance of decisions, enhancing the success of implementation and, ultimately, national benefits. This process is based on lessons learnt during the South African experience and has been successfully applied in the development of the Namibian and Malawian national minerals policies. An effective policy in the SADC will engineer the delicate balance between poverty reduction and an internationally competitive minerals sector. This balance enhances the possibility of long-term economic growth and development in the SADC region. The overriding advantage of this strategy is that it generates 'home-grown' policy instruments and implementation of mineral law with which stakeholders can identify. This process presents a new challenge to traditional policy formulation strategies in emerging economics and the bottom-up approach, linked to wide political support, allows the potential realisation of national objectives.

AB With a high biological diversity and good status of preservation, the northern part of the Amazon Basin, and specially the State of Amapa, have their fauna and flora poorly studied. Studies pointed that Amapa has several areas classified as highest priority for faunal inventories in the Amazon Basin, but even that few studies have been conducted. In order to fulfill part of these knowledge gaps, three of the most important conservation units in the State, namely the Tumucumaque Mountains National Park, the Amapa National Forest and the Rio Iratapuru Sustainable Development Reserve, were studied for different biological groups. The results of four bat surveys in these conservation units are presented here. With a sampling effort of 1730.5 mistnet.hours, 858 bats were recorded, belonging to 51 species, 36 genus and six families. At least 25 of these species are first records for the State, elevating to 73 the number of bat species already recorded in Amapa.

ID GENERATIONAL ACCOUNTS; IMMIGRATION; IMPACT
AB The goal of this paper is to analyse the impact of immigration flows on the public finances of Andalusia, and thus, on the long-run sustainability of public policies in this region. We perform different simulations using the methodology of Generational Accounting. Our results, compared to those obtained by Collado et al. (2004) for Spain, suggest that the dependency ratio shows a less dramatic evolution for Andalusia. However, the financial viability of welfare policies will be more difficult given the forseeable evolution of public finances in that region. Our results also suggest that the impact of immigration will be positive, but less significant than in the rest of Spain, since the average immigrant has a low-income profile in this region. Moreover, the lower the immigrant offspring assimilation, the lower the immigration contribution will be.

AB Adsorption onto sewage sludge is an important process for the elimination of tributyltin (TBT) from wastewater. However as the disposal of sewage sludge to agricultural land is a significant route for recycling biosolids, there exists an issue as to whether the potential long-term build-up of organotins in agricultural soil is acceptable, from a human health and environmental point of view. For the sustainable use of biosolids in agriculture it is essential to control and reduce the quantities of persistent pollutants such as organotins in sewage sludge. In this study, a sampling program was designed to establish the levels of TBT (and other organotins) in sewage sludge and their reduction during anaerobic treatment and processing prior to disposal. Experiments were also undertaken to assess the fate of TBT in laboratory scale anaerobic digesters where the influence of digester operating parameters could be evaluated. Organotin concentrations were determined using capillary gas chromatography with flame photometric detection. The results demonstrated that the majority of TBT remained concentrated in the solid phase (sewage sludge). Concentrations of TBT in sewage sludge were approximately 18 mg kg(-1) (dry weight) and both laboratory experiments and fieldwork demonstrated that degradation of TBT during anaerobic digestion of sludge was minimal.

TI Rapid tests for sexually transmitted infections (STIs): the way forward

AB In the developing world, laboratory services for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are either not available, or where limited services are available, patients may not be able to pay for or physically access those services. Despite the existence of national policy for antenatal screening to prevent congenital syphilis and substantial evidence that antenatal screening is cost-effective, implementation of syphilis screening programmes remains unacceptably low because of lack of screening tools that can be used in primary health care settings. The World Health Organization Sexually Transmitted Diseases Diagnostics Initiative ( SDI) has developed the ASSURED criteria as a benchmark to decide if tests address disease control needs: Affordable, Sensitive, Specific, User- friendly, Rapid and robust, Equipment-free and Deliverable to end-users. Rapid syphilis tests that can be used with whole blood approach the ASSURED criteria and can now be deployed in areas where no previous screening has been possible. Although rapid tests for chlamydia and gonorrhoea lack sensitivity, more tests are in development. The way forward for STI diagnostics requires a continuing quest for ASSURED tests, the development of a road map for test introduction, sustainable programmes for quality assurance, and the creation of a robust infrastructure linked to HIV prevention that ensures sustainability of STI control efforts that includes viral STIs.

AB s The community-level attributes of two youth HIV prevention initiatives in a single community are examined using the concepts of social capital, empowerment and critical consciousness. The school-based peer education programme and youth-initiated public clinic 'add-on' facility for the treatment of adolescent sexually transmitted diseases had differing experiences in terms of implementation, community acceptance, sustainability and achieving their goals. By examining the role of conscientization, networks for accessing resources and power, and community acceptability of adolescent HIV prevention, this paper describes the differing experiences of these two programmes. The paper indicates the need for true adolescent agency in challenging the social constructions of adolescent HIV risk it the social and community levels.

AB Although the South African film industry has the required competency to become a significant player in the international film market, few South African films enjoy commercial success. This paper examines why South African films are not more successful and assesses what government and other stakeholders can do to promote a sustainable and successful film industry. The paper draws on the experiences of the United States, the United Kingdom and other countries to argue that the South African government should not focus solely on the cultural aspects of the film product but should attach more importance to distribution, promotion and audience development.

ID COMMUNITY
AB How do rural communities manage the challenge of local governance and community capacity-building, given the policy choices of central government (both state and national) in favour of global resource-development industries? Central government policy choices expose rural communities to the vagaries of the global economy, even as the Australian government's stated intent vis-a-vis rural Australia is the exact opposite: to encourage locally driven economic and community sustainability. Rural development policy in Australia often has the effect of denying the very outcomes it hopes to achieve. On the one hand, government policies encourage rural communities to be independent, to build 'social capital', and to add value to their local produce; on the other hand, macroeconomic policies change the contexts within which these communities function, creating a tension which is difficult to reconcile. In the case of the Western District of Victoria, an established agricultural and pastoral region, the cycles of economic activity have been disrupted in recent years by new and exciting global industries whose trajectories sit largely outside local control. This paper questions whether governments have a systemic view of the impact of these competing demands on rural communities, and calls for a more informed, whole-of-government policy-making for the development of Australia's rural regions.

AB Sustainable agricultural use of cultivated desert soils has become a concern in Hexi Corridor in Gansu Province of China, because loss of topsoil in dust storms has been recently intensified. We chose four desert sites to investigate the effects of cultivation (cropping) on (i) soil organic C and its size fractions and (ii) soil aggregate stability (as a measure of soil erodibility). These parameters are of vital importance for evaluating the sustainability of agricultural practices.
   Total organic C as well as organic C fractions in soil (coarse organic C, 0.1-2 mm; young organic C, 0.05-0.1 mm; stable organic C, < 0.05 mm) generally increased with the duration of the cultivation period from 0 (virgin soil, non-cultivated) to more than 30 years (p < 0.05). Compared to total organic C in virgin soils (2.3-3.5 g kg(-1) soil), significantly greater values were found after 10 to > 20 years of cultivation (6.2-7.1 g kg(-1) soil). The increase in organic C in desert soils following prolonged cultivation was mainly the consequence of an increase in the coarse organic C. The increase in total organic C in soil was also dependent on clay content [total organic C = 0.96 + 0.249 clay content (%) + 0.05 cultivation year, R-2 = 0.48, n = 27, p, < 0.001]. This indicates that clay protected soil organic C from mineralization, and also contributed to the increase in soil organic C as time of cultivation increased.
   There was a significant positive correlation between aggregate stability and total organic C across all field sites. The water stability of aggregates was low (with water-stable aggregate percentage similar to 4% of dry-sieved aggregates of size 1-5 mm). There was no consistent pattern of increase in the soil aggregate stability with time of cultivation at different locations, suggesting that desert soils might remain prone to wind erosion even after 50 years of cultivation. Alternative management options, such as retaining harvested crop residues on soil surface and excluding or minimizing tillage, may permit sustainable agricultural use of desert soils.

AB Degradation of soil structure can lead to increased risk of run-off and soil erosion, and therefore, it is necessary to implement management practices that are more sustainable and will enhance and rehabilitate soils while increasing food production. The impact of small-grain rotations grown with legumes, fallow and continuously on total C (C-T) labile C (C-L), non-labile C (C-NL), total N (N-T), aggregation expressed as mean weight diameter (MWD) and infiltration determined as unsaturated hydraulic conductivity (K-unsat) were examined in a long-term rotation trial established in 1966 on a Black Earth (Pellic Vertisol) and a Red Clay (Chromic Vertisol) soil near Tamworth, in New South Wales, Australia. The results were compared with an adjacent uncropped pasture on each soil type. Cropping reduced all C fractions, N-T, MWD and K-unsat on both soils, which were further degraded when long fallowing was included in the rotation. C-L decreased by 70% with long fallow in the Red Clay and by 78% in the Black Earth compared with the adjacent pasture, while MWD decreased by 61% in the Red Clay and 91% in the Black Earth. Rotation of cereals with legumes resulted in smaller decreases in C fractions, NT, MWD and K-unsat when compared with pasture. Rotation with lucerne (Medicago sativa) resulted in 41% higher C-L, 45% higher MWD and 87% higher K-unsat (10 mm tension) than long fallow on the Red Clay soil and 65, 126 and 43% higher on the Black Earth soil. There were strong positive correlations of soil C fractions and N-T with MWD for both soil types. Similar significant relationships were found for all C fractions and NT with K-unsat (10 mm tension) for the Red Clay soil, but not for the Black Earth. Rotations with forage legumes can limit declines in C fractions, N-T, MWD and K-unsat when cropping these soils and has potential to increase soil sustainability. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

AB Soil properties and surface characteristics affecting wind erosion can be manipulated through tillage and crop residue management. Little information exists, however, that describes the impact of long term tillage and residue management on soil properties in the subarctic region of the United States. This study examines the impact of 20 years of tillage and residue management on a broad range of physical properties that govern wind erosion processes on a silt loam in interior Alaska. A strip plot experimental design was established in 1983 and included intensive tillage (autumn and spring disk), spring disk, autumn chisel plow, and no tillage with straw either retained on or removed from the soil surface. Soil and residue properties measured after sowing barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) in May 2004 included penetration resistance, soil water content, shear stress, bulk density, random roughness, aggregate size distribution, and residue cover and biomass. No tillage was characterized by larger aggregates, greater soil strength (penetration resistance and shear stress), wetter soil, and greater residue cover compared to all other tillage treatments. Despite crop failures the previous 2 years, crop residue management influenced residue biomass and cover, but not soil properties. Autumn chisel and spring disk appeared to be viable minimum tillage options to intensive tillage in controlling erosion. Autumn chisel and spring disk promoted greater roughness, aggregation, and residue cover as compared with intensive tillage. Although no tillage appeared to be the most effective management strategy for mitigating wind erosion, no tillage was not a sustainable practice due to lack of weed control. No tillage also resulted in the formation of an organic layer on the soil surface over the past 20 years, which has important ramifications for long term crop production in the subarctic where the mean annual temperature is < 0 degrees C.

AB Soil management practices are needed in the subarctic that stabilize the soil against the forces of wind and water as well as conserve soil water for crop production. There is a paucity of information, however, regarding the long-term effects of conservation tillage on soil hydraulic properties in subarctic Alaska. The objective of this study was therefore to characterize infiltration, water retention, and saturated hydraulic conductivity of a soil 20 years after establishing tillage and straw management treatments in interior Alaska. The strip plot experimental design, established on a silt loam and maintained in continuous barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), included tillage as the main treatment and straw management as the secondary treatment. Tillage treatments included no tillage, autumn chisel plow, spring disk, and intensive tillage (autumn and spring disk) while straw treatments included retaining or removing stubble and loose straw from the soil surface after harvest. Soil properties were measured after sowing in spring 2004; saturated hydraulic conductivity was measured by the falling-head method, infiltration was measured using a double-ring infiltrometer, and water retention was assessed by measuring the temporal variation in in-situ soil water content. No tillage resulted in greater saturated hydraulic conductivity and generally retained more water against gravitational and matric forces than other tillage treatments. Infiltration was greater in autumn chisel plow than other tillage treatments and was presumably suppressed in no tillage by an organic layer overlying mineral soil. Infiltration was also enhanced by retaining straw on rather than removing straw from the soil surface after harvest. No tillage is not yet a sustainable management practice in this region due to lack of weed control strategies. In addition, the formation of an organic layer in no tillage has important ramifications for the soil hydrological and thermal environment. Therefore, minimum tillage (i.e., autumn chisel plow or spring disk) appears to be a viable management option for maximizing infiltration in interior Alaska. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

AB Soil organic matter (SOM) and phosphorus (P) fractions play a key role in sustaining the productivity of acid-savanna oxisols and are greatly influenced by tillage practices. In 1993, a long-term experiment on sustainable crop rotation and ley farming systems was initiated on a Colombian acid-savanna oxisol to test the effects of grain legumes, green manures, intercrops and leys as possible components that could increase the stability of systems involving annual cereal crops. Five agropastoral treatments (maize monoculture-MMO, maize-soybean rotation-MRT, maize-soybean green manure rotation-MGM, native savanna control-NSC and maize-agropastoral rotation-MAP) under two tillage systems (no till-NT and minimum tillage-MT) were investigated. The effects of NT and MT on SOM and P fractions as well as maize grain yield under the five agropastoral treatments were evaluated. Results showed that soil total C, N and P were generally better under no-till as compared to minimum-tilled soils. While P fractions were also generally higher under no-till treatments, SOM fractions did not show any specific trend. Seven years after establishment of the long-term ley farming experiment (5 years of conventional tillage followed by 2 years alternative tillage systems), MT resulted into moderately higher maize grain yields as compared to NT. The MGM rotation treatment had significantly higher values of maize yield under both tillage systems (4.2 Mg) compared to the NSC (2.3 Mg ha(-1)). Results from this study indicate that the rotational systems (maize-soybean green manure and maize-pastures) improved the soil conditions to implement the no-till or minimum tillage systems on Colombian savanna oxisol.

AB The Representative Soil Sampling Scheme of England and Wales has recorded information on the soil of agricultural land in England and Wales since 1969. It is a valuable source of information about the soil in the context of monitoring for sustainable agricultural development. Changes in soil nutrient status and pH were examined over the period 1971-2001. Several methods of statistical analysis were applied to data from the surveys during this period. The main focus here is on the data for 1971, 1981, 1991 and 2001. The results of examining change over time in general show that levels of potassium in the soil have increased, those of magnesium have remained fairly constant, those of phosphorus have declined and pH has changed little. Future sampling needs have been assessed in the context of monitoring, to determine the mean at a given level of confidence and tolerable error and to detect change in the mean over time at these same levels over periods of 5 and 10 years. The results of a non-hierarchical multivariate classification suggest that England and Wales could be stratified to optimize future sampling and analysis. To monitor soil quality and health more generally than for agriculture, more of the country should be sampled and a wider range of properties recorded.

   cultural policy; sustainable cultures; sustainable communities; Tlokweng
   village; Botswana
AB In October 2003 UNESCO adopted the Convention for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage as a step towards safeguarding non-material cultural heritage. The key word of the Convention is 'Safeguarding' which is defined as "measures aimed at ensuring the viability of the intangible cultural heritage, including the identification, documentation, research, preservation, protection, promotion, enhancement, transmission, particularly through formal and non formal education, as well as the revitalization of the various aspects of such heritage" [Article 2.3]. This is a commendable step by UNESCO, given that the 1972 UNESCO Convention has for more than 30 years focused specifically on the tangible aspects of cultural heritage. Article 15 of the 2003 Convention on intangible heritage makes reference to issues relating to the 'Participation of communities, groups and individuals". A focus on communities means that the Convention must face very varied national and community perspectives. This article focuses on elements of the 2003 UNESCO Convention to investigate implications for the sustainable existence and utilization of intangible heritage in a context of an African community in Botswana. It is concluded that safeguarding elements of intangible heritage by creating inventories and representative lists [Articles 12 and 16] can reduce the value of the cultural capital together with the social capital upon which the heritage exists by making some elements of intangible heritage ubiquitous, in the process lessening their existence and use values and thus disrupting the socio-cultural contexts within which these elements exist. Tlokweng village, a case study from Botswana, illuminates these discussions.

TI Should South Africa have a fiscal rule?
SO SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS
LA English
DT Article
DE fiscal rules; budget deficit; public debt
ID POLICY
AB Over the past three decades many countries have struggled to find solutions to their persistent public sector deficits. For some the solution to this problem seemingly became the adoption of fiscal rules. This paper considers the applicability of one such rule, namely the output-sensitive deficit rule of Taylor, and in particular its applicability to South Africa. The paper shows that its applicability in developing countries such as South Africa might be limited due to higher output volatility that may cause output-sensitive deficit rules such as the Taylor rule to become more volatile. Such volatility in the deficit/GDP ratio may cause fears that government may not be able to maintain the stability of the debt/GDP ratio, thereby again introducing fiscal unsustainability. To address this problem the paper augments the Taylor rule to reduce the volatility in the public debt/GDP ratio and demonstrates how these rules would have performed in South Africa. It concludes that the augmented fiscal rule might contribute to both fiscal sustainability and economic stability in South Africa.

ID INDICATORS; MANAGEMENT
AB Frequently, agriculture intensification by means of high-input technologies and agroecosystem simplification led to unsustainable farming systems. Increasing spatial-temporal diversity in agroecosystems has been shown as a promising alternative for restoring degraded land. A methodological approach is discussed here, based on preliminary results of experiences in a region of strong biophysical gradients. The CENTURY model is validated under local conditions and used as monitoring tool. The impact of an increased agrodiversity on soils with contrasting inherent properties is exemplified by running three land use scenarios for two case-study sites for the next 50 years and evaluating trends in soil organic matter (SOM) contents. Field survey and simulation results suggested that: (1) reference values for SOM levels for monitoring soil health should be defined considering main agroecological factors; (2) simulation models may help identifying adequate ranges of variation for them; (3) and model outputs may complement experimentation and represent a didactic tool to be used for decision-making and knowledge-transfer processes.

AB The paper deals with the problem of the redevelopment of derelict buildings and abandoned sites as a complex issue that includes environmental, social and economic aspects. The objective of the research was to suggest a model for determining the rational revitalization of derelict immovable property from the perspective of sustainable development. The authors assume that a multi-criterion analysis is an appropriate technique to use to assure equilibrium among various domains of sustainability. When taking into account the uncertainty of a problem, calculations using the fuzzy version of the TOPSIS method were proposed. The development of a model for determining revitalization priorities of abandoned buildings was based on a case study of derelict rural buildings in Lithuania. A set of indicators was defined and used to perform the multi-criterion analysis of revitalization alternatives of the derelict buildings. Based on results from calculations, scientific recommendations for a rational revitalization of buildings and their sites were prepared. Copyright (c) 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.

AB The research project MAMMUT explores synergies between the processes of urbanization and sustainable development. In a pilot study, we tested the assumption that the concept of situations of opportunity can define the project's unit of analysis. We applied MAMMUT's conceptual framework to the Stockholm Underground, identified that situation's formative moment (1941, when main decisions were taken) and analysed its prehistory and factual outcome. To illustrate its field of options, a counterfactual highway and roads scenario was developed. For outcome and scenario, we outlined the resulting urban structure, the institutions of development and operation and the households' ways of life, and assessed environmental impacts. The situation concept was found to be useful for identifying and analysing synergies between urbanization and sustainable development. It needs to be further developed to study the relationships between its four disciplinary aspects. Applying it to futurological studies calls for methodological development including scenario techniques and backcasting. Copyright (c) 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.

DT Article
AB In this article, I offer a clarification of the ambiguities surrounding the pivotal concepts that have shaped and will continue to shape environmental education movement in the United States and beyond: nature, conservation, sustainable development, and environmental justice. I point out that dualistic frameworks not only polarize environmental educators' ethical, political, and pedagogical values but also oversimplify complicated ecological issues. It is critical to generate inclusive and collective pedagogical efforts that recognize the interactions between the natural and the cultural, the possibility of integrating ecocentric and technocentric conservation education movements, and the need to foster humility for ongoing dialogues concerning sustainable development and environmental justice.

AB The scope of this work was to show the utility of thermal analysis and calorimetric experiments to study the thermal oxidative degradation of Mediterranean scrubs. We investigated the thermal degradation of four species; DSC and TGA were used under air sweeping to record oxidative reactions in dynamic conditions. Heat released and mass loss are important data to be measured for wildland fires modelling purpose and fire hazard studies on ligno-cellulosic fuels. Around 638 and 778 K, two dominating and overlapped exothermic peaks were recorded in DSC and individualized using a experimental and numerical separation. This stage allowed obtaining the enthalpy variation of each exothermic phenomenon. As an application, we propose to classify the fuels according to the heat released and the rate constant of each reaction. TGA experiments showed under air two successive mass loss around 638 and 778 K. Both techniques are useful in order to measure ignitability, combustibility and sustainability of forest fuels.

AB This paper examines local responses to potential ecotourism development in the Tawushan Nature Reserve located in southeastern Taiwan. Community attitude and intention toward four dimensions of ecotourism, including conservation of natural resources, preservation of cultural tradition, sustainable community development, and participation in ecotourism planning and management, were measured. Furthermore, the paper examines whether or not there is congruence between community attitude and intention toward ecotourism development. Analysis is based on data collected using face-to-face questionnaire interviews in two indigenous communities consisting primarily of the Paiwan ethnic group. The study findings show that local people hold generally positive views of the measures necessary to achieve ecotourism; however, their intentions to engage in behaviors to support these measures do not entirely match with their positive views. This suggests that while local residents may support ecotourism development based on international guidelines, their intentions to act will depend on local environmental, social, and politico-economic conditions. It is suggested that issues related to community empowerment, relationship between government and communities, value conflicts introduced by ecotourism development, and the dynamics among and between various community groups will need to be addressed if positive community intention to participate in ecotourism is to be encouraged.

AB E-travel agencies adopt B2B strategic alliances in order to strengthen their competitive advantages in the e-commerce travel market and because they are an effective tool to gain wider sustainable gains. External environmental and internal organizational factors impacting the success of strategic alliances model are themselves a crucial issue. This study uses multiple methods to collect data from multiple sources and uses qualitative and quantitative surveys. A two-stage research design is adopted to explore the present strategic alliances between Taiwan's wholesaler e-travel agencies and retailer sub-agencies. The results provide an in-depth understanding into the B2B e-commerce strategic alliance model. According to this research, Taiwanese e-travel agencies consider three external environment uncertainties, five internal organization motivations, five partner selection criteria, and two performance measurements of alliance strategies. Finally, the paper proposes an optimal B2B e-commerce strategic alliance model that matches the essential development needs of B2B e-commerce and overcomes the environmental uncertainties.

TI Suburban life and the boundaries of nature: resilience and rupture in

AB Despite an academic shift from dualistic to hybrid frameworks of culture/nature relations, separationist paradigms of environmental management have great resilience and vernacular appeal. The conditions under which they are reinforced, maintained or ruptured need more detailed attention because of the urgent environmental challenges of a humanly transformed earth. We draw on research in 265 Australian backyard gardens, focusing on two themes where conceptual and material bounding practices intertwine; spatial boundary-making and native plants. We trace the resilience of separationist approaches in the Australian context to the overlay of indigeneity/ non-indigeneity atop other dualisms, and their rupture to situations of close everyday engagement between people, plants, water and birds. Our ethnographic methods show that gardens are places where both attitudes and practices can change in the process of such engagements. In a world where questions of sustainability are increasingly driven by cities and their residents, these chains of agency help identify areas of hope and transformative potential as well as concern.

TI Sustainable soundscapes: Noise policy and the urban experience
SO URBAN STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
ID COMMUNITY; POLLUTION; LANDSCAPES; EXPOSURE; SENSE; CITY; UK
AB This paper introduces regulatory components influencing city soundscapes in Europe and the UK, illustrating the abatement approach taken within noise policy, demonstrating the importance of individual experience in assessing the soundscapes of urban environments and identifying a terminology to facilitate an introduction of soundscapes into the planning process. Drawing on work from soundscape ecology, a way is demonstrated to coalesce these divergent positions. Reviewing interviews undertaken in Clerkenwell, the paper demonstrates that it is not simply noise levels that are important to people in an urban area. Context, source, distance, temporariness and control over noise, are all relevant to whether people would want to see a particular sound eliminated from their soundscape. Using Schafer's terminology 'keynote sounds', 'soundmarks' and 'sound signals', a rationale is proposed through which experienced soundscapes may be articulated, challenging the strategy of noise abatement which could produce a conformity of soundscape that homogenises place and dissolves local uniqueness.

AB Coastal uses have deeply evolved these last decades and high anthropogenic pressures on coastal ecosystems have affected the sustainability of these areas with respect to the services and the resources they may provide. Traditional fisheries management has failed to avoid overexploitation of most coastal marine resources. Management measures based on an Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM) are thus required. Spatial management covers various ranges of properties that may enhance usual regulatory means. If spatial considerations are explicitly integrated in fisheries management, the latter may contribute to zoning design in order to balance the economic, social and biological values of natural marine resources. While traditional fisheries management approaches protect resource based on population numbers, Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) protect ecosystem in space. Besides their ecological effects on fish assemblages within its boundaries, MPAs can enhance adjacent artisanal fisheries. MPAs can thus ensure the sustainability of fisheries and at the same time maintain non-fisheries benefits of marine ecosystems to society.

TI An international waste convention: measures for achieving sustainable

SO WASTE MANAGEMENT & RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article

AB Waste is a by-product of economic growth. Consequently, economic growth presents challenges for sustainable resource management and development because continued economic growth implies continued growth in waste outputs. Poor management of waste results in the inappropriate depletion of natural resources and potentially adverse effects on the environment, health and the economy. It is unsustainable. This paper begins by outlining the magnitude of and the current response to the growth in the quantity of waste outputs. This is followed by a consideration of why the international response to date, including the Rio Declaration and Agenda 21, fails to address the issue adequately. The paper concludes with a discussion on why and how an international treaty or other measure could advance sustainable development by providing an appropriate framework within which to address the problem.

AB Multi-day rainfall events appear to be an important cause of recent flooding in the UK. Hydrological data from an extensive, nested hydrometric network in the unregulated, predominantly rural Upper Eden catchment in northern England are presented for one such flood event. These highlight antecedent catchment conditions and the propagation of the multi-day flood event during February 2004. An assessment of flood response is provided over varying scales and land use between the upland Gais Gill catchment (I. I km(2)) and the larger Upper Eden catchment (616 km(2)). Large spatial variations in rainfall totals are identified from a dense raingauge network during the flood event and are principally related to catchment elevation. High cumulative rainfall totals for the 6-day event, particularly at upland sites appear to be the exceptional feature of the flood event with return periods in the order of 100 years at some upland gauges. Resultant patterns of flood attenuation and translation are quantified in different areas of the catchment, highlighting the flashy response of the headwater catchments and the attenuated downstream response in the lowland environment. The study forms part of the national Catchment Hydrology And Sustainable Management (CHASM) programme.

TI Wind-aerated lagoons for sustainable treatment of wastewaters from small
   communities
SO WATER AND ENVIRONMENT JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
DE lagoon treatment; small communities; UWWTD; wastewater treatment
AB Biological treatment processes that milise wind-aerated lagoons have proved popular for small communities because of their negligible sludge production. Scottish Water has recently constructed one such system, known as the Aero-Fac (North Dakota, USA), and this paper reports on an intensive 12-month study designed to both monitor the lagoon performance and establish the key design parameters. Over the monitoring period the final effluent complied with both Scottish Environmental Protection Agency discharge consents and Scottish Water performance guarantees for biochemical oxygen demand and total suspended solids, which averaged 9 and 28mg/L, respectively. The lagoons showed an accelerated growth of algae during the summer months, but this did not adversely affect the final effluent suspended solids. The lagoons also achieved a faecal coliform removal of around 3.4 log and an average effluent ammonia of 7.6 mg/L. However, the ammonia removal was seasonal with a better performance in the summer months, which probably reflects take-up by the growing algal population over this period. No sludge was wasted from the lagoon over the monitoring period yet it accumulated only sparingly in the lagoons, mainly around the inlet of the primary lagoon. The estimated per capita sludge accumulation rate was 0.0047 m(3)/person/year. The total capital costs of,the scheme were 1.65 pound million, and of this the lagoon cost was 840 pound 000. The capital costs of 420 pound per capita make this more expensive than other, similar options, but plant operating costs are significantly reduced.

AB The Water Framework Directive (WFD) is potentially the most significant piece of water management legislation to be developed by the European Union (EU) in the last forty years. Whilst water legislation is already regarded by many people as the 'gold plating' of EU environmental policy, many of the previous regulations and policies have focussed on specific point and non-point source water quality problems and have stipulated stringent standards to be achieved within specified time limits. In sharp contrast, the WFD aims to establish a planning and management framework for sustainable use of water and the ecological restoration of entire river systems, many of which do not fit neatly within the political or administrative boundaries of the Member States. Public participation in planning and management decisions is a key aspect of the WFD. This paper describes the specific requirements of the WFD for public participation and examines their implementation in the Ribble basin in North West England. The Ribble is part of a EU river basin network designed to test the WFD implementation guidelines issued by the European Commission. Particular challenges associated with engaging stakeholders in WFD implementation are highlighted and recommendations for future practice are offered

ID VALLEY IRRIGATION DISTRICT; LAND; IMPACT; POLICY; AREAS
AB The Water Framework Directive (WFD) of the European Commission considers water supply and sanitation on agricultural and forestry holdings as a part of water management policy. In this sense, this study analyses the current situation in Galicia, European Union, in terms of the management of wastes derived from dairying, and the attitudes of farmers toward this issue and government regulations. The study was carried out by conducting a field survey to 4384 farm owners. The farms were classified according to the income level (size) and the priority status of the farm, and the current situation was defined based on the results obtained from the survey. The most positive aspect revealed by the survey is the willingness of farmers to improve wastewater management, which is a meaningful data because 72% of the farmers declared to use some system for wastewater collection or treatment.

ID ESTIMATING EVAPOTRANSPIRATION; WETLAND
AB A dynamic hydrologic model was developed for the Ortuluakar Marsh in Turkey to investigate the causes of water-level decreases observed since the 1990s and to explore potential remediation and sustainability options. Ortuluakar Marsh is a sub-system of the Sultan Marshes ecosystem, a large wetland complex consisting of freshwater marshes and salt-water lakes in the Develi Basin of south-central Turkey. The wetland has experienced significant seasonal and long-term waterlevel changes after the construction of an irrigation project in the catchment. The model uses a monthly time scale and solves the unsteady water-balance equation. Inputs from precipitation, overland flow, springs and ground water, and outputs due to evapotranspiration and surface flow are represented in the model. The model was calibrated to fit monthly water-level measurements from 1997 to 2003. Sensitivity analyses showed that the model is highly sensitive to evapotranspiration and ground-water inflow. Simulations of several water allocation options suggest that ground-water use should be reduced in the Develi Basin to halt the decline in water level in the Ortuluakar Marsh.

AB The hazel grouse Bonasa bonasia is declining in many areas within its European distribution, particularly in managed forests. Adequate habitat management may thus be crucial for the regional survival of the species. So far management activities have tended to focus on the local scale. However, for the sustainable management of the hazel grouse and its habitat, the landscape scale also needs to be considered. We therefore evaluated whether habitat suitability for hazel grouse can be quickly, but adequately, modelled at the landscape scale with information obtained from aerial photographs. We mapped hazel grouse records in a forested area typical of large tracts of the Swiss Jura mountain range, and extracted data on habitat composition from infrared aerial photographs applying a bird-centred sampling approach. We then used the hazel grouse records together with an equal-sized data set of non-grouse plots to build predictive habitat suitability models using a generalised linear model (GLM) and a classification tree (TREE). The models were evaluated and then applied spatially explicitly to the 25 km 2 study area to compare their predictions for hazel grouse distribution. Hazel grouse preferred vertically and horizontally richly structured forest stands. Forest edge density, shrub and herb cover, stand structure and development stage were essential habitat variables. The resulting 5-fold cross-validated predictive habitat models performed well, having a kappa of 0.62 (GLM) and 0.8 (TREE), and a correct classification rate of 0.81 (GLM) and 0.90 (TREE). This suggests that predictive modelling based on a bird-centred analysis is an efficient way to assess habitat suitability for hazel grouse habitat management at the landscape scale.

AB We use simple, multivariate evolutionary models to evaluate the short-term potential for size-selective harvest to reduce genetic variability and alter life history in cervids. These genetic effects limit sustainable levels of harvest of the animals because they determine how changes in sex ratio, generation length and traits contributing to fitness influence population growth rate and local adaptation. Our analysis of harvest-mediated adaptive evolution employs a genetic approach that parameterizes models with empirical data obtained from European red deer Cervus elaphus. The analysis indicates that harvest, if sufficiently high to reduce the breeding ratio of males to females to below about 15: 100, can reduce effective population size to a level that threatens adaptive potential. The reduction in effective size is realized through decreases in both sex ratio of breeders and the age of breeding males. Predicted selective effects of harvest on body size indicates a weak potential to alter most life-history traits over 10 generations under two harvest scenarios; the patterns suggest that current modes of harvest are unlikely to produce substantial life-history changes in red deer over 10 or fewer generations unless the genetic influences on red deer traits are considerably higher than those predicted here. Nevertheless, male reproductive success is expected to decline detectably if male harvest rate is sufficiently high (> 30%). Collectively, our results imply that harvest methods should permit higher post-hunt male:female ratios (18: 100 or higher) and ensure that a sufficient number of larger, older males survive the breeding season. The capacity of selective harvest to alter demography and life history depends heavily on the genetic covariance structure underlying variation in these traits, information that is unknown for many red deer populations. Prudent harvest management should therefore implement and monitor approaches to hunting that aim to conserve life-history variation; meanwhile, use of less selective methods can reduce the risk to long-term adaptive potential and may permit higher sustainable harvest rates.

TI Effects of falconry harvest on wild raptor populations in the United
   States: Theoretical considerations and management recommendations
SO WILDLIFE SOCIETY BULLETIN
LA English
DT Article
DE demographics; falconry; harvest; maximum sustainable yield; modeling;

ID SURVIVAL; BREEDERS; MODELS
AB We used recent population data and a deterministic matrix model that accounted for important aspects of raptor population biology to evaluate the likely impact of falconry harvest (including take of different age classes) on wild raptor populations in the United States. The harvest rate at maximum sustainable yield (MS) ranged from 0.03 to 0.41 for the species examined. At least for peregrine falcons (Falco peregrinus), harvest rate at MSY was greatest for nestlings and lowest for adults. The quality of demographic data for the species influenced MSY. For most species the state of current knowledge probably underestimates the capacity for allowed harvest because estimates of vital rates, particularly survival, are biased low, because emigration is not distinguished from survival. This is offset somewhat by biases that might overestimate sustainability inherent in MSY-based analyses and deterministic models. Taking these factors into consideration and recognizing the impracticality of monitoring raptor populations to determine actual effects of harvest, we recommend that falconry harvest rates for juvenile raptors in the United States not exceed one-half of the estimated MSY up to a maximum of 5%, depending on species-specific estimates of capacity to sustain harvest. Under this guideline, harvest rates of up to 5% of annual production are supported for northern goshawks (Accipter gentilis), Harris's hawks (Parabuteo unicinctus), peregrine falcons, and golden eagles (Aquila chrysaetos); lower harvest rates are recommended for other species until better estimates of vital rates confirm greater harvest potential.

AB In this article, we study 19 developing and developed countries to identify key challenges, approaches, and innovations in strategic and coordinated action for sustainable development at the national level. We are interested in the institutional fabric of implementing sustainable development. What are governments actually doing to organize the processes required for this? What are the institutional innovations in this regard and what kind of typologies can be identified?
   Despite some true progress made, our findings indicate that countries are still at the early stages of learning toward effective action for sustainable development. This applies both to developing and developed countries. Key unsolved challenges include (a) coordination with the national budget, (b) coordination with sub-national level sustainable development strategies, and (c) coordination with other national-level strategy processes.

AB Nanofiltration is an effective technique in improving the organic matter removal from coagulated surface water, but the process should also be economically feasible and environmentally sustainable when applied. Cost and environmental impact of nanofiltration installed after conventional surface water treatment were calculated and evaluated at different operating parameters in this study. The installation of nanofiltration after conventional surface water treatment would increase the cost of treated water in a minimum by 0.11 EURO/m(3) in the studied case. The least cost was gained at the higher studied recovery (83%) at the driving pressure of 6 bar, where also the total environmental impact was well balanced. However, the installation of nanofiltration would increase the environmental impact of water treatment remarkably and improvements should be done to minimise these effects. The main ways to minimise the cost of nanofiltration were related to recovery of the process, energy consumption, membrane lifetime and membrane cleaning, whereas the environmental impact minimisation was mostly related to recovery of the process and energy consumption.

AB Participatory approaches to natural resource management and development are widely accepted as effective instruments for achieving sustainable resource management particularly in the developing nations. This paper presents an over-view of soft system dynamics methods under a participatory modeling framework that is consistent with participatory approaches to assessing sustainable forest management. Three general types of soft system dynamics models are described: cognitive mapping, qualitative system dynamics, and fuzzy cognitive mapping. The three models entail different information requirements, knowledge base, and varying degrees of complexity. The models can be developed and used as stand-alone resource management tools. Or, depending on the level of complexity and the availability of information about the resource management system in question, they can be integrated to constitute a more robust and flexible planning framework. This paper describes applications of these models in different case studies. Applications of the first two models are reported in detail elsewhere, hence, they are only described briefly. The third model, called fuzzy cognitive mapping, is described in more detail including an illustrative case study. Experiences and lessons learned from these selected sets of applications are also discussed. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.X. All rights reserved.

AB The Okavango basin comprises the Cuito and Cubango active catchment areas in Angola, in addition to the Kavango-Okavango non-active catchment in northern Namibia and Botswana. The Okavango River water and its ecosystem resources are critically important sources of livelihoods for people in the basin. Pressures from livelihoods and development are already impacting on the environment. These pressures may increase in the future due to the rapid increase in population, the peace process and associated resettlement activities in Angola, and major development initiatives in Botswana and Namibia. For instance, possible future increase in water abstraction from the Okavango River may affect the long-term environmental sustainability of the Okavango Delta by minimizing channel shifting and thereby reducing spatial biodiversity. The paper argues that while conservation of the natural environment is critical, the pressing development needs must be recognized. The reduction of poverty within the basin should be addressed in order to alleviate adverse effects on the environment. The paper recommends that the development of sustainable tourism and community-based natural resource management initiatives may be appropriate strategies for reaching the Millennium Development Goals of poverty alleviation and achievement of environmental sustainability in the Okavango Basin. These initiatives have a comparative advantage in this area as demonstrated by the performance of the existing projects. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Estimations of hydrological descriptors are required for studying links between river flow and ecological processes at different scales, from local scale at which biological and/or water quality data are usually available, to larger scale for sustainable development purposes. The study of regional hydrology has seen significant advances in recent years due to new developments in statistics, environmental database access, and calculating capabilities. Nevertheless, theoretical difficulties for mapping and for estimating river regime characteristics at ungauged locations remain because of the nature of the variable under study: river flows are related to a specific area, i.e. the drainage basin, and are hierarchically organized in space through the river network with upstream-downstream dependencies. This presentation aims at describing a method for producing choropleth maps of average runoff and computing mean discharge along the main river network. The approach applied to mean annual runoff is based on geostatistical interpolation procedures coupled with empirical relationships and is illustrated by an application to assess water resource in France. The performance of the developed approach is tested against two other geostatistical methods (ordinary kriging and residual kriging). This study concludes that the classical approaches for interpolation can be improved by explicitly introducing hydrological properties of the mapped variable. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

AB Cytotoxicity can in principle be maximized if drugs with different activities can be delivered simultaneously to the same cell. However, combination therapy with drugs having distinct properties such as solubility generally requires use of multiple carriers or solvents, limiting the likelihood of simultaneous delivery. In this brief report, we describe the in vivo use of biodegradable polymersomes for systemic delivery of an anticancer cocktail. These polymer-based shells exploit a thick hydrophobic membrane and an aqueous lumen to efficiently carry both hydrophobic and hydrophilic drugs, respectively paclitaxel and doxorubicin. Polymersomes are long-circulating in vivo but also degrade and release their drugs on a time scale of about 1 day, by which time the tumors treated here will otherwise have almost doubled in volume. A single systemic injection of the dual drug combination shows a higher maximum tolerated dose than the free drug cocktail and shrinks tumors more effectively and more sustainably than free drug: 50% smaller tumors are seen at 5 days with polymersomes. The polymersomes cause two-fold higher cell death in tumors than free drug and show quantitatively similar increases in maximum tolerated dose and drug accumulation within the tumors-suggesting promise for multi-drug delivery.

AB The primary goal of this research was to explore the potential of farmer's knowledge as a source of information on the past and present cultural landscapes, focusing on the land-use system, the cultural heritage, and the farmer's perception of landscape changes, from the 1950s to the present day. For this purpose, 42 semi-structured interviews were conducted from a random sample of 10% of the villages in an area of the Northern Mountains of Galicia (NW Spain). As shown in farmers' reports, the main crops in the 1950s were wheat or rye, potatoes or maize (only near the coast) and turnips. Scrubland areas were an essential resource for pasture, litter, temporary crops and charcoal, whereas deciduous forest was mainly used as a source of wood for carpentry, firewood and litter. Agriculture was the main economic activity, whereas crafts and other activities in the fisheries or forestry industry were secondary. Granaries, watermills and stone laundry basins were the most frequent elements of built heritage that was mentioned in the interviews. Farmers were also comprehensively aware of the broad changes that occurred in the landscape. The results indicate that farmer's knowledge is a valuable source of information for documenting past and present land-use practices, local cultural heritage and changes in the landscape, all of which are helpful for the design of landscape-orientated policies. Moreover, observed ancestral cultural practices, such as extensive grazing in scrubland areas, may be promoted as strategies for helping the sustainability of cultural landscapes in the study area and in other areas with similar characteristics.

AB As small island developing states work towards economically and environmentally sustainable development, they lack many of the financial, technical, and information management resources available in larger, more developed countries. The ability to acquire geographic information and integrate it into decision-making processes is particularly difficult. Yap, a member of the Federated States of Micronesia, exemplifies many small island developing states in its effort to develop an informational infrastructure. This paper describes the early steps of on-going work by Yapese scientists, governmental agencies, and non-governmental organizations, and Queens University of Charlotte to start a successful GIS program. It is intended that this program will contribute to a future planning support system. Early application of Yap's GIS has resulted in a dramatic reduction in area of an invasive grass (Imperata cylindrica) and increased knowledge and use of GIS by Yapese decision-makers.

AB Landscape change occurs through the interaction of a multitude of natural and human driving forces at a range of organisational levels, with humans playing an increasingly dominant role in many regions of the world. Building on the current knowledge of the underlying drivers of landscape change, a conceptual framework of regional landscape change was developed which integrated population, economic and cultural values, policy and science/technology. Using the Southern Brigalow Belt biogeographic region of Queensland as a case study, the role of natural and human drivers in landscape change was investigated in four phases of settlement since 1840. The Brigalow Belt has experienced comparable rates of vegetation clearance over the past 50 years to areas of tropical deforestation. Economic factors were important during all phases of development, but the five regional drivers often acted in synergy. Environmental constraints played a significant role in slowing rates of change. Temporal trends of deforestation followed a sigmoidal curve, with initial slow change accelerating though the middle phases then slowing in recent times. Future landscape management needs to take account of the influence of all the components of the conceptual framework, at a range of organisational levels, if more ecologically sustainable outcomes are to be achieved.

AB The effect of management and soil type on the development of an experimental prairie plant community was investigated over a 4-year period. Soil type had a greater affect than management treatment, with poor persistence of the prairie community on topsoil plots largely irrespective of management. On sand mulched plots, prairie persistence was high. Burning was the most successful management technique for maintaining prairie plant cover and facilitating recruitment of prairie seedlings. The most successful treatment combinations were generally sand mulching plus spring burning. Sand mulching was successful because it minimised weed germination and competition in the first growing season hence allowing prairie species to dominate and compete effectively with invading weeds in subsequent years. Sand mulching also minimised slug grazing in spring, hence mortality of adult prairie plants was reduced and seedling recruitment facilitated. Although seedling recruitment occurred within the experiment, no seedlings of prairie plants were observed to establish outside the experiment. This, in combination with the observation that where not managed by spring burning, prairie communities declined or disappeared, strongly suggests that the species used in the study do not pose a naturalisation threat to native vegetation in northern England. The management techniques used in the study vary considerably in terms of efficacy and energy consumption and are discussed in relation to practice in public parks and other urban landscapes.

AB Most Chinese municipal governments and urban planners have attempted to conserve and create urban greenspace in response to rapid urbanization. It is a major task for urban landscape planners to construct an effective and harmonious urban ecological network and maintain a sustainable urban development environment. In this paper, the present situation and a recent greenway augment plan of Xiamen Island were assessed using a series of landscape metrics. The results showed that the recent greenway augment plan could improve the present greenway system considerably. The improvements were indicated by decrease in patch density, and increase in total class area and edge density on the patch level, landscape diversity, landscape evenness and landscape connectivity on the landscape level. On the basis of these analyses, a number of alternative planning scenarios were designed by using network analysis methods for improving the ecological network of Xiamen Island. An alternative planning scenario was proposed to decrease the degree of landscape fragmentation, increase the shape complexity of greenway patches and enhance the landscape connectivity. The results indicated that methods which integrate landscape metrics with network analyses could not only quantitatively assess the present situation and the rationality of planning for urban greenway systems, but also facilitate the design of planning scenarios for urban ecological networks, enabling them to meet the principles of conformity, harmony, circulation, safety, diversity and sustainability. The principles and methods of landscape ecology, and the greenway concepts that have originated in the West can be useful for Chinese landscape planning and can be applied to greenway development in China.

AB The SUBAT-project evaluates the opportunity to keep nickel-cadmium traction batteries for electric vehicles on the exemption list of European Directive 2000/53 on End-of-Life Vehicles. The aim of the SUBAT-project is to deliver a complete assessment of commercially available and forthcoming battery technologies for battery-electric, hybrid or fuel cell vehicles. This assessment includes a technical, an economical and an environmental study of the different battery technologies, including the nickel-cadmium technology. In a general perspective, the impacts of the different battery technologies should be analysed individually to allow the comparison of the different chemistries (lead-acid, nickel-cadmium, nickel-metal hydride, lithium-ion, sodium-nickel chloride,...) and to enable the definition of the most environmentally friendly battery technology for electrically propelled vehicles.
   The project officially ran from 2004-01-01 to 2005-03-31. This paper summarizes the outcome of the project at the time of the submission of the paper, i.e. January 2005. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A model for the amplitude-frequency (A-f) effect in electrostatic microresonators is presented. This effect is an undesired nonlinear phenomenon that sets the maximum usable oscillation current and thereby degrades the resonator's signal-to-noise ratio and performance. The model developed in this letter provides analytical expressions for the A-f effect and derives an optimal bias condition that maximizes the usable current. In addition, the authors present experimental data for a double-ended-tuning-fork resonator. Using the derived bias condition, an improvement of more than two times in the sustainable oscillation current has been achieved. (c) 2006 American Institute of Physics.

AB Agricultural Water Management began in 1976 with Dr. Jans Wesseling as Editor in Chief and Dr. N.A. de Ridder as Associate Editor. Dr. Wesseling stated the purpose of the journal in his editorial published in the first issue as follows: "that the new journal will contribute to the fruitful exchange of ideas and knowledge of the role of the most commonly occurring fluid in the world on the production of our daily food". Papers about the role water plays in agriculture have been published based on national, regional, or even local studies of interest to the readers. In 1977, the first full year of publication, 19 papers were published. In 2005, that total swelled to 129. From the beginning through 2005, 1581 papers were published in 78 volumes including 15 special issues. The ambit of the journal has always been global, publishing results from industrialized and developing countries. In the first year, authors from 10 nations published papers in the journal; 44 countries were represented in 2005. People from 21 countries have served on the journal's Advisory Editorial Board.
   The journal's Impact Factor (based on how often its papers are cited) during the past decade has risen from 0.3 to 0.8. Since 2002, it has ranked in the upperhalf of the 55 journals in the Water Resources class according to Thomson Scientific. Electronic submission and review began in 2004. After registration, authors submit papers to http://ees.elsevier.com/ agwat/default.asp, and reviewer comments, and manuscript revisions are conducted electronically under the supervision of the Editors in Chief. A web-based system enables authors in remote locations to submit manuscripts without any expenditure for photocopying or postage. it also speeds the publication process in an area of science that is rapidly evolving, and new work can be cited quickly when published in Agricultural Water Management.

TI Subsurface drainage practices: From manual installation to large-scale

LA English
DT Article

   quality control; capacity building
AB Drainage of agricultural lands is an instrument for production growth, a safeguard for sustainable investment in irrigation, and a tool for conservation of land resources. Projections to meet the food and fibre needs of the world during the next 25 years shows that drainage of at least 10-15 million ha should be improved, which will require an investment of EUR 19 billion or about 750 EUR million annually. It is expected that one third of this area will be provided with subsurface drainage systems.
   Subsurface drainage has been practiced for thousands of years, however, the rapid introduction in Europe and North America only started around 1940, when the prevailing empirical knowledge of drainage and salinity control gained a solid theoretical foundation. Since then, the installation practices evolved from purely manual installation on individual farm plots to fully mechanized installation programmes covering thousands of hectares. To make this rapid change possible, practical tools for the implementation had to be developed, starting with the introduction of new types of installation equipment, i.e. trencher and trenchless drainage machines. To optimize the use of these machines, however, a number of problems had to be solved. New materials for drain pipes and envelopes had to be developed to reduce the high transportation and installation cost of the traditional materials and to improve quality of construction. Next, the traditional method of quality control proved to be inadequate because of the increased speed and method of mechanical installation. And last but not least, staff had to be trained in these modernised drainage machinery and installation techniques, as well as in the planning and organization of the implementation process. This paper discusses these developments in installation techniques, equipment and materials, and the corresponding institutional changes that were needed to keep up with these changing demands. These developments are still going on to meet the specific needs of installation in developing countries, under climatic, physical and social conditions that differ from the ones for which they have been designed. Furthermore, the specific needs of drainage are also changes, particularly with regards to the quality of drainage water, that require changes in the drain system design and corresponding installation practices.

AB Microirrigation with fertigation provides an effective and cost-efficient way to supply water kand nutrients to crops. However, less-than-optimum management of microirrigation systems may cause inefficient water and nutrient use, thereby diminishing expected yield benefits and contributing to ground water pollution if water and nitrogen applications are excessive. The quality of soils, ground, and surface waters is specifically vulnerable in climatic regions where agricultural production occurs mostly by irrigation such as in California. Robust guidelines for managing microirrigation systems are needed so that the principles of sustainable agriculture are satisfied. The main objective of this research was to use an adapted version of the HYDRUS-2D computer model to develop irrigation and fertigation management tools that maximize production, yet minimize adverse environmental effects. This software package can simulate the transient two-dimensional or axisymmetrical three-dimensional movement of water and nutrients in soils. In addition, the model allows for specification of root water and nitrate uptake, affecting the spatial distribution of water and nitrate availability between irrigation cycles. Recently, we analyzed four different microirrigation systems in combination with five different fertigation strategies for various soil types using a nitrate-only fertilizer, clearly demonstrating the effect of fertigation strategy on the nitrate distribution in the soil profile and on nitrate leaching. In the present study, the HYDRUS-2D model was used to model the distribution of soil nitrogen and nitrate leaching using a urea-ammonium-nitrate fertilizer, commonly used for fertigation under drip irrigation. In addition, the distribution of phosphorus and potassium was modeled. Model simulations are presented for surface drip and subsurface drip tape, each associated with a typical crop in California.

AB Irrigation impacts land and water resources in ways that can reduce farm productivity. Irrigation also causes off-farm impacts, such as waterlogging, salinization, and degradation of water quality in rivers and lakes. Farmers and public officials must determine acceptable levels of the direct and indirect costs involved in sustaining irrigated agriculture. Farm-level and policy decisions will vary among regions with differences in economic development, resource endowments, and public preferences regarding the inevitable impacts of irrigation on the environment. Hence, the notion of irrigation sustainability will vary among regions and over time with differences in public preferences.
   We discuss several policy alternatives in concept and we describe two examples in which public policies have influenced irrigation sustainability: (1) efforts to reduce salt loads from the Wellton-Mohawk division of the Gila river project in Arizona, and (2) efforts to reduce the negative environmental impacts of irrigation and drainage on the west side of the San Joaquin Valley in California. In both cases, the environmental costs of irrigation and drainage have increased over time, leading some observers to suggest that irrigation should be discontinued in some areas and water should be re-allocated to non-agricultural uses.
   Our conclusion regarding sustainability is shared by other authors: Irrigation is sustainable, but the direct costs and environmental impacts can be substantial. Technology is not a limiting factor. Societies must determine the costs and environmental consequences they are willing to incur to achieve sustainability and how those costs are allocated among individuals who benefit directly or indirectly.

AB Water has been labelled 'blue gold', and 'blue gold' is destined to be the critical issue of the 21st Century. Globally, irrigation is responsible for 80% of the world-wide spending of 'blue gold'.
   Development of sustainable irrigation practices will require that we understand better the biophysical processes of root-water uptake in soil, and transpiration from plant canopies.
   Our review paper is divided into four parts: models, measurements, knowledge gaps and policy.
   First, we present a retrospective on what has been done with root-water uptake models since the pioneering scheme of Wilford R. Gardner in 1960. His solution for water movement to a plant root was analytical. Since then, nearly all the models calculate water flow using numerical solutions of the Richards' equation. These schema include a water-uptake term specifically for the distributed uptake of water from soil by the root system. These models fall into two groups based on how the uptake term is handled. The most common formulations, called Type I, have evolved from the work of Gardner [Gardner, W.R., 1960. Dynamic aspects of water availability to plants. Soil Sci. 89, 63-73] and describe the microscale physics of water flow from the soil to, and through, the plant roots. The second form, Type II, comprises macroscopic, empirical functions that describe uptake based on responses to water potential. We discuss the merits and potential of these schemes. Yet, models are data hungry. Effective modeling requires apposite parameterisation to be effective. This can require substantive empiricism. Second, we present new data on the functioning of root-water uptake and transpiration by kiwifruit vines. We describe new observations in the root zone, obtained using arrays of time domain reflectometry (TDR) sensors. As well, we present results obtained with new methods of sap-flow measurement inside the kiwifruit vine's roots. These reveal the uptake dynamics during partial root zone drying (PRD), a technique oft-touted to reduce irrigation volumes.
   Next, we outline future research needs. This includes a requirement to infer better the matric potential at the soil-root boundary and its control on plant transpiration.
   We suggest that the role of reverse flow and specification of the root resistance also needs more researching. Further, linking the functioning of water uptake with the form of the root system will not be achievable until we know more about root resistance. Canopy area and architecture are critical for controlling transpiration, yet they are tiresome to measure. Improved measurement techniques, preferably remote, would enhance our ability to predict crop water-use and to assess more accurately the need for irrigation [Wesseling, J.G., Feddes, R.A., 2006. Assessing crop water productivity from field to regional scale. Agric. Water Manage. 86, 30-39].
   Finally, we demonstrate how our scientific knowledge can be used to develop sustainable irrigation practices. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Six experimental diets were fed to rainbow trout to examine the effect of fish hydrolysate and ultra filtered fish hydrolysate on growth performance, feed utilization and growth regulation using diets low in dietary fish meal inclusion. One diet contained a high level of plant protein sources (90.6% of total dietary protein) and a low level of fish meal (9.4% of dietary protein). Two diets contained different levels of hydrolysate in exchange for the plant protein sources, reducing the plant protein level to 73.9% and 57.2%, respectively. Two further diets were identical in composition except that the hydrolysate was ultra filtered to remove low molecular weight compounds. A moderate level of fish meal was used in the sixth diet which had a dietary plant protein level of 57.0%. All diets were made equal in protein, lipid, energy and lysine. The feeding trial lasted for 90 days and for the fastest growing group, fed moderate level of fish meal, the fish increased in weight from 149 g at start to a final weight of 443 g. All groups showed significant differences in growth and feed utilizations. Specific growth rates were; 0.30% day(-1) for the plant protein diet, 0.98% day(-1) for the high hydrolysate diet, 0.72% day(-1) for the group containing the high level of ultra filtered hydrolysate, and 1.21% day(-1) for the moderate fish meal diet. Feed efficiencies (g fish weight gain per g feed intake) were found to be 0.57 for plant protein diet, 0.97 for high level of hydrolysate, 0.83 for ultra filtered hydrolysate and 1.03 for the moderate fish meal diet. Half dietary inclusions of hydrolysate and ultra filtered hydrolysate revealed values between the plant protein diets and high levels of these ingredients, respectively. Feed consumption in percentage of average fish weight per day, correlated with the feed efficiency for all groups. PER, PPV and BV correlated with the differences in growth. Protein digestibilities were equal for all groups, while the moderate fish meal diet showed higher lipid and energy digestibilities than the plant protein diets. Although some of the differences may be due to growth inhibitors in plant resources other explanations may be relevant. Plasma growth hormone (GH) levels were significantly higher in fish fed the plant protein diet than fish fed the fish meal or high hydrolysate diet, which is most likely a result of their poor feeding status. Plasma IGF-I levels were not affected by diet. Comparisons of groups with similar inclusion of plant ingredients, and thus equal level of growth inhibitors, show that in removing small molecular weight compounds from fish hydrolysate, the growth and feed efficiency were significantly reduced. Some of these small compounds in fish hydrolysate thus seem to be essential for biological performance. Further, as fish meal revealed the best performance, fish muscle protein is not the only nutrient that makes fish meal an essential ingredient in aqua feed for carnivorous fish. This information is important in the work to find replacement of fish meal in a sustainable growing global aquaculture industry. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Positive Exposure, a non-profit organization founded and directed by former fashion photographer Rick Guidotti and co-directed by psychiatrist Dr. Diane McLean, uses photography and video interviews to explore the lived experiences of people affected with genetic conditions. Positive Exposure challenges pervasive social biases and stereotypes about genetic variation and strives to broaden and enrich societal perceptions of human beauty and spirit. Presented here are the open-ended personal reflections completed by four individuals with craniofacial differences recruited from a support group, Inner Faces. These four case studies aim to relay the professional photo-shoot experiences of people who maybe challenged by the stigma associated with craniofacial differences. Questions addressed issues of perceived self-esteem, stigma, hopefulness, and photography experiences. These personal reflections were gathered 1 year following participation in a Positive Exposure photo-shoot. Participants described the ways in which the photo-shoot has been a lasting and life-promoting experience. In addition, these individuals emphasize the integral and enduring role the photographer, Rick Guidotti, played in their personal awakening. Positive Exposure provided these individuals with renewed identification of both inner and outer sources of beauty. These four case studies suggest that Positive Exposure may serve as a sustainable intervention to bolster self-esteem and self-image. Published 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB The commercial harvest of American matsutake (Tricholoma magnivelare) is a multi-million dollar industry in the Pacific Northwest region of North America. How to best manage for sustainable mushroom production is uncertain and concerns remain about the cumulative effects of picking in the same areas year-after-year and whether raking of surface litter and mineral soil layers to find mushrooms will reduce subsequent fruiting. Here, we evaluate the effects of several mushroom harvest techniques on American matsutake production.
   This study was established in the Oregon Cascades in 1994 with the selection of 18 shiros of similar mushroom production. Six mushroom harvest treatments were implemented in 1995: (1) control, (2) best management practice (BMP), (3) shallow rake, litter replaced, (4) shallow rake, no replacement, (5) deep rake, litter replaced, (6) deep rake, no replacement. These treatments were pooled into three litter disturbance groups for analysis: (a) no raking of the litter, (b) litter raked with replacement, and (c) litter raked without replacement. Matsutake production on additional shiros was monitored to further compare the control and BMP treatments. Our results demonstrate that careful picking (BMP) was not detrimental to mushroom production during the initial 10 years of mushroom harvest activity. One-time treatments in which the forest floor litter layers were removed and not replaced were strongly detrimental to matsutake production and the effects have persisted for 9 years.
   Matsutake production was reduced to an intermediate degree by the raking with litter replacement treatments. Damage to shiros caused by repeated raking was not tested, however we expect that the effects of repeated raking would be more severe than those reported here. Negative treatment effects were particularly noticeable in years with abundant fruiting. When environmental conditions are poor for fruiting all shiros experience low production, thereby obscuring treatment effects.
   Within-year and year-to-year variation in fruiting is a major challenge to studies of matsutake ecology, particularly with regard to documenting treatment effects. Further studies spanning years or even decades will likely be needed to quantify production, effects of management activities, and investigate the biology of Tricholoma magnivelare.
   Because this study was limited to one habitat type, extension of the results to substantially different habitats types must be made with caution. However, we speculate that since the underlying biology of matsutake fruiting is similar across a wide range of habitats, careful picking should generally not hinder subsequent fruiting when other substantial disturbance to the shiro is absent.

AB The Brazilian government is rapidly establishing millions of hectares of national forests (FLONAs) in the Amazon rainforest. The strategy behind the establishment of the FLONAs is to bring legal logging to areas where it is more easily controlled, taxed, and sustainably managed than the "boom and bust" logging that occurs, and has historically occurred, on private property in the Amazon. Management of the FLONAs includes the levying of stumpage fees and administration taxes to generate operating revenue and foster more sustainable logging practices. We consider alternative policies available to FLONA administrators that, under a certain set of assumptions, are sufficient to indemnify some social costs of tropical deforestation. Specifically, we look at various rates of profit and severance tax and examine how these affect logging firms' decisions regarding harvest rates and how these taxes might be used to establish an indemnity fund. This fund could be used to cover the FLONA's operations costs, placate local non-loggers, and offset externalities of logging. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Important decisions of mankind have for centuries been made using voting techniques, both in small groups and in nationwide elections. Currently, involvement of public in forestry decision making is seen as an important part of sustainable forest management, both as a means to an end and as an end in itself. In public participatory processes, issues such as fairness, representativity, and transparency are important, as well as in any election. Therefore, it is natural to utilise the achievements of voting theory also in decision support for sustainable forest management. In this article, first a review of basic voting techniques is given, along with some new techniques involving elements of fuzziness or randomness. Second, modifications of voting for multicriteria decision aid are presented and, finally, applications of voting to natural resources management are described. The applicability of voting approaches to the group decision support and participatory planning of forestry are discussed. The most significant advantages of voting methods for this kind of decision support processes were found to be their ability to deal with ordinal preferences of decision makers and ordinal evaluation data on alternatives. In addition, voting methods are comprehensive and easy to interpret. This makes the decision support process transparent and quick and convenient to implement even with large groups of people, and via information networks. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The aim of this study was the groundwater evaluation to pesticide compounds and nitrates in oriziculture areas of the 'Baixo Sado' region ( Portugal), based on their use, predictive approaches, and field and laboratory work. One or more of the pesticide compounds analysed (chlorfenvinphos, cycloxydim, 3,4-dichloroaniline, endosulphan, MCPA, molinate, oxadiazon, profoxydim, propanil) were detected in 62% of 171 water samples collected from 22 wells used for public supply, domestic supply, and irrigation, during 2002 and 2003. From the total samples, 6% presented maximum concentration levels of at least one of the compounds above 0.1 mu g L-1. Mixtures of pesticide compounds were observed in 25% of the total groundwater samples, with up to five substances being detected in each one. The concentration sum of all was above 0.5 mu g L-1 in four water samples. All the analysed compounds, with the exception of the insecticide chlorfenvinphos, occurred in groundwater. Molinate was the most frequently detected (55%), particularly with maximum concentration levels above 0.1 mu g L-1. Detection frequencies were higher in water samples collected from irrigation wells (78%). Groundwater exposure to total pesticides and nitrates was analysed. Maximum concentration levels were 59.6 mu g L-1 and 183 mg L-1 NO3-, respectively. A seasonal variation pattern could be observed for both parameters in water samples collected from some wells. The results from this study show that sustainable use of pesticides and nitrogen fertilizers is required in order to achieve an overall contamination reduction from these compounds in the aquatic environment.

AB The direct etherification of three disaccharidic polyols, sucrose, trehalose and isomalt (R), with 1,2-epoxydodecane was studied. The catalytic activity of various solid basic catalysts, differing by their superficial hydrophilic-lipophilic properties, was investigated. Disaccharide hydroxyalkylethers yields greater than 90% were obtained in a DMSO-water mixture in the presence of the recoverable PS-NOH solid catalyst. The regioselectivity of the reaction was fully investigated by HPLC and NMR. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Chickens infected with Salmonella enterica serovars Typhimurium (ST) and Enteritidis (SE) still represent a major source of human food poisoning via consumption of contaminated meat and eggs. Vaccination represents a sustainable approach to control Salmonella in the chicken and the serovar specificity of immunity has the potential to impact on the need for multivalent vaccines. The issue of cross-reactive immune responses and cross-serovar protection was examined in these experiments. Cellular and humoral immune responses were measured by antigen-specific ELISA and splenocyte proliferation assays during primary infections (with ST and SE) and during a second challenge with homologous or heterologous serovars. Primary infection with ST or SE induced strong lymphocyte proliferation and high levels of specific antibody (IgM, IgG and IgA) responses with substantial serovar cross-reactivity. The occurrence of high levels of splenocyte proliferation and strong antibody responses corresponded to the initiation of clearance with both ST and SE. Re-challenge of ST and SE infection-primed chickens with either serovar resulted in significant levels of protection (assessed by bacterial numbers and rate of clearance) with little difference between homologous or heterologous challenge schedules. Relatively low levels of antigen-specific splenocyte proliferation were detected during secondary infection, which may be caused by splenic T cells exiting to the gut. In contrast, the more rapid specific antibody responses (compared with primary infection controls) indicate the development of a secondary antigen-specific adaptive response. The substantial level of cross-protection between serovars and the level of antigenic cross-reactivity indicates the potential for single serovar live vaccines to protect against both group B and D salmonellae.

TI Failure recovery for structured p2p networks: Protocol design and
   performance under churn

   rate; peer-to-peer networks
AB Measurement studies indicate a high rate of node dynamics in p2p systems. In this paper, we address the question of how high a rate of node dynamics can be supported by structured p2p networks. We confine our study to the hypercube routine scheme used by several structured p2p systems. To improve system robustness and facilitate failure recovery, we introduce the property of K-consistency, K >= 1, which generalizes consistency defined previously. (Consistency guarantees connectivity from any node to any other node.) We design and evaluate a failure recovery protocol based upon local information for K-consistent networks. The failure recovery protocol is then integrated with a join protocol that has been proved to construct K-consistent neighbor tables for concurrent joins. The integrated protocols were evaluated by a set of simulation experiments in which nodes joined a 2000-node network and nodes (both old and new) were randomly selected to fail concurrently over 10,000 s of simulated time. In each such "churn" experiment, we took a "snapshot" of neighbor tables in the network once every 50 s and evaluated connectivity and consistency measures over time as a function of the chum rate, timeout value in failure recovery, and K. We found our protocols to be effective, efficient, and stable for an average node lifetime as low as 8.3 min. Experiment results also show that the average routing delay of our protocols increases only slightly even when the churn rate is greatly increased. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Mural thrombi are composed dominantly of platelets and develop under a blood flow. Portions can break off and are carried in the blood flow as emboli. Thrombus growth rates are affected by the velocity of the blood flow, but they do not simply increase with it, they exhibit a maximum, with subsequent decrease. Whereas this variation indicates an interaction of biochemical and physical processes, studies have concentrated widely on understanding only the biochemical processes. Here we show results of simulation of thrombus formation in 3D flows by accounting for the movements of individual platelets. Each platelet follows prescribed rules for interactions while the local flow around the thrombus continuously adjusts to the growing structure of the thrombus, also when embolization occurs. With an activation delay time assigned to each platelet we demonstrate the dependence of thrombus growth rate on blood velocity as found experimentally by Begent and Born [Begent N, Born GV (1970) Nature 227:926-930]. With activated platelets having mutual tensile action sustainable up to a prescribed distance we achieve thrombus growth faster than with shorter maximum distances that make a thrombus less porous; when the prescribed maximum distance is large enough the thrombus shape is not like a "hill" but like a "carpet." We find that thrombus growth rate is enhanced by modest pulsatility but less so when pulsations are amplified in part because of more embolization.

ID CARBON; BIOMASS; GLOBALIZATION; TIMBER
AB Amid widespread reports of deforestation, some nations have nevertheless experienced transitions from deforestation to reforestation. In a causal relationship, the Forest Identity relates the carbon sequestered in forests to the changing variables of national or regional forest area, growing stock density per area, biomass per growing stock volume, and carbon concentration in the biomass. It quantifies the sources of change of a nation's forests. The Identity also logically relates the quantitative impact on forest expanse of shifting timber harvest to regions and plantations where density grows faster. Among 50 nations with extensive forests reported in the Food and Agriculture Organization's comprehensive Global Forest Resources Assessment 2005, no nation where annual per capita gross domestic product exceeded $4,600 had a negative rate of growing stock change. Using the Forest Identity and national data from the Assessment report, a single synoptic chart arrays the 50 nations with coordinates of the rates of change of basic variables, reveals both clusters of nations and outliers, and suggests trends in returning forests and their attributes. The Forest Identity also could serve as a tool for setting forest goals and illuminating how national policies accelerate or retard the forest transitions that are diffusing among nations.

AB During the production of 130 million t of crude steel (EU 25) by the BOF process approximately 1.7 million t of BOF dust and 1.3 million t of BOF sludge are generated. Although these residues contain noteable amounts of iron, their use in integrated steelworks is often limited due to environmental problems, negative impacts on productivity and problems during handling. The DK process has shown for now more than 20 years that there is a sustainable solution for treating these residues in an industrial scale.

DT Article

   distribution; basic reproductive number
AB A "contact network" that models infection transmission comprises nodes (or individuals) that are linked when they are in contact and can potentially transmit an infection. Through analysis and simulation, we studied the influence of the distribution of the number of contacts per node, defined as degree, on infection spreading and its control by vaccination. Three random contact networks of various degree distributions were examined. In a scale-free network, the frequency of high-degree nodes decreases as the power of the degree (the case of the third power is studied here); the decrease is exponential in an exponential network, whereas all nodes have the same degree in a constant network. Aiming for containment at a very early stage of an epidemic, we measured the sustainability of a specific network under a vaccination strategy by employing the critical transmissibility larger than which the epidemic would occur. We examined three vaccination strategies: mass, ring, and acquaintance. Irrespective of the networks, mass preventive vaccination increased the critical transmissibility inversely proportional to the unvaccinated rate of the population. Ring post-outbreak vaccination increased the critical transmissibility inversely proportional to the unvaccinated rate, which is the rate confined to the targeted ring comprising the neighbors of an infected node; however, the total number of vaccinated nodes could mostly be fewer than 100 nodes at the critical transmissibility. In combination, mass and ring vaccinations decreased the pathogen's "effective" transmissibility each by the factor of the unvaccinated rate. The amount of vaccination used in acquaintance preventive vaccination was lesser than the mass vaccination, particularly under a highly heterogeneous degree distribution; however, it was not as less as that used in ring vaccination. Consequently, our results yielded a quantitative assessment of the amount of vaccination necessary for infection containment, which is universally applicable to contact networks of various degree distributions.

AB Human activities are altering many factors that determine the fundamental properties of ecological and social systems. Is sustainability a realistic goal in a world in which many key process controls are directionally changing? To address this issue, we integrate several disparate sources of theory to address sustainability in directionally changing social-ecological systems, apply this framework to climate-warming impacts in Interior Alaska, and describe a suite of policy strategies that emerge from these analyses. Climate warming in Interior Alaska has profoundly affected factors that influence landscape processes (climate regulation and disturbance spread) and natural hazards, but has only indirectly influenced ecosystem goods such as food, water, and wood that receive most management attention. Warming has reduced cultural services provided by ecosystems, leading to some of the few institutional responses that directly address the causes of climate warming, e.g., indigenous initiatives to the Arctic Council. Four broad policy strategies emerge: (i) enhancing human adaptability through learning and innovation in the context of changes occurring at multiple scales; (ii) increasing resilience by strengthening negative (stabilizing) feedbacks that buffer the system from change and increasing options for adaptation through biological, cultural, and economic diversity; (iii) reducing vulnerability by strengthening institutions that link the high-latitude impacts of climate warming to their low-latitude causes; and (iv) facilitating transformation to new, potentially more beneficial states by taking advantage of opportunities created by crisis. Each strategy provides societal benefits, and we suggest that all of them be pursued simultaneously.

AB Project IMPACT is a collaborative care intervention to assist older adults suffering from major depressive disorder or dysthymia. Qualitative research methods were used to determine the barriers and facilitators to sustaining IMPACT in a primary care setting. Strong evidence supports the program's sustainability, but considerable variation exists in continuation strategies and operationalization across sites. Sustainability depended on the organizations' support of collaborative care models, the availability of staff trained in the intervention, and funding. The intervention's success was the most important sustainability factor, as documented by outcome data and through the "real world" experience of treating patients with this intervention.

AB Six indicators were investigated for South African sardine Sardinops sagax and anchovy Engraulis encrasicolus: mean length of catch, length-at-50% maturity, total mortality, exploitation rate, ratio of bycatch, and centre of gravity of commercial catches. Sardine length-at-50% maturity is the most promising as a descriptive indicator because it is positively correlated with population size for an extensive time period (1953-2005). The remaining indicators were limited by shorter data-series (1984-2005). However, mean length of catch, ratio of bycatch and exploitation rate were found to be useful when considered in conjunction with other indicators. The centre of gravity of commercial sardine catches has shown a significant eastward shift from the West Coast, whereas that of anchovy has remained off that coast. Ratio of bycatch indicates that school composition is a reliable descriptive indicator of relative abundance in the two species. Fewer indicators for anchovy were useful, which is attributed to this species' flexible life-history pattern.

AB Cape fur seals Arctocephalus pusillus pusillus were estimated to kill some 6 000 Cape gannet Morus capensis fledglings around Malgas Island in the 2000/01 breeding season, 11 000 in 2003/04 and 10 000 in 2005/06. This amounted to about 29%, 83% and 57% of the overall production of fledglings at the island in these breeding seasons respectively. Preliminary modelling suggests this predation is not sustainable. There was a 25% reduction in the size of the colony, the second largest of only six extant Cape gannet colonies, between 2001/02 and 2005/06. There has been a large increase in predation by Cape fur seals on seabirds around southern African islands since the mid-1980s, coincidental with both an increase in the seal population, altered management of the islands and an altered distribution of prey for gannets and seals. At Malgas Island, most gannet fledglings were killed between 10:00 and 18:00, the period when most are in the water around the island, from mid-January to mid-March, the main fledging period. The Cape gannet is classified as Vulnerable.

AB Many of the world's fish populations are overexploited, including Ghana's fish resources. This study examines spatio-temporal trends in fish species composition in relation to biotic, abiotic and anthropogenic factors, towards achieving better-informed management of the beach-seine fisheries. Fishery-dependent data were collected between November 1999 and October 2001 from 94 beach-seine hauls fished at two stations along the Ghanaian coast. The catch consisted of fish, crustaceans, other invertebrates, and macroalgae. Generally, juveniles of species that are exploited by offshore fisheries were found in the catches. Species abundance and their occurrence generally peaked between November and January. Duration of solar radiation and tide level appeared to be important predictors of fish biomass. It is important to exploit the nearshore fish assemblage sustainably because of its nursery role. A co-managed (fishers and government) three-month ban on beach-seining (between May and July) is recommended as the most appropriate control measure towards the sustainability of Ghanaian fish stocks.

ID GROWTH
AB Bangladesh has made considerable progress in alleviating poverty in the recent past. Using data from a nationally representative longitudinal survey of rural households in Bangladesh conducted in three waves in 1988, 2000, and 2004, this article relates the dynamics of rural poverty reduction to the structural shift in income generation mechanism from farm to nonfarm activities, changing household factor endowments, and the adoption of improved agricultural technologies over time.(1) The findings show that the occupational shift from the farm to the nonfarm sector, such as trade, business, and services, as well as the expansion of cultivated areas through tenancy, enhance income growth. Geographic mobility, overseas migration in particular, makes a significant contribution to income growth as well. The reduction in poverty appears to be vitally dependent on the enhancement of the endowment of human and physical capital that augments the poor households' capability to better exploit income-generating opportunities and place the households on a sustainable route out of poverty.

ID LIFE-CYCLE ASSESSMENT; ASSESSMENT LCA
AB Energy use is one of the key indicators for developing more sustainable agricultural practices. For this reason, energy use in the production of conventional and organic milk and rye bread in Finland was studied by conducting a life cycle inventory (LCI). The product systems of milk and rye bread consisted of farming, production of fuels, electricity and fertilisers, as well as the processing phases of milk and bread, i.e. the dairy and the bakery. Transportation of fuels, raw materials and the final products was also taken into account. Primary energy consumption was 6.4 GJ in average conventional milk production and 4.4 GJ in average organic milk production, calculated per 1000 1 of milk. For rye bread the values were 15.3 GJ (conventional) and 13.3 GJ (organic) per 1000 kg of rye bread. The proportion of renewable energy in the product systems studied,varied between 7 and 16% of the total primary energy use, being somewhat higher in organic production. In milk production, energy use efficiency can be increased, by favouring organic production. Making changes in the energy use patterns of bakeries would be the fastest way to affect the energy profile of bread, because bakery is responsible for 70 and 80% of the total energy consumption in conventional and organic bread production, respectively.

AB This paper presents emergy evaluations of Denmark and Danish agriculture for the years 1936, 1970 and 1999. The evaluations highlight the changing relationship between agriculture and society over the time period studied. A large increase in total emergy supporting the Danish economy was observed, and the 379% rise from 1936 to 1999 in emergy use per capita, a biophysical measure of living standard, came from both imported sources and from the non-renewable storages of the biosphere. In 1936, Danish agriculture was largely based on the use of draft animals for traction and approximately 1,10,000,000 person-hours of direct labor were required for production, while in 1970 and 1999, all traction was mechanized and approximately 415,000,000 and 12 1,000,000 person-hours were required for production, respectively. Over the same period, the emergy supporting each person-hour of agricultural labor increased by 1600%. The driving forces for agricultural production shifted towards an increased reliance on commercial energy and indirect labor. Given the increase in emergy available to the Danish economy through extraction and use of domestic oil and gas and trade over the period studied, the shift in labor from agriculture to the service and manufacturing sectors represented a nation-wide re-organization for maximum empower. The evaluations also indicate that while agriculture remains an essential way for industrial economies to capture local renewable resources, given the limited net emeray yields of agricultural production, the magnitude of non-agricultural economic activity that agriculture systems can support appears limited in an economy with access to high-net-yield imported energy resources.

   GROWTH; REGION
AB The double cropping of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and summer maize (Zea mays L.) in the North China Plain (NCP) requires intensive irrigation that results in rapidly depleting aquifers and threatens the sustainable agricultural development in the region. This study investigated the possibility of growing winter wheat and maize with minimum irrigation (MI) by bringing soil moisture in the top root zone to field capacity at sowing with no further irrigation afterwards. Results over 8 yr (1997-2005) showed that grain yield of winter wheat was over 5000 kg ha(-1) and maize was over 6000 kg ha-1 in most of the seasons under MI. The average yield was decreased by 14% for winter wheat and 13% for maize compared with the fully irrigated treatment (FI). Water use efficiency (WUE) under MI was increased by 15% for winter wheat and 10% for maize compared with that under FI. Average seasonal evapotranspiration (ET) was 335 mm under MI and 447 non under FI for winter wheat, and 319 mm and 403 mm for maize, respectively. The annual irrigation requirement of MI was only half that of FI. Yield reduction in MI was negatively related to seasonal rainfall (significant at P < 0.05). The success of MI depended on the deeper root system of winter wheat using soil moisture that accumulated below the shallower rooted maize over the summer rainfall season. The results showed that an MI strategy that would be simple to implement for farmers would contribute significantly to the sustainability of the groundwater resource.

SO AMBIO

   IMPACT; ENVIRONMENT; YIELDS
AB Fisheries for arctic freshwater and diadromous fish species contribute significantly to northern economies. Climate change, and to a lesser extent increased ultraviolet radiation, effects in freshwaters will have profound effects on fisheries from three perspectives: quantity of fish available, quality of fish available, and success of the fishers. Accordingly, substantive adaptation will very likely be required to conduct fisheries sustainably in the future as these effects take hold. A shift to flexible and rapidly responsive 'adaptive management' of commercial fisheries will be necessary; local land- and resource-use patterns for subsistence fisheries will change; and, the nature, management and place for many recreational fisheries will change. Overall, given the complexity and uncertainty associated with climate change and related effects on arctic freshwaters and their biota, a much more conservative approach to all aspects of fishery management will be required to ensure ecosystems and key fished species retain sufficient resiliency and capacity to meet future changes.

LA English
DT Article
DE sovereignty; Indian gaming; Sisseton-Wahpeton; self-determination;
   tribal government
AB This study analyzes Indian gaming in South Dakota-specifically, that of the Sisseton-Wahpeton Sioux Tribe (SWST)-via library material, telephone and taped interviews, nonparticipant/participant observation, newspaper and administrative reports, and public law statutes. Questions were developed, pretested, and applied to form a gaming narrative or voice of the SWST and its constituency. The article argues that tribes must define, exert, and use their political sovereignty to engage in positive, effective, and sustainable aspects of self-determination. Through the lens deemed most appropriate for the tribe, the SWST plays a vital role in overall economic development on and off the reservation. To be effective, the tribe must be the principal actor for positive economic development, the catalyst for recruiting outside enterprises, and the regulator/monitor of a positive economic development initiative and must develop/maintain the ability to define its organizational structures and engage in those day-to-day activities that advance overall tribal economic development policies and activities.

AB Since World War II the use of antimicrobial products associated with food animal production has increased. Antimicrobials along with evolving production practices have significantly increased throughput, animal welfare, and improved health. Concerns surrounding the growing significance of emerging and in some cases rapidly disseminating antibiotic (antimicrobial) resistant bacterial pathogens among human and livestock populations has stimulated a reassessment of this application. The negative publicity has led many consumers and activist groups to believe that protein derived from food animals grown in the absence of those drugs is safer than products derived from the conventionally reared. There is a general fear that antimicrobial usage in agriculture threatens the sustainability of human therapeutic agents and the public wellbeing. The issue has gradually emerged from ''fringe group paranoia'' to mainstream-finally impacting consumer choices.
   Antimicrobial resistance concerns have stimulated a significant reaction by the US animal agriculture industry. Numerous pig production entities, large and small, have attempted to create additional pork product value by developing niche marketing opportunities. Thus far most of the subtherapeutic in-feed antimicrobial reduction has been voluntary in the US. Two production areas have developed where reduced usage occurs. First is the growth of antibiotic free production (ABF) and second is an increased use of treatment levels which avoids subtherapeutic criticism. The bulk of this article is directed at new production practices, pig health management, disease elimination, and biosecurity efforts that result from early industry attempts at reduced or excluded antimicrobial pig production. Raising antimicrobial (antibiotic) free (ABF) pork from birth is challenging for a variety of reasons. Some of these challenges can be cost effectively dealt with while others are difficult if not impossible to control in modern production environments. Healthy pig production is essential for sustainable ABF operations.

TI Local involvement in harnessing crude oil and natural gas in Nigeria
SO APPLIED ENERGY
LA English
DT Article
AB Vast financial investments have been made in the upstream crude-oil and natural-gas (CONG) sector in Nigeria, but have not resulted in significant benefits for most Nigerians. The associated major activities, e.g., exploration, drilling, production, well intervention and service provision remain primarily controlled and managed by foreign multi-national companies. Only minor contracts have been awarded to local contractors. Several factors, ranging from locally inadequate finance being available, corrupt local operators, lack of technical expertise and the conflicting attitudes of multi-national operators and local contractors have contributed to this. Yet, numerous opportunities are increasingly available for indigenous entrepreneurs and local contractors. To achieve good public relations, sustainability and better economic performances, a wiser balance between globalisation and localisation is needed! This study considers the impedances to achieving greater indigenous inputs to the CONG sector, with recommendations proffered with respect to what could be done to alleviate them.

AB 1. Tropical rivers are increasingly being altered by hydropower dams. In Costa Rica, more than 30 hydropower plants were built during the 1990s and more dams are being proposed. Hydropower dams currently provide more than 80% of electricity consumed by the country's 4 million residents, yet most of Costa Rica's hydropower potential remains untapped.
   2. Ecological consequences of dams in Costa Rica stem primarily from river fragmentation, stream de-watering, and downstream hydrological alterations. Dams affect distribution and abundance of aquatic biota, especially migratory species. Cumulative effects of multiple dams on individual river basins, especially in the northern part of the country, are also of concern but have not been adequately documented.
   3. In light of recent hydropower development, we recommend conservation strategies that protect remaining free-flowing rivers, call for assessment of ecological impacts of dams on a broader scale, encourage research on aquatic systems and sustainable hydropower technologies, and promote the development of methods for estimating environmental flows for Costa Rican rivers.

TI Sustainable use of continuous positive airway pressure in extremely

LA English
DT Article
ID RESPIRATORY-DISTRESS-SYNDROME; BIRTH-WEIGHT INFANTS; IMMATURE BABOONS;
   LUNG INJURY; FAILURE
AB Background: Early use of nasal continuous positive airway pressure (nCPAP) may reduce lung damage, but it is not clear how many extremely preterm infants can be cared for without mechanical ventilation on the first days after delivery.
   Objectives: To describe our experience of nCPAP in infants born at < 27 weeks' gestation and to determine the chance of reintubation of this group of extremely preterm infants.
   Methods: A retrospective, observational study examined the period from November 2002 to October 2003, when efforts were made to extubate infants to nCPAP at the earliest opportunity. Data were collected on all infants born at < 27 weeks' and gestation admitted to The Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, Queen Charlotte's and Chelsea Hospital, London, UK. The chance of an individual infant requiring reintubation within 48 h of delivery was estimated, calculating the predictive probability using a Bayesian approach, and oxygen requirements at 36 weeks' postmenstrual age were examined.
   Results: 60 infants, 34 inborn and 26 ex utero transfers, were admitted; 7 infants admitted 24 h after birth were excluded and 5 died within 48 h. The mean birth weight was 788 g and the gestational age was 25.3 weeks. Extubation was attempted on day I in 21 of 52 infants on ventilators and was successful in 14; and on day 2 in 14 of 35 and successful in 10 of infants extubated within 48 h of delivery survived to discharge. 5 of 23 infants on mechanical ventilation at 48 h of age were on air at 36 weeks postmenstrual age, and 12 of 26 of those were on nCPAP at 48 h of age. The probability of an individual baby remaining on nCPAP was 66% (95% Cl 46% to 86%) on day 1 and 80% (95% Cl 60% to 99%) on day 2. The smallest infant to be successfully extubated was 660 g and the youngest gestational age was 23.8 weeks.
   Conclusions: Extremely preterm infants can be extubated to nCPAP soon after delivery, with a reasonable probability of not requiring immediate reintubation.

AB An assessment of nutrient sustainability has been done for stands of European beech, Sycamore maple, European oak, Norway spruce, Larch, Grandis fir and Douglas fir at Bjornstorp Estate in southern Sweden. To estimate the nutrient sustainability, mass balance was calculated with respect to Ca, Mg, K, N and P. The release from mineral weathering was calculated using the PROFILE model. The leaching has been estimated from observed soil water concentrations and nutrients removed by harvest from projected production. The results indicate that the planned production is on the limits of sustainability and sometimes in excess of it. The stands will overuse Ca, sometimes also Mg, K and P, if all growth is harvested. Soil acidification is still progessing at Bjornstorp Estate, and soil depletion is the result of this. The estimated sustainable yield and the mass balances suggest that the leaching rate is the most uncertain factor for assessing sustainability. Different types of critical loads were investigated, including a new type, based on no excess acidity in the system. The calculations stress the importance of reducing the acid deposition and that nutrient sustainable management must be included in forest management.

AB Over the last decade the Humboldt penguin, Spheniscus humboldti, has become a focus for ecotourism. Current management applies visitor guidelines similar to those developed for Magellanic penguins, Spheniscus magellanicus. However, unlike these, Humboldt penguins are extremely sensitive to human presence. Breeding success was significantly reduced at frequently visited sites. Heart rate telemetry during disturbance experiments revealed that Humboldt penguins respond more strongly to human presence than do any other penguin species thus far studied. A person passing an incubating penguin at 150 in distance already provoked a significant heart rate response. Recovery times were up to half an hour after direct human approach, causing increased energy expenditure without any overt behavioural reaction. Being extraordinary sensitive to human activity with little habituation potential the Humboldt penguin proves to be a difficult focal species for ecotourism. For sustainable ecotourism visitors are required to stay out of sight of Humboldt penguin breeding and moulting areas. Management guidelines need to acknowledge that even closely related species may react very differently towards human presence. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB An emulsifiable formulation of Beauveria bassiana conidia was applied alone or together with pyridaben 15% EC at similar to 5% of its labeled application rate for control of citrus red mite Panonychus citri in three citrus orchards (Trials 1-3) of Taizhou, Zhejiang, southeastern China during the mild, rainy season of autumn 2006. Aqueous dilutions (150 l/ha) of two fungal rates (1.5 and 3.0 x 10(13) conidia/ha in Trials 1 and 2; 1.2 x 10(12) and 1.2 x 10(13) in Trial 3) or the low chemical rate (562.5 mg AI/ha) were sprayed to plots in randomized blocks (40-m-long row of trees per plot, three plots per treatment) with mean density of 17.8, 15.0 and 12.0 mites per leaf in Trials 1-3, respectively. Based on percent density declines and relative efficacies estimated by sampling all plots at 3-5 day intervals, the two fungal rates in each trial gave significant control and the funga/chemical combinations always resulted in better control. The pyridaben-inclusive sprays of >= 1.5 x 1013 conidia/ha applied twice at 15-day interval provided excellent mite control for 35 days, yielding overall mean efficacies of 83.2-92.3% and mite density declines of 73.8-91.2%. In contrast, the relative efficacy in a standard pyridaben treatment (11.25 g AI/ha) reached 83.8% on day 3 but decreased from 72.0% on day 5 to 4.1% on day 15. Field conditions, featured with the records of similar to 20 degrees C and > 95% RH for 216 and 300h in Trials 1 and 2 (35 days) and 52 It in Trial 3 (15 days), were favorable. The effects of local weather on the trials in topographically different hillside orchards are discussed. Conclusively, combined application of the fungal formulation with pyridaben at the low rate is a potential alternative for sustainable control of the mite pest in orchards of southern China.

AB Mycorrhizae occur in nearly all terrestrial ecosystems. Resource exchange between host plants and mycorrhizal fungi influences community, ecosystem, and even global patterns and processes. Understanding the mechanisms and consequences of mycorrhizal symbioses across a hierarchy of scales will help predict system responses to environmental change and facilitate the management of these responses for sustainability and productivity. Conceptual and mathematical models have been developed to help understand and predict mycorrhizal functions. These models are most developed for individual- and population-scale processes, but models at community, ecosystem, and global scales are also beginning to emerge. We review seven types of mycorrhizal models that vary in their scale of resolution and dynamics, and discuss approaches for integrating these models with each other and with general models of terrestrial ecosystems.

AB Conservation biologists struggle to decide how many animals to save. In this article, I outline 18 approaches to setting population target levels (PTLs) for animals, with rules of thumb and analytical recommendations for each approach. Minimally viable populations, the most common target level, are necessary but not sufficient for most efforts, given the range of values that bear on conservation. Reference ecosystems, either extant or historical, are key for setting practical target levels. Setting PTLs sufficient for conserved populations to be animals in all respects (including functional, social, landscape, ethical, aesthetic, and spiritual aspects) is a critical consensus point. In many cases densities as well as overall population size will need to be specified. I suggest a four-tiered system of setting incrementally higher population target levels such that conservation provides first for demographic sustainability, then ecological integrity, then sustainable use, and finally restoration of historical numbers of wildlife, based on times when human beings had less impact on the planet than we do today.

TI Vitamin A supplementation in Tanzania: the impact of a change in
   programmatic delivery strategy on coverage
SO BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH
LA English

ID CHILD-MORTALITY; HEALTH-CARE; INEQUITIES; COST
AB Background: Efficient delivery strategies for health interventions are essential for high and sustainable coverage. We report impact of a change in programmatic delivery strategy from routine delivery through the Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI+) approach to twice-yearly mass distribution campaigns on coverage of vitamin A supplementation in Tanzania
   Methods: We investigated disparities in age, sex, socio-economic status, nutritional status and maternal education within vitamin A coverage in children between 1 and 2 years of age from two independent household level child health surveys conducted ( 1) during a continuous universal targeting scheme based on routine EPI contacts for children aged 9, 15 and 21 months ( 1999); and ( 2) three years later after the introduction of twice-yearly vitamin A supplementation campaigns for children aged 6 months to 5 years, a 6-monthly universal targeting scheme ( 2002). A representative cluster sample of approximately 2,400 rural households was obtained from Rufiji, Morogoro Rural, Kilombero and Ulanga districts. A modular questionnaire about the health of all children under the age of five was administered to consenting heads of households and caretakers of children. Information on the use of child health interventions including vitamin A was asked.
   Results: Coverage of vitamin A supplementation among 1 - 2 year old children increased from 13% [95% CI 10 - 18%] in 1999 to 76% [ 95% CI 72 - 81%] in 2002. In 2002 knowledge of two or more child health danger signs was negatively associated with vitamin A supplementation coverage (80% versus 70%) ( p = 0.04). Nevertheless, we did not find any disparities in coverage of vitamin A by district, gender, socio-economic status and DPT vaccinations.
   Conclusion: Change in programmatic delivery of vitamin A supplementation was associated with a major improvement in coverage in Tanzania that was been sustained by repeated campaigns for at least three years. There is a need to monitor the effect of such campaigns on the routine health system and on equity of coverage. Documentation of vitamin A supplementation campaign contacts on routine maternal and child health cards would be a simple step to facilitate this monitoring.

ID NETHERLANDS; POLICIES; STOCK
AB Buildings belong to the most cost-effective sectors where carbon dioxide (CO2) reductions can be achieved, and urban regeneration offers a good intervention point for switching to sustainable fuel sources, as changes in energy infrastructure can be coupled with other construction, thus decreasing the cost. However, the potential energy savings that are feasible do not match the more ambitious policy targets. Based on case studies in the Netherlands, obstacles are identified in the context of urban renewal that need to be overcome if energy efficiency measures are to be implemented and space heating replaced with low-carbon technologies. The current free-market public policy instruments have not managed to,address the obstacles identified in the case studies due to poor market signals, costs and payback periods, risks, and a lack of leadership on environmental targets and policies on sustainable urban renewal. The potential for stronger government intervention is examined for the effectiveness in reducing both energy consumption and CO2 generation. Legislation could produce a certain policy outcome in terms of CO2 reduction in urban renewal in the Netherlands if compliance and legitimacy are ensured, but policy consideration is also required to account for the dilemma of low-income households and the rebound effects associated with occupant behaviours.

   public policy; sustainable urban development; urbanization; China
AB During the past two decades, China has witnessed a rapid rate of urbanization and is faced with unique problems due to the country's natural resources, history, society, economy and culture. The role of institutions is examined as a fundamental ingredient for sustainable urbanization in a Chinese perspective. The context within which China's urbanization is proceeding is analysed and the urbanization progress is briefly reviewed. The contradictions exposed in the urbanization progress are identified and the institutional defects behind these problems are analysed: the over-reliance on gross domestic product (GDP) as an indicator, inappropriate assessment systems for local government, the urban-rural dual structure, the legal system, and building regulations. It is concluded that China's urbanization progress is too fast to be sustainable and that accomplishing sustainable urbanization in developing countries, particularly during their transformational period, cannot be best understood in terms of technical and monetary factors. Instead, the urbanization process can be formulated within a context of institutional innovation. Essential institutional innovations at both the central and local government levels are required: improving the performance appraisal system to regulate officials' behaviour; reforming the dual socio-economic system to cure 'town-country syndrome'; strengthening the legal system to bring it more in line with the requirements of a market-oriented economy; and revising building codes and standards to implement green plans and programmes. The 'scientific perspective of development' proposed by China's new national leadership indicates a break from an overwhelming emphasis on GDP growth, and is expected to provide a multifaceted approach giving impetus to a more sustainable approach to urbanization.

AB With China's accession to the World Trade Organization and rapid development of the country's economy, foreign design firms are seeking timely opportunities for market entry. However, unique features of the Chinese business environment and their impact on the design services sector remain unclear to many of these potential new entrants. The objective of this paper is to survey the interior design services sector and provide guidance for foreign firms that wish to enter this market. Several systemic problems pertaining to this sector are identified from interviews, which include two different standards for design fees, short design cycles and an inappropriate design proposal review system. Several transnational marketing strategies are proposed: establishing alliances with Chinese private design firms, and establishing long-term cooperative relationships with developers and contractors to provide focused services. However, a more competitive pricing policy is not regarded as a sustainable strategy for foreign interior design firms.

AB The political economy of by-catch management is outlined with particular reference to the regulation of Makaira nigricans Lacepede, 1802 and Tetrapturus albidus Poey, 1860 in the Atlantic. As has happened in the US, national policy preferences can become more conservation-oriented as a result of lobbying by focused noncommercial interests, but these groups are most effective when bolstered by broad domestic institutions. Achieving legislation domestically prior to its introduction at the international level is important, because it gives national commercial fishing interests incentives to ensure that their competition from abroad is similarly regulated. Nevertheless, billfish management requires cooperation among decision-makers from many fishing countries, most of whom formulate policy under much different circumstances. Technological solutions that reduce the costs of avoiding by-catch are still the best option for sustainable billfish management.

ID TEHUANTEPEC; MEXICO; GULF
AB The greatest catch rates in the world for sailfish [Istiophorus platypterus (Shaw in Shaw and Nodder, 1792)] occur in an area of the Eastern Pacific Ocean off Central America, where this species supports multi-million dollar catch-and-release sport fisheries associated with tourism in Costa Rica, Panama, and Guatemala. Sailfish is also caught as by-catch in expanding coastal artisanal long-line fisheries, which primarily target mahi-mahi, sharks, and tunas. Furthermore, sailfish have been historically impacted as by-catch in the very large industrial high seas long-line tuna fisheries since about 1964. In spite of the importance of sailfish to the Central American fisheries and their local economies, very little is known about its population dynamics and status of exploitation. We present an ecosystem view of likely mechanisms regulating the seasonal relative abundance of sailfish off Guatemala. Overall, regional sailfish abundance is 80% below their initial 1964 levels and trophy sizes of recreationally caught sailfish have declined at least 35% from their unexploited trophy sizes. These developments compromise the strategic value of the resource to the sport fishing industries and generate conflicts among stakeholders. We postulate the need for a regional fishery management plan for the sailfish as a way to promote sustainable use of the resource.

ID MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS; IMPLEMENTATION; UNCERTAINTY
AB Developing and implementing effective management measures is critical for the sustainability of billfish (sailfish, Istiophorus platypterus (Shaw in Shaw and Nodder, 1792); blue marlin, Makaira nigricans Lacepede, 1803; and white marlin, Tetrapturus albidus Poey, 1860) populations and pelagic ecosystems. Typically managers use biological performance indicators to evaluate stock status and ultimately determine management measures. Social and economic performance indicators for resource users should be better studied to determine the impact of management strategies on affected communities. These indicators can be linked to each management objective, whether the objective is biological, social or economic, and used to evaluate the performance of management strategies. In this study, we collected data in the United States and Venezuela and developed four performance indicators: gross revenue, net revenue, financial profit, and economic profit. Here we show that socio-economic indicators can be developed for vastly different fisheries and can be used to describe and quantify the socioeconomic impacts of alternative management measures. The indicators are useful tools to highlight the impacts that certain management measures may have on various stakeholder groups.

AB Analysis of the gill structure of striped marlin, Yetrapturus audax (Philippi, 1887), and wahoo, Acanthocybium solandri (Cuvier, 1832), demonstrates similarities to tunas (family Scombridae) in the presence of gill specializations to maintain rigidity during fast, sustainable swimming and to permit the O(2) uptake required by high aerobic performance. For ram-gill ventilators such as tunas, wahoo, and striped marlin, a rigid gill structure prevents lamellar deformation during fast water flow. In tunas, lamellar fusions bind adjacent lamellae on the same filament to opposing lamellae of the neighboring filament. Examination of striped marlin and wahoo gill structure demonstrates a previously undescribed inter-lamellar fusion which binds juxtaposed lamellae on the same filament, but does not connect to opposing lamellae of the adjacent filament. Lamellar thicknesses and the water-blood barrier distances in striped marlin and wahoo are comparable to those of tunas and among the smallest recorded. Vascular replica casts reveal that striped marlin lamellar vascular channels are similar to tunas in having a diagonal progression that reduces lamellar vascular resistance. Wahoo lamellar channels, however, have a linear pattern similar to most other teleosts.

AB This paper offers a theoretical analysis for a renewed approach to farming suitable to the requirements of sustainability and multifunctionality and provides an empirical example. We propose first a broader approach to strategic resources that can be mobilized by farms. These include not only the classic forms of capital - physical, human, and financial but also natural and social capital. This theoretical framework relies on a resource-based approach. Second, starting from stakeholder theory, the farm is represented as an organization inserted in stakeholder networks and a web of multiple influences acting on the farmers' strategic decisions. Stakeholder theory offers a new light on the farm's borders and on its relations with other non-agricultural participants and actors.

ID EMERGING ECONOMIES; GOVERNANCE; ORGANIZATION; STRATEGY; FORMS; MODEL
AB Many transition economies are characterised by a relatively rudimentary institutional framework. Weak legislative structures and the absence of effective market regulation and property right enforcement rules diminish the chance of mutually profitable business transactions and-more generally-restrict the chances for innovation and sustainable growth. Against this background, we analyse the extent to which more efficient governance mechanisms can contribute to a more favourable business environment. In doing so, we adopt a network perspective. We argue that both in developed market economies as well as in centrally planned economies much of economic exchange takes place in networks. However, the characteristics of these networks, in particular the concept of trust, can differ significantly. This leads us to conclude that the real challenge of the process of economic transition is connected to building new economic exchange networks. In this paper, we discuss this argument and analyse how the current enlargement of the EU into Eastern Europe may favourably affect this process of institutional change in the accession countries.

AB The past decade has seen an increasing interest in forest management based on historical or natural disturbance dynamics. The rationale is that management that favours landscape compositions and stand structures similar to those found historically should also maintain biodiversity and essential ecological functions. In fire-dominated landscapes, this approach is feasible only if current and future fire frequencies are sufficiently low compared with the preindustrial fire frequency, so a substitution of fire by forest management can occur without elevating the overall frequency of disturbance. We address this question by comparing current and simulated future fire frequency based on 2 x CO2 and 3 x CO2 scenarios to historical reconstructions of fire frequency in the commercial forests of Quebec. For most regions, current and simulated future fire frequencies are lower than the historical fire frequency, suggesting that forest management could potentially be used to maintain or recreate the age-class distribution of fire-dominated preindustrial landscapes. Current even-aged management, however, tends to reduce forest variability by, for example, truncating the natural age-class distribution and eliminating mature and old-growth forests from the landscape. Therefore, in the context of sustainable forest management, silvicultural techniques that retain a spectrum of forest compositions and structures at different scales are necessary to maintain this variability and thereby allow a substitution of fire by harvesting.

AB Background: Although randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are the gold standard for evaluating therapeutic interventions, surgical RCTs are particularly challenging and few have been done in the field of epilepsy surgery. We assess the level of RCT activity in epilepsy surgery and propose feasible alternatives to develop sustainable research initiatives in this area. Methods: We undertook a systematic review of the world literature to assess the level of RCT activity in epilepsy surgery. Previous personal experience with RCTs in epilepsy surgery and examples Of Successful Canadian multicentre research networks were reviewed to propose initiatives for sustainable, valid research in epilepsy surgery. Results: We identified 12 RCTs in epilepsy Surgery, including 692 patients, of whom 416 were involved in vagus nerve stimulation, 16 in various brain electrostimulation procedures, 180 in comparisons of different surgical techniques, and 80 in a comparison of medical versus surgical therapy. Most studies were of short duration (median 3 months. range 3-12 months). In the area of resective surgery, only temporal lobe epilepsy has been subjected to any type of RCT comparison. All RCTs have been done within the last 13 years. There were no multicentre Canadian surgical studies. Conclusions: The adoption of RCTs in epilepsy Surgery has been slow and difficult worldwide. Because Of its universal health care system and its well established epilepsy surgery centres, Canada is in a strong position to create a national epilepsy surgery research initiative capable of undertaking high quality, sustainable research in epilepsy Surgery.

AB Background: Since its founding in 1970, Canada's International Development Research Centre (IDRC) has supported research by concerned Latin American researchers on environments and human health relationships. Framing of such relationships has changed through different periods.
   Methods: Participant observation, bibliographic searches, document review, and interviews with key IDRC staff.
   Findings: From the early years of multiple different projects, IDRC developed more focussed interest in tropical diseases, pesticides, agriculture and human health in the 1980s. The United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development in the early 1990s gave impetus to examination of links between ecosystems and human health or "EcoHealth". Projects in Latin America built on earlier work but extended it in methods (transdisciplinarity, community participation, gendered approach) and scope (broader land use and development paradigm issues tackled). A key IDRC-funded activity in Latin America was "EcoSalud", an Ecuadorian effort, which has worked with farming communities, agricultural researchers, health practitioners and local politicians to advance integrated pest management, better recognize and treat poisonings and improve pesticide-related policies.
   Ongoing challenges include: mobilizing sufficient resources for the primary prevention focus of EcoHealth activities when primary care infrastructure remains stretched, promoting micro-level change-in diverse communities and ecosystems, and addressing power structures at the global level that profoundly affect environmental change.

SO CHINESE GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCE

DE economic structure transformation; land use change; Changjiang River
   Basin
AB Land, as a key factor of production, is an appropriate indicator of national and regional economic structure transformation. Land use in the Changjiang (Yangtze) River Basin (CRB) since the 1950s has experienced these changes. Industrialization has been the most powerful force of the change in the regional development of the CRB. Virtually all regional resources were put into this effort to modernize the industrial production and urban construction systems of the CRB whose industrialization and urbanization has been a success story, with impressive structural change in both production and land use. These changes are evident in modern urban areas, but even more in traditionally rural areas. The regression analysis of regional development in the CRB over an extended period shows that the dominant factor in regional land use change is widespread industrialization in rural areas rather than the expansion of urban area. Thus, urbanization has had a limited influence on land use change in the CRB. A major task in realizing more sustainable land use in the future development of CRB is to relocate industrial activities from rural to urban areas.

TI Calculation of Ecological Footprint Based on Modified Method and
   Quantitative Analysis of Its Impact Factors-A Case Study of Shanghai
SO CHINESE GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
DE ecological footprint; quantitative analysis; impact factors; Shanghai
AB Ecological footprint (EF) has attracted much attention internationally as a potential indicator for sustainable development. In China, EF has also gained recognition in related fields and disciplines. Moreover, some scholars in these fields have proposed alternative methods to calculate EF and have made some progress. This paper, therefore, begins with the introduction and development of EF in China. However, the established methods of EF calculation hold some limitations, such as indicator variance and result abnormality. In order to resolve those problems, the authors make a further modification considering the demand of EF as a comprehensive indicator: 1) More accurate analysis has been done to divide EF into several parts: imported EF, exported EF, and producible EF, which is the solution to the problem of abnormality in original EF results and can explain abnormal phenomena reasonably. 2) Considering the actual situation of Shanghai, amended equivalence factor is brought forward and a matrix is formed with equivalence factors. The measure can reduce the deviation between the fact and the results. 3) The calculation compares local yield with global average yield to analyze the effects of yields. And based on local yields in different years, the results are more accurate. Finally, the calculation method is applied to calculating EF of Shanghai from 1980 to 2003, and the subsequent detailed analysis is presented. Available data and results suggest a statistically significant correlation coefficient between EF and GDP, population density and urbanization level. Through analyzing the process of calculating EF and its results, it can be seen that EF, as a macro-indicator, can not exactly indicate whether development within a region can meet the requests of sustainable development, which can be explained by the fact that the result of EF is impacted greatly by subjective factors including national policy, available technology, population, etc. Nevertheless, EF can demonstrate, at least to some degree, the regional status in terms of resources and energy consumption, as well as developmental potential. The calculation of EF, therefore, deserves further research to achieve more far-reaching significance in application.

DE urbanization; economic circles; spatial pattern; Jilin Province
AB Urbanization is a crucial criterion of assessing a nation's or a particular region's level of modernization. It has been accelerated all over the world in the 21th century. The main purpose of this research is to provide a strategy of spatial pattern of urbanization for rural areas in Jilin Province based on the reality of economic development in Jilin and the imbalance of natural resources distribution. The strategy divides the nine central cities of Jilin Province into three economic circles. The outer economic circle, open circle, includes Yanbian, Baishan, Tonghua and Baicheng, covering the eastern and western parts of Jilin Province. The middle one includes Jilin, Liaoyuan, Siping and Songyuan. The inner one, centring as Changchun, includes Gongzhuling, Yitong, Nong'an, Jiutai and Dehui. It needs to centre as Changchun which has the good foundation of economic development and more economic increase, then by economic effect extending out gradually, other areas develop subsequently. To construct Jilin as a green ecological province, cultivation in the outer circle should be controlled, with the main aim to recover grassland. Large population should be moved to other places by developing labor economy. From economy and ecology, to decrease the load of the land can reduce the loss of the resources and benefit the balance of ecology. Subsequently, the whole province's economy will be developed sustainably.

   scheme; Lancang-Mekong river
AB Based on the case study of Lancang-Mekong river, analyses have been made on the database of bilateral and multilateral treaties/agreement of transboundary water resources in the world and the regional agreements of Mekong River, the principles of the equitable and reasonable utilization, and causing no significant harm, index system and related models on transboundary water allocation have been worked out, and the key ecologic thresholds of the maximum and minimum water flow and water level of water allocation have been defined. By using the data of water resources development and utilization at present and development objectives of the riparian states, to ensure the ecological environment demand of water in the river basin and based on the water yields in the riparian states, 5 types of 3 kinds of water allocation schemes with water volume as the core have been set up, viz., the whole allocation, the project allocation and the river-basin-integrated allocation. By comparing the beneficial effect of each scheme, the results show that (1) the whole allocation scheme can equitably define the available water consumption volume of each state, but cannot sustain the ecological objectives in the river basin; (2) the project allocation scheme can meet the needs of the most riparian states, but cannot meet the drainage ecologic need (esp. to prevent the intrusion of saltwater in Mekong Delta) and the development objectives of Vietnam; (3) the integrated allocation scheme can meet the development need of each state in the predictable period and sustainability of drainage ecology, but the beneficial countries should make compensation to the others so as to materialize the fairness of transboundary water allocation.

AB Remission is now the accepted goal of management in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). This article highlights the controversies surrounding the definition of remission and reviews the potential of current treatment options to achieve remission.
   Defining "true" remission can be difficult based on current criteria, which do not consider structural and physical function. Nonetheless, considerable advances in recent years have made the concept of remission a realistic goal. In early RA, substantial and largely irreversible radiographic damage is seen in 60% of patients within the first 2 years of diagnosis. Early therapeutic intervention would ideally lead to reduction in long-term disability in RA and likelihood of inducing and maintaining remission.
   Long-term maintenance therapy with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) has been shown to be effective, in preventing flares of disease. Stopping therapy for short periods does not necessarily lead to flares, but the effect on long-term radiographic damage and potential to achieve similar levels of disease control following reinstatement of therapy is not established. Early use of tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-antagonist therapy (e.g. infliximab) has been shown to lead to significant improvement in disease activity measures (clinical and radiologic outcomes) when compared to monotherapy or combination DMARD and corticosteroid therapies. Response was shown to be sustained in 70% of patients receiving TNF-blocking therapy I year after stopping treatment. This suggests the significant role of TNF-blocking therapy in enabling sustainable remission without need for long-term administrations, which has important implications for favourable health economics. At present, little published evidence exists on the effects of withdrawal of TNF-blocking therapy in patients with established RA in remission. In conclusion, evidence indicates that remission is a realistic goal, but more evidence is required to establish optimal treatment strategies and define criteria for remission that include imaging and immunological as well as clinical assessment of the disease state.

AB "Achieving comprehensive, coordinated, and sustained Earth observations for the benefit of humankind." The need to collect, organize, standardize Earth observation data for the benefit of a planetary community of users has been recognized since more than a century: in the recent period, after World War Two, the 'World Meteorological Convention' adopted a strategy in Washington in 1947, which led to the creation of WMO in 1951 (World Meteorological Organization). An important step took place, next, when ICSU (International Council of Scientific Unions now named International Council for Science), upon a suggestion of Lloyd Berkner, initiated in 1952 the organization of the International Geophysical Year (1957-1958) with a special focus on Earth observation from space. Indeed, the launching of Earth observation satellites was put forward as one of the major objectives of IGY (International Geophysical Year). This goal was reached beautifully with the successful launches of Sputnik on 4 October 1957 by the USSR and of Explorer I on 31 January 1958 by the USA. Sputnik, purposely spherically shaped, brought the first high-altitude atmospheric data through the observation of the drag exerted by the atmosphere on the spacecraft. Explorer 1, equipped with a Geiger counter, led to the discovery of the 'Van Allen belts' surrounding the Earth. The development, at a tremendous pace, of experimental satellites observing the Earth, the planets, and the Universe followed then immediately. As early as 1960, the concept of meteorology satellites emerged with the launch of the first weather satellite in polar orbit, TIROS. It took then almost 20 years before reaching the stage of implementing operational meteorological satellites in polar sun-synchronous or in geostationary orbits: at that time, meteorologists had learned how to incorporate meteorological space data into weather-forecast systems. The aim of this paper is to describe schematically the gradual implementation of an Earth observation system of systems associating in situ and space observations as well as numerical modelling in order to provide humankind with the necessary tools for Earth science, sustainable development, and security.

AB At the Institute of Silviculture at the University of Natural Resources and Applied Life Sciences, Vienna, students learn to cross-link ecological, socio-economic and technical knowledge of maintaining, regenerating, tending and utilizing forests in a sustainable way. They learn complex concepts and processes most successfully when they are actively engaged in the learning process. Therefore, the principle of blended learning, a combination of online phases and face-to-face meetings is proposed. In this contribution, a brief description on the didactic concept of the courses in Silviculture, the features of the content management system COCOON, the authoring tool, the process of teaching and the way how students are supported by the integration of different learning objects is given. Rationale, challenges and pitfalls of the approach are discussed. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper discusses the potential of bamboo as a building material for Western countries. In the study presented, bamboo culms were environmentally and financially assessed and compared to building materials more common in Western Europe, e.g., steel, concrete and timber. Furthermore, a case study was done of temporary European bamboo buildings, structures and bridges, in order to determine factors of success and failure of building with bamboo. This paper presents the results of these studies, which indicate that within certain boundary conditions and with consideration of the recommendations following the case study, bamboo is a very sustainable building material for Western countries and can be competitive to materials more commonly used.

AB Corporate governance is fundamentally about such questions as what business is for-and in whose interests companies should be run, and how. Wider issues such as business ethics through entire value chains, human rights, bribery and corruption, and climate change are among the great issues of our time that increasingly cross-cut the rarefied worlds of corporate boardrooms. As a result, a growing proportion of SustainAbility's work has seen the fusion of corporate governance with such wider societal concerns. This paper reviews the increasingly complex cross-connects between the rapidly mutating governance agenda and the burgeoning world of corporate responsibility, social entrepreneurship and sustainable development. We will move through three stages: (1) a brief review of work that SustainAbility has done in the area of corporate governance; (2) the three great waves of societal pressure on business since 1960, and where things seem likely to head next; and (3) some headline conclusions that emerged in this field from the World Economic Forum's 2006 annual summit in Davos.

AB This paper reviews some traditional and more recent methods for analyzing unreplicated experiments. Such experiments have presented a challenge to statisticians throughout their involvement in agricultural research. At Rothamsted this began in 1919, when R.A. Fisher was appointed to analyze the accumulated data from the classical field experiments. Fisher's experiences with the classicals, which had virtually no replication, must have contributed to his inclusion of replication as one of the key features of a well-designed experiment. Nevertheless, Fisher made good use of Rothamsted's data, for example in his study of the influence of rainfall on yields from the Broadbalk. He also devised the randomization test, which can be used to analyze unreplicated data. More recently, Broadbalk has also been used to study climate change and sustainability. Newer developments have been concerned to find alternatives to use, instead of blocking, to take account of the spatial variation within an experiment. The resulting methods for modeling spatial correlations have allowed experimenters to obtain more precise estimates of treatment effects-or to decrease numbers of replicates- and they can also provide reliable analyses of unreplicated treatments.

ID RESTORATIVE MATERIALS; STRENGTH; CEMENTS
AB Objective. Etching of enamel by self-etching adhesive systems is not as pronounced as with phosphoric acid employed with most total-etch adhesive systems. This may result in differences in the effectiveness of the bonds for the two types of systems. The aim of this study was to compare two such systems by bond strength and fatigue testing.
   Materials and methods. Shear bond strengths for Single Bond (SB) and Adper Prompt-L-Pop (PLP) were obtained on bovine enamel surfaces. Fatigue measurements were made with the same test fixtures using cyclical loading at 2 Hz for a maximum of 10(5) cycles or until the bond failed. Four selected loads between 40 and 70% of the shear bond strength were tested for each adhesive and the number of cycles to failure was recorded. S-N curves were constructed from the data and fatigue stress limits were determined. The Mann-Whitney U-test and t-tests were used for statistical comparisons of the results. SEM analysis of resin tag formation into enamel surfaces was carried out.
   Results. A significantly greater bond strength was found for SB (25.3 MPa) than for PLP (19.2). Sustainable stresses after 10(5) load cycles were substantially lower than the corresponding shear bond strengths and fatigue limits were found to be 8.4 MPa for PLP and 14.6 MPa for SB. The ratio of fatigue limit to bond strength was less for PLP (44%) than for SB (57%). Resin tag penetration into enamel was substantially less for PLP than for SB.
   Significance. Fatigue testing in conjunction with bond strength testing can provide a better means for assessing the performance of adhesive systems used for bonding to enamel. (C) 2005 Academy of Dental Materials. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Fluvial geomorphology is rapidly becoming centrally involved in practical applications to support the agenda of sustainable river basin management. In the UK its principal contributions to date have primarily been in flood risk management and river restoration. There is a new impetus: the European Union's Water Framework and Habitats Directives require all rivers to be considered in terms of their ecological quality, defined partly in terms of 'hydromorphology'. This paper focuses on the problematic definition of 'natural' hydromorphological quality for rivers, the assessment of departures from it, and the ecologically driven strategies for restoration that must be delivered by regulators under the EU Water Framework Directive (WFD). The Habitats Directive contains similar concepts under different labels. Currently available definitions of 'natural' or 'reference' conditions derive largely from a concept of 'damage', principally to channel morphology. Such definitions may, however, be too static to form sustainable strategies for management and regulation, but attract public support. Interdisciplinary knowledge remains scant; yet such knowledge is needed at a range of scales from catchment to microhabitat. The most important contribution of the interdisciplinary R&D effort needed to supply management tools to regulators of the WFD and Habitats regulations is to interpret the physical habitat contribution to biodiversity conservation, in terms of 'good ecological quality' in rivers, and the 'hydromorphological' component of this quality. Contributions from 'indigenous knowledge', through public participation, are important but often understated in this effort to drive the 'fluvial hydrosystem' back to spontaneous, affordable, sustainable self-regulation.

AB Sustainability Impact Assessment (SIA) of economic, environmental, and social effects triggered by governmental policies has become a central requirement for policy design. The three dimensions of SIA are inherently intertwined and subject to trade-offs. Quantification of trade-offs for policy decision support requires numerical models in order to assess systematically the interference of complex interacting forces that affect economic performance, environmental quality, and social conditions. This paper investigates the use of computable general equilibrium (CGE) models for measuring the impacts of policy interference on policy-relevant economic, environmental, and social (institutional) indicators. We find that operational CGE models used for energy-economy-environment (E3) analyses have a good coverage of central economic indicators. Environmental indicators such as energy-related emissions with direct links to economic activities are widely covered, whereas indicators with complex natural science background such as water stress or biodiversity loss are hardly represented. Social indicators stand out for very weak coverage, mainly because they are vaguely defined or incommensurable. Our analysis identifies prospects for future modeling in the field of integrated assessment that link standard E3-CGE-models to themespecific complementary models with environmental and social focus.

AB This paper presents a new approach to the development of environmental policy, relying on the combination of several instruments to achieve different objectives and on the active involvement of the stakeholders in the policy development process. The development of an innovative system of environmental policy instruments for sustainable management of pig farming in a municipality in Portugal is used to illustrate the proposed approach. The system is based on the adoption of a policy mix, combining a command and control approach, established through a regulation for the pig farming sector, with economic instruments (a sustainability fund and a tradable pig raising rights system) and voluntary approaches (an eco-label for meat products from farms with superior sustainability performance). The design of the instruments has followed a participatory and transparent approach, where the stakeholders were actively engaged in the decision making process. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

   research; systems analysis
ID SCIENCE; ENVIRONMENT
AB in ecological economics the terms sustainable development and transdisciplinarity are closely related. It is shown that this close relation is due to the fact that research for sustainable development has to be issue oriented and reflect the diversity, complexity and dynamics of the processes involved as well as their variability between specific problem situations. Furthermore, the knowledge of people involved and their needs and interests at stake have to be taken into account. There are three basic and interrelated questions about issues to be addressed in sustainability research: (1) In which way do processes constitute a problem field and where are the needs for change? (2) What are more sustainable practices? (3) How can existing practices be transformed? To treat them properly, transdisciplinary research is needed. The emergence of transdisciplinary research in the North and the South is described. By distinguishing analytically among basic, applied and transdisciplinary research the challenges that have to be tackled in transdisciplinary projects are analyzed. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

AB This paper addresses the risk of time inconsistency in economic appraisals related to the use of hyperbolic discounting (declining discount rates) instead of exponential discounting (constant discount rate). Many economists are uneasy about the prospects of potential time inconsistency. The paper discusses whether they have reason to be uneasy. The answer is no. The risk of reversing previous recommendations due to the passing of time alone is not severely larger for hyperbolic discounting than it is for exponential discounting. And it can be managed by the same rules of precaution normally used in long term strategic policy decisions and institutional reforms. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper aims to assist policy makers in formulating efficient and sustainable wetland management policies in accordance with the Ramsar Convention and the European Union Water Framework Directive (2000/60/EC), by providing results of a valuation study on the Cheimaditida wetland in Greece. A choice experiment is employed to estimate the values of changes in several ecological, social and economic functions that Cheimaditida wetland provides to the Greek public. In addition to the conditional logit model, a random parameter logit model, a random parameter logit model with interactions and a latent class model are estimated to account for heterogeneity in the preferences of the public for the various functions of the wetland. The results reveal that there is considerable preference heterogeneity across the public and on average they derive positive and significant values from sustainable management of this wetland. The estimated economic benefits of sustainable wetland management are weighed against the costs of alternative wetland management scenarios. Results of this cost-benefit analysis can aid in the design of socially optimal policies for sustainable management of the Cheimaditida wetland, with possible implications for other similar wetlands in Greece and the rest of Europe.

AB This study developed a generalised analytical framework that can be applied to integrating environmental sustainability aspects into economic development planning in the case of exploiting water resources through inter-basin water transfers (IBWT). The study developed and applied a multi-country ecological social accounting matrix (MC-ESAM) for Lesotho and SA to evaluate the ecological implications of the Lesotho Highlands Water Project (LHWP) and their consequent economic costs and benefits for the two countries. The study further used the developed MC-ESAM multipliers to analyse the impact of lost ecological services downstream the LHWP dams in Lesotho on the wellbeing of households directly affected by the project in Lesotho and the general economies of Lesotho and SA. The results revealed that while the LHWP has significant direct and indirect benefits in terms of social and economic development in Lesotho and SA, the project has serious unintended impacts on ecological resources and services, with deleterious wellbeing implications for populations residing within the reaches of the LHWP rivers and downstream the LHWP dams in Lesotho. The empirical analysis results showed relatively small impacts in general, but were significant for groups of people directly affected by the project in Lesotho. An important limitation of the empirical contributions of the study relates to the inability to measure and include in the analyses values of critical other ecosystem services of affected freshwater resources. Nevertheless, the study demonstrated the importance of integrated ecological economic accounting for comprehensive assessment of IBWT projects' impacts. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Assessment of land use and land use change and forestry (LULUCF) as CDM
   projects in Brazil
SO ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
LA English
DT Article
DE CDM; LULUCF; Brazil; emissions mitigation potential
AB Brazil is an active player in the CDM business, even playing host to the first CDM project ever registered. Although the majority of the CDM actions which have been developed to date in Brazil are in the energy sector, an analysis of Brazil's emissions profile demonstrates that the energy sector does not have a significant share of the country's emissions. Rather that 25% and 56% of the emissions stem from Agriculture and Land Use activities, respectively. In the light of this profile, this paper re-evaluates Brazil's national Green House Gas (GHG) matrix, and attempts to highlight the potential of the Land Use and Land Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF) CDM projects. An analysis of potential actions for improved penetration of LULUCF projects is presented, alongside key recommendations for future actions. This paper outlines how and why LULUCF projects can become the cornerstone of sustainable development policy in the North and North East region of Brazil, two of the main less developed regions in the country, totalling 62% of the country's land mass. A focus is made on three A/R projects recently development in Brazil. Through these case studies, an attempt is made to outline potential guidelines for future actions. This paper demonstrates that A/R projects have a significant potential impact on local and rural development in Brazil today. They have the potential to promote the sustainable use of forestry and soil resources. From the analysis it is clear that satisfying local community needs and commitments is a necessary prerequisite to achieving a situation where the risks associated with the issuing of the CER's (Certified Emission Reductions) could be better managed and also in line with enhanced support from the national authorities (as part of local development plans). The paper concludes that Brazil has significant potential to develop LULUCF CDM projects and that these projects can promote sustainable development through direct impact on the sustainable livelihoods of local communities over the long-term. It is recommended, in line with Brazil's current emission profile, that to realise this potential it is necessary to design a new relationship model between the key players involved in the CDM process: government agents, local stakeholders, national academia and private parties. Further it is necessary for the Federal Government to foster the LULUCF projects. Supporting actions include defining clear policies that minimise risk and/or reduce perceived risk and the promotion of multi-stakeholder involvement in the CDM project development process.

TI The index of sustainable economic welfare (ISEW) for a local authority:
   A case study in Italy
SO ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
LA English

DE local level; economic welfare; sustainability; ISEW; economic policy
ID PROGRESS INDICATOR GPI; THRESHOLD HYPOTHESIS; QUALITY; GROWTH
AB The Index of Sustainable Economic Welfare (ISEW) has been calculated for many countries, but rarely at the local level. This paper shows how the index has been calculated for the Province of Siena, Central Italy. The whole procedure is illustrated step by step, including the search for the most suitable and precise methods to obtain reliable values for each item composing the index. Application of ISEW at a very local level was found to be feasible. The most general difficulty encountered was the lack of an adequate institutionalised source of statistical information to support the construction of indicators other than purely economic or demographic ones. This is mainly due to the still low interest for a sustainable management of natural resources and land on the part of local authorities, and the related willingness to invest money and human resources on environmental research. The ISEW gives a more realistic representation of the well-being of the population than GDP, since it includes environmental and social items not considered in conventional national accounting. Furthermore, in Italy, the principle of administrative decentralization has been implemented in recent years to such an extent that the central government devolved part of its power to Regions, Provinces and Municipalities. Consequently, local authorities are called to allocate more resources to pursue their policies towards sustainability, an issue which modem electoral campaigns are often based on. The results for the Province of Siena show that there is a large gap between local GDP and ISEW (about 37% of GDP). (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We test the stability of the unadjusted and adjusted environmental Kuznets curves (EKCs). Our results provide evidence in favour of a theoretically funded "adjusted EKC hypothesis" in which the impact of per capita GDP on CO2 emissions is evaluated conditionally to the effects of the industry mix and of the energy-supply infrastructure. In this specification, the shape of the GDP-CO2 relationship appears quite sensitive to changes in the estimation period. In the final part of the paper, signs and dynamics of fixed effects of individual countries in different specifications are interpreted as measures of virtuous or vicious of environmental behaviour.

ID EXHAUSTIBLE RESOURCES; INDIGENOUS KNOWLEDGE
AB This paper proposes that the current growth-oriented exposition of the knowledge economy in literature is not only monistic but also partial. The mainstream's persistent emphasis on knowledge and economic growth and its neglect of knowledge and other critical issues (such as promoting wealth equalities and environmental conservation) lead to a paucity in terms of the variety of knowledge in the global knowledge commons, which will not fulfill the goal of sustainable development. To maintain a sustainable society with an efficient use of resources, it is necessary to achieve a more equitable distribution of wealth. This type of question, however, continues to be ignored and remains unanswered in both the Austrian analysis of the knowledge problem and the mainstream exposition of the knowledge economy. In this regard, John Stuart Mill's concept of the stationary state is in line with contemporary analysis of a sustainable society and is worth further review. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

TI Possibilities and barriers for recirculation of nutrients and organic

   applied to the medium-sized town Hillerod, Denmark

ID HUMAN URINE; WATER; DESIGN
AB We aimed to develop and evaluate technical solutions for increasing recirculation of nutrients and organic matter from urban areas. Furthermore, we assessed the feasibility of the solutions in a specific medium-size modern town setting - the municipality of Hillerod (approx. 27,000 inhabitants), Denmark. Fourteen integrated systems were described based on well-known technology and assessed on the basis of their ability to meet requirements in relation to public health, comfort, costs, durability; user friendliness, energy use, and recirculation potential. Of these 14, four were used to 'retrofit' into the existing town in an integrated municipal sewage and organic waste management system and the resulting change in terms of energy balances, recycling, and economic costs were modeled against a conventional 'reference' waste management system. For the chosen systems the energy saving corresponded to the yearly electricity consumption in 896 Danish households. it was estimated that capital and running costs were approximately 10% and 17% higher than for the reference system, including the net energy savings. The reference system produced sufficient nutrients for fertilising 152ha of agricultural field, whereas the alternative system in which nutrients were collected as sludge from biogas digester, human urine, and sludge from the wastewater treatment plant were enough for fertilising 451 ha of agricultural land. On the basis of this work it can be concluded that it is technically possible to design integrated ecological waste management systems, based on known technical components that may be operated at or close to the cost level of the current conventional sanitation systems. Such integrated systems need to be further developed and tested on a scale that will allow an interaction with farmers and their organizations, in order to evaluate their wider environmental consequences and to further integrate health and socio-cultural aspects. The main drivers for change in countries with a fully developed centralized sewage and waste infrastructure would seem to be either government policy-motivated (sustainability drive) or motivated by grass root movements, since the economic incentives for technology change are currently uncertain and probably small. However, in the middle-income countries, including part of the developing world, there is potential for considerable cost savings, and enormous need for development of waste and sanitation infrastructure, which would give impetus to more effective use of ecological sanitation.

AB In order to review the development, the potentials, and the challenges of the International Long-Term Ecological Research (ILTER) Network, the necessity for the development of the ILTER Network, the development of ILTER activities in the world, and the body structures of ILTER Network are described. As an example for showing the potentials of ILTER activities, exemplary results of tree growth studies carried out by the author utilizing long-term daily weather data at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest, New Hampshire, USA are presented and future potentials are discussed. At this time, as the ILTER Network is situated at a critical point, challenges for the ILTER Network are discussed with regard to its further development. In this review, the author tries to maintain that as the long-term ecological research, whose results can secure comparability in the dimension of time and space, can provide us with a fundamental basis for sound understanding and management of ecosystems, we can publicize the activities and findings from the ILTER Network to the public, on from local to international levels, to continue further efforts around the world for our sustainable future.

AB Viewed within a historical context, Asia has experienced dramatic land transformations, and currently more than 50% of Asian land area is under agriculture. The consequences of this transformation are manifold. Southeast Asia has the highest deforestation rate of any major tropical region. Many of the world's large rivers and lakes in Asia have been heavily degraded. About 11 of 19 world megacities with more than 10 million inhabitants are in Asia. These land use activities have resulted in substantial negative ecological consequences, including increased anthropogenic CO2 emissions, deteriorated air and water quality, alteration of regional climate, an increase of disease and a loss of biodiversity. Although land use occurs at the local level, it has the potential to cause ecological impact across local, regional and global scales. Reducing the negative environmental impacts of land use change while maintaining economic viability and social acceptability is an major challenge for most developing countries in Asia.

AB Asian dusts, yellow sand, or dust and sand storms (DSS) in Asian continent are the end products of desertification, which became a regional environmental problem being aggravated by time. It is closely related to an issue of sustainability in the region. As the desertification is caused not only by natural factors, such as the climate change, strong wind, and low precipitation, but also by rapidly increasing human activities, such as overgrazing, misuse of water resources, and irrational land use, it is urgent to make efforts to combat desertification in Asian continent including China. In this regard, it is necessary to consider socio-economic aspects as well as ecological aspects and, consequently, the project for the construction of a Demonstration Model Village for eco-environmental rehabilitation should be paid to a special attention. The authors deal with this regional issue in consideration of three Es, which are represented by ecology, economy, and environment in providing the perspectives in sound approach to the issue. As an approach to the issue of Asian dusts and desertification in Asian continent, this Eco-Village study provides one way forward.

AB This paper describes currency board regime operations in Bosnia and Herzegovina and assesses their performance and sustainability in the context of the economic, political, and institutional environment. To the best of our knowledge, our study seems to be unique in this respect. Based on our analysis, we judge that Bosnia and Herzegovina's currency board regime is well suited and appropriate, given the country's history, its current state, and its future goals. Nevertheless, we believe that the key to the currency board's sustainability, and an eventual accession to the European Union, is a stronger legal and regulatory infrastructure and a more unified political system.

AB Planning sustainable development projects requires comprehensive and reliable information to serve as the base for making timely and reasonable decisions. A Geographical Information System (GIS) can be used to obtain such information in a comparatively quick and easy way using specialized maps and numeric data. In this study, a GIS approach is established to enhance the development of a useful energy scenario for the selection of irrigation technologies in Bangladesh, based on the irrigated cropped area. The irrigation technologies considered were shallow tubewell, force mode tubewell, low lift pump, manual operated pump units, and traditional systems as power sources. The objective of this approach was to develop the energy scenario of irrigation technology during two cropping seasons in Bangladesh. The model estimated the amounts of energy used, the amounts needed, and shortages for the selected irrigation technologies. Mapping algebra in avenue request, and spatial analysis was done for multi-layered model development. The spatial distribution of the uses, needs, and shortages of energy was analyzed for 64 districts of Bangladesh. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID RELIABILITY INTERVAL METHOD
AB It is logical to believe that the building professionals (architect, structural engineers, building services engineers, etc.) are the relevant persons that may influence the decision-making process on a real estate development process. Accordingly, the attitudes and perception of building professionals should have a significant influence on sustainable development. This article describes a survey concerning the perceptions of different building professionals, which include architects, construction engineers and building services engineers, on the environment, resource sustainability, and green consumerism in two major cities in China: Hong Kong and Shenyang. It is recognized that energy is central to sustainable development and in 2006/2007, the United Nation Commission on Sustainable Development will focus on energy issue. The discussion in this article will concentrate on the building professionals' perception on energy related issues. Nevertheless, the findings in respect of their awareness of the environment, resources sustainability and other related issues are also summarized. At global level, apart from the need to preserve historical buildings, the professionals in Shenyang feel that 'exhaustion of natural resources' is of major concern and energy preservation is significant. However, the Hong Kong professionals do not consider energy resource sustainability is of urgency. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

DE policy instruments; diffusion; sustainable building
AB An integrative model to explain potential adopters' decisions to adopt energy innovations was adapted and applied in the field of new office building construction. We tested the relative effects of competing, theoretical explanations (derived from economics, innovation science and policy science) on the decision to adopt. The research covered 35 projects representing 9% of the total volume of new office construction in the Netherlands between 2000 and mid-2002. Two levels of explanations for adopting innovations were derived: (a) the potential adopter's weighed assessments of the innovations and his or her nature of decision making and (b) explanation of those first-level variables. Using multiple regression techniques, we determined the relative influence on innovation-adoption of variables covering economy and technology, government intervention, company characteristics, and influences from market and society. The decision to adopt 'mature' innovations, in contrast to 'young' innovations, is based more on routine procedures than project-specific considerations. Policies need to take this difference into consideration. We also show evidence that in promoting adoption of E-innovations for new office buildings the Dutch system of applying Energy Performance Standards and subsidies proofs to be effective.

AB A proper analysis (an evaluation) of the environmental load of consumption is important in the context of sustainable development. Presently, different methods are used to calculate the environmental load of household consumption, mainly in energy and or greenhouse gas emission terms. These methods are all based on input-output energy analysis, but use different data sources and produce different results. In this article, we discern and describe three methods used to calculate the total energy requirements of households, and we discuss the main results produced with these methods. All three methods are applied to the Netherlands in order to compare differences and similarities in the results. We found that the total energy requirement calculated with all three methods was almost the same, with differences less than 4%, however each method provides results at a different level. Basic energy input-output analysis generates total requirements and requirements per consumption category, and is therefore suitable for describing and explaining the effect of household consumption. The hybrid method combining energy input-output analysis with process analysis generates requirements per consumption item and therefore offers opportunities to search for options of change of household consumption patterns to more sustainable consumption.

DT Article
DE energy policy; nuclear energy; fast breeder reactors
AB India's GDP has been growing quite fast in recent past and it is forecast that it would continue to do so in the coming several decades. To realize the growth in GDP, it is necessary that corresponding growth in demand of primary energy as well as electricity is estimated and plans are made to meet the demand. Our estimate indicates that even after recognizing that energy intensity of GDP would continue to decline as in the past, the total electricity generation by the middle of the century would be an order of magnitude higher than the generation in the fiscal year 2002-2003. This calls for developing a strategy for growth of electricity generation based on a careful examination of all issues related to sustainability particularly abundance of available energy resources, diversity of sources of energy supply and technologies, security of supplies and self-sufficiency. This paper presents a scenario for growth of electricity in India. To meet the projected demand, the paper presents a strategy, which incorporates, wherever available, recommendations of various organs of the Government of India. It is observed that in order to limit cumulative energy import during the next 50 years to about 30%, the nuclear contribution towards electricity generation has to increase from the present 3% to about a quarter of the total. For the nuclear power to play this role, the programme of the Department of Atomic Energy to augment nuclear installed capacity to 20 GWe by 2020 based on a mix of Pressurized Heavy Water Reactors (PHWRs), Light Water Reactors (LWRs) and Fast Breeder Reactors (FBRs) should be completed and the R&D necessary to set up U-Pu metal-based FBRs of short doubling time and associated fuel reprocessing technologies should also be completed in the next 15 years.

AB In the present paper, a possible application of information theory for urban system analysis is shown. The ESM method proposed, based on Shannon's entropy analysis, is useful to evaluate different alternative measures of new energy saving technology transfer at different programming stages for consumption reduction and environmental impact control. A case study has been conducted in an urban area of Florence (Italy): the action/factor interaction entropy values can provide a scale of intervention priority and by comparing results obtained evaluating conditional entropy, ambiguity and redundancy, it is possible to identify the highest energy sustainable intervention in terms of higher or lower critical and risky action/ factor combinations for the project being carried out. The ESM method proposed, if applied to different urban areas, can provide a rational criterion to compare complex innovative and sustainable technologies for irreversibility reduction and energy efficiency increase.

AB Social learning is a prerequisite for sustainable energy use. This paper sets out some considerations from learning theory that offer a useful way of looking at domestic energy awareness and at actions to improve energy efficiency and conserve energy. Findings from a survey of residents of an English village that had won an 'energy-conscious village' competition are used to illustrate how individual and social learning can occur over a period of time, and how a 'top down' initiative may relate to other more informal sources of motivation and information. A model of learning about domestic energy use that incorporates awareness, action and feedback is proposed, and the implications for policy and further research are discussed. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

AB A technically attractive solution for sustainable present and future is to integrate photovoltaic (PV) panels into building fabric of urban houses as an alternative to grid electricity, however, in Serbia this technology is rarely applied. To contribute to sustainability and create success conditions for renewable energy sources (RES) applications due its wish to join EU, Serbian government currently integrated RES into its new energy policy framework. In the near future in the separate law, the government will identify financial conditions to apply this policy and start RES use. To adequately inform this law, we calculated the electricity revenue during entire life of a two-floor house in Belgrade, Serbia and investment in PV panels (currently available on Serbian market) integrated in its entire envelope. It was discussed what are the current degree of economic viability of this solution and suggested level of state subventions needed to support the solar electricity production either by feed-in tariffs or other financial instruments.
