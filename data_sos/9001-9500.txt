AB Sustainable development is a key factor for economic growth in the twenty-first century. It can be achieved in two stages, the first stage is to conserve and protect forest and other parts of the environment and the second stage is to have an appropriate economic plan to produce more agricultural and industrial goods. This investigation evaluates a possible method for sustainable development in the Sistan-Balochistan Province of Iran. Sistan-Balochistan has the lowest economic growth rate due to severe geographical and environmental constrains.

AB Although sustainable development has already been promulgated as one of its fundamental strategies by the national government since 1993, sustainable development, as an exotic new paradigm characteristic of profound philosophical and ethical thinking initiated in developed countries, is still not familiar to the Chinese people. Fortunately, in parallel to the evolution of sustainable agriculture, mainly in developed countries, since the beginning of the 1980s, Chinese agricultural scientists and technicians have already innovated their own unique form of Chinese Ecological Agriculture (CEA), on the basis of traditional agriculture that has been sustained for more than 4000 years. The basic principle of CEA emphasizes the obeying of both ecological rules and economic rules, as well as the approach of systematics and ecological engineering exactly corresponding to those adopted by sustainable development. The major difference between the two is that CEA has already been executed on a very large scale and has served as an effective and popularized way to implement sustainable agriculture in most parts of China. Also, as an active way of intensifying agriculture in terms of more inputs of skills, knowledge and labour, CEA is contributing much to all-round rural development throughout China.

AB By means of socioeconomic and ecological alternatives, a pilot project was conducted in Shanxin village, Cangwu County, Guangxi Province of Southern China. First, a participatory diagnosis of the degree and causes of mountain forest degradation and the current forest management state was carried out. Second, a participatory planning scheme was undertaken, based on the principle of protecting water and soil and alleviating poverty. A guarantee system to reclaim a patch of typical degraded secondary forest was established, planned to be a demonstration sample for promoting local forest sustainable management. Finally, the implementation of the planning scheme was monitored and evaluated. It was found that 80% of the seedlings replanted were dead, meaning the pilot trial had failed. Through further diagnosis and analysis the problem was isolated, and some gaps in the administration process and formulation of the guidelines were identified. In this paper, the lessons learned are documented, and targeted participatory management strategies are suggested for future sustainable development projects in poor mountain areas.

DT Article
DE industrial ecology; eco-industrial development; eco-industrial park;
   cleaner production, rapidly industrializing Asian countries
AB Rapidly industrializing Asian countries (RIACs) face both development and environmental challenges. The increasing resource and environmental pressures have impeded RIACs' efforts to quickly promote their people's quality of life, while protecting their natural environment. Due to lack of resources, technologies and capital, RIACs need to seek a more integrated development strategy. Industrial ecology may be one solution, as it aims at optimizing the use of materials and energy in products, processes, industrial sectors and economies by systemically mimicking natural systems in an industrial setting. The relevant practices and experiences in the developed world have proved that there is a degree of effectiveness and efficiency to development through the application of industrial ecology. It is even more critical to applying the principles of industrial ecology in RIACs with fewer resources. However, compared with the developed nations, RIACs face different environmental, economic and social constraints. Therefore, RIACs have to adopt different approaches to implement the concept of industrial ecology. In this paper, we first introduce the environmental, economic and social constraints in RIACs and imply that RIACs need a sustainable industrial development strategy, namely, 'producing more with less'. Then, we review the current practices on eco-industrial development in RIACs. As a specific case study, due to its size and increasing influence on the global economy and politics, China will be examined in detail with regard to its eco-industrial development practices. Through these approaches, the challenges to applying industrial ecology to RIACs will be analyzed and recommendations are provided.

AB While the concept of sustainable land management is now widely accepted, there remains considerable scope for developing location-specific land-use indicators for sustainability evaluation. A study was conducted to investigate the indicators of land-use sustainability in the context of tropical agro-ecosystems using the case of Sakaekrang watershed, Thailand. The biophysical data were generated from Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and the socioeconomic data were collected through a field survey. In the light of sustainable land management objectives, a total of 32 criteria were considered in the analysis to determine land-use sustainability, and identify indicators that best explain the sustainability level. About one quarter of the agricultural area in the watershed meets the sustainability threshold, indicating a substantial unstable area in the watershed. Among 11 indicators that showed a significant relationship with the computed land-use sustainability, land quality, source of farm income, and evapotranspiration were the most important.

ID HIMALAYA; SUSTAINABILITY; MANAGEMENT; CANADA
AB In the Kullu District, Himachal Pradesh, India, economic and urban growth, and diversification have increased pressure on forests and forest-based social-ecological systems. As in many Himalayan regions, livelihood sustainability is linked to forest resources, products and services. Recent development in the region, to which these systems may be vulnerable, brings into question environmental and livelihood sustainability. This paper examines the resilience of integrated systems of people and nature, or social-ecological systems, in the face of development pressures by evaluating a number of local and state-level institutional responses. Resilience, which describes the ability of the social-ecological systems to adapt to change by buffering shocks, improving self-organization and increasing capacity for learning, is an essential quality. for sustainable development. Institutional responses which positively contribute to resilience and sustainability include the work of mahila mandals in forest management, adoption of joint Forest Management (JFM) policies and practices, upholding rules, strengthening local institutions, establishing firewood depots and adopting alternative energy sources. Institutional failures brought about by the lack of rule enforcement and corruption erode resilience. The analysis of institutional responses helps to identify areas where capacity exists and areas in which capacity building is needed to produce resilient social-ecological systems and therefore, sustainable development.

AB A significant feature of the River Nile is its trans-boundary nature. The basin is shared among 10 riparian states. This trans-boundary character of the Nile presents a great challenge. At the heart of such a challenge is the imperative of poverty eradication. The sustainable development of the River Nile can help alleviate poverty by providing enhanced food, power and water security and associated employment creation. Co-operation in the Nile basin started in the form of bilateral agreements at the beginning of the last century. As an example of bilateral co-operation, in November 1959 Sudan and Egypt signed an agreement for the utilization of the shared waters of the River Nile. This agreement considers the rights of other riparian countries to the Nile waters. Countries of the Nile basin have been engaged in regional co-operative activities over the past 30 years: 'HYDROMET', 1967-1993; 'TECCONILE', 1993-1999; and 'NBI', 1998-present. The transitional mechanism was officially launched in February 1999 in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, by the Council of Ministers of Water Affairs of the Nile Basin States under the title of the Nile Basin Initiative (NBI). The NBI provides a unique forum for the countries of the Nile to move forward a co-operative process to realize tangible benefits in the basin and build a solid foundation of trust and confidence. The Nile basin countries have invested significant time, effort and resources into launching and sustaining the NBI. The NBI provides a transitional institutional mechanism for co-operation, an agreed vision and basin-wide framework, and a process to facilitate substantial investment in the Nile basin. It is based on the recognition that the basin has a shared past and a sharedfuture, and that there is an urgent need for development and for the alleviation of poverty. It represents deep commitment by the Nile riparian countries to foster co-operation and pursue jointly the sustainable development and management of Nile water resources for the benefit of all.

TI Irrigation water pricing in water user associations, Turkey
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WATER RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB Countries' social and economic policies as well as their priorities and preferences determine irrigation water pricing; it is a very complex, multi-dimensional and unknown problem in all countries. There is no guiding principle; therefore many different factors affect water pricing in agriculture. The water fee is the main revenue of Water User Associations (WUAs) in Turkey. Irrigation water fees have been determined by WUAs, taking into consideration crop area for gravity irrigation and volume for pump irrigation. Legal changes should be made in order to achieve sustainable WUAs immediately. Irrigation water pricing should be required to balance multiple objectives, such as economic efficiency, equity, water saving, management effectiveness and financial sustainability.

TI Sustainability indicators for Swiss dairy farms and the general
   implications for business/government interdependencies
SO INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF ADMINISTRATIVE SCIENCES
LA English
DT Article
AB This article explores the relevance of sustainable business development for society and the state. Sustainability of enterprises can be defined as demonstrating the ability to be capable of continuing the same type of business in the lifetime of the next generation. In the case of Swiss dairy farms, this type of sustainability may also depend on the willingness of the government and society to make the necessary financial adjustments. Sustainability indicators for such farms are, therefore, related to ecological and social benefits rather than simply to economic success. To evaluate the role of Swiss dairy farms, a system with economic, ecological and social indicators for measuring their sustainability would be valuable. This approach creates an integration of sustainability life-cycle assessment factors of enterprises, on the one hand, and purely economic business indicators, on the other. The approach developed in this article would be of interest to all sectors that depend on public support.

AB This article explores the potential for nation-states to become substantial contributors to sustainability governance. This potential resides in the ability of nation-states to make environmental protection a basic goal, in part by committing institutional resources toward the formation and implementation of substantive actions perceived necessary for long-term environmental sustainability. Existing research suggests that nation-states undertake environmental action in order to maintain legitimacy in the face of political pressure. While the maintenance of legitimacy is necessary, we argue that a substantive state role in sustainability governance is also dependent upon the rationalization of state environmental roles. Further, rationalization can be fostered through the enrichment of embedded state-societal networks with two key actors in civil society: environmental justice movements and environmental knowledge professionals. This article develops a conceptual framework that grounds sustainability efforts in rationalization processes and examines the synergistic potential for these two social actors to help build states that institute fundamental environmental reform.

   furrow; green manure; reduced tillage
AB Vertisols are among the major high potential soils in the central highlands of Ethiopia. Their productivity is constrained by severe waterlogging. Under traditional management systems, yield from these soils is far below the potential. To bridge the gap, several surface drainage methods were introduced and have shown a yield advantage over some of the traditional methods. However, alternative technologies for better crop yield and improved land resources management are still needed for sustainable use of the soils and water resources. As part of a concerted effort to improve productivity, field experiments were conducted during the 1996 and 1997 at Gincii, and 19982000 growing seasons at Caffee Doonsaa. Three land preparation methods, broad bed and furrows (BBF), ridge and furrows (RF) and flat seedbeds (FL) for the former, and four alternatives, BBF, RF, reduced tillage (RT) and green manuring (GM) for the latter, were evaluated. A randomized complete block design (RCBD) was used with three replications on permanent plots. Surface runoff and crops yields were considered as indicators of the efficiency of the land preparation methods. BBF gave the highest runoff at both locations over the years, but the effects on crop yields were inconsistent at both locations. BBF gave the lowest and the highest grain and straw yields in the first and the second years, respectively, at Gincii. GM and RT for cereals and BBF for a legume have shown better yield advantage at Caffee Doonsaa. To arrive at reliable conclusions, it is recommended that the experiment be continued under the prevailing cropping systems, taking soil quality and other sustainability indicators into account.

AB The irrigated arid and semi-arid zones in India face twin problems of overall water scarcity and waterlogging accompanied by salinity. Subsurface drainage has proved successful in the rehabilitation and conservation of waterlogged saline soils. Drainage water from subsurface drainage systems seems to be an important source of water in the next millennium to tide us over the anticipated water scarcity problem in agriculture. However, the drainage waters from subsurface drainage systems are often saline and in the absence of a natural outlet, their disposal creates a problem. Various possible options have been discussed to mitigate the environmental threat posed by low quality drainage waters. Issues relating to potential reuse of low quality drainage waters along with management practices are addressed. Effects of factors influencing the long-term sustainable use of saline drainage waters are presented and it is emphasized that special management practices have to be followed/evolved for site-specific water quality, soil, crop and climatic conditions. However, the extent of salt leaching and crop establishment will depend on the total amount of monsoon rains and adequate subsurface drainage. It has been concluded that the use of a part of the saline drainage water in the post-reclamation phase will not only augment the water supply but also minimize effluent disposal requirements.

AB The purpose of this project was to help bridge the gap between developers and residents by creating a design criteria checklist for outdoor residential areas and to validate the checklist by means of a post-occupancy evaluation (POE) carried out by the residents in six housing areas. Items addressed in the checklist covered general layout, complexity and coherence, identity and affection, construction materials, greenery, climate, pollution and noise, ecological sustainability, meeting areas, privacy, security and traffic control, and maintenance. The reliability of the expert form amounted to r =. 71 and each expert showed significant positive correlations with the other experts. The agreement between experts was consistently higher for some areas than for others. Based on 406 individuals, a factor analysis was carried out for the POE data, which rendered the following factors: Attachment, Outdoor Enjoyment, Aesthetics, Sustainability, and Social Interaction. The assessments by experts and residents were compared in terms governed by the structure of the factor analysis. The validation showed that POE Attachment was predicted by the total score of the expert form and that specific clusters of expert items predicted Outdoor Enjoyment and Aesthetics. It was not possible by means of the expert form to predict Sustainability and Social Interaction. We suggest that this tool will be useful for design education, for designing new residential areas, and for the assessment of existing residential areas.

AB Strategic managers today are faced with five critical judgment calls when formulating strategies for their companies: (1) Approaching strategy as an art or as a science, (2) publicizing the strategy or maintaining its secrecy, (3) seeking strategic consistency over the long term or maintaining flexibility, (4) embracing strategic risk or avoiding it, and (5) adopting a top-down or a bottom-up approach to strategic planning. This paper compares American and Mexican managers along these five areas. Findings suggest that conventional wisdom on differences between American and Mexican managers in strategy formulation may not be true. Future research directions are also provided.

AB Policy development is a dynamic and cyclic process characterised by successive stages of development, implementation and evaluation. Throughout this process, interaction between science and coastal management plays an important role. An illustration is given in this paper, based on an analysis of the history of coastal policy in the Netherlands over the last two decades. Evaluation in 1995 of the coastal policy of Dynamic Preservation, developed during the late 80's and implemented in 1990, led to a redefinition in 2000. Implementation in 2001, of a sustainable coastal policy in the Netherlands with both a small- and a large-scale approach, is the result.
   The analysis in this paper indicates that the successful development and implementation of coastal policy in the Netherlands, is related to the use of a systematic 'frame of reference'; characteristics are explicit definitions of both strategic and operational objectives applied in a 4-step decision recipe of (1) a quantitative state concept, (2) a bench marking procedure, (3) a procedure for CZM measures or intervention and (4) an evaluation procedure. Applications of this frame of reference show its high potential to better integrate coastal science and coastal policy and -management and to stimulate co-operation.

ID PUBLIC-HEALTH; PERCEPTIONS; PREVENTION
AB The Primary Prevention of Cancer Program at the British Columbia Cancer Agency Centre for the Southern Interior (BCCA-CSI), known as the Waddell Project, is now five years old and currently is in partnership with fourteen regional communities. Each of these communities has a range of community-developed programs currently in place. The driving force behind the Waddell Project comes from the belief that emancipatory change is central to community health. That is, only those communities that are capable of challenging, questioning, and creating change can make the cancer-prevention decisions that are relevant, useful, and sustainable within the context of the daily lives of their members. The resulting model for the project was influenced by Habermas's Theory of Communicative Action, from which are derived the project's guiding concepts of equality, negotiated content, collaborative process, inclusion of critique, importance of action, and mutual accountability. In this article, these concepts are revisited from the unique contexts and perspectives of the collaborating participants. Implications would suggest that the processes adopted to support empowered community engagement in cancer prevention are, in many ways, more beneficial than the implementation of the resulting initiative itself Furthermore, it would seem that, rather than funding, it is prolonged and supportive commitment that is the most crucial factor for facilitating emancipatory change in community health.

ID SOCIAL-SECURITY; CAPITAL ACCUMULATION; MODELS
AB A serious obstacle to China's economic reform is the lack of a sustainable pension system. Using a newly designed computable general equilibrium (CGE) model that differentiates 7 productive activities and 22 age and gender groups, this study compares various options for financing the implicit pension debt and estimates the effects of pension reform on the sustainability of the system and on economic growth. Simulation results show that the current pay-as-you-go system is not financially sustainable and the implicit pension debt is estimated at around 46 to 64 percent of GDP in 2000. The paper proposes to use value-added tax revenue to finance the transition cost, which would make the new multi-pillar system financially sustainable.

AB Ayong Le Kama (J. Econ. Dyn. Control 25 (2001) 1911) combines within an interesting model optimal saving (a la Ramsey) with optimal intertemporal renewable resource use a la Berck (J. Environ.

This note draws attention to two possible outcomes-thresholds and limit cycles-that are overlooked in Ayong Le Kama (but also in other recent works) and that are quite important in this context.

AB In this paper we examine a group formation problem, where heterogeneous individuals partitioned themselves into communities, each choosing its own public project from the given space of feasible projects. The model is that of "horizontal product differentiation" where individuals display distinct preferences over the policy space. We consider the notion of "efficient" configuration that minimizes the total project-related costs and aggregate personalized costs of all individuals, and "sustainable" configurations, those are immune against breakaways by subgroups of individuals. Our main result is that, with a unidimensional project space and single-peaked personalized costs, every efficient partition is sustainable. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science (USA). All rights reserved.

TI Bermudagrass management in the Southern Piedmont, USA: IX. Trace
   elements in soil with broiler litter application
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY
LA English

ID CADMIUM; METALS; COPPER; ZINC; LEAD
AB An understanding of the long-term cycling of trace elements in soil with broiler litter fertilization under various forage utilization strategies is needed to develop sustainable agricultural production systems. We evaluated differences in Cu, Mn, Zn, and six other trace elements in response to 5 yr of bermudagrass [Cynodon dactylon (L.) Pers.] management varying in fertilization and harvest strategies on a Typic Kanhapludult in Georgia. Chicken (Gallus gallus) broiler litter was a significant source of trace elements that led to 3.4 +/- 0.5 times higher Cu, 2.0 +/- 0.3 times higher Mn, and 2.1 +/- 0.2 times higher Zn in the surface 3 cm of soil than when forage was fertilized inorganically. There were variable effects of broiler liner fertilization on other trace elements, depending upon element, depth of sampling, and forage utilization strategy. Concentrations of all trace elements in soil were below levels considered toxic to plants. Soil at a depth of 0 to 3 cm under grazed paddocks had 33 +/- 5% greater Cd, 18 +/- 1% greater Cr, 53 +/- 24% greater Cu, and 24 +/- 7% greater Zn compared with unharvested and bayed management. Trace elements in soil were unaffected whether forage was unharvested or removed as hay. These results suggest that broiler litter is a significant source of several trace elements and that ruminant processing of forage and subsequent deposition of excreta on the paddock allow these trace elements to accumulate more at the soil surface where they might interact with the high concentration of organic matter.

TI Health impact assessment as an agent of policy change: Improving the
   health impacts of the mayor of London's draft transport strategy
SO JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY AND COMMUNITY HEALTH
LA English
DT Article
AB Objective: To increase the positive and mitigate the negative health impacts of the mayor's draft transport strategy for London.
   Design: A rapid prospective health impact assessment (HIA) of the penultimate draft of the strategy, using a review commissioned by the regional director of public health; an appraisal of congestion charging; and a participatory workshop. Two audits of changes were performed to assess the impact on policy of the HIA process.
   Setting: Regional government policy development. Intervention: Recommendations from the rapid HIA were fed back into the drafting process.
   Main outcome measure: Changes ( a) between the penultimate draft and the draft for public consultation and (b) between that and the final mayoral strategy.
   Results: The draft transport strategy published for consultation differed in a number of respects from the previous version. Almost all the recommendations from the HIA were incorporated into the final strategy. Significant changes included promoting sustainable travel plans for workplaces and schools; giving priority to infrastructure and services that benefit London's deprived communities; increased emphasis on promoting walking and cycling and reducing reliance on private cars; and a commitment to track the health impacts of the final strategy and its implementation. Specific additions included re-allocating road space.
   Conclusion: HIA was successful in influencing the transport strategy for London, resulting in several improvements from a health viewpoint. HIA is an effective method both for bringing about significant change in policy proposals and in increasing policy makers' understanding of determinants of health and hence in changing attitudes of policy makers.

AB Soil is commonly described as the mantle or the skin covering the landmass of planet Earth. Soils perform 6 main functions (biomass production, water quality maintenance, biological habitat, physical infrastructure support, raw materials for human use, and maintaining cultural heritage) and a soil is evaluated by its ability to perform one or more of these functions. The ability of the land to feed and clothe people and to maintain ecological functions is being impeded by demographics. The global land area that is generally free of constraints for most agricultural uses is about 12.6%. Agricultural land, however, is unequally spread around the globe with a larger portion in the temperate countries of the world. In addition to poorer land quality in tropical regions, land degradation is also well entrenched, thus aggravating food security. There are 11.9 million km(2) of such lands and about 1.4 billion people are involved and most of these areas are in the developing countries. Countries of the developing parts of the world have to make a conscious decision to better manage their land resources. The paradigm shift that poorer countries need to make to sustain food production is to implement holistic and sustainable land management programs by adopting technologies that have already been validated in other parts of the world.

AB Policy analysis contributes to sustainable forestry by defining forestry problems in social and decision contexts to generate sustainable management options through synthesis of multiple perspectives. Scale issues are accommodated by limiting analysis to a location appropriate to the problem and context, including institutional arrangements and spatial and temporal concepts of fairness perceived by stakeholders. Management policies for National Forest System lands produce some sustainability problems. Statutory changes offering improvement include legitimizing the modern integrated sustainable forest management concept and requiring inclusive, consensus-building processes for generating durable forestry project decisions.

ID ECOSYSTEM MANAGEMENT; PERCEPTIONS; SERVICE
AB On December 6, 2002, the USDA Forest Service published a proposed planning rule that replaces postdecisional appeals of land and resource management plans with a "predecisional objection process" within a framework of collaborative planning for sustainability. This article examines the Forest Service's rationale for eliminating postdecisional appeals, provides an overview of accountability relationships, and explores the implications for democratic accountability if the proposed rule eliminating postclecisional appeals is adopted. Appeals have provided an important mechanism of accountability in forest planning. There are questions about whether the objection process will provide a comparable means of accountability. The change represents a shift away from traditional legal and hierarchical accountability relationships toward accountability based on public deliberation and scientific input in a collaborative planning process. The success of such a model depends on successfully institutionalizing collaborative planning throughout a large, decentralized organization.

DE Beetle assemblages; Habitat fragmentation; New Zealand; Urban reserves
AB Urban reserves provide a major opportunity for conservation of indigenous biodiversity in the heavily urbanised landscape of Waitakere City (Auckland), New Zealand. However, there is little documented information on what indigenous fauna survives in these reserves. Beetle (Coleoptera) communities associated with two small, isolated urban reserves and two sites in a larger forest area within the Waitakere Ranges were sampled using pitfall traps and analysed. A total of 887 beetles, from 23 families and 89 recognisable taxonomic units were caught. The urban reserves had a marked reduction in species richness and abundance of beetles compared with the sites within the larger forest areas. Various environmental factors influencing the distribution of beetles across the sites were investigated. The most important factors were size of fragment, local forest cover and soil moisture. 'Common' species (>5 specimens in the total dataset) found in the Waitakere Ranges and small urban reserves, were either endemic or indigenous to New Zealand. Therefore, even though these reserves may be isolated from a larger, more continuous forest tract, they have considerable potential as reservoirs of beetle diversity in highly modified landscapes and the contribution of urban reserves to the local sustainability of beetle assemblages emphasises the importance of maintaining 'green' areas in and around cities.

AB This paper examines how public debt, government credibility and external circumstances affect the probability of currency devaluations in a three-period, open-economy version of the Barro and Gordon (J. Polit. Economy 91 (1983) 589) model. Nominal public debt links current to future policy actions: resisting a crisis may either enhance or undermine the sustainability of the exchange rate regime depending on whether what matters is the government's reputation or fundamentals, i.e. the level of the debt. The focus is on the impact of public debt, debt maturity and the government's credibility on the expected devaluation in the current and future periods. We can thus identify the factors that affect the short-term interest rate and the forward rate, hence derive predictions about the level and the slope of the yield curve. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

   horizontal drains; land reclamation; subsurface drainage
AB In the early days of the Reclamation Service, the criteria for irrigability of lands generally consisted of two elements: (1) is water available? and (2) can we get the water to the land? Within a few years, many of the early projects were experiencing reduced agricultural productivity and reduced ability to repay construction loans because the soils were becoming waterlogged and saline. By 1915, construction of subsurface drainage facilities had been initiated on several projects. However, at the time, subsurface drainage was more of an art than a science. Much of the world's experience with agricultural drainage had been gained in humid areas which were quite different from and areas. With no standards and limited knowledge of ground water movement, these early drainage efforts met with varying degrees of success. This paper summarizes the development of scientific methods to ensure successful application of drainage in a. sustainable irrigated agriculture. Reclamation has introduced these methods to solve irrigated drainage problems at the international level. This paper will address the international experience, and how the same design and construction methods and procedures are now being used to design corrective drainage facilities for dams and other major structures and to support environmental enhancement programs.

AB Trust has been a focus of research on virtual collaboration in distributed teams, e-commerce, e-learning, and telemedicine. Central to several models of trust and virtual collaboration is user's disposition to trust. This construct, however, has generally been conceptualized in as a stand-alone trait without a substantive theoretical background in personality theory. This paper advances the interpersonal circumplex model (ICM) as a theoretical framework for understanding the role of personal traits in collaboration in virtual contexts. The ICM posits that tendencies in interpersonal interaction stem from personal dispositions that can be understood in terms of dimensions of power and affiliation, fundamental constituents of user's personality. We develop a model that proposes that interpersonal traits, specifically, personality type as defined by the circumplex, affect the individual's disposition to trust, perceived trustworthiness, communication, and thereby affects willingness to collaborate and the sustainability and productivity of the collaboration. The model enables us to unpack the black box concepts of disposition to trust, faith in others, and trusting stance that are currently incorporated in theories of trust in information systems. The theory also enables explanation of trust dynamics at the dyadic and group levels. We develop propositions positing that individual's traits and dyadic complementarity are mediating factors in interpersonal trust and willingness to use new technologies and significantly affect the initiation, duration, and productivity of computer-mediated collaboration.

AB This article advocates that more strategy researchers and managers become engaged in an interactive, reciprocating research process, the objective of which is building pragmatic strategic management theory. To this purpose, the authors suggest how researchers and managers may engage in theory-building processes in which generalized theories of researchers and contextual theories of managers interactively evolve in a new model of double-loop learning. In particular, the authors suggest the following sequence of activities: (a) Researchers should propose integrative theories thought to be generally applicable; researchers and managers should then consider applicability of strategy theory to specific competitive contexts. (b) This strategic logic is then formulated by managers and applied to specific competitive contexts. (c) The market response leads to refining or to redefining the firm's strategic logic. (d) The firm's experience in formulating and in testing strategic logics inform researchers' efforts to develop new strategy theory.

ID CAPITALISM; BUSINESS
AB This paper evaluates the evolution and the implementation of the ANC government's commitment to fostering a black capitalist class or black economic empowerment (BEE) as a non-racial nation-building strategy. A substantial black bourgeoisie and other middle classes have begun to emerge over the last decade, contrary to popular perceptions. The legitimating role assigned to the emergent black bourgeoisie by the ANC and the government, however, threatens to turn the strategy into a nepotistic accumulation. This development is paradoxically threatening to re-racialise the country, widening black inequality gaps, and precluding the rise of a black bourgeoisie with a nurture capitalist agenda. Other equally powerful social groups have begun to challenge the prevailing strategy, compelling the government to explore a more accommodating strategy exemplified by the recent introduction by the government of 'broad-based economic empowerment'. Should a less patrimonial, less racially and ethnically divisive BEE strategy emerge from this quasi-pluralist power play, such a change holds prospects for the creation of a 'growth coalition' capable of sustainable capitalist development and true empowerment of the black majority. That would be a positive development in terms of establishing and consolidating democracy in South Africa.

ID DEMOCRATIZATION
AB Theory informs us that decentralisation, a process through which powers, responsibilities and resources are devolved by the central state to lower territorial entities and regionally/locally elected bodies, increases efficiency, participation, equity, and environmental sustainability. Many types and forms of decentralisation have been implemented in Africa since the colonial period, with varying degrees of success. This paper explores the process of forest management decentralisation conducted in Cameroon since the mid-1990s, highlighting its foundations and characterising its initial assets. Through the transfer of powers to peripheral actors for the management of forestry fees, Council Forests and Community [or Village] Forests, this policy innovation could be empowering and productive. However, careful observation and analysis of relationships between the central state and regional/local-level decentralised bodies, on the one hand, and of the circulation of powers, on the other, show - after a decade of implementation - that the experiment is increasingly governed by strong tendencies towards 're-centratisation', dictated by the practices of bureaucrats and state representatives. The paper also confirms recent empirical studies of the capture of decentralised actors'. It finally shows how bureaucrats and state authorities are haunted by the Frankenstein's monster syndrome, concerning state local relationships in decentralised forest management.

AB Pretreatment of date palm seedlings with an hypoaggressive Fusarium isolate (AHD) protected them partially from further infection by Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. albedinis (Foa), the Bayoud disease pathogen. No mortality occurred during 2-3 months of incubation in plants pretreated with AHD, as opposed to aggressive isolate (ZAG) inoculated controls where up to 100% mortality was observed 15-30 days after inoculation. Such protection involved biochemical interactions between the host plant and AHD since no direct competition or antagonism was revealed between AHD and ZAG. The examination of the accumulation of phenolics and peroxidase activity, two parameters previously reported to be involved in date palm resistance to Foa, indicated that the response to AHD was correlated with the ability of pretreated date palm tissues to establish a faster defence response in the roots of both susceptible and resistant cultivars. Plants pretreated with AHD accumulated higher amounts of phenolics, mainly non-constitutive hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives, which play a crucial role in date palm defence against Foa, as previously described by our group. These compounds were accumulated along with the constitutive caffeoylshikimic acids. A faster induction of peroxidase activity in response to Foa was also recorded in plants pretreated with AHD. Given the multi-component nature of these induced responses, AHD could be part of integrated disease management strategies for a sustainable control of the palm tree Bayoud disease.

AB In this article, sustainable development is defined in terms of thirty-nine policies and techniques. In October 2001, a survey was sent to U.S. cities that (1) measures the extent to which actions are being taken relative to these policies and techniques and to local planning offices being involved in the taking of such actions and (2) identifies the principal impediments to the taking of such action. Among the findings were that communities of all sizes and in all parts of the country are active in a wide range of policies and techniques, and impediments to such adoption are less related to politics and institutional capacity and more to motivation and knowledge.

ID EDUCATION; COLOMBO; CITY
AB In order to be relevant and useful in a fragmented developing country context, community and regional planning needs to shift away from the use of rigid tools to more flexible, adaptive approaches. An international review of planning curricula indicated a widespread consensus with respect to key competencies required of planners. This understanding was used in the development of new teaching programs at three Sri Lankan universities. Complementing the technical core knowledge areas, strong emphases on problem structuring, critical and strategic thinking, and the understanding of the political and institutional contexts appear to be crucial to making the agenda of "planning for sustainable development" more than a fashionable cliche. In order for these core areas to have relevance in a developing country context, however, planning curricula need to achieve a balance between local priorities and a "global" perspective.

AB The objective of this paper is to empirically test the hypothesis that reducing uncertainty for farmers through investment in human capital increases the likelihood of participation in an agroforestry development program. A model based on Keynes's notion of profit expectations and "weight" is developed in order to gain some insight into agroforestry adoption behavior Data was collected near the Calakmul Biosphere Reserve in the state of Campeche in southeastern Mexico. One hundred seventy-five farmers were interviewed from January through March of 1998. Results support the hypothesis that human capital investment improves the likelihood of participation in an agroforestry development program.

AB The concept of a risk related value of the spend for saving a statistical life (VSSSL) is advanced for use in cost-benefit studies across the power generation sector, and the nuclear industry in particular. For illustrative purposes, a best estimate VSSSL is set based on HSE guidance at pound2 M. Above a risk of 10(-3) y(-1) it is assumed that the VSSSL may approach this maximum sustainable value. As the risk reduces so does the VSSSL. At a risk level of 10(-6) y(-1) a VSSSL of pound0.5 M is applied. For risks below 10(-9) y(-1) the value of further risk reduction approaches zero, although a nominal VSSSL of pound10 k is applied as a pragmatic way forward in this study. The implications of adopting this concept as an aid to decision making in determining the spend on radiological dose reduction measures are illustrated through a worked example with a banded approach to estimating collective dose.

ID RANGELAND; VEGETATION
AB Knowledge of the relationship between stocking rate or grazing intensity and plant production is fundamental to the sustainable management of rangelands. The general management paradigm is that plant production declines as stocking rate increases. Our objective was to determine the impact of stocking rate on herbaceous production of a sand sagebrush (Artemisia filifolia Torr.)-grassland. Stocking rates averaging 43, 57, and 85 animal-unitdays ha(-1) (AUD ha(-1)) for year-round grazing were applied from 1941 to 1961. Herbaceous plant production was determined by sampling standing crop in temporary exclosures at the end of the growing season from 1958 to 1961, the last 4 years of the grazing study. Total herbaceous production averaged over stocking rates and years was 1,490 kg ha(-1). Grasses contributed 89 % of the total while forbs contributed 11 %. Total production averaged 1,540, 1,470, and 1,450 kg ha-1 for stocking rates of 43, 57, and 85 AUD ha(-1) y(-1), respectively. There were no differences among stocking rates for total production or for the production of any individual grass species (P > 0.05). Forb production was also not affected by stocking rate, averaging 200, 140, and 120 kg ha-1 for stocking rates of 43, 57, and 85 AUD ha(-1) y(-1) (P > 0.05). Differences in production among years were much greater than differences among stocking rates for all vegetation components. Little bluestern [Schizachyrium scoparium (Michx.) Nash] and sand lovegrass [Eragrostis trichodes (Nutt.) Wood] showed the greatest responses to favorable precipitation. Herbaceous production of this sand sagebrush-grassland was little affected by 20 years of differential stocking rates.

AB Information on the long-term impact of repeated annual fertilizer applications of different nitrogen (N) sources on soil and plants is needed to develop sustainable grassland production systems. The concentration of macronutrients in the 0-5, 5-10, 10-15, 15-30, 30-60, 60-90 and 90-120 cm layers in a thin Black Chernozemic (Typic Boroll) soil and in bromegrass (Bromus inermis Leyss.) hay were compared after 15 annual applications of 168 and 336 kg N ha(-1) as ammonium nitrate, urea, calcium nitrate, and ammonium sulphate, and a zero-N check. The concentration of NO3-N was increased by ammonium nitrate and ammonium sulphate at both N rates in most soil layers, by calcium nitrate at both N rates and by urea at 336 kg N ha(-1) in the 1560 cm soil. The accumulation of NO3-N increased with soil depth down to 60 cm, except for urea and ammonium sulphate at 168 kg N ha(-1), and then it declined in deeper soil layers. The concentration of NH4-N was increased with fertilizer applications in some of the surface soil layers. The concentration of P was increased in the top 15 cm soil by ammonium nitrate and ammonium sulphate. The concentrations of Ca, Mg and K in the surface soil declined with most of the N fertilizer treatments while some treatments increased the Ca and Mg concentrations in the deeper soil layers. Increasing the N rate from 168 to 336 kg N ha(-1) usually accentuated the above stated N effects on the concentration of macronutrients in the soil. The nitrate-based fertilizers caused more accumulation of NO3-N in some soil layers than the ammonium-based fertilizers. The relative increase in the concentration of NH4-N and P and the decline in the concentration of Ca, Mg and K in the soil by N addition was usually associated with the concomitant lowering of soil pH by N fertilization. In bromegrass hay, the total N concentration was increased by N fertilization but the concentration of other elements, except K, usually declined because of the dilution effect of the extra hay yield associated with N addition. Increasing the N rate from 168 to 336 kg N ha(-1) further elevated the total N concentration but had no effect on the concentration of the other elements. Total N concentration in the hay tended to be greater with ammonium sulphate and ammonium nitrate than with the other 2 fertilizers. The concentration of total S was greater with ammonium sulphate than the other N fertilizers, and the concentration of P, Ca, Mg and K was not affected by the N fertilizer type. Fertilizer-induced high levels of NOYN, NH4-N and P in soil may present potential for environmental pollution at these high N rates.

ID ADVOCACY COALITION FRAMEWORK; POLICY
AB It is usually assumed that large-scale facilities 'have to go somewhere'. The problem of finding sites is frequently construed as meeting some national need whilst ensuring justice for local communities who bear the brunt of environmental hazards and costs. This paper explores the dynamics of siting controversies and their relationship with political and economic priorities. Drawing on evidence from the transport and minerals sectors in the UK, it challenges the dominant storyline in which conflicts over siting are represented in terms of 'national need versus local interests'. Consequently it calls into question the concept of the policy 'cascade', whose advocates seek to restrict debate about generic issues at local inquiries. It is argued that local resistance both provides an institutional platform for, and is in turn reinforced by, a wider policy critique. Arrangements for consideration of specific projects therefore provide crucial apertures for debate about national priorities, and repeated controversy acts as an important longer-term stimulus to policy learning and change.

TI Sustainable innovation and the siting dilemma: thoughts on the
   stigmatization of projects and proponents, good and bad

ID PERCEIVED RISK; TRUST
AB The exercise of siting environmentally stigmatized facilities touches the central nerve of modernity. It represents a true dilemma, a set of conflicting conditions that cannot be brought into harmony. From a local perspective, siting is commonly thought of as an act of inherent violence to place and community. At the same time, modern life generates conditions that demand some form of collective action to solve the problems it generates. Yet, whether such 'solutions' represent government action on behalf of the larger society or private action on behalf of entrepreneurs, the very 'problem sets' involved have become inherently stigmatized. By their very nature, they represent degradation, devaluation and diminution of quality of life-health, aesthetics, lifestyle and lifescape. No rational person or community would choose them, given real choices. The double entendre of modernity is that its reflexivity involves both the reflection back of socially created risks but also that these risks evoke a 'knee jerk' reaction of opposition. Such reviling makes perfect sense when opposition occurs to obviously 'bad' facilities. A much more challenging context for examination involves opposition to potentially 'good' projects. Using a case study, this article explores the definition of a 'good' sustainable project, the dynamics needed to achieve sustainability, and the roadblocks to sustainable action that occur with shallow rather than deep resistence to siting.

DT Article
AB School mental health programs are increasingly prominent in the United States and in other countries, but funding remains tentative. This article describes a partnership between a school mental health program and an outpatient mental health center, and considers the larger goal of promoting sustainability and increasing revenue. Issues related to using fee-for-service revenue to support school mental health are explored, and strategies for promoting effective partnerships are discussed. Recommendations for programs facing the challenge of incorporating fee-for-service activities into their current model of service provision are provided.

AB The research reported in this paper identifies those factors that, taken together with Information Systems (IS) augmentations, affect the competitive positioning of businesses. The research focuses on the financial services, retailing and manufacturing sectors, spanning the levels of business information intensity found in the UK.
   The paper is in two parts. The first deals with the scope and duration of the achievement of IS-enabled enhanced competitive positioning. Around 25% of businesses in the sample were judged to have at least one IS that allowed the organisation to gain competitive advantage, whilst 30% were judged to have at least one IS that nullified a competitor's advantage. Broadly, all sectors showed the same pattern. The median time that a competitive advantage was held was between 6 and 18 months.
   The second part of the paper is concerned with the establishment of an IS-enabled opportunity framework, identifying the associated business benefits, the associated changes in competitive position, and the sources of sustainable achievement. Twenty-two factors were identified as being significant in turning a business benefit into a competitive advantage, and seven were identified as significant in converting this competitive advantage into a sustainable one. These factors were overwhelmingly within the internal architecture of the organisation. The findings support the view that sustainable IS-enabled competitive advantage is elusive.

AB Sustainability and sustainable development are considered complex and lack commonly agreed principles of application. This has led not only to a diversity of seemingly competing tools but also puts scientists in conflict in legal actions. Science with its core commitment to testing, peer review, and repeatability offers the option for a credible definition of sustainability that can ensure that all players are moving in the same direction and personal value judgements are limited to interpretation of detail. This paper looks at the role of science in defining limits for sustainability, as in The Natural Step Framework, and at its current usage in legal debate such as the Resource Management Act. Evaluation of current approaches and tools against an existing hierarchical model of planning in complex systems is used to offer more constructive and cooperative options for the future. Sustainability science needs an integrated and inter-disciplinary approach as well as the more common specialist disciplinary approaches.

TI Monitoring the effect of irrigation with gypsiferous mine wastewater on
   crop production potential as affected by soil water and salt balance
SO JOURNAL OF THE SOUTH AFRICAN INSTITUTE OF MINING AND METALLURGY
LA English
DT Article
ID DRAINAGE
AB Irrigation of agricultural crops may be a cost-effective option for the utilization of gypsiferous minewater as it may also create an opportunity to produce crops during the dry winter season on farms in South Africa, such as in Mpumalanga. in this study, intensive field monitoring systems were developed and implemented to assess the feasibility and sustainability of irrigation with gypsiferous mine water. Soil water and salt balance components, as well as crop yields, were monitored in field trials carried out at Kleinkopje and New Vaal Collieries (Anglo Coal), and at Syferfontein (Sasol). Field measurements indicated that high crop and pasture yields can be obtained, provided fertilization and irrigation water management are appropriate.
   Soil water and salt balances indicated that considerable amounts of minewater can be used and considerable masses of salts can be removed through precipitation of gypsum in the soil profile. with appropriate management, water and salt runoff and salt leaching can be intercepted, thereby minimizing the impact on groundwater.
   The SWB model is being validated through on-going monitoring. This will allow the use of the SWB model at other sites to predict the long-term impact of irrigation with mine water on soil and groundwater, as well as to run scenario simulations in order to recommend sustainable management of irrigation with minewater.

ID SMALL RUMINANTS; KIDS; PREGNANCY; BOTSWANA
AB The economic impact of different extension messages used was calculated using enterprise budgeting (gross margin analysis). Input data were gleaned from the literature, from participatory appraisals, as well as a field study, spanning 12 months, of small-scale communal goat farming systems in Jericho in the Odi District of North West Province. The number of offspring weaned per annum, as a proportion of does owned, was selected as the desired output for analysis. This study has shown that small-scale communal goat farmers are not adopting or implementing extension messages to improve production capacity. In south Africa the majority of goats are slaughtered in the informal sector. If the informal sector is to be persuaded to market goats commercially through formal channels, then knowledge of the economics of goat farming on communal lands should be provided. The economic aspects of extension messages are probably an important factor in determining acceptance and sustainability yet appear to be seldom investigated. The probable reason for lack of adoption of standard extension messages, which promote improved nutrition, parasite control, vaccination and treatment of goats, was economic. In other words, the so-called 'poor management practices' used by communal farmers appeared to be economically more profitable than the 'good management practices' suggested to increase production. The price of communal goats was not related to their mass. A higher level of inputs would probably have resulted in a heavier kid, however it was established that this would not have influenced the price received as a majority of the goats were slaughtered for ritual purposes where age, colour and sex were more important to the purchaser than body mass. It is standard practice in commercial farming systems to evaluate the economic benefits of all management practices before they are implemented. Production animal veterinarians use veterinary economics to compare different scenarios to control diseases or select management practices in commercial herds. It is suggested that the inputs and outputs of small-scale farming systems should be carefully analysed and that veterinary economics should also be used to evaluate the probable impact of extension messages formulated by veterinarians and animal health technicians.

TI Reforming work - Gender, class, and the printing trade in Victorian
   Britain
SO JOURNAL OF WOMENS HISTORY
LA English
DT Article
AB Women's employment in industrial trades was a highly contested issue in Britain during the second half of the nineteenth century. Nowhere was this more evident than in women's attempts to gain a foothold in printing. This article explores the campaign that Victorian feminists waged to enable women to enter the industrial workforce in the face of increasing opposition by male workers and labor organizations. Trade unions cast woman printers as a threat to the family wage; in response, women founded their own printing organizations. Started in 1876, the Women's Printing Society employed both working- and middle-class women as printers. Unable to join male-run printing houses because of the restrictions that the London Compositor Unions imposed, the Society created a place for women in the industry by basing their business on a system of shared profits that benefited both employees and investors. These businesses issued one of the first sustainable challenges to gendered hierarchies of work by reforming capitalist business practices in order to provide new opportunities for women workers.

AB The United States and its allies face enormous challenges in charting a sustainable, long-term course for the global War on Terrorism (WOT). The War has become a lightning rod for controversy. While it has achieved some important successes, the jihadist cause that attracts fringe elements in the Islamic world into terrorist organizations appears to be spreading. Transnational terrorism comes in many variants, but groups with a specific national or regional focus do not equate to the kind of globally pervasive threat posed by Al Qaeda and its affiliated groups.
   The Bush Administration is prosecuting the WOT as a four-pronged campaign: to defeat terrorist networks; to deny these groups state sponsorship; to diminish underlying conditions that terrorist groups exploit; and to defend the U.S. homeland against terrorist attacks. Progress has been made on the first, second and fourth of these missions.
   The WOT's long-term success will hinge upon: building reliable partnerships within countries plagued by extremist violence; assuring that CT assistance is not used to stifle legitimate dissent; keeping WMD out of the hands of criminals and terrorists; finding an optimal balance between military and non-military instruments; expanding human intelligence assets; and undermining the extremist ideologies that fuel terrorism. Within the Asia-Pacific region, the priority needs to be on building state capacities in Southeast Asian states and improving security in the maritime domain.

AB This study analyzes the differences between the villagers' and the Forest Department's preferences in the choice of tree species to be planted in eastern Rajasthan, India. Locals learned to manage the tree resources in a sustainable manner before the formal knowledge perspectives started to dominate through various state forestry programmes in which decision making is dominated by expert perspectives in a given political context. The study also attempts to identify the problems of complementary relationships between local and expert knowledge and the resulting management implications. Copyright (C) 2004 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

AB Extensive lignite mining in the Indian (Thar) Desert commenced within the past decade. Accompanying extraction of this valuable resource there have been visible, important environmental impacts. The resultant land degradation has prompted concern from both public and regulatory bodies. This research assesses the success of rehabilitation plans implemented to revegetate a lignite mine-disturbed area, near the village of Giral in western Rajasthan State. Rehabilitation success was achieved within the environmental constraints of this northwest Indian hot-desert ecosystem using a combination of: (1) backfilling (abandoned pits) with minespoil and of covering the backfilled-surfaces with fresh topsoil to a thickness of about 0-30 m; (2) use of micro-catchment rainwater harvesting (MCWH) technique; (3) soil profile modification approaches; (4) plant establishment methodologies; and (5) the selection of appropriate germplasm material (trees, shrubs and grasses). Preliminary results indicate that the resulting vegetative cover will be capable of self-perpetuation under natural conditions while at the same time meeting the land-use requirements of the local people. The minespoil is alkaline in nature and has high electrical conductance. The average content of organic carbon, N, P and K is lower than in the regional topsoil. However, the concentration of Ca, Mg, Na and total S in the minespoil is much higher than in the topsoil. Further, the spoil material has no biological activity. Enhanced plant growth was achieved in MCWH plots, compared to control plots, where minespoil moisture storage was improved by 18-43 per cent. The rehabilitation protocol used at the site appears to have been successful because, in addition to the planted species, desirable native invasive species have become established. This study developed methods for the rehabilitation of lignite mine-disturbed areas and has also resulted in an understanding of rehabilitation processes in and regions with an emphasis on the long-term monitoring of rehabilitation success.

TI Measuring for sustainability: A multidimensional measurement framework
   for library and information services
SO LIBRI
LA English
DT Article
ID MANAGEMENT
AB Knowledge economy literature indicates that proof of an organization's sustainable future and growth lies in multi-dimensional evaluation rather than in the traditional one-dimensional monetary or financial capital perspective. This article attempts to provide a multi-dimensional framework within which a library and information service (L&IS) could measure its performance. As prerequisite, for implementation of the stated framework, the L&IS management (and staff) needed to understand that:
   measuring should be done for local development and progress using the L&IS's mission and a strategy for a sustainable future as the focal areas;
   sustainability requires more than providing proof of spending the stakeholder's money wisely; and
   adding value for the customer in isolation also does not ensure sustainability.
   In order to be sustainable in the knowledge economy it is necessary to understand that the relationships between the human, structure, customer and stakeholder capitals are vital. The L&IS sector would therefore, in the first instance, be required to ensure that customers could trust that they are receiving the services and products that maximise their own productivity and asset utilization. Secondly L&IS stakeholders would need to be assured that they are receiving the best value for their investment. Lastly, but perhaps most importantly, L&IS staff would have to be assured that they have the necessary skills and resources to provide for a motivating environment and that the infrastructure created will ensure continuous improvement for all.

ID INTERNATIONAL EXPERIENCES; LESSONS DRAWN
AB 'Institution' is a concept with many definitions and interpretations. Yet it is a key concept in the fisheries management discourse, as it is through institutions that management systems work. Hence the efficacy of fisheries management is largely a question of institutional design and dynamics. In this paper, I argue that we need to clarify what we mean by institutions, what functions they have, and how they develop over time. How we perceive institutions determines what we can and must do in order to make management systems operate more effectively, as our perspectives define the range of options for intervention in the management process. Drawing on classical and modern social science literature, I claim that we need a broader concept of institutions than is currently in fashion among fisheries social scientists inspired by rational choice. We need a concept that includes the social and cultural underpinnings of management systems and one that captures the social processes and governance mechanisms that are essential to fisheries management in the broadest sense. If not, our visions of the challenges that fisheries management represents, and what needs to be done in order to make fisheries more sustainable, become too restricted to make any long-term impact.

AB Although negotiating over prices with sellers is common in many markets such as automobiles, furniture, services, consumer electronics, etc., it is not clear how a haggling price policy can help a firm gain a strategic advantage or whether it is even sustainable in a competitive market. In this paper, we explore the implications of haggling and fixed prices as pricing policies in a competitive market. We develop a model in which two competing retailers choose between offering either a fixed price or haggling over prices with customers. There are two consumer segments in our analysis. One segment, the hagglers, has a lower opportunity cost of time and a lower haggling cost than the other segment, the nonhagglers. When both retailers follow the same pricing policy, then a haggling policy is more profitable than a fixed-price policy only when the proportion of nonhagglers is sufficiently high. We find two kinds of prisoners' dilemma: under some conditions, a more profitable haggling policy can be broken by a fixed-price policy, and under other conditions, a fixed-price policy can be broken by a haggling policy. Surprisingly; we show that under some conditions, an asymmetric outcome with one retailer haggling and the other offering a fixed price is also an equilibrium.

AB Many companies keep their suppliers and partners at arm's length, zealously guarding internal knowledge. Toyota Motor Corp., however, embraces its suppliers and encourages knowledge sharing through established networks. Toyota has developed interorganizational processes that facilitate the transfer of both explicit and tacit knowledge. The three key processes revolve around supplier associations (for general sharing of information), consulting groups (for workshops, seminars and on-site assistance from Toyota) and learning teams (for on-site sharing of know-how within small groups).
   With Toyota's help, suppliers have fine-tuned their operations until, compared with their work for Toyotas rivals, they have 14% higher output per worker, 25% lower inventories and 50% fewer defects. Quality improvement, enable Toyota to charge price premiums tier its products.
   Toyota's experience suggests that competitive advantages can be created and sustained through superior knowledge-sharing processes within a supplier network. The authors believe those principles have applicability in other types of alliances, too, including joint ventures. In fact, they contend that establishing effective interorganizational knowledge-sharing processes with suppliers and partner. can be crucial for any company. The author, claim that knowledge sharing with suppliers is the reason for Toyotas dynamic learning capability and might be the company's one truly sustainable competitive advantage.

AB The azooxanthellate scleractinian coral Lophelia pertusa has a near-cosmopolitan distribution, with a main depth distribution between 200 and 1000 m. In the northeast Atlantic it is the main framework-building species, forming deep-sea reefs in the bathyal zone on the continental margin, offshore banks and in Scandinavian fjords. Recent studies have shown that deep-sea reefs are associated with a highly diverse fauna. Such deep-sea communities are subject to increasing impact from deep-water fisheries, against a background of poor knowledge concerning these ecosystems, including the biology and population structure of L. pertusa. To resolve the population structure and to assess the dispersal potential of this deep-sea coral, specific microsatellites markers and ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequences ITS1 and ITS2 were used to investigate 10 different sampling sites, distributed along the European margin and in Scandinavian fjords. Both microsatellite and gene sequence data showed that L. pertusa should not be considered as one panmictic population in the northeast Atlantic but instead forms distinct, offshore and fjord populations. Results also suggest that, if some gene flow is occurring along the continental slope, the recruitment of sexually produced larvae is likely to be strongly local. The microsatellites showed significant levels of inbreeding and revealed that the level of genetic diversity and the contribution of asexual reproduction to the maintenance of the subpopulations were highly variable from site to site. These results are of major importance in the generation of a sustainable management strategy for these diversity-rich deep-sea ecosystems.

AB Sustainable forest restoration and management practices require a thorough understanding of the influence that habitat fragmentation has on the processes shaping genetic variation and its distribution in tree populations. We quantified genetic variation at isozyme markers and chloroplast DNA (cpDNA), analysed by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) in severely fragmented populations of Sorbus aucuparia (Rosaceae) in a single catchment (Moffat) in southern Scotland. Remnants maintain surprisingly high levels of gene diversity (H-E) for isozymes (H-E = 0.195) and cpDNA markers (H-E = 0.490). Estimates are very similar to those from non-fragmented populations in continental Europe, even though the latter were sampled over a much larger spatial scale. Overall, no genetic bottleneck or departures from random mating were detected in the Moffat fragments. However, genetic differentiation among remnants was detected for both types of marker (isozymes Theta(n) = 0.043, cpDNA Theta(c) = 0.131; G-test, P-value < 0.001). In this self-incompatible, insect-pollinated, bird-dispersed tree species, the estimated ratio of pollen flow to seed flow between fragments is close to 1 (r = 1.36). Reduced pollen-mediated gene flow is a likely consequence of habitat fragmentation, but effective seed dispersal by birds is probably helping to maintain high levels of genetic diversity within remnants and reduce genetic differentiation between them.

AB Performance of tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Scherb. cv. 'Ludion') receiving different doses of nitrogen, and lucerne (Medicago sativa L. cv. 'Kayseri') mixtures with tall fescue without nitrogen were compared in Erzurum, Turkey, for 5 years. Hay yield, crude protein content, and nitrogen harvest in mixtures of 1:1, 2:1, and 1:2 tall fescue:lucerne were compared with those in pure tall fescue stands received 0, 50, 100, and 150 kg N ha(-1). The mixtures did not receive N fertiliser apart from 40 kg N ha(-1) in the establishment year. Over the 4 harvest years, the highest hay yields were obtained from two of the three mixtures (1 lucerne:1 tall fescue and 2 lucerne:1 tall fescue, 13.8 and 12.9 Mg ha(-1), respectively). The hay obtained from mixtures had higher crude protein content than that of pure tall fescue heavily fertilised with N. The total nitrogen harvest increased with increasing N applications in pure tall fescue stands, however mixtures showed superior N yield. Alternative sowing of lucerne and tall fescue (1:1) had better and sustainable hay production, crude protein content, and total nitrogen harvest than the other sowing methods. Hence, alternative sowing of lucerne and tall fescue with 30 cm row spacing is recommended for high and sustainable quality hay production in the absence of N fertilisation.

DE high-conversion boiling water reactor; void coefficient; sustainability
AB The high-conversion boiling water reactor (HCBWR) has been studied as one of the next-generation BWRs. The HCBWR can be improved by the use of island-type fuel, which has mixed-oxide rods in the bundle interior and uranium rods only in the small region of the periphery, to have inherently negative void coefficient (i.e., negative void coefficient in infinite lattice configuration). The proposed reactor concept also has the sustainability to extend the light water reactor's period by similar to180 yr and the compatibility with a conventional BWR system such that only substitution of fuel bundles and control rods is required. As an example case, the high-conversion advanced boiling water reactor II (ABWR-II) is evaluated.

AB The U.S. Department of Energy initiative Generation IV aim is to produce an entire nuclear energy production system with next-generation features for certification before 2030. A Generation IV-capable system must have superior sustainability, safety and reliability, and economic cost advantages in comparison with third generation light water reactors (LWRs). A gas core reactor (GCR) with magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) power converter and cascading power cycle forms the basis for a Generation IV concept that is expected to set the upper performance limits in sustainability and power conversion efficiency among all existing and proposed fission powered systems. A gaseous core reactor delivering thousands of megawatt fission power acts as the heat source for a high-temperature MHD power converter. A uranium tetrafluoride fuel mix, with similar to95% mol fraction helium gas, provides a stable working fluid for the primary MHD Brayton cycle. The hot working fluid exiting a topping cycle MHD generator has sufficient heat to drive a conventional helium Brayton cycle with 35% thermal efficiency as well as a superheated steam Rankine cycle, with up to 40% efficiency, which recovers the waste heat from the intermediate Brayton cycle. A combined cycle efficiency of close to 70% can be achieved with only a modest MHD topping cycle efficiency. The high-temperature direct-energy conversion capability of an MHD dynamo combined with an already sophisticated steam-powered turbine industry knowledge base allows the cascading cycle design to achieve breakthrough first-law energy efficiencies previously unheard of in the nuclear power industry. Although simple in concept, the gas core reactor design has not achieved the state of technological maturity that established high-temperature gas-cooled reactors and high-temperature molten salt core reactors have pioneered. However, the GCR-MHD concept has considerable promise; for example, like molten salt reactors the fuel is continuously cycled, allowing high burnup, continuous burning of actinides, and hence greatly improved fuel utilization. The fuel inventory is two orders of magnitude lower than LWRs of comparable power output, and fissile plutonium production is likewise lower than in spent LWR fuel. Besides these features, specific GCR-MHD design challenges such as fission enhanced gas conductivity of the MHD partially ionized gas, GCR safety issues and related engineering problems are discussed.

AB Previous work has shown considerably enhanced soil fertility in agroecosystems managed by organic farming as compared to conventional farming. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) play a crucial role in nutrient acquisition and soil fertility. The objective of this study was to investigate the diversity of AMF in the context of a long-term study in which replicated field plots, at a single site in Central Europe, had been cultivated for 22 years according to two "organic" and two "conventional" farming systems. In the 23rd year, the field plots, carrying an 18-month-old grass-clover stand, were examined in two ways with respect to AMF diversity. Firstly, AMF spores were isolated and morphologically identified from soil samples. The study revealed that the AMF spore abundance and species diversity was significantly higher in the organic than in the conventional systems. Furthermore, the AMF community differed in the conventional and organic systems: Glomus species were similarly abundant in all systems but spores of Acaulospora and Scutellospora species were more abundant in the organic systems. Secondly, the soils were used to establish AMF-trap cultures using a consortium of Plantago lanceolata, Trifolium pratense and Lolium perenne as host plants. The AMF spore community developing in the trap cultures differed: after 12 months, two species of the Acaulosporaceae (A. paulinae and A. longula) were consistently found to account for a large part of the spore community in the trap cultures from the organic systems but were found rarely in the ones from the conventional systems. The findings show that some AMF species present in natural ecosystems are maintained under organic farming but severely depressed under conventional farming, indicating a potentially severe loss of ecosystem function under conventional farming.

AB This article investigates sustainable development from the perspective of indigenous communities, based on empirical studies of the Bakun Dam project in Malaysia. It analyzes the socio-economic and ecological implications of the links between Bakun's growth vision and the socio-cultural sustainability of the indigenous communities in Sarawak. It emphasizes that promoting sustainable development should mean protecting the source of the indigenous communities' social fabrics and cultural identity-in this case, the Bakun forest ecosystem.

AB Background and Purpose: Seasonal accumulation of carbon rich organic matter is thought to be a source of mucilaginous aggregates in the northern Adriatic in conditions of marked phosphorus limitation. To assess a possible role of P-limitation in the production of precursors of mucilage aggregates, a mesocosm experiment was designed with different P enrichments. In this paper, a study of the production and fate of organic C during the experiment is presented.
   Materials and Methods: Primary production (PP) was measured using the C-14-method. Chlorophyll a was determined fluorometrically after acetone extraction. DOC was determined using a high-temperature catalytic oxidation method on a TOC analyser. POC was determined by a CHNS analyser.
   Results: Substantially different processes were observed in the two enriched mesocosms regarding primary production. A sustainable orthophosphate concentration in the "P-deficient" mesocosm, maintained through enzymatic regeneration by induction of alkaline phosphatase, was sufficient to almost equalize the primary production efficiency in both enriched mesocosms. In contrast, in the "nutrient balanced" mesocosm no alkaline phosphatase induction to Maintain an appropriate primary production rate were involved.
   Conclusions: Differences between the "P-deficient" and "nutrient balanced" enriched mesocosm indicated that during bloom events in the northern Adriatic C-rich organic matter can be produced and act as a sustainable source for mucilage production, due to selective enzymatic phosphorus regeneration (APA-mediated).

AB The contribution focuses on the process of merging the East German system of higher education with that of West Germany in the context of German unification in 1990/91. The impact of German unification on East German higher education is described as consisting of five basic measures: (a) de-politicisation; (b) reorganisation and evaluation of extra-university research; (c) establishment of universities of applied sciences; (d) restructuring of disciplines; (e) renewal of academic staff. While arguing that higher education reforms in West Germany were necessary as well but could not be carried out parallel to higher education renewal and restructuring in East Germany, the author describes and analyses how the reform process in East Germany became a challenge and stimulus for reform and change of the West German system of higher education. Its impacts which could be turned into sustainable structural advantages are identified in three areas: (a) quality of teaching; (b) regional development and transfer of knowledge; (c) innovative approaches to research and new degree programmes. The contribution concludes by pointing out that the issue of merging two quite different systems of higher education into one, i.e. a transformation in its own kind, should be discussed as a strategic issue in which the right balance of cooperation and competition can lead to competitive advantages on a global scale.

AB The objective of this paper was to evaluate the performance of tambaqui (Colossoma macropomum) in a polyculture trial with jaraqui (Semaprochilodus insignis), using agricultural and forest products as supplementary feeding for tambaqui. Two ponds, measuring 644 m(2) (Pond A, associated with pigs) and 1,075 m(2) (Pond B, non associated), were stocked with 0.5 tambaqui/m(2) and 0.1 jaraqui/m(2). After 371 days, tambaqui showed a mean growth from 18.6 +/- 4.5 g to 997.1 +/- 195.08 g in Pond A, and from 81.4 +/- 18.8 g to 519.9 +/- 191.7 g in Pond B. Feeding management of Pond A may be a sustainable alternative of tambaqui production in substitution to commercial rations.

AB Rhizosphere processes of individual plants have been widely investigated since 1904 when the term "rhizosphere" was first put forward. However, little attention has been paid to rhizosphere effects at an agro-ecosystem level. This paper presents recent research on the rhizosphere processes in relation to plant nutrition in main cropping systems in China. In the peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.)/maize (Zea mays L.) intercropping system, maize was found to improve the Fe nutrition of peanut through influencing its rhizosphere processes, suggesting an important role of phytosiderophores released from Fe-deficient maize. Intercropping between maize and faba bean (Vicia faba L.) was found to improve nitrogen and phosphorus uptake in the two crops compared with corresponding sole crop. There was a higher land equivalent ratio (LER) in the intercropping system of maize and faba bean than the treatment of no root interactions between the two crops. The increased yield of maize intercropped with faba bean resulted from an interspecific facilitation in nutrient uptake, depending on interspecific root interactions of the two crops. In the rotation system of rice (Oryza sativa L.)-wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) crops, Mn deficiency in wheat was caused by excessive Mn uptake by rice and Mn leaching from topsoil to subsoil due to periodic cycles of flooding and drying. However, wheat genotypes tolerant to Mn deficiency tended to distribute more roots to deeper soil layer and thus expand their rhizosphere zones in the Mn-deficient soils and utilize Mn from the subsoil. Deep ploughing also helped root penetration into subsoil and was propitious to correcting Mn deficiency in wheat rotated with rice. In comparison, oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.) took up more Mn than wheat through mobilizing sparingly soluble soil Mn due to acidification and reduction processes in the rhizosphere. Thus, oilseed rape was tolerant to the Mn-deficient conditions in the rice-oilseed rape rotation. Oxidation reactions on root surface of rice also resulted in the formation of Fe plaque in the rice rhizosphere. Large amounts of Zn were accumulated on the Fe plaque. Zinc uptake by rice plants increased as Fe plaque formed, but decreased at high amounts of Fe plaque. It is suggested that to fine-tune cropping patterns and optimize nutrient management based on a better understanding of rhizosphere processes at an agro-ecosystem level is crucial for increasing nutrient use efficiency and developing sustainable agriculture in China.

AB We measured nitrate (NO(3)(-)) leaching, ammonia (NH(3)), and nitrous oxide (N(2)O) emissions, denitrification, crop offtake of N, and wet N deposition on two fields at each of two sites for five seasons. The soils were loamy sand and silty clay loam. The objective was to quantify all the major N fluxes over 2 arable rotations on contrasting soil types and to assess the impact of these balances on soil N.
   The greatest N input was fertiliser-N, which was between 89 and 96% of the total, except when linseed was grown to which no fertiliser-N was applied. Wet N deposition was 7-15 kg ha(-1) which contributed ca. 5% to total N inputs.
   Outputs of N were mainly as crop offtake and NO(3)(-) leaching. Crop N offtakes were 54 to 98% of total N outputs, ranging from 45 kg ha(-1) for linseed to 245 kg ha(-1) for winter wheat. N offtake was usually least (< 100 kg ha(-1)) for crops where residues remained in the field (e.g., winter rye and sugarbeet). The greatest offtakes of N (> 200 kg ha(-1)) were usually by winter wheat crops when straw was removed. At both sites average leaching followed the expected pattern of sugarbeet < cereals < potatoes. Total annual losses of N(2)O never exceeded 2 kg ha(-1) N, between 0.2 and 2.8% of fertiliser-N applications. Estimated losses of N(2) gas tended to be greater, especially on the heavier soil, up to ca. 7 kg ha(-1) in 1998/99. Fluxes of NH(3) were usually small (13 kg ha(-1) N), and nearly half of the measured fluxes were net deposition. Net N inputs of NH(3) exceeded outputs in only one of the four fields monitored.
   Thus, the greatest potential reduction in N losses from arable fields not given organic manures is to minimise NO(3)(-) leaching. This would have the additional benefit of reducing subsequent indirect emissions of N(2)O which at 2.5% of leached N, would be as great as direct soil emissions of N(2)O. However, it may be difficult to make significant reductions in leaching from rotations such as these, receiving only mineral fertiliser-N. Most crops in this study received no more fertiliser-N than was currently recommended at the time for optimum yield, and so reductions in N input would potentially have led to loss of income. Moreover, inputs and outputs of N were, at best, in balance and in one of the four fields monitored N outputs exceeded N inputs, which is likely to lead to a depletion of soil N. Any further decrease in soil N might have repercussions for the sustainable use of soil.

AB The Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 (GPRA) directs agencies to determine their objectives based on what stakeholders value. Identifying, measuring and analyzing values and objectives is a key challenge for public land management agencies. Using R and Q factor analysis we assess the values and objectives within the Leadership Team ( LT) of the United States Forest Service (USFS). R-factor analysis demonstrates strong support among the LT for a more preservation-oriented view to manage public lands. Q-factor analysis reveals divergent perspectives among the LT and how the aggregated preservation orientation found with the R-factor analysis plays out according to individual perspectives. The findings illustrate the challenges inherent in identifying what values and objectives exist, how they should be analyzed, and the implications for choosing one set of values and objectives over another in public lands management to fulfill the mandates under GPRA.

AB The world food supply has become inadequate for more than half the world population, as evidenced by a recent report of the World Health Organization that indicated that more than 3 billion people are malnourished. This is the largest number of malnourished ever reported. Per capita food production, especially cereal grains, has been declining for nearly 2 decades, despite new biotechnology and other agricultural technologies. Rapid human population growth, compounded by diminishing availability of fertile cropland, freshwater, and fossil fuels, is intensifying the emerging problems in all food production systems. Numerous ethical issues are related to the problem of malnutrition, including global corporatization.

ID PROGRAMS; IMPLEMENTATION; SCIENCE; INTERVENTIONS; CHILDREN
AB During the next decade we will see broad dissemination of a growing number of empirically validated school-based prevention programs. The processes of effectiveness research, broad program diffusion, and program integration at the school and community level will become a central focus of research activity. The paper presents six future directions for research in the field of school-based prevention and health promotion. The directions include developing new programs and models, developing standards and accountability systems related to school success, moving from efficacy to effectiveness research, understanding factors influencing program integration, broad dissemination of programs and policies, and the sustainability of programs, policies, and community partnerships. These future directions are driven by three significant research-to-service challenges faced both by practitioners and researchers that involve systems integration across developmental stages, levels of care, and institutional structures.

AB Prevention research is at a stage where evidence-based programs and strategies have been identified, and the next question is how to diffuse them. However, the context in which evidence-based programs were first tested and found to be effective may have changed, raising the question of whether the current burden of proof of effectiveness of these programs should be examined before, or at least in conjunction with, diffusion research. This paper discusses, first, contextual changes in testing the effectiveness of prevention programs that have been hitherto identified as evidence-based, and then suggests designs for the next generation of effectiveness trials. Following this, gaps in current diffusion research are discussed according to the four stages of diffusion: adoption, implementation, dissemination, and sustainability, with the major focus on implementation. Designs that may address these gaps in future research are considered, with particular application to prevention research in schools.

AB The new frontier for prevention research involves building a scientific knowledge base on how to disseminate and implement effective prevention programs with fidelity. Toward this end, a brief overview of findings from the Blueprints for Violence Prevention-Replication Initiative is presented, identifying factors that enhance or impede a successful implementation of these programs. Findings are organized around five implementation tasks: site selection, training, technical assistance, fidelity, and sustainability. Overall, careful attention to each of these tasks, together with an independent monitoring of fidelity, produced a successful implementation with high fidelity and sustainability. A discussion of how these findings inform the present local adaptation-fidelity debate follows.

AB Homogeneous organometallic catalysts have a great potential for the development of sustainable synthetic processes. There is, however, an urgent need for the development of new techniques to separate products and catalysts efficiently, allowing for recycling and reuse of the precious catalyst. The unique solvent properties of supercritical carbon dioxide offer new approaches for the immobilization of organometallic catalysts, many of which are suitable for efficient continuous-flow operation. Recent research in this field tries to combine the molecular nature of organometallic catalysts with the reaction-engineering aspect of multiphase catalysis.

DE Guanabara Bay basin; Sustainability evaluation; DPSIR framework;
   Cost-benefit analysis (CBA); Correction of conventional accounts (GDP)
AB The Guanabara Bay basin, SE Brazil, is shown as an experimental site to evaluate development and sustainability in coastal areas. We developed a Driver-Pressure-State-Impact-Response (DPSIR) framework in a practical context to integrate natural and socio-economic indicators. Sustainability reflects public policies towards the utilization of natural resources. Cost-benefit analysis (CBA) included in DPSIR evaluates losses and benefits resulting from such policies. CBA has some limitations due to the difficulty of valuating environmental goods and services. Instead of valuating them we propose to combine sustainability indicators and defensive expenditures for the implementation of public policies. This approach agrees with the environmental conservation paradigm implicit in sustainable development. It allows an estimation of the physical natural capital depreciation (PNCD), by using it to correct the gross domestic product (GDP) of the study area, and demonstrating the present non-sustainable characteristics of the current policies applied to the area.

AB While long life society constitutes progress in terms of healthier, better and longer lives, it is also associated with higher pension and health expenditures to an extent that threatens the long term adequacy and sustainability of existing welfare systems. It therefore requires adaptation on the part of society and of social institutions and policies, in particular the labour market and the welfare systems, in order to stem or even reduce the growing dependency ratios of the population. In this context, the gender dimension is crucial for any policies that aim at improving the effectiveness of labour markets and social and economic inclusion. This article thus starts by signalling the six main changes that have occurred in the European Union and US labour markets and the workforce, which concern in particular women in all age groups. It then highlights the main responses of the welfare systems to these changes, emphasizing activation measures and indicating their successes and shortcomings-as illustrated by the Danish and UK experience. The article concludes by suggesting policies that may enhance female activity and employment rates, from both the labour supply and demand perspectives.

AB Crop production in the Northern Great Plains is rapidly changing because of no-till practices; producers now grow a diversity of crops with winter wheat to increase production as well as to manage weeds. With the multitude of crops available, producers are asking for guidelines to sequence crops in rotations that help weed management. We developed a planning tool that lists various choices with crops when designing a rotation; the choices are arranged by impact on weed dynamics as quantified by research in the region. The tool includes choices among crops, such as varying crops with different life cycles, planting dates, or row spacing, and choices within an individual crop, such as varying cultivar or planting date. Choices among crops impact weeds the most, whereas choices within an individual crop are less effective and usually lead to lower crop yield. For example, rotations comprised of two cool-season crops followed by two warm-season crops can reduce weed populations six- to 12-fold. In contrast, replacing a standard-height cultivar with a taller cultivar that is more competitive with weeds, is often inconsistent for weed management, whereas crop yield may be less. Producers associated with the Northern Plains Sustainable Agricultural Society felt that the planning tool would encourage long-range planning as well as help integrate weed management with the design of cropping systems. The purpose of the tool is to encourage ecologically based weed management, which can reduce herbicide inputs by 50% for Northern Great Plains producers.

AB Sustainability has recently become an ingrained concept in crop production systems worldwide, and is the cornerstone of research programs of the global network of research centers operated by the Consultative Group of International Agricultural Research (CGIAR), which functions in collaboration with the various national agricultural research systems. One of the major CGIAR centers, the International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas (ICARDA), focuses mainly on dryland agriculture, but increasingly on irrigation, in its mandate area of West and Central Asia and North Africa. ICARDA has collaboration programs with its host country, Syria, the cradle of civilization and of settled agriculture, and the center of origin of many of the world's major crops, notably cereals and pulses. Wheat is, and has been, the most important commodity food in Syria. The Center's goal is to enhance wheat productivity in a sustainable manner for the benefit of the country's resource-poor farmers and society as a whole. Wheat is grown on about 1.5 million ha or 27% of the total cultivated land in Syria, mainly under rainfed conditions (300-500 mm annual rainfall), which are increasingly experiencing supplemental irrigation, while drier (<200 mm) areas are fully irrigated. Improved cultivars generally combine high yield potential and stress tolerance and tend to have high yield stability, being input-efficient under limited resources in stress environments and input responsive under favorable environments. Such varieties are tested under farmers' conditions through multi-year multi-locations. Other aspects of the ICARDA-Syrian collaboration wheat program include improved tillage, with an emphasis on conservation systems, adequate fertilization, and improved agronomic practices, e.g., early sowing in relation to rainfall conditions, optimum row spacing and plant population, and adequate weed control. This vigorous collaborative research-technology transfer program has produced a major shift in wheat production in Syria, from traditional low-input practices with landrace or improved cultivars to widespread adoption (two-thirds of wheat area) of modern cultivars along with improved production technology. As a result of such efforts, national income has substantially increased, and Syria has become a net exporter of wheat. Thus, the collaborative efforts of an international research center and its host country have shown clearly that there is an alternative to a traditional, low-output agriculture and its associated ills.

TI The ability of organic farming to nourish the Austrian people: an
   empirical study in the region Mostviertel-Eisenwurzen (A)
SO RENEWABLE AGRICULTURE AND FOOD SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article
DE organic farming; food security; food balance
AB A sustainable agricultural and food system is characterized by two qualities: availability of high-quality, healthy food along with the best possible preservation of natural resources. Organic farming is discussed as a solution model for the complementary achievement of both aims. Taking the region Mostviertel-Eisenwurzen (A) as a case study, the present investigation examines the regional self-reliance in food production by means of three scenarios. In the basic scenario, the current land use of the region is set against the present-day food demand of the local population. The organic scenario assumes that the farming method of the region adheres 100% to the guidelines of organic farming. The food produced is set against the current food demand, as in the basic scenario. In the third scenario-the organic-alternative scenario-the 100% organically produced food is set against a food demand of the local population that follows the recommendations of nutritional science, comprising more plant-based diets. The results show that in the case of the hypothetical conversion to organic farming, food production decreases in absolute numbers. Despite this reduction, the local population can be sufficiently supplied with food energy, both in the case of the average Austrian diet as well as in a diet according to the recommendations of nutritional science. The number of people that can be supplied outside the region is higher in the nutritional science diet than in the average Austrian diet, despite the lower total net export quantity. While egg, meat and milk production are up to six times the local demand, the degree of self-supply of plant products (especially fruit and vegetables) covers only two-thirds of the demand after conversion. Moreover, our calculations show how a change of consumption patterns affects the demand for imported feedstuff. The region changes from being a net importer of concentrate (76,190 t fresh mass) at the starting point to a gross exporter (39,784 t fresh mass) in the organic and the organic-alternative scenario. In summary, agricultural production according to the guidelines of organic farming and a diet following the recommendations of nutritional science seems a promising strategy for achieving a sustainable agricultural and food system.

AB The indigenous system of crop production in Nigeria, the bush fallow farming system, which is known for its stability and biological efficiency, can no longer be operated effectively, due to a shortage of land. In order to increase farm productivity, researchers have devised alley farming, a low-input farming system which sustains crop and livestock production, can reduce competition from weeds, and conserves soil by reducing soil physico-chemical degradation and the decline of soil organic matter. The mobilization of women to adopt agricultural innovations is an important topic in development studies. Due to the important role of Nigerian women farmers in crop and livestock production, they are encouraged to adopt alley farming. Contrary to some of the literature, which claims that women are slow innovation adopters, this study argues that women farmers easily adopt innovations that can enhance their economic status. The paper argues that the characteristics of alley farming influence women farmers' adoption or rejection of the farming system. It was observed that the land tenure system is not an inflexible constraint on alley farming adoption. It is argued that low participation of women in agricultural innovation adoption is caused by lack of information about the advantages of the innovations, because meetings are fixed at times when women are not able to attend. This paper points out that the adoption of alley farming has increased the agricultural production and the quality of life of women farmer adopters.

DT Article
AB This paper presents quantitative results on the economics of different levels of thermal insulation for a building envelope. Results are calculated on the basis of an example building in Germany, which is a recently built single family house with materials commonly used in light-weight constructions. Defining the cost efficiency of an energy efficient building allows one to identify solutions which are already economically viable as well as to determine specific costs of the investment in an advanced sustainable building.

AB Plants that have evolved to survive on metal-rich soils-metallophytes-have key values that must drive research of their unique properties and ultimately their conservation. The ability of metallophytes to tolerate extreme metal concentrations commends them for revegetation of mines and metal-contaminated sites. Metallophytes can also be exploited in environmental technologies, for example, phytostabilization, phytoremediation, and phytomining. Actions towards conserving metallophyte species are imperative, as metallophytes are increasingly under threat of extinction from mining activity. Although many hundreds of papers describe both the biology and applications of metallophytes, few have investigated the urgent need to conserve these unique species. This paper identifies the current state of metallophyte research, and advocates future research needs for the conservation of metallophyte biodiversity and the sustainable uses of metallophyte species in restoration, rehabilitation, contaminated site remediation, and other nascent phytotechnologies. Six fundamental questions are addressed: (1) Is enough known about the global status of metallophytes to ensure their conservation? (2) Are metallophytes threatened by the activities of the minerals industry, and can their potential for the restoration or rehabilitation of mined and disturbed land be realized? (3) What problems exist in gaining prior informed consent to access metallophyte genetic resources and how can the benefits arising from their uses be equitably shared? (4) What potential do metallophytes offer as a resource base for phytotechnologies? (5) Can genetic modification be used to "design" metallophytes to use in the remediation of contaminated land? (6) Does the prospect of using metallophytes in site remediation and restoration raise ethical issues?

   development; seaweed cultivation
ID NUTRIENTS
AB China has a long history of aquaculture. Since the 1980s, mariculture has been considered by the government as an increasingly important sub-sector of aquaculture. Mariculture provides nutritional and economic benefits, and decreases the intensity of exploitation on declining wild living resources. China now has the highest mariculture production in the world. Kelp made up 50 - 60% the total Chinese mariculture production in 1967 - 1980. Production of Laminaria japonica Aresch, the leading species, reached 252, 907 t ( dry wet) in 1980. The percentage of kelp production decreased after 1981 because of proportionally greater production of molluscs, shrimps and finfish. Marinefinfish and mollusc production increased sharply after 1990. In 2001, the total mariculture production reached 11,315,000 t from a production area of 1,286,000 ha. The rapid development and changes in mariculture species have aroused increasing concern about mariculture's impact on the coastal environment. The impact of coastal aquaculture, such as water quality deterioration and contaminants, will have a significant bearing on the expansion of mariculture. The key of improving and maintaining the long-term health of mariculture zones lies in adopting sustainable culture systems. It is imperative that the density of stocking fish and other economically important organisms such as oysters, and scallops, be controlled, in addition to restricting the total number of net-cages in the mariculture zones. The authors suggest moving rafts ( cages) periodically and to development of a fallow system in which area fish culture will be suspended for 1 - 2 years to facilitate recovery of the polluted sediment. Moving fish culture offshore into deeper waters is also suggested. The authors also believe that large-scale seaweed cultivation will reduce eutrophication in coastal culture zones in China.

AB Grass species, which are frequently used for rehabilitation of degraded areas, can establish root associations with nitrogen fixing bacteria thus contributing to the ecosystem's sustainability. On the other hand, microbial diversity plays an important role in the resilience of biological processes, including N-2 fixation. This study aimed at the phenotypic characterization of 72 diazotrophic Gram-negative bacteria. Samples were isolated from areas under different rehabilitation strategies after bauxite mining in Pocos de Caldas, Minas Gerais, Brazil, and inoculated in NFb, Fam, and JNFb media. Type and reference strains of Herbaspirillum, Azospirillum and Burkholderia species were used for comparison as they are able to grow in such media. The similarity dendrogram based on seven cultural characteristics of the isolates in GNA medium presented a great diversity, as 50 groups were formed with 81% similarity. NaCl tolerance in the potato/sucrose/acid malic medium varied from 0 to 50 g L-1 and allowed a separation of isolates and type strains into five groups. Cell diameters varied from 0.61 to 1.21 mum, and 13 isolates were not similar to the type strains. Fifteen groups with 75% similarity were formed based on total proteins patterns obtained by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Neither was there any relationship among groups based on the different characteristics, nor between these and the areas of bacteria isolation. Fam and JNFb media detected the target species as well as other unidentified ones. The high phenotypic dissimilarity among isolates and type strains, mainly regarding total protein eletrophoresis profiles suggests that new species could be present within these populations.

AB The understanding and quantification of the impact caused by soil use and management on the physical soil quality are fundamental for the development of sustainable agricultural systems. The objective of this research was to quantify sonic physical soil properties to evaluate the physical quality of a dystrophic Red Latosol (Rhodic Ferralsol) in the northwest of the State of Parana, Brazil. Undisturbed soil samples were collected from two contiguous areas on an Experimental Farm of the State University of Maringa. One area was cultivated with annual crops under conventional tillage (disk plow and harrowing) and the other under native forest (semidecidual seasonal forest). The evaluated physical soil attributes were soil porosity and bulk density, soil water retention curve, soil resistance curve, and the least limiting water range. Results indicated significantly higher values of bulk density and lower values of soil porosity in the cultivated area. The soil water retention curve was not influenced by the soil use system, but was negatively influenced by bulk density. The soil resistance curve was influenced by the soil use system, evidenced by high values of soil resistance to root penetration under increasing drought in the cultivated soil. The least limiting water range was significantly smaller in the cultivated soil owing to the soil resistance to root penetration and air-filled porosity, which determined the lower and upper limits of soil water availability with bulk density increase. In. the soil under native forest, the least limiting water range was equal to the water availability determined by the field capacity and the permanent wilting point. Soil compaction in the cultivated soil induced changes in the soil porous system, which were described by lower values of the least limiting water range than in virgin soil.

AB Sustainable development demands institutions manage the conflicts and struggles that inevitably arise over material and ideal interests. While current cooperative theory privileges the economic element, a political economy of cooperation emphasizes cooperatives' tentative bridging of economic and political spheres with a democratic ethos. The cooperatives' democratic political structure exists in tension with a capitalist economic structure and other sites of friction. These contradictions are: in the realm of social relations, between production and consumption; in the realm of spatial relations, between the local and the global; and in the realm of collective action, between cooperatives as both traditional as well as new social movements. Where neo-classical economic models seek to eliminate or reduce these tensions, political economy views these tensions as functional to sustainability by creating an "institutional friction" that facilitates innovation, flexibility and long-term adaptability. This political economy of cooperation is intended as a step toward the development of a multidimensional sociology of cooperation.

AB In this study we present the length frequency distributions of Boops boops, Mullus barbatus, Scomber, japonicus, Spicara smaris and Trachurus mediterraneus caught with different gears (trawls, purse-seines, beach-seines, gill nets, trammel nets and longlines) in Cyclades during 1995-2000. Trawls generally caught the smallest sizes for four out of the five species studied (i.e. B. boops, M. barbatus, S. smaris and T. mediterraneus) and purse-seines caught individuals with intermediate sizes between those caught with trawls and small-scale gears. For S. japonicus, gill nets caught smaller individuals than those caught with purse-seines and trammel nets. The same general pattern was also observed comparing the seasonal length frequencies of the three most abundant species (i.e. B. boops, T mediterraneus and S. smaris). Generally, trawls caught immature individuals when compared to small-scale gears and the vast majority of the individuals caught by all gears (with the exception of trammel nets for M. barbatus) was smaller than the optimum exploitation size, indicating that the gears examined are not appropriate for the sustainable exploitation of these resources.

AB Use of existing data sources has made the social indicators approach an attractive method for anticipating the social and economic effects of policy changes on resource-dependent communities. Despite its practicality, this approach is severely limited by data availability and reliance on aggregate figures that obscure variation between smaller areas. A forest-dependent community in Washington State was studied in an attempt to discern the effects of the Northwest Forest Plan on local-level social and economic conditions using data from secondary sources supplemented by targeted interviews. Findings from this pilot study strongly suggest that a social indicators approach cannot determine the causal factors behind social and economic change in rural communities. We propose a strategy for repeated surveys of communities and recommend an investment in longitudinal analysis of community businesses, households, and individuals in locales thought likely to be affected by changes in federal land management policies.

AB Identification of soil quality indicators (SQI) is important to sustainable management of natural resources. The objective of this project was to develop a technique for identifying SQIs for agricultural land use. Soil structure, water retention and transmission properties, and pH and electrical conductivity (EC) were measured and related to agronomic productivity for five land use and soil management treatments at the experimental farm of the North Appalachian Experimental Watersheds, Coshocton, Ohio. The five treatments were no-till corn without manure (NTWM), no-till corn with manure (NTM), no-till corn (Zea mays)-soybean (Glycine max) rotation (NTCSR), conventional tillage corn (CT), and meadow (M). Soil properties measured were bulk density (rho(b)), drainable porosity (f(a)), available water capacity (AWC), steady state infiltration rate (i(c)), saturated hydraulic conductivity (K-s), soil organic carbon (SOC) concentration, water stable aggregation (WSA), mean weight diameter of aggregates (MWD), and texture. The correlation analysis on the measured soil attributes reduced the number of key variables from 17 to 11. A rating index on a 1 to 5 scale was obtained for each of the key soil properties. The linear regression analysis was first performed with key soil attributes as independent variables and biomass or grain yields as dependent variables, with the rating factor later assigned to each measured key soil attribute. The multiple regression analysis showed that SOC and WSA explained more than 35% of variability in biomass and 33% in grain yields, respectively, and were identified as the major SQIs. Other important SQIs were rho(b), AWC, MWD, pH, and EC. The cumulative sustainability ratings (CR) for each land use showed that NTM was the most sustainable soil management treatment (CR = 20) and CT the least sustainable (CR = 30). The CR was also correlated significantly with grain yield (R-2 = 0.31, P < 0.002). The CR for different land uses suggests that soil management with NTM is the most sustainable and CT the least.

AB The characterization of the soil habitat is of fundamental importance to an understanding of processes associated with sustainable management such as environmental flows, bioavailability, and soil ecology. We describe a method for quantifying and explicitly modeling the heterogeneity of soil using a stochastic approach. The overall aim is to develop a model capable of simultaneously reproducing the spatial statistical properties of both the physical and biological components of soil architecture. A Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methodology is developed that uses a novel neighborhood and scanning scheme to model the two-dimensional spatial structure of soil, based on direct measurements made from soil thin sections. The model is considerably more efficient and faster to implement than previous approaches, and allows accurate modeling of larger structures than has previously been possible. This increased efficiency also makes it feasible to extend the approach to three dimensions and to simultaneously study the spatial distribution of a greater number of soil components. Examples of two-dimensional structures created by the models are presented and their statistical properties are shown not to differ significantly from those of the original visualizations.

AB The fate of fertilizer P in soil during crop production has to be determined to evaluate the long-term economic value and sustainability of fertilizer practices. We assessed changes in soil test P and soil P fractions with continuous P fertilization and soil P depletion under continuous corn (Zea mays L.) in a Ste. Rosalie clay soil (humic Gleysol; fine, mixed, frigid, Typic Humaquept). Soil samples were analyzed for Mehlich-3 P (M-3 P) and P fractions using a modified Hedley's procedure. Soil M-3 P values remained constant in spite of crop removal in soil not receiving fertilizer for 10 yr. Continuous P fertilization at rates from 44 to 132 P ha(-1) yr(-1) increased linearly soil M-3 P, with 6.3 kg P ha(-1) of net P addition required to increase M-3 P by 1 mg P kg(-1). Residual fertilizer P in soil resulted from the continuous P addition were found predominately in labile inorganic P (LPi) (NaHCO3-P-i) and moderately labile P-i (MLPi) (NaOH-P-i). Increased P rates favored soil P transformation from LPi to MLPi, indicating enhanced soil P retention. With P depletion, soil M-3 P declined in plots previously receiving 132 kg P ha(-1) yr(-1), with 4.2 kg P ha(-1) crop P removal decreasing soil M-3 P by 1 mg P kg(-1). Continuous crop removal of soil residual P (Res-P) resulted in decreases in soil LPi and increases in MLPi, an indication of increased retention of Res-P with time. However, moderately stable P-i (HCl-P-i) remained constant, both with continuous P addition and P depletion. Conversion of residual fertilizer P to less available P forms in soil was a slow process and thus the fate of the Res-P should be taken into consideration when developing soil nutrient management plans.

AB The effects of grazed, annual ryegrass pasture (annually tilled with a rotary cultivator) and permanent kikuyu pasture were compared with that of undisturbed native vegetation at four sites in the Tsitsikamma region, South Africa. Soil organic carbon content, aggregate stability, saturated hydraulic conductivity, air permeability, root length density and rooting depth were all less under ryegrass than kikuyu pasture. There was, however, no consistent effect of pasture-type on pore size distribution or penetrometer resistance. Differences in penetrometer resistance were most obvious in the 10-30 cm layer with subsurface compaction being evident at some sites under both types of pasture. This was attributed to the treading effects of grazing cattle plus formation of a compacted layer at the depth of tillage under ryegrass pastures. Subsoil tillage of a ryegrass pasture resulted in a substantial reduction in penetrometer resistance in the compacted 10-20 cm layer and increases in hydraulic conductivity, air permeability, root length density and rooting depth. We conclude that conversion from conventional to zero tillage is a potential way of improving the sustainability of annual pasture production and that the extent of subsoil compaction under both pasture types needs further investigation.

AB The industrialised world's plant biotechnology portfolio is based on a limited number of large commodity crops and input traits, and in general is unavailable and unaffordable, if not unsuitable, to the needs of sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) where per capita agricultural production has decreased since the 1960s. Governments and organisations involved in providing technological help must take into account the conditions under which small-scale - often subsistence - farmers of a particular region work. It is suggested that in order to be sustainable, biotechnology for SSA should in the first instance be tissue culture-, molecular marker- and biocontrol-based, as well as stongly orientated toward regional crop diversity. However, many of the constraints that retard development in SSA, for example, poverty, chronic malnutrition, urbanisation and HIV/Aids, will also initially affect the implementation and maintenance of viable biotechnology programmes. Increasingly, reports on the ills that have befallen developing countries identify a main cause as lack of political will on the part of these countries' leaders.

TI Sustainable production of root and tuber crops (potato, sweet potato,
   indigenous potato, cassava) in southern Africa
SO SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY
LA English
DT Article
ID CHEMICAL-COMPOSITION
AB Africa, including South Africa, is faced with a problem of increasing rural poverty that leads to increasing urbanisation, joblessness, crime, food insecurity and malnutrition. Root and tuber crops such as sweet potato and potato, as well as cassava and indigenous potato are important crops for food security. The latter are also important due to their tolerance to marginal conditions. Potato and sweet potato are of great economic value in South Africa, with well-organised marketing chains and, for potato, a large processing industry. There is one cassava starch extraction factory in operation in South Africa. A number of diseases are of importance in potato in South Africa: early blight, late blight, bacterial wilt, scab and virus. Insect pests such as tuber moth and leaf miner are also constraints. In sweet potato the occurrence of viruses and weevils, as well as the availability of healthy planting material are the most important limiting factors in production. African Cassava Mosaic Disease (CMD) caused by a virus, is a problem in growing cassava. Plant biotechnology applications offer a number of sustainable solutions. Basic applications such as in vitro genebanking where large numbers of accessions can be maintained in a small space, meristem cultures to produce virus-free plants and mass propagation of popular cultivars in order to make planting material available for sustainable production. More advanced biotechnology applications that may be of value are molecular marker technology and genetic engineering. The latter can play a role in overcoming virus and potato tuber moth in potato, in resistance to CMD in cassava and possibly in sweet potato to incorporate virus and weevil resistance.

TI Biotechnology for sustainable banana and plantain production in Africa:
   the South African contribution
SO SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY
LA English
DT Article
ID MYCOSPHAERELLA-FIJIENSIS; MICROSATELLITE MARKERS; MUSA SPP.; TOLERANCE;
   AAA; EXPRESSION; DISEASE
AB Sustainable production of banana, plantain and enset in Africa is crucial to secure food and provide income to millions of people. These crops, however, are severely threatened by diseases, pests and environmental constraints. Most bananas in Africa are produced by small-scale farmers who often do not have the financial resources for sustained production by means of the application of chemical fertilisers, fungicides and pesticides. Biotechnology can provide a means whereby plants can be improved for sustainable cultivation. Applications of biotechnology include tissue culture technology, development of molecular markers, and genetic transformation. Biotechnology, however, should not be used in isolation to solve the problems in banana and plantain production in Africa, but should be incorporated into integrated disease and pest management programmes. South Africa has the infrastructure and capacity to play an important role in the training of scientists, research on production constraints, and implementation of biotechnological advances for the rest of Africa.

AB Germplasm of traditional vegetable crops were screened for drought tolerance. Different physiological, morphological and biochemical traits of drought tolerance were investigated, including enzymes of the antioxidative pathway (SOD, AP and GR), turgor maintenance (LWP, RWC), membrane stability (CMS, TTC), osmoprotection (proline), productivity (photosynthesis), rooting (root architecture), early drought tolerance and leaf area. Different in vitro screening techniques were carried out. Useful traits of drought tolerance were identified in Amaranthus tricolor, A. hybridus, A. hypochondriacus, Vigna unguiculata and V subterranea, and are currently being applied in a breeding programme in an attempt to develop tolerant genotypes of neglected vegetable and seed crops that might contribute to secure food production in rural areas in Africa.

AB Biological control has evolved from an obscure science to a well-established field of study. Biological control systems for citrus and subtropical fruit crops have been studied at the University of Pretoria for more than 20 years. Various Bacillus spp. originally isolated from leaf and fruit surfaces effectively controlled Cercospora spot of avocado, anthracnose of mango and avocado, Dothiorella/Colletotrichum fruit rot complex and stem end rot of avocado and mango, soft brown rot on mango and postharvest decay and secondary infections on litchi and citrus. Control was achieved through semi-commercial preharvest sprays or postharvest pack-house dip and spray applications. Integrated treatments involving antagonists combined with quarter-strength or recommended dosage of fungicides, disinfectants or natural plant extracts also effectively suppressed postharvest diseases of avocado, citrus and mango. Antagonist attachment, colonisation and survival were studied using several techniques including viable counts, electron microscopy and monoclonal antibodies. Modes of action of these different antagonist-pathogen-host combinations indicated several levels of interactions that were time and density-dependent and included secondary metabolites, nutrient competition volatiles and competitive colonisation. Innovative alternatives to apply the antagonists in the field were evaluated and included the use of foraging bees to disseminate the antagonists to flowers and woolly-based plastic caps to provide a slow release effect for the antagonist under field conditions. Commercialising the antagonists proved to be difficult due to limitations in local registration guidelines. The South African fruit industries and the University of Pretoria currently hold the patent with regard to the formulation and application of these biocontrol products. One of these products, Avogreen (B. subtilis), a control agent against Cercospora spot on avocado, has been commercialised. This review discusses the problems, opportunities and challenges in developing and commercialising biocontrol agents in the African context. Only once these complex antagonist-pathogen-host interactions, microbial dynamic systems and environmental impact on product performance are fully understood, can biocontrol be truly regarded as a viable alternative to pesticides and will it provide some solution to Africa's critical crop protection needs.

AB Using a new methodology that allows nonlinearities, we find frequent support for external debt sustainability in a number of Latin American countries. Our findings reverse the results for several countries, obtained with traditional unit-root tests and present a richer framework for evaluating the external solvency of an economy. Our results also provide some justification for the assumption the international current accounts are based on.

TI Fiber-to-fiber - a case study at Domtar, Cornwall
SO TAPPI JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
AB Domtar Inc., at its pulp and paper mill in Cornwall, Ontario, Canada, has developed a unique program for handling mill process residues. The mill accomplished an about-turn from landfilling to recycling by implementing a comprehensive land application program for the beneficial use of residuals, including pulp and paper mill biosolids (PPMB) on land.
   Positive results from agronomic research in using PPMB-dewatered effluent treatment residue-to improve agricultural soils and boost grain and forage production are now well established. Five years of data collected from operational plantations of short rotation tree species are now showing the benefit of using pulp and paper mill residues. The results show a good potential for the use of process residues, particularly PPMB, in a kind of closed loop recycling that returns wood-based residues to the forest to grow more wood fiber, from back to fiber.
   Application: The use of pulp and paper mill residues to grow more trees is a largely unexplored benefit of papermaking. Land application of mill residues is silviculturally beneficial, economically sensible, ecologically sustainable, and environmentally responsible.

TI Categorizing the telehealth policy response of countries and their
   implications for complementarity of telehealth policy
SO TELEMEDICINE JOURNAL AND E-HEALTH
LA English
DT Article
ID TELEMEDICINE; NETWORK
AB Developing countries are exploring the role of telehealth to overcome the challenges of providing adequate health care services. However, this process faces disparities, and no complementarity in telehealth policy development. Telehealth has the potential to transcend geopolitical boundaries, yet telehealth policy developed in one jurisdiction may hamper applications in another. Understanding such policy complexities is essential for telehealth to realize its full global potential. This study investigated 12 East Asian countries that may represent a microcosm of the world, to determine if the telehealth policy response of countries could be categorized, and whether any implications could be identified for the development of complementary telehealth policy. The countries were Cambodia, China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Myanmar, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, and Vietnam. Three categories of country response were identified in regard to national policy support and development. The first category was "None" (Cambodia, Myanmar, and Vietnam) where international partners, driven by humanitarian concerns, lead telehealth activity. The second category was "Proactive" (China, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, and Thailand) where national policies were designed with the view that telehealth initiatives are a component of larger development objectives. The third was "Reactive" (Hong Kong and Japan), where policies were only proffered after telehealth activities were sustainable. It is concluded that although complementarity of telehealth policy development is not occurring, increased interjurisdictional telehealth activity, regional clusters, and concerted and coordinated effort amongst researchers, practitioners, and policy makers may alter this trend.

TI Atlantic Telehealth Knowledge Exchange
SO TELEMEDICINE JOURNAL AND E-HEALTH
LA English
DT Article
AB Atlantic Canada has some of the earliest, most comprehensive, well-established networks, and innovative applications for telehealth in the country. The region offers a range of models for telehealth, in terms of management structure, coordination, funding, equipment, utilization, and telehealth applications. Collectively, this diversity, experience, and wealth of knowledge can significantly contribute to the development of a knowledge base for excellence in telehealth services. There is no formal process in place for the sharing of information amongst the provinces. Information sharing primarily occurs informally through professional contacts and participation in telehealth organizations. A core group of organizations partnered to develop a process for knowledge exchange to occur. This type of collaborative approach is favored in Atlantic Canada, given the region's economy and available resources. The Atlantic Telehealth Knowledge Exchange (ATKE) project centred on the development of a collaborative structure, information sharing and dissemination, development of a knowledge repository and sustainability. The project is viewed as a first step in assisting telehealth stakeholders with sharing knowledge about telehealth in Atlantic Canada. Significant progress has been made throughout the project in increasing the profile of telehealth in Atlantic Canada. The research process has captured and synthesized baseline information on telehealth, and fostered collaboration amongst telehealth providers who might otherwise have never come together. It has also brought critical awareness to the discussion tables of governments and key committees regarding the value of telehealth in sustaining our health system, and has motivated decision makers to take action to integrate telehealth into e-health discussions.

TI Sustainable development, sustainable livelihoods and land reform in
   South Africa: a conceptual and ethical inquiry
SO THIRD WORLD QUARTERLY
LA English
DT Article
AB In this article various necessary conceptual linkages as well as contingent discontinuities between the concepts of land reform, sustainable livelihoods and sustainable development are studied. Exploring the complex relationship between land reform and sustainable development through a critical analysis of the concept of sustainable livelihoods, we argue that a strong ethical case for land reform as a component of sustainable development can be constructed by appealing to principles such as justice, equity and the obligations that we have towards fellow humans, as well as the environment, but fail to discharge if land reform is neglected. The case against land reform and its importance for sustainable livelihoods and sustainable development is also considered. We argue that this case is either inconclusive, or at best shows limits to the value of land reform in certain contexts only. It also suggests pitfalls to be avoided when land reform is being introduced, and can thus be regarded as enhancing the case for land reform that avoids such pitfalls. We furthermore argue that the complex set of relations that emerges proves to justify increased emphasis on implementation of land reform as a contribution towards sustainable development.

AB The Internet is widely considered as a key factor of speeding up social and cultural change. It represents the merging of information and communication technologies and enables flows of information and capital, and communication and cooperation regardless of space and, possibly, time. This article explores the example of Open Source/Free Software development, i.e. software development in self-organized projects based on a considerable share of voluntary work. Here, we find complex articulations of speeding up and slowing down technological development. Open Source/Free Software projects complement the logic of speeding up technological progress and of obsolescence with a reflexive logic of optionality, variety and sustainability which addresses the accessibility of technology and knowledge as a precondition for future creativity beyond markets and organizations.

AB The successful development of bioartificial and cell-based liver support systems relies on the identification of molecular mechanisms controlling the balance between hepatocellular proliferation and differentiation. Although a definitive function-inductive role for the cell-cell adhesion molecule, E-cadherin, was established through lateral cadherin-cadherin engagement in hepatocyte cocultures (Brevia, T.A., and Moghe, P.V. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 76, 295, 2001), the roles of other modes of cadherin presentation are not well understood. Further, alternative cadherin display configurations promoting cell growth/proliferative pathways, a major requisite for sustainable engineered tissues, remain to be identified. In this report, we employed protein A-functionalized polymeric microsphere substrates that specifically bound self-dimerizing cadherin-IgG/Fc fusion chimeras via their Fc regions, thereby orienting them outward for active adhesion, and presented the E-cadherin chimeras basally to cultured rat hepatocytes to study the effects of cadherin display on cell proliferative potential and differentiated function. In contrast to the previously documented function-inductive roles of laterally expressed cadherin, basal acellular cadherin presentation resulted in an increase in hepatocyte DNA synthesis and cell divisions, accompanied by a decrease in the expression of a key marker of liver-specific function, albumin message levels. Next, we probed the relative effect of basal exogenous display of acellular cadherins on the inductive phase of differentiation within hepatocyte cocultures with cadherin-expressing L929 cells. When acellular cadherins were applied to hepatocyte cocultures involving chaperone cell-mediated cadherin presentation, the previously reported function-inductive effects of cadherins on hepatocyte function were reversed, resulting in lower levels of albumin and urea secretion indicating a dominance of acellular cadherin effects. Our results demonstrate that cadherins are important regulators of the balance between hepatocyte differentiation and proliferation, and furthermore that the direction of balance shift may be dependent on the method of cadherin presentation. Thus, the geometric display of cadherin could be a potential parameter to switch hepatocyte functional-proliferative balance and may aid in customizing scaffolds for regulating hepatic tissue dynamics.

AB This paper presents a case study on the implementation of quality management programmes and initiatives in one manufacturing company in Australia, which has lasted for more than two decades. Using data collected through in-depth interviews, the case study describes how the company progressed from an earlier initiative based on quality control to the present initiatives that emphasize customer focus, product development, and innovation. Several important insights are drawn from the case study, including the importance of aligning the quality programmes or initiatives with a clear strategic focus. In addition, the commitment and leadership of senior management of the company has been demonstrated, particularly in the provision of resources and facilities to support the TQM programme, and also shown is how the company has been successful in maintaining its long-term commitment to quality management, which has led to an accumulation of various knowledge and competencies, which function as a valuable resource to sustain its business performance.

AB Pastures are often a mixture of different plant species. The growth patterns of these mixtures are determined by the interactions and competition among the coexisting species, as well as their response and interactions with the environment. Grassland management,for economic and environmental sustainability should be based on the integrated view of the pasture system and the understanding of the processes involved. Computer models are ideal to study such complex systems. Most modeling efforts have focused on binary combinations of an agronomic crop and a major weed species in agricultural systems. In this research, the GRAzing SImulation Model (GRASIM) was extended to account for growth and interspecies competition among a mixture of plant species, including grasses, legumes, and weeds. In the multispecies GRASIM, a user-specified number of species grow separately on a daily time step, competing for light, soil water and nitrogen. Forage experiments were conducted on a naturalized pasture at the Pennsylvania State University Beef Research Farm (University Park, Pa.). The pasture was divided and rotationally stocked at two intensities (high and low). Forage biomass data from 1998 and 1999 were used to develop and evaluate the multispecies GRASIM model. The multispecies GRASIM reasonably simulated the growth dynamics of multiple species on two grazing treatments across two seasons, despite the high variability of the pasture. The model-simulated and observed biomass data for the dominant species across the two treatments and the two growing seasons gave regression coefficients of determination (R-2) ranging from 0.25 to 0.98. Model limitations and directions for future efforts are outlined and discussed. The multispecies GRASIM can be used to help evaluate coexisting species interaction and their response to the environment and provide insight into the complex mixed-species pasture ecosystem.

AB Virus diseases cause serious losses in yield and quality of cultivated plants worldwide. These losses and the resulting financial damage can be limited by controlling epidemics using measures that minimise virus infection sources or suppress virus spread. For each combination of virus, cultivated plant and production system, there is an 'economic threshold' above which the financial damage is sufficient to justify using such measures. However, individual measures used alone may bring only small benefits and they may become ineffective, especially over the long term. When diverse control measures that act in different ways are combined and used together, their effects are complementary resulting in far more effective overall control. Such experiences have led to the development of integrated management concepts for virus diseases that combine available host resistance, cultural, chemical and biological control measures. Selecting the ideal mix of measures for each pathosystem and production situation requires detailed knowledge of the epidemiology of the causal virus and the mode of action of each individual control measure so that diverse responses can be devised to meet the unique features of each of the different scenarios considered. The strategies developed must be robust and necessitate minimal extra expense, labour demands and disruption to standard practices. Examples of how epidemiological information can be used to develop effective integrated disease management (IDM) strategies for diverse situations are described. They involve circumstances where virus transmission from plant-to-plant occurs in four different ways: by contact, non-persistently or persistently by insect vectors, and by root-infecting fungi. The examples are: Subterranean clover mottle virus (SCMoV) (contact-transmitted) and Bean yellow mosaic virus (BYMV) (non-persistently aphid-transmitted) in annually self-regenerating clover pasture; three seed-borne viruses (all non-persistently aphid-transmitted) plots of pasture legume improvement programmes; Tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV) (persistently thrips-transmitted) in vegetables in seedling nurseries, protected cropping or field systems; and lettuce big-vein disease (fungus-transmitted) in lettuce in seedling nursery, hydroponic, infested field or uninfested field situations. By describing the kinds of approaches required, this article is intended to help future research and extension programmes devise integrated disease management strategies that not only function effectively to diminish the losses caused by economically important plant virus diseases but also fulfill the requirement of being environmentally and socially responsible.

AB Whitefly-transmitted geminiviruses are the most important constraint to the production of common bean and vegetable crops in the tropical lowlands and mid-altitude valleys of Latin America. Currently, over 30 distinct species of geminiviruses that are transmitted by the whitefly Bemisia tabaci infect common bean, tomato, pepper, cucurbits and other horticultural crops. A climate probability model (using FloraMap) was obtained using data from 304 geo-referenced locations where B. tabaci and geminiviruses cause significant damage. Clustering of the 304 points produced a simple model with two climatic variables: a dry season of at least 4 months each with less than 80 mm of rain and a mean temperature of the hottest month exceeding 21 degreesC. A modified Koeppen climate classification showed that 55% of the geminivirus-affected localities are in the tropical wet/dry region, 22% in the tropical and subtropical dry/humid climates and the remaining locations belonged to the wet equatorial and trade wind litoral climates. These findings contribute to understanding whitefly/geminivirus epidemics and implementation of sustainable integrated pest and disease management practices. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

AB Carrot virus Y (CarVY) is a newly described potyvirus that causes a foliar and root disease in carrots which seriously diminishes yield and quality. It infects crops in most commercial carrot producing areas of Australia. Infection sometimes reaches very high incidences within individual crops resulting in their being abandoned due to unmarketability of the roots. A range of commonly grown carrot cultivars were all susceptible. CarVY symptoms in carrot foliage are chlorotic mottle, marginal necrosis or reddening and generalised chlorosis of leaves, increased subdivision of leaflets giving a 'feathery' appearance and plant stunting. Roots from plants infected early are stubby showing severe distortion and knobliness, while those from plants infected late are thin with little distortion. The known host range of CarVY is narrow and the key infection sources for spread by aphid vectors to newly sown crops are infected 'volunteer' carTots and adjacent infected carrot crops. Continuous irrigated carrot production in sequential plantings on the same farm all-year-round results in massive infection with the virus, while discontinuous production results in low incidences. Exposure of young carrot plants to peak aphid populations initiates early epidemics. Case histories showing how control measures affected CarVY incidence are described for one farm that deployed them compared with one that did not. An integrated control strategy devised for sustainable management of CarVY in carrot crops is described. Preliminary tests indicate that seed transmission of CarVY may occur at low levels in carrot, so introduction of the virus to isolated sites may be from inadvertent sowings of contaminated carrot seed.

AB The Somerset Levels and Moors have been designated a 'special protection area' under the EU Habitats Directive and a Ramsar wetland of international importance. Water management is important to their wellbeing, but drainage to improve agricultural productivity has reduced habitat quality and biodiversity interest. Over the last decade, significant progress has been made towards halting and (in some areas) reversing the declining wetland flora and fauna. However, the UK Government's target of achieving favourable conservation status by 2010 is unlikely to be achieved without further change.
   This paper examines the changes which are needed to achieve sustainable agricultural flood-management and conservation objectives in Somerset as a model for wetlands in England and Wales. Agricultural policy and, in particular, the lack of cross-compliance and limited discretionary modulation, is failing marginal areas such as the Somerset Levels and Moors; also, farmers and the environment are losing out. In order to ensure that objectives are clear and options and constraints are understood, increased dialogue between stakeholders is essential.

AB This study quantified concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus in the Lake Chivero catchment area, Zimbabwe. The results showed that sewage effluent is the major source of nutrients in the lake. The lake is hypertrophic, and it was concluded that the current situation is not sustainable. The Vollenweider model was used to predict the acceptable inflow phosphorus concentrations based upon oligotrophic conditions. The predicted value of 10 t/year total phosphorus was considered to be unattainable under the current situation because it is already lower than that from non-point sources. A 1970s value of 75 t/year total phosphorus is recommended as a starting point because it excludes sewage effluent and, for the long-term, it is recommended that pollution prevention and water re-use should be adopted in combination with the recycling of nutrients in controlled urban agriculture.

AB Using economic and historical yield data models in this paper we outline the socioeconomic and ecological conditions for sustainable use of fish resources in commercial lake fisheries in Finland, in the context of fragmented private ownership and owner-based management. Interlocked use refers to area greater than the typical current area on one or two lakes, and that could be used as a joint resource by the fishers in the area. The results of the economic model show that the management of the interlocked fishery, in particular by encouraging mobility of fishers, can produce higher sustainable economic benefits from the fishery. The yield data analysis shows that an interlocked resource may considerably decrease fluctuations of yield in commercial vendace fisheries. This implies that the interlocked use approach would increase the cost-effectiveness and decrease the interannual variability in income to the fishers, thus promoting sustainability in the fishery and making it potentially a more viable livelihood in rural areas.

AB Tyrosinase was used to initiate the grafting of peptides onto the amine-containing polysaccharide chitosan. Chemical evidence for covalent grafting was obtained from electrospray mass spectrometry for products formed from reactions with glucosamine (the monomeric unit of chitosan) and the model dipepticle Tyr-Ala. When this model dipepticle was incubated with tyrosinase and chitosan, there was a marked increase in the viscosity of the solution. This viscosity increase provides physical evidence that tyrosinase can initiate peptide grafting onto the chitosan backbone. A peptide-modified chitosan derivative was generated by reacting chitosan (0.32 w/v%) with acid-hydrolyzed casein (0.5 w/v %) using tyrosinase. After reaction, the peptide-modified chitosan was partially purified and dissolved in an aqueous acetic acid solution. Low concentrations of this pepticle-modified chitosan were observed to confer viscoelastic properties to the solutions. Specifically they conferred high viscosities and shear thinning properties to the solutions, and solutions containing only 1 w/w % of the pepticle-modified chitosan behaved as weak gels. Thus, tyrosinase provides a simple and safe way to convert food-processing byproducts into environmentally friendly products that offer useful functional properties. The selectivity of tyrosinase and the relatively high reactivity of chitosan's amines allow grafting to be performed with uncharacterized peptide mixtures present in crude hydrolysates.

   discharge
AB A new method for frequency analysis of hydrologic time series was developed to facilitate the estimation and reconstruction of individual or groups of frequencies from hydrologic time-series and facilitate the comparison of these isolated time-series components across data types, between different hydrologic settings within a watershed, between watersheds, and across frequencies. While climate-related variations in inflow to and outflow from aquifers have often been neglected, the development and management of ground-water and surface-water resources has required the inclusion of the assessment of the effects of climatic variability on the supply and demand and sustainability of use. The regional assessment of climatic variability of surface-water and ground-water flow throughout the southwestern United States required this new systematic method of hydrologic time-series analysis.
   To demonstrate the application of this new method, six hydrologic time-series from the Mojave River Basin, California were analyzed. The results indicate that climatic variability exists in all the data types and are partially coincident with known climate cycles such as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation and the El Nino-Southern Oscillation. The time-series also indicate lagged correlations between tree-ring indices, streamflow, stream base flow, and ground-water levels. These correlations and reconstructed time-series can be used to better understand the relation of hydrologic response to climatic forcings and to facilitate the simulation of streamflow and ground-water recharge for a more realistic approach to water-resource management.

AB To mimic catastrophic disturbances which have favored the establishment of natural stands rich in mahogany (Swietenia macrophylla), two 5000 in 2 clearings were established in each of four locations using each of three treatments: complete felling; slashing, felling and burning; and machine-clearing, which uprooted all prior vegetation. One to three months later, and again after an additional 12 months, twenty 4-month-old mahogany seedlings were planted in the center of each clearing, and, simultaneously, nearby, under the forest canopy. One year after the first planting and again 7 months later, vines and competing vegetation were cleaned from around the seedlings on one of each type of clearing in each location. Fifty-eight months later, only 5% of mahogany seedlings survived under the canopy, as compared to 32% on felled clearings and 50% on burned or machine-made clearings. Average annual growth of seedlings planted the year clearings were opened was approximately double that of seedlings planted a year later, after natural regeneration of other species had become established. At 58 months uncleaned trees averaged 352 cm in height (and the tallest 600 cm) on burned clearings, 324 cm on machine-made clearings, and 195 cm on felled clearings. Surviving seedlings planted under the forest canopy had grown less than 30 cm during the same period. On burned and machine-made clearings the effect of cleaning on growth was not statistically significant, but on felled clearings cleaning increased growth by 120%, to rates similar to those on burned clearings. Attack by the Hypsipyla grandella shootborer was significantly affected by cleaning. After 58 months, only 12% of seedlings on uncleaned plots had been attacked, compared to 44% of seedlings on cleaned plots. Cleaning also significantly increased vines, particularly on seedlings planted the year after clearings were created: 36% of all seedlings on cleaned plots had vines, as compared to 19% of uncleaned seedlings. In summary, planting mahogany seedlings under the forest canopy cannot be expected to regenerate mahogany trees. However, mahogany seedlings survive and grow well on clearings, with no subsequent interventions, if planted shortly after these are opened by machine or burning. This approach to regeneration could be expected to yield densities of 100 commercialsized mahogany trees/ha among a matrix of 400 naturally regenerated trees/ha of other species. At this rate, regenerating mahogany on clearings equivalent to 3% of the annual cutting area intervened at each harvest, could provide for replacement of mahogany trees harvested from the permanent forest reserves in the region.

AB In the Gaza Strip, the available freshwater sources are severely polluted and overused. Desalination of seawater through reverse osmosis (RO) has become the most realistic option to meet a rapidly growing water demand. It is estimated that the Gaza Strip will need to develop a seawater desalination capacity of about 120,000 m(3)/d by the year 2008, and an additional 30,000 m(3)/d by the year 2016 in order to maintain a fresh water balance in the coastal aquifer and to fulfill the water demand for different uses in a sustainable manner. Cost and reliability of a large RO facility are still subject to much uncertainty. The cost of seawater desalination by RO systems varies with facility size and lifetime, financing conditions, intake type and pre-treatment requirements, power requirements, recovery rate, chemicals cost, spare parts cost, and membrane replacement cost. The permeate salinity is a function of feed water temperature, recovery rate, and permeate flux. The quantity of water produced depends mainly on plant size, recovery rate, and operating load factor. Many of these parameters are subject to a great deal of uncertainty. The objective of this work is to develop a probabilistic model for the simulation of seawater reverse osmosis processes using a Bayesian belief network (BBN) approach. This model represents a new application of probabilistic modeling tools to a large-scale complex system. The model is used to: (1) characterize the different uncertainties involved in the RO process; (2) optimize the RO process reliability and cost; and (3) study how uncertainty in unit capital cost, unit operation and maintenance (O&M) cost, and permeate quality is related to different input variables. The model utilizes information from journal articles, books, expert opinions, and technical reports related to the study area, and can be used to support operators and decision makers in the design of RO systems and formulation of operational policies. The structure of the model is not specific to the Gaza Strip and can be easily populated with data from any large-scale RO plant in any part of the world.

ID DECISION-MAKING
AB Sustainable decision-making involves political decisions at the local, regional, or national levels, which aim at a balanced development of socio-environmental systems. A fundamental question in sustainable decision-making is that of defining and measuring sustainable development. Many methods have been proposed to assess sustainability. Recently, a model has been developed, called Sustainability Assessment by Fuzzy Evaluation (SAFE), which uses fuzzy logic reasoning and basic indicators of environmental integrity, economic efficiency, and social welfare, and derives measures of human (HUMS), ecological (ECOS), and overall sustainability (OSUS). In this article, we perform sensitivity analysis of the SAFE model to identify the most important factors contributing to sustainable development. About 80 different indicators are tested and classified as promoting, impeding, or having no effect on the progress toward sustainable development. The proposed method is applied to the Greek and American economics. The conclusion is that there is no unique sustainable path and, accordingly, policy makers should choose different criteria and strategies to make efficient sustainable decisions for each country.

AB This paper proposes a new approach to measure corporate contributions to sustainability called Sustainable Value Added. Value is created whenever benefits exceed costs. Current approaches to measure corporate sustainable performance take into account external costs caused by environmental and social damage or focus on the ratio between value creation and resource consumption. As this paper will show it is more promising to develop sustainable measures based on opportunity costs. Sustainable Value Added is such a measure. It shows how much more value is created because a company is more efficient than a benchmark and because the resources are allocated to the company and not to benchmark companies. The concept of strong sustainability requires that each form of capital is kept constant. As Sustainable Value Added is inspired by strong sustainability, it measures whether a company creates extra value while ensuring that every environmental and social impact is in total constant. Therefore, it takes into account both, corporate eco- and social efficiency as well as the absolute level of environmental and social resource consumption (eco- and social effectiveness). As a result, Sustainable Value Added considers simultaneously economic, environmental and social aspects. The overall result can be expressed in any of the three dimensions of sustainability.

ID FOOTPRINT
AB This paper sets up an input-output system of the relevant ecosystem flows that determine the carbon cycle in the global ecosystem. Introducing energy as the value added component in the ecosystem allows to calculate ecosystem prices expressed in 'energy values'. Linking the ecosystem with the economy in an integrated input-output model then allows to calculate prices of economic activities and of ecosystem activities. In analogy to the 'Ecological Footprint', where productive land is needed to absorb anthropogenic emissions, in this integrated input-output model additional carbon sinks are introduced for emission absorption. These carbon sinks need solar energy input, i.e. 'ecological value added'. Emission absorption as well as GDP therefore become activities valued in the numeraire of the integrated system, i.e. 'energy values'. From that sustainability indicators can be derived.

   emission reductions
AB This article is based on the observation that, up until now, corporate investment has been limited in clean technologies despite the will of governmental authorities to stimulate them in order to cope with the demands of sustainable development. The paper deals with the issue of the development of clean technologies and the role of regulations as clean technology promoters. It tries to apprehend the characteristics and specificity of clean technology from both an empirical and a theoretical point of view, so as to understand which are the most favourable (or inversely, the most detrimental) conditions for their development. We use case studies concerning the reduction of volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions in the chemical and metallurgical industries. These two examples highlight the problems created by the shift from a "with-solvent paradigm" to a "solvent-free paradigm" and the way clean technology trajectories may spread within such paradigms. We show that the problem of clean technology development primarily resides in some factors that impede technological adoption, although a strong and mixed incentives framework prevails. Such impediments are sector-specific, leading to different clean technology trajectories among sectors and indicating areas of sectoral intervention that could become the cornerstones of complementary technology policy.

AB The extended exergy analysis method, taking into account the mean life time cycle of building, has been applied to evaluate the sustainability of an urban area. The impact of the emissions due to the life cycle of the buildings has been evaluated. Two thermodynamic indexes, eta(I) and eta(II) showing, respectively, the first and second law efficiency of buildings, have been proposed as thermodynamic indexes. The applied methodology provides a single thermodynamics environmental criterion for the selection of technological alternatives, strategies and designs that produce lower environmental impacts connected to higher exergy indexes eta(II).

AB A number of renewable resource models (some of them just recently published, e.g. about shallow lakes) refer to 'convexities' (with respect to the resource stock) as the source for multiple steady states and associated thresholds. This short paper draws attention to the fact that multiple steady states and thresholds are possible in well-behaved (i.e. concave) models too. The ecological consequence is that renewable resource management is sensitive to initial conditions in more cases than so far suggested in the literature. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Milkfish has been farmed in Taiwan for over 300 years. Faced with limited land resources, a labor shortage, decreasing demand, and growth of imported fisheries products, the industry is looking at the problem of how to maintain a sustainable and efficient production. This study specifies a stochastic production frontier function to estimate potential milkfish farm output and efficiency by using 1997-1999 data from a survey of 433 aquaculture milkfish farms. Both Translog and Cobb-Douglas frontier production models are estimated using the maximum likelihood estimation method. Empirical results show that the Translog stochastic production function model fits the data better and that milkfish farming in Taiwan exhibits diminishing returns to scale. We also compare estimated maximum potential milkfish production per hectare under various pond conditions to provide managers with information about how to boost efficiency. In addition, this study estimates substitution elasticities and complementarity of input factors for milkfish farms to provide helpful information for milkfish farmers on how to reallocate input resources and help raise milkfish productivity through improvements in technical efficiency.

AB Shrimp disease management using bioactive marine secondary metabolites (MSMs) was developed as a package of practice for the sustainable shrimp farming. Therefore, the effect of MSMs on the host defense factors of shrimp was evaluated in the present study. Findings indicated that Ova diet significantly increase the defense factors such as haemogram, agglutination index, phagocytic rate, bacterial clearance and serum bactericidal activity of treated shrimps over the control group. Based on the gut bacterial load, Ova diet was considered as proactive drug whereas Dendrilla diet was determined as a curative agent. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The reductive dechlorination of tetrachloroethene (PCE) and trichloroethene (TCE) at contaminated sites often results in the accumulation of cis-1,2-dichloroethene (DCE) and vinyl chloride (VC), rather than the nonhazardous end product ethene. This accumulation may be caused by the absence of appropriate microorganisms, insufficient supply of donor substrate, or reaction kinetic limitations. Here, we address the issue of reaction kinetic limitations by investigating the effect of limiting substrate concentrations (electron donor and acceptor) on DCE and VC dechlorination kinetics and microorganism growth by bacterium VS. For this, a model based on Monod kinetics, but also accounting for competition between electron acceptors and the effect of low electron donor and acceptor concentrations (dual-substrate kinetics), was examined. Competitive coefficients for VC (7.8 +/- 1.5 muM) and DCE (3.6 +/- 1.1 muM) were obtained and included in the model. The half velocity coefficient for hydrogen, the electron donor, was experimentally determined (7 +/- 2 nM) through investigating dechlorination over different substrate concentrations. This complete model was then used, along with experimental data, to determine substrate concentrations at which the dechlorinating microorganisms would be in net decay. Notably, the model indicates not decay will result if the total electron acceptor concentration (DCE plus VC) is below 0.7 muM, regardless of electron donor levels. The ability to achieve sustainable bioremediation to acceptable levels can be greatly influenced by this threshold level.

AB Land use has changed dramatically over the last 30-40 years throughout the Mediterranean. Much of this change has been driven by shifts in agricultural and socio-economic policy. This paper explores landscape dynamics in the SPA 'Encinares del rio Alberche y Cotio' Central Spain between 1984 and 1999 in an area of approximately 83,000 ha. Categorical land cover maps, derived from three (1984, 1991 and 1999) remotely sensed Landsat images, are analyzed using a suite of landscape pattern metrics, and a simple transition matrix model of landscape change is developed. As with other landscapes in the Mediterranean a key trend is that of the abandonment of agricultural land and its subsequent succession to scrubland and woodland. Although there were significant composition changes in the landscape over the study period configurational changes are less evident. The transition matrix model suggests that there were differences in landscape dynamics between 1984-1991 and 1991-1999-most importantly an increase in the rate of land abandonment is evident. The model predicts a steady state landscape containing a higher abundance of scrubland and woodland, and a corresponding decline in pastureland and cropland. Finally, the underlying socio-economic and other drivers of landscape change in the Encinares del rio Alberche y Colio and some of the implications of recent changes are discussed in terms of increased wildfire risk. Sustainable management of landscapes to protect biodiversity requires the type of study described here. A necessary pre-requisite of such management activities or planning is an assessment of changes in landscape pattern and process, the social and economic pressures driving them, and their possible effects on ecosystem structure and function.

ID MONETARY-POLICY
AB Monetary policy cannot be adequately addressed without also specifying fiscal policy. I interpret the economic reforms in New Zealand in the 1980s using a simple model that includes reaction functions of both monetary and fiscal policy. The interpretation is based on the wealth effects of the government debt. The successful and sustainable shift in monetary policy regime in New Zealand was supported by a compatible switch in fiscal policy.

AB Pollination deficits in agricultural and natural systems are suggestive of large reductions in pollinator populations. However, actual declines are difficult to demonstrate using census data. Here, we show census data to be misleading because many abundant pollinators exhibit high levels of production of sterile diploid males usually found only in small inbred hymenopteran populations; Euglossa imperialis exhibits high levels of diploid male production induced by low effective population sizes (N(e)approximate to15), despite being the most abundant orchid bee in lowland tropical forests in Panama. We caution that although some pollinators appear abundant on the basis of census data, their long-term persistence may be highly tenuous based on genetic evidence. We propose the use of diploid male frequency data as a metric for assessing the sustainability of bee populations.

TI Critical magnetic Prandtl number for small-scale dynamo
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
LA English
DT Article
ID GEODYNAMO
AB We report a series of numerical simulations showing that the critical magnetic Reynolds number Rm(c) for the nonhelical small-scale dynamo depends on the Reynolds number Re. Namely, the dynamo is shut down if the magnetic Prandtl number Pr-m=Rm/Re is less than some critical value Pr(m,c)less than or similar to1 even for Rm for which dynamo exists at Pr(m)greater than or equal to1. We argue that, in the limit of Re-->infinity, a finite Pr-m,Pr-c may exist. The second possibility is that Pr-m,Pr-c-->0 as Re-->infinity, while Rm(c) tends to a very large constant value inaccessible at current resolutions. If there is a finite Pr-m,Pr-c, the dynamo is sustainable only if magnetic fields can exist at scales smaller than the flow scale, i.e., it is always effectively a large-Pr-m dynamo. If there is a finite Rm(c), our results provide a lower bound: Rm(c)greater than or similar to220 for Pr(m)less than or equal to1/8. This is larger than Rm in many planets and in all liquid-metal experiments.

Chinese Yellow Broiler Chickens were infected with 40,000 crude sporulated Eimeria oocysts at 15 days of age and prophylactic medication commenced a day prior to infection. Drug resistance was assessed for each ionophore drug by calculating the anticoccidial index (ACI) and percentage optimum anticoccidial activity (POAA) based on relative weight gain, rate of oocyst production and lesion values. Results revealed that Nanhai Eimeria oocysts comprising of E. tenella, E. maxima and E. acervulina, were resistant to monensin, sensitive to both salinomycin and lasolacid and partially sensitive to maduramicin and semduramicin. By selection for early development of oocysts during passage through chickens, the prepatent time of E. tenella, E. maxima and E. acervulina were reduced by 49, 36 and 22 h, respectively. The precocious lines are less pathogenic than the parent strains from which they were selected and conferred a satisfactory protection for chickens against coccidiosis. These ionophore-tolerant precocious lines could have wider applications in the development of anticoccidial vaccines for sustainable control of coccidiosis. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

AB Sustainable natural forest management initiatives in the lowland tropical forests of Bolivia require that cost-effective measures be identified to help maintain timber stand quality and reduce damage to advance regeneration during logging operations. This study considered the potential costs and benefits of including two 'best' management practices-the pre-harvest flagging of future crop trees (FCTs) and improved planning of skid trails-in adjacent 45 ha plots, in conjunction with conventional planned diameter-limit logging in a lowland tropical forest in the Department of Santa Cruz, Bolivia. The study also included a general assessment of FCT damage and timber waste associated with standard felling operations. The additional costs of flagging FCTs greater than or equal to30 cm DBH were estimated to be US$ 0.38/ha. FCT flagging significantly reduced damage by 20% in felling gaps and by 10% along skid trails that received 2-10 skidder passes. A mean directional error of +/-35degrees per tree felled was observed for felling operations, indicating that damage to FCTs during felling could be reduced through implementation of directional felling techniques. Improved felling techniques could increase mean timber utilization by as much as 0.16 m(3) or US$ 3.20 per tree felled through reduced wood waste associated with stump pull, a common problem observed during felling operations. Pre-harvest skid trail planning increased costs an estimated US$ 1.46/ha, but reduced mean skidder "search times" (min/m(3) harvested) by 23% and unnecessary skid trails by 96%. Compared to normal harvesting operations, overall operational efficiency increased by approximately US$ 3.00/ha. Pre-harvest skid trail planning significantly reduced FCT damage along skid trails that received 2-10 skidder passes. The results of this study indicate that pre-harvest skid trail planning and improved timber felling techniques yield short-term financial gains relative to conventional management as well as potential long-term gains through FCT conservation and, therefore, warrant implementation. Forest certification groups should consider FCT flagging for inclusion in timber certification criteria for the region given its low cost and proven utility for maintaining timber stand quality.

AB This study explores the potential of critical transformative learning for revitalizing citizen action, particularly action toward a sustainable society. Through an action research process with 14 university extension participants, it was found that a dialectic of transformative and restorative learning is vital for fostering active citizenship. This study also found that transformation is not just an epistemological process involving a change in worldview and habits of thinking; it is also an ontological process where participants experienced a change in their being in the world. As participants shifted into a new mode of relatedness with their material, social, and environmental realities, they sought avenues for socially responsible involvement as active citizens.

AB Soil-loss, food insecurity, population pressure and low income of the rural population are interrelated problems in the Loess Plateau of northern China, and result in a spiral of unsustainability. This paper examines Ansai County as a case study to explore strategic land use options that may meet well-defined goals of regional development, using a systems approach that integrated the fragmented and empirical information on the biophysical, agronomic and socio-economic conditions. We used production ecological principles, simulation modeling and multiple goal linear programming as integrative tools. Four scenarios were explored, representing major directions of agricultural development in the region and views of national and local stakeholders, farmers and environmentalists. The results indicate that soil conservation, food self-sufficiency and income for the rural population can be substantially improved by efficient resource use and appropriate inputs. In the long-term, terracing and use of crop rotations with alfalfa may be the best options for soil conservation. The large rural population and the lack of off-farm employment opportunities could be the most important factors affecting rural development in Ansai. This study contributes to the understanding of regional problems and agricultural development potentials, and shows' agro-technical possibilities for alleviating the unsustainability problems in this fragile and poorly endowed region. To promote actual development towards the identified options, on-farm innovation and appropriate policy measures are needed. The explored land use options enable a much more targeted innovation and development of policies. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The paper describes the facilitated learning process of farm households and district policy makers in addressing the problem of soil nutrient depletion. The process is applied in a case study in four districts in Kenya and Uganda during the period 1997-1999, where the potentials of low-external input technologies (LEIA) in addressing the soil nutrient depletion problem were assessed. Working through an inclusive process of dialogue, observation, diagnosis, experimentation and exposure to different types of knowledge, participants made a thorough analysis of the current soil fertility situation and tested various LEIA options for improving soil fertility management. In all four research sites the future agricultural productivity is threatened by soil nutrient depletion. Maximal use of locally available nutrients through LEIA techniques, combined with optimal use of external nutrients appears to be the most appropriate strategy in the existing economic environment. Long-term and intensive collaboration between research institutions on the one hand and extension services, non-government and community based organisations on the other are a prerequisite for a successful and sustainable implementation of a facilitated learning approach. Involvement of stakeholders in the various stages of the research process, including the planning and project formulation is essential for an effective follow-up and implementation of the results. More attention needs to be paid to the development of communication tools to enable an effective interaction between policy makers and researchers. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The sustainability of agroecosystems depends on the maintenance of the economic, biological and physical components that make up the system. The high level of integration of these components implies that any evaluation of agroecosystem sustainability must consider the dynamics of multiple components. In recent years a number of system simulation models have been developed to examine different aspects of agroecosystem sustainability. This paper presents a brief description of a simulation model developed to evaluate agroecosystem changes using a number of indicators. Agroecosystem sustainability is then evaluated using simulation results for a series of agricultural production systems in Saskatchewan, Canada. The results indicate that the economic and environmental sustainability of the system is dependent on the biophysical constraints which determine the management options that are technically, agronomically and economically viable. The simulations revealed that system sustainability did not uniformly increase or decrease according to the indicators used. Crown Copyright (C) 2003 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The temporal nature of agricultural landscape change, where both intra- and inter-annual processes and changes are often at work, renders traditional methods of landscape change assessment not completely effective. Additionally, seasonal and longer-term shifting patterns of cultivation can sometimes appear as permanent landscape change when in fact they actually are simply a local change in spatial arrangement. To address these complexities, this work tests an approach that is longitudinal in character and based upon assessing the structure of landscape change as well as the landuse/landcover (LULC) change. Set in rural northeast Thailand, patch dynamics are examined through use of LULC change trajectories built from an image time series and temporal patterns built from pattern metrics. The given unit of observation is the pixel, and its "life history" is constituted by the values derived from the images of a satellite time series, which are then reconstituted at the patch level for better ecological interpretation. The hypothesis that underpins this approach is that the nature of the trajectory is associated with the function of the land in that patch and in the neighborhood of surrounding patches. Hence, different trajectories of LULC spatial arrangement may suggest, for example, differences in the stability or dynamics of LULC over time and space, which are further suggestive of land sustainability or resilience, or conversely land conversion or dynamism. The study area for this research is a marginalized, agrarian environment in northeast Thailand, a region that has undergone deforestation of upland forests for the cultivation of commercial field crops, intensification of lowland rice for subsistence as well as local and regional sales and global export, and LULC scenarios altering the savanna landscape that serves as the background matrix. The analysis here characterizes the relative stability and temporal dynamics of LULC at the patch level. Pattern metrics calculated at the patch level are assessed as the spatial organization of landscape units that represent: (1) transitional areas of LULC dynamics occurring as peripheral expansion, (2) LULC change from forest to agriculture through deforestation, or (3) agriculture to forest through secondary plant succession, with savanna serving as a transitional matrix. In short, this paper proposes and tests a method for assessing the temporal persistence of LULC through pattern metrics. The method contributes a technique for analyzing the landscape ecology of sites as a function of their stability/dynamics within a scale-explicit context, and contributes to the growing body of work on relating scale, pattern, and process.

AB The complex interactions between human activities and the environment at the interface of land and water is analyzed with a focus on the Somali Current (East Africa), and Indian Ocean Island States, subregions of the Global International Waters Assessment (GIWA). These 2 subregions contain some of the world's richest ecosystems, including the high biodiversity forests of Madagascar and the diverse coastal habitats of the eastern African coast. These ecosystems support local communities and national and regional economies. Current and future degradation of these systems, from water basins to continental shelves, affects the livelihoods and sustainability of the countries in the region, and long-term efforts to reduce poverty. The assessments determined that pollution and climate change are the primary environmental and social concerns in the Islands of the Indian Ocean, while freshwater shortage and unsustainable exploitation of fisheries and other living resources are the primary environmental and social concerns in East Africa. The GIWA approach, through assessing root causes of environmental concerns, enables the development of policy approaches for mitigating environmental degradation. This paper explores policy frameworks for mitigating the impacts, and reducing the drivers, of 3 environmental concerns-freshwater shortage; solid waste pollution; and climate change-addressing social and institutional causes and effects, and linking the subregions to broad international frameworks. The common theme in all 3 case studies is the need to develop integrated ecosystem and international waters policies, and mechanisms to manage conflicting interests and to limit threats to natural processes.

AB This article is based on the findings of the Global International Waters Assessment (GIWA) Subregion 53, Bay of Bengal. It introduces the Subregion. The wide disparity in development indicators in the Bay of Bengal Subregion (BOBSR) is presented. The large population of poor people living in South Asia is presented as a factor that needs special attention. The article focuses on the 3 geographic sites selected for detailed analysis: i) the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna river systems; ii) the Merbok Estuary mangroves, Malaysia; and iii) the Sunderbans mangroves, Bangladesh. Integrated water management based upon regional cooperation among Bangladesh, India and Nepal holds opportunities for mutual benefit. Policy options are proposed. For mangrove ecosystems, the impacts of urbanization in Malaysia and the unmanaged expansion of shrimp farming in Bangladesh are analyzed. Improved governance was seen to hold promise for enhancing economic benefits from shrimp farming while safeguarding the natural ecological system. However, these measures need to be a part of national efforts to achieve the UN Millennium Development Goals.

AB The Sulu-Sulawesi Sea, with neighboring Indonesian Seas and South China Sea, lies at the center of the world's tropical marine biodiversity. Encircled by 3 populous, developing nations, the Philippines, Indonesia and Malaysia, the Sea and its adjacent coastal and terrestrial ecosystems, supports ca. 33 million people, most with subsistence livelihoods heavily reliant on its renewable natural resources. These resources are being impacted severely by rapid population growth (> 2% yr(-1), with expected doubling by 2035) and widespread poverty, coupled with increasing international market demand and rapid technological changes, compounded by inefficiencies in governance and a lack of awareness and/or acceptance of some laws among local populations, particularly in parts of the Philippines and Indonesia. These key root causes all contribute to illegal practices and corruption, and are resulting in severe resource depletion and degradation of water catchments, river, lacustrine, estuarine, coastal, and marine ecosystems. The Sulu-Sulawesi Sea forms a major geopolitical focus, with porous borders, transmigration, separatist movements, piracy, and illegal fishing all contributing to environmental degradation, human suffering and political instability, and inhibiting strong trilateral support for interventions. This review analyzes these multifarious environmental and socioeconomic impacts and their root causes, provides a future prognosis of status by 2020, and recommends policy options aimed at amelioration through sustainable management and development.

TI Ocean pollution from land-based sources: East China Sea, China
SO AMBIO
LA English
DT Article
AB The environment of East China Sea (ECS) has been faced by huge stresses from anthropogenic activities and population growth in the Yangtze River drainage basin and the areas along the coasts. Improper use of natural resources and short-term economic objectives have resulted in severe environmental degradation in a fairly short time frame and the degradation has now reached a level where the health and well being of the coastal populations are threatened. The main pollutants are inorganic nitrogen, phosphate, oil hydrocarbons, organic matters and heavy metals. Nutrients cause eutrophication of the coastal waters and the estuarine area and very often stimulate the occurrence of red tides. The environmental pollution of Yangtze River basin directly impact on the state of the marine environment in the ECS. The ecosystem stability is maintained by a steady water discharge from the river, that mixes with the marine salty water in the estuary, and the sediment loads from the river that balance ocean erosion in the delta and its adjacent coastal area. The large-scale water transfer and dam constructions in the Yangtze River basin will change this basis' For the ECS the challenge is to reverse the negative processes taking place and to restore ecosystem balance. The main challenge is to integrate socioeconomic and environmental decision making in order to promote sustainable development. A better understanding of the driving forces in society that cause these environmental pressures is required in order to overcome these obstacles. International cooperation may be an important contributor to the progress and in particular provide access to financial, technological, scientific and human resource assistance.

The project area covers nine provinces (Adiyaman, Batman, Diyarbakir, Gaziantep, Kilis, Mardin, Siirt, Sanliurfa and Sirnak) in the Euphrates-Tigris basins and Upper Mesopotamia plains. In this study, detailed weather data are presented for these provinces (except Sirnak). The data consist of new outdoor design conditions for heating and cooling according to the format recommended by the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers Inc. (ASHRAE), the heating and cooling degree-days for different base temperatures and the bin data for dry-bulb temperatures from -21 degreesC to 45 degreesC with 3 degreesC increments, in six daily 4-h shifts. These data are determined by using long-term recently-measured data. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Wind-induced indoor-air flow in a high-rise building adjacent to a
   vertical wall
SO APPLIED ENERGY
LA English
DT Article
AB Providing adequate natural ventilation would reduce the building cooling load in tropical areas. This is regarded as a design moving towards 'green' or 'sustainable' building. Driving forces for natural ventilation in those hot and humid countries are basically wind-induced actions. This effect depends on the surrounding environment in a dense urban area, where buildings are closely built together. For a building located next to a vertical wall or a taller building, turbulent effects due to incident wind fields would be important. In this paper, the wind-induced indoor air flow in a building adjacent to a vertical wall is studied by Computational Fluid Dynamics under different ventilation conditions. Results are useful not only for providing better ventilation, but also for working out a fire-action plan in case of accidents. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Fodder supply condition was studied at 41 nomadic families in Gobi, Southern Semi-Desert area in Mongolia, from Dec. 1994 to Apr. 1995 to determine problems in cold, feed deficient season for establishment of sustainable livestock production system. The conditions of two family groups: those located in sparse vegetation (FG1), and those in comparably dense (FG2), were also compared. Commercial concentrate feed (concentrate), hay and Zoodoi were prepared for supplementation. Zoodoi was hand-made feed made mainly of Allium mongolicum and Allium polyrrhizum. Allium mongolicum tended to be used at FG1 frequently, and Allium polyrrhizum at FG2 depend on differences of micro vegetation. 44%, 90% and 39% of families prepared 165.6 kg of concentrate, 301.6 kg of hay and 6.8 kg of Zoodoi per sheep and goat (small livestock) on the average, respectively. The ratio of families that used concentrate at FG1 was smaller than those at FG2, though there were no significant differences on the amount. More hay was fed at FG1 than at FG2, and Zoodoi tended to be fed more in the FG1 group. Recipients were mostly restricted to young, female and sick small livestock that use the feeds effectively. More families gave concentrate and hay to the young than to the females and sick. They also gave more Zoodoi to young and sick animals than to females in this area. In the FG1 group, no differences were found between recipients on the concentrate supply. More families supplied hay to young animals than to sick ones, and Zoodoi was fed more to sick animals than to young and females. On the other hand, those in the FG2 found, more families fed fodders to young than to female and sick regardless of the kinds of feeds. The amount of fodder supplementation in the studied area was restricted, but accurate techniques of nomads to adapt the situation were clarified.

TI Making the biodiversity monitoring system sustainable: Design issues for

SO AUSTRAL ECOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
DE biodiversity; biodiversity monitoring; long-term monitoring; monitoring
   systems; rangeland monitoring
AB There is strong demand for information about the status of, and trends in, Australia's biodiversity. Almost inevitably, this demand for information has led to demand for a broad-scale monitoring system. However the decision to embark on a monitoring system should only be made once it has been established that a monitoring system is the optimal way to inform management. We stress the need to invest resources in assessing whether a monitoring system is necessary before committing resources to the design and implementation of the system. Current debate associated with the design of a biodiversity monitoring system has similarities to the debate within the range management profession in the early 1970s. The experience with range monitoring shows that large-scale monitoring systems such as those being proposed will require considerable resources, recurrently expended into the distant future, but with only a limited ability to adapt to new demands. Those involved in any biodiversity monitoring system will need to understand the implications of investing in a long-term monitoring programme. Monitoring sustainability will only be possible if the monitoring system is itself sustainable. We discuss a number of issues that need to be addressed before the system is at all sustainable. These attributes are a mix of biophysical, social and institutional attributes and highlight the view that monitoring systems of the type being suggested comprise an unusual mixture of attributes not found in typical scientific activity. The present paper is not a technical manual, but rather considers some of the design issues associated with designing and implementing large-scale monitoring systems.

AB To now, New Zealand has been spared arboviral diseases, except for the odd imported infection. However, two exotic vector mosquitoes (Ochlerotatus camptorhynchus and Ochlerotatus notoscriptus) have become established in New Zealand and the routine arrival of infected people from overseas may soon lead to local arboviral transmission. Large populations of wild wallabies and Brushtail possums could serve as reservoirs of Ross River virus and other arboviruses. Several other exotic mosquito species, including important disease vectors such as Aedes albopictus and Aedes aegypti, have already been intercepted in New Zealand. It is clear that increased border surveillance is necessary if we are to interdict the establishment of such species. We recommend several measures that should be adopted, including increased training and awareness of public health officials, clinicians and the general public, and taking appropriate steps to make New Zealand self-sustainable in terms of arboviral surveillance, diagnosis, and prevention.

AB Cozumel Island in the Mexican Caribbean is inhabited by four carnivores, of which two, the Cozumel coati Nasua nelsoni and pygmy raccoon Procyon pygmaeus, are endemic species. The taxonomic status of a third carnivore, a dwarf gray fox Urocyon cinereoargenteus, is undetermined, but may deserve subspecific or species- level recognition. The fourth species, the kinkajou ( Potos flavus), may be a recent introduction. We review the status of these carnivores, report our field observations and results of line transect and trapping efforts, discuss current threats to these taxa, and make recommendations for their conservation. A population density of 0.43 +/- 0.27 coatis / km(2), and a total island population size of 150 +/- 95 individuals, was estimated from 386 km of line transects in 1994 - 1995. Intensive trapping efforts ( 1479 trap- nights) in 2001 at multiple localities were unsuccessful. Pygmy raccoons were observed in the mangrove and coastal wetland areas of the island and in 2001 we captured 11 individuals with the same sampling efforts as for coatis ( 8.8 raccoons/ 1000 trap- nights). The gray fox is also apparently very rare on the island. While a few observations of the animals have been made ( 1984, 1994 and 2001), no animals were seen along transects and none were trapped. The primary threats to the persistence of these taxa include introduced congeners, introduced predators, parasite and disease spill- over from exotic animals, habitat fragmentation, hunting and collection as pets, and hurricanes. We suggest that the Cozumel coati, pygmy raccoon, and the Cozumel population of the gray fox be considered as Critically Endangered according to the IUCN classification system. Current conservation actions focusing on Cozumel carnivores are extremely limited. We recommend eradication of introduced species, maintenance of habitat connectivity, ex situ conservation programs, explicit public policies on land- use and sustainable development, public awareness campaigns, and continuous scientific research and monitoring.

AB In this paper data on the bird community overwintering in the subalpine zone of Sagarmatha National Park (Khumbu Himal area, Nepal) are presented, with particular emphasis on habitat structure and bird-habitat relationships. The impact of land use and management on the conservation of diversity is analysed and discussed. Four habitat types were considered: mixed forest, pure juniper forest, dwarf rhododendron shrubbery and cultivations. Mixed forest supports the richest avifauna, but forest birds are sensitive to over-exploitation of their habitat: bird density, species richness and diversity are significantly lower in heavily utilised forest. Here, the lower density of rhododendrons, firs and birches, together with their younger age, seem to be unattractive to insectivorous gleaners and granivores, which prefer tree- and understorey-rich spots of unutilised forest. Terraced cultivations also are a rich habitat for wintering birds, and traditional cultivations with hedgerows and scattered bushes have a great potential for bird conservation. Juniper woods are important habitats mainly for frugivores, whereas dwarf rhododendron shrubberies support the poorest avifauna. This study emphasises that forest birds and habitats are severely threatened. As deforestation is the consequence of the tourist pressure for fuelwood along the trekking route to Mt. Everest Base Camp, a strict regulation of tourist-related developments is essential to preserve biodiversity and manage land uses within sustainability. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Information about the relative biodiversity value of different waterbody types is a vital pre-requisite for many strategic conservation goals. In practice, however, exceptionally few inter-waterbody comparisons have been made. The current study compared river, stream, ditch and pond biodiversity within an 80 kin 2 area of lowland British countryside. The results showed that although all waterbody types contributed to the diversity of macrophytes and macroinvertebrates in the region, they differed in relative value. Individual river sites were rich but relatively uniform in their species composition. Individual ponds varied considerably in species richness, with the richest sites supporting similar numbers of taxa to the best river sections, but the poorest sites amongst the most impoverished for all waterbody types. At a regional level, however, ponds contributed most to biodiversity, supporting considerably more species, more unique species and more scarce species than other waterbody types. Streams typically supported fewer species and fewer unique species at local and regional level than either ponds or rivers. Ditches (most of which were seasonal) were the least species-rich habitat, but supported uncommon species, including temporary water invertebrates not recorded in other waterbody types. Multivariate analysis indicated that permanence, depth, flow and altitude were the main environmental variables explaining invertebrate and plant assemblage composition. The findings, as a whole, suggest that ponds and other small waterbodies can contribute significantly to regional biodiversity. This contrasts markedly with their relative status in national monitoring and protection strategies, where small waterbodies are largely ignored. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Our knowledge of the agricultural sustainability of the millennia-old mountain oases in northern Oman is restricted in particular with respect to C and N turnover. A laboratory study was conducted (1) to analyse the effects of rewetting and drying on soil microorganisms after adding different manures, (2) to investigate the effects of mulching or incorporating of these manures, and (3) to evaluate the relationships between C and N mineralisation rates and manure quality indices. During the first 9-day rewetting and drying cycle, i.e. the "mulch" period, the content of extractable organic C decreased by approximately 40% in all four treatments. During the second 9-day rewetting and drying cycle, i.e. the "incorporation" period, this fraction decreased insignificantly in almost all treatments. The control and mature manure treatments form the first pair with a low percentage of total organic C evolved as CO2 (0.3% in 18 days) and a considerable percentage of total N mineralised as NH4 and NO3 (1% in 18 days), the fresh and immature manure treatments form the second pair with a higher amount of total organic C evolved as CO2 (0.5% in 18 days) and no net N mineralisation. During the first 9-day rewetting and drying cycle, the contents of microbial biomass C and biomass N increased by approximately 150% in all four treatments. During the second 9-day rewetting and drying cycle, no further increase was observed in the control and immature manure treatments and a roughly 30% increase in the other two treatments.

ID FUZZY-LOGIC CONTROL; MACHINE VISION
AB A robotic platform for mapping of weed populations in fields was used to demonstrate intelligent concepts for autonomous vehicles in agriculture which may eventually result in a new sustainable model for developed agriculture. The vehicle presented here is adapted to operate in 0.25 and 0.5 in row crops and equipped with cameras for row guidance and weed detection. A modular approach is taken, with four identical wheel modules, allowing four wheel steering and propulsion of the platform. The result is improved mobility which allows parallel displacement of the vehicle during turns by decoupling adjustments in position from adjustments in orientation. Control of the platform is provided through a vehicle electronics and control system based on embedded controllers and standard communication protocols. The software Implements a hybrid deliberate software architecture that allows a hierarchical decomposition of the operation. The lowest level implements a reactive feedback control mechanism based on an extension of simple control for car-like vehicles to the four wheel case. The controller design forces the front and rear of the vehicle to follow a predetermined path and allows the vehicle to maintain a fixed orientation relative to the path. The controller rationale is outlined and results from experiments in the field are presented. (C) 2003 Silsoe Research Institute. All rights reserved Published by Elsevier Ltd.

ID LIFE-HISTORY; DYNAMICS; RECRUITMENT; RISK
AB We explore the effects on population size and yield of different levels of harvesting of a predator in a predator-prey system. We consider the consequences of adaptive change in the predator's foraging time (or effort) and feedback control of fishing effort. The predator may increase in population size with increasing fishing effort, either when the prey is characterized by a positive effect of its own population size on its own growth rate or when the prey is overexploited by the predator. The predator abundance at which the sustainable yield is maximized can be larger than the abundance without fishing. The effort that achieves maximum sustainable yield and the effort that maximizes predator abundance can both be close to the effort at which the stock collapses. Feedback control in the response to predator abundance may fail to achieve the desired abundance of the target stock or its prey even if the fishing effort is well controlled. These results suggest that developing policies for exploiting adaptive predator species in potentially cycling systems cannot be based on the stable single-species models often used in fisheries management.

ID FERTILIZATION SUCCESS; GENUS HALIOTIS; STOCK; RECRUITMENT; ABUNDANCE;
   DYNAMICS; BEHAVIOR; DENSITY
AB The greenlip abalone (Haliotis laevigata) population in Waterloo Bay, South Australia, has undergone collapse and fishery closure twice since 1978. A rich data set, including survey measures of degree of spatial aggregation, has been gathered over that time and provides a unique opportunity to identify factors accounting for persistence or collapse, an issue that is of significance to abalone fisheries worldwide. Statistical analyses of fishery and survey data were undertaken to infer functional relationships between catch, effort, recruitment, adult density, and extent of aggregation. Catch rates were hyperstable, an observation consistent with the targeting of large aggregations. Statistical analysis of recruitment showed a significant year effect, implying an environmental signal, and suggested that aggregation size impacts fertilization success. Aggregation size grew under closure, suggesting an impact of fishing on this demographic feature. Aggregative behaviour appears to be critical for subpopulation sustainability. Fishery collapse may be triggered by depletion of larger abalone aggregations by heavy fishing, resulting in declines in fertilized egg production. When heavy fishing coincides with unfavourable environmental conditions, recruitment may be insufficient to sustain the subpopulation. If aggregation is similarly critical for other subpopulations, management strategies could be adapted according to the extent of aggregation in each subpopulation.

AB At the landscape scale, one of the key indicators of sustainable forest management is the age-class distribution of stands, since it provides a coarse synopsis of habitat potential, structural complexity, and stand volume, and it is directly modified by timber extraction and wildfire. To explore the consequences of several landscape-scale boreal forest management strategies on age-class structure in the Mauricie region of Quebec, we used spatially explicit simulation modelling. Our study investigated three different harvesting strategies (the one currently practiced and two different strategies to maintain late sera] stands) and interactions between fire and harvesting on stand age-class distribution. We found that the legacy of initial forested age structure and its spatial configuration can pose short- (<50 years) to medium-term (150-300 years) challenges to balancing wood supply and ecological objectives. Also, ongoing disturbance by fire, even at relatively long cycles in relation to historic levels, can further constrain the achievement of both timber and biodiversity goals. For example, when fire was combined with management, harvest shortfalls occurred in all scenarios with a fire cycle of 100 years and most scenarios with a fire cycle of 150 years. Even a fire cycle of 500 years led to a reduction in older forest when its maintenance was not a primary constraint. Our results highlight the need to consider the broad-scale effects of natural disturbance when developing ecosystem management policies and the importance of prioritizing objectives when planning for multiple resource use.

AB A discussion of cultural industries in this journal ("Kinmen: governing the culture industry city in the changing global context") raises doubts about the "successful" governance of local redevelopment and the established institutional system described by the authors (Yang and Hsing, 2001). We would not like to argue the context of cultural development but aim to discuss the reality and the crisis of Kinmen; which was, ironically, not expected to display steady development in the 21st century. Nevertheless, the cultural-industrial institutions in Kinmen, which were addressed by Yang & Hsing, still need to go a long way in order to be fully implemented and the development of Kinmen has achieved sustainability.

AB Improved weed management strategies may be possible through rotational schemes which alter the weed seedbank community. This study investigated the effects of 2-year crop rotations with alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.), clover (Trifolium pratense L.), rye (Secale cereale L.), or sweet corn (Zea mays L. var. rugosa Bonaf.) on weed seedbank density and diversity at three sites in New York. Weed seedbank density and diversity increased under all rotational schemes over the 2 years, but increases were generally lowest after sweet corn, in which tillage and herbicides were used. By the end of the second year, seed densities of individual weed species had changed to different extents in response to rotational crop. Most of the instances in which seed densities increased significantly were associated with rye. Although pre- and post-emergence herbicides plus tillage were used with sweet corn, weed seedbank densities were similar compared with the alfalfa and clover rotations, in which no herbicides nor tillage were used. Our results indicate that legumes could be a component in the sustainable management of weeds through manipulation of the seedbank. A rye cover crop did not appear to deter seed return nor recruitment to the seedbank as much as the legumes did. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The fruit borer Helicoverpa armigera (Hubner) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) is a serious pest of several crops in India. Among these, tomato, cotton, pigeon pea, and chickpea consistently suffer extensive damage by the insect in different parts of the country. The pesticides no longer control the insect. Among the alternative tactics for its control, transgenic plants expressing toxic proteins of Bacillus thuringiensis offer a sustainable and effective method to prevent the crop losses because of H. armigera attack. The transgenic Bt tomato plants expressing a Cry1Ab protein of B. thuringiensis suffered significantly lower damage by H. armigera than the non-transgenic control plants in the laboratory, greenhouse and field. The Bt plants caused 100% mortality of the larvae and did not support any growth and development by the latter. The only damage caused by the invading neonate larvae was to the terminal parts of tomato shoots, which underwent wilting though larvae died thereafter. In view of this, a complete control of the H. armigera by Bt plants in the field will have to be supported by the other tactics of pest management such as bio-control agents or limited use of pesticides.

DE multivariate analysis; cabbage head rot; sustainable agriculture
AB Weeds and diseases constrain cabbage (Brassica oleracea L.) production in New York. Moreover, the highly competitive weed species, Ambrosia artemisiifolia L., increases the risk of white mold caused by Sclerotinia sclerotiorum (Lib.) de Bary. The objective of this study was to identify sustainable weed and disease management practices for the integrated control of both classes of pests in cabbage. Cabbage sub-plots were established on larger whole-plots which had been under rotations of alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.), clover (Trifolium pratense L.), rye (Secale cereale L.) or sweet corn (Zea mays L. var. rugosa Bonaf.) for the two previous years. Weed densities were measured 21 d after cabbage transplanting. Weed community response to the rotational crops varied by location. In general, herbicides provided the best weed control in cabbage, but non-chemical practices (mulching, cultivation) were as effective as herbicides in controlling A. artemisiifolia. This weed was associated with reductions in cabbage size at all three sites. The results demonstrate that rotational crop schemes in conjunction with non-chemical management strategies can be effective in controlling weed infestations. Dry weather during the growing season prevented the development of white mold. However, cabbage quality was reduced by a rot caused by a species of Fusarium. The incidence of rot appeared unrelated to weed density or weed community composition. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The long-term preservation of national park ecosystems requires scientific knowledge about populations, communities, and the ecological processes upon which sustainable ecosystems depend. Unfortunately, national parks in the United States have a well-documented history of indifference, if not hostility, to the support of basic research. Numerous external reviews have criticized the lack of institutional support for science, blaming it in large part on the traditional emphasis of the National Park Service (NPS) on scenery and tourism management. However, recent efforts to improve the support for science in the U.S. national parks have been most encouraging. These include a long-sought Congressional mandate to support research, a major budget initiative to support scientific understanding and management of park resources as well as to improve research facilities, leadership in the establishment of a network of university-based cooperative units, and the successful partnering with private organizations to support innovative programs to fund Ph.D. students, postdocs, and sabbaticals in national parks. The long-term success of national parks in preserving natural ecosystems depends, in large part, on the NPS's ability to provide support for the science that is necessary to understand natural ecosystems as well as the effects of human activities.

AB This article examines the challenges to trade unions related to workers' participation in organizational renewal known as 'sustainable business'. It analyses how integrated management systems involving occupational health and safety (OHS) and environmental issues affect employee participation. The analysis involves two case studies of enterprises that have recently been modernized in terms of employing integrated management systems. Under the general title of 'Developing Workplaces', the Danish Confederation of Trade Unions has increased its commitment to sustainability, which is used as the point of departure for concept-driven organizational change. However, the article concludes that the so-called 'prime mover' and high-profile environmental and OHS enterprises do not sufficiently take the interests of employees into consideration.

ID DEATH FORETOLD; CRISIS
AB According to a well-established economic principle, any public debt that does not exceed the discounted stream of future primary surpluses should find buyers. This paper argues why this principle may not hold if the government has only imperfect control over its net income flow. A small risk of unsustainability appears to be at the origin of a much larger risk of illiquidity. Solving the model for the rational expectations equilibrium, we find that the maximum debt level that investors are willing to hold may be much lower than the commonly used sustainable level.

TI Energy sustainability and global warming in Spain

DT Article
DE energy sustainability; renewable energy sources (RES); policy
   coordination
AB A set of Directives and official documents aim to reorient European policy strategies in the energy sector. However, certain socioeconomic and institutional factors prevent Spain from attaining the interrelated goals set up in those documents (namely, energy liberalisation, reduction of CO2 emissions and promotion of renewable energy). These objectives are difficult to achieve in an institutional setting, such as the Spanish one, characterised by different administrative levels (national and regional). Competencies and initiatives taken in CO2 emission mitigation through RE deployment are scattered around those government levels and lack of coordination between such administrative levels seems to be a main feature. In other words, the combined attainment of those objectives requires that policy makers coordinate local, institutional and public initiatives and examine their feasibility. This paper explores the main imbalances and coordination problems at the territorial and sector levels concerning the complex relationship between energy (production and consumption) and sustainability in Spain. From the analysis of these issues, relevant policy implications can be inferred. (C) 2002 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The inherent technical, economic and environmental benefits of hydroelectric power make it an important contributor to the future world energy mix, particularly in the developing countries. These countries have a great and ever-intensifying need for power and water supplies and they also have the greatest remaining hydro potential. Development is a basic human right, as few would deny. Energy policymakers must meet their responsibility in exploring the most rational options for meeting the energy needs of the developing countries, while protecting the environment to the maximum possible extent. Technically, feasible hydropower estimated at nearly 15,000 TWh/yr still exists in the world today, mostly in countries where increased power supplies from clean and renewable sources are most urgently needed to progress social and economic development. This paper reviews the current role hydropower is playing in the world, along with some its inherent benefits, and then looks at the remaining potential, and some specific development plans in various countries of the world.

AB Bioenergy is one of the forms of renewable energy. Bioenergy, the energy from biomass, has been used for thousands of years, ever since people started burning wood to cook food, and today wood is still our largest biomass resource for bioenergy. The use of bioenergy has the potential to greatly reduce our greenhouse gas emissions. Replacing fossil fuels with energy from biomass has several distinct environmental implications. If biomass is harvested at a rate that is sustainable, using it for energy purposes does not result in any net increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas. States have played a leading role in protecting the environment by reducing emissions of greenhouse gasses (GHGs), and state emissions are significant on a global scale. CO2 and CO are the main greenhouse gases associated with global warning. At the present time, coal is responsible for 30-40% of world CO2 emissions from fossil fuels. SO2 and NOx contribute to acid rain. Carbon assessments can play an important role in a strategy to control carbon dioxide emissions while raising revenue.

DE triple bottom line; health impact assessment; accountability
AB This theoretical study explores the links between the Triple Bottom Line (TBL) concept and the principles of HIA and considers the potential role of HIA to provide a mechanism for integrating health concerns within a broader agenda of government and business. TBL is a framework linked to the broader sustainability agenda that underpins and reviews environmental, economic and social performance of organizations. In its simplest form, TBL acts as a tool for reporting to stakeholders/shareholders organizational performance and the nature of the impacts on the community. The links to HIA are clear as both seek to determine the impact (potential and actual) on the health and well-being of the population.
   The study found that TBL can operate at four levels within organizations ranging from reporting through to full integration with the organization's goals and practices. Health is narrowly defined and there are tensions about how to undertake the social accountability functions. The study shows the potential role for HIA within the broader policy and accountability agenda. As health is one of the main outcomes of an organization's activities it needs to be taken into account at all levels of activity. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

ID HEALTH IMPACT ASSESSMENT; AIR-POLLUTION; PUBLIC-HEALTH; POLICY
AB The object of the health impact assessment (HIA) was to inform economic development of a neighbourhood in Sheffield (England) and to use HIA as a tool to increase the participation of local communities in strategic development decisions. Community profiling and literature review was followed by analysis and prioritisation of policy and health impacts, and recommendations for policy change. A series of Standing Conferences were used to bring community, statutory and private sector perspectives together for debate. The paper reflects upon the extent to which the economic, environmental, and social HIA recommendations have been implemented, 2 years on. It concludes that most progress has been made where lobbying and action by local groups has been able to bring about change. Unsurprisingly regional and national policy making has proved harder to influence. Involvement of two community partnership groups was important in building community involvement. The learning is summarised in a 10 point list of factors which enable HIA to make a difference. It is concluded that participatory HIA can not only assist in identifying the integrated solutions which sustainable development requires, but also helps form the partnerships and alliances required to realise such solutions.

AB This study examines the motivations of mainland Chinese facilities in seeking ISO 14001 certification and examines the linkages between these motivations and self-reports of the effectiveness of major environmental management system (EMS) components. In a sample of 128 facilities in Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou, the main drivers for certification were reported to be to ensure regulatory compliance, to enhance the firm's reputation, and to improve environmental performance, in that order. Although motivation to achieve cost reductions were least emphasized, a broad range of motivations appears to be considered in the decision to seek certification to ISO 14001. Regression models linking these motivations to the EMS components suggests that internal motivations have an influence on most EMS components. One interesting exception to this, however, is that no significant relationship was observed between internal motivations and the promulgation of environmental objectives and targets. The relationships associated with external motivations for certification (i.e., those in response to customer and other stakeholder pressures) and EMS components, on the other hand, are weaker and tend to Occur earlier in the process cycle. No significant relationships were found between motivations to reduce costs and perceptions of the effectiveness of EMS components. Overall, these findings suggest that ISO 14001, as currently being implemented in mainland China, may have a modestly useful role when used in combination with other policy mechanisms to Move the Chinese economy toward more sustainable practices. It is asserted that the ISO standard could provide even greater benefits if Chinese registrars were more proactive in developing EMS in conjunction with even more rigorous third-party audits.

TI Sustainable mining in the European Union: The legislative aspect
SO ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper is a review of the community legislation of the European Union ("acquis communautaire") with regard to the mineral extractive industry. It highlights the existing inconsistencies of the acquis, which require correction. Historically, the mining industry has received privileged treatment within the European Community. The treaties declare the promotion of a policy of using natural resources prudently and rationally to avoid their unconsidered exhaustion. However, mining is excluded from the scope of major environmental directives or reserves a certain freedom for interpretation. This has led to an increasing number of related cases at the European Court of Justice. The regulatory tools of the environmental acquis are rather diverse in controlling the emission Sources, the pollution pathways, and the impacted receptor media through administrative measures or assigning environmental quality targets. A combined approach is needed for controlling the environmental impacts of the extractive industries. The amendment of the Seveso II Directive, the elaboration of a reference document on best available techniques and the preparation of a wide-scope directive on mining waste management might provide a frame for the elimination of the above discrepancies. In addition, a coherent European Community policy based on the balanced consideration of economic, environmental, and social aspects could ensure a sustainable development of the mining industry.

AB Ecology and culture comprise interacting components of landscapes. Understanding the integrative nature of the landscape is essential to establish methods for sustainable management. This research takes as a unifying theme the idea that ecological and cultural issues can be incorporated through management. As a first step in developing integrative management strategies, information must be collected that compares and contrasts ecological and cultural issues to identify their areas of intersection. Specifically how can local cultural knowledge enable, water resource management that reflects cultural and ecological values? This research examines Native American cultural knowledge for setting water resource management priorities in the Wind River Indian Reservation in central Wyoming, A cross-cultural approach is adopted to assess the relationship between indigenous cultural knowledge and Euro-American perspectives through a comparative examination of the Wind River Water Code and Wyoming Water Law. This research indicates that cultural perspectives provide a rich arena in which to examine management issues. Understanding and identifying cultural practices may be an important first step in collaborative resource management between different cultural groups to prevent conflict and lengthy resolution in court.

AB As part of the U. S. 2003 National Report on Sustainable Forests, four metrics of forest fragmentation - patch size, edge amount, inter-patch distance, and patch contrast - were measured within 137 744 non-overlapping 5625 ha analysis units on land-cover maps derived from satellite imagery for the 48 conterminous States. The perimeter of a typical forest patch is about 100 m from the perimeter of its nearest neighbor, except when there is not much forest, in which case that distance is 200 to 300 m. A typical analysis unit has from 10 to 40% as much forest edge as it could possibly have, given the amount of forest present. Most analysis units contain a large number of patches that are less than one hectare in size, and about 10% contain one or more 2000 to 5000 ha patches. Forest often defines the background landscape, and patch contrast is generally either very high or very low in eastern regions and intermediate in western regions. Many research needs were identified by this experimental analysis of available data and metrics.

AB Amending poultry litter (PL) with aluminum sulfate (alum) has proven to be effective in reducing water-soluble phosphorus (P) in the litter and in runoff from fields that have received PL applications; it has therefore been suggested as a best management practice. Although its effectiveness has been demonstrated on a macroscopic scale in the field, little is known about P speciation in either alum-amended or unamended litter. This knowledge is important for the evaluation of the long-term stability and bioavailability of P, which is a necessary prerequisite for the assessment of the sustainability of intensive poultry operations. Both solid-state MAS and CP-MAS P-31 NMR as well as P-31{Al-27}-TRAPDOR were used to investigate P speciation in alum-amended and unamended PL. The results indicate the presence of a complex mixture of organic and inorganic orthophosphate phases. A calcium phosphate phase, probably a surface precipitate on calcium carbonate, could be identified in both unamended and alum-amended PL, as wellas physically bound HPO42-. Phosphate associated with Al was found in the alum-amended PL, most probably a mixture of a poorly ordered wavellite and phosphate surface complexes on aluminum hydroxide that had been formed by the hydrolysis of alum. However, a complex mixture of organic and inorganic phosphate species could not be resolved. Phosphate associated with Al comprised on average 40 +/- 14% of the total P in alum-amended PL, whereas calcium phosphate phases comprised on average 7 +/- 4% in the alum-amended PL and 14 +/- 15% in the unamended PL.

AB Despite substantial evidence pointing to a looming Malthusian catastrophe, governmental measures to reduce population have been opposed both by religious conservatives and by many liberals, especially liberal feminists. Liberal critics have claimed that 'utilitarian' population policies violate a 'fundamental fight of reproductive liberty'. This essay argues that reproductive liberty should not be considered a fundamental human right, or certainly not an indefeasible right. It should, instead, be strictly regulated by a global agreement designed to reduce population to a sustainable level. Three major points are discussed: 1) the current state of the overpopulation problem; 2) the claim of a fundamental human fight of reproductive liberty; 3) an outline of a global agreement to address overpopulation as a 'tragedy of the commons.

TI Looking after water in Africa - ESA's TIGER Initiative meets the
   challenges posed at the Johannesburg Summit
SO ESA BULLETIN-EUROPEAN SPACE AGENCY
LA English
DT Article
AB Water resource, the 'blue gold' of the 21st century, can be successfully monitored from space using Earth-observation technology. Satellites can measure precipitation, atmospheric water content, soil moisture, surface run-off, lake and river levels, groundwater reservoirs, as well as ice and snow cover. Improved sensors, better modelling and a deeper understanding of the underlying science have substantially advance our knowledge of the global water cycle in recent years.
   However, there are still major shortcomings in both the understanding and the observation of key parameters. The estimation of groundwater resources, for example, poses a major challenge, as they are not directly visible from space. Indirect methods based on gravity-field measurements, radar interferometery and altimetric monitoring of rivers need to be applied to gain knowledge of reservoir volumes and flows. In order to improve our capabilities and to offer this technology to people in developing countries, ESA has launched a new programme focusing on the use of space technology for water-resource management in Africa. The initiative, called 'TIGER', is a direct follow-up of ESA's strong engagement in the 2002 Johannesburg World Summit on Sustainable Development, and implements its recommendations through concrete actions.

DE evaluation; NHS policy; primary care; research capacity
AB Introduction. Various initiatives have been implemented in recent years to support primary care practitioners new to research. We describe the evaluation of one particular scheme, the NHS Eastern Region Primary Care R&D Enterprise Award Scheme, and discuss the implications of the results for future policy.
   Methods. Representatives from both the funders (NHS R&D) and the award holders were involved in the design of an evaluation questionnaire and in the interpretation of the results.
   Results and Discussion. The evaluation demonstrated value in relation to traditional research outcomes and also, notably, in relation to professional contribution. Future policies may need to address: the indicators used in measuring the success of such schemes; the relationship between what individuals choose to do and its context within national policy on research and development; and the sustainability of involvement in research.

ID RIVER; RECRUITMENT; IMPACTS
AB During the monsoon the Bangladesh floodplain becomes integrated into a single biological productive system. A conservative estimate of the number of freshwater bony fish species present in the system is 273 of which 13 are exotics. Cyprinids, catfishes and hilsa shad Tenualosa ilisha, a clupeid, predominate. About 20-30 fishes, mostly blackfishes, which are resident in the floodplain and tolerant of low levels of oxygen provide the majority of the national freshwater fish production. Most of the rural population fish professionally, seasonally or for subsistence. In addition to the harvesters, a further two million people are involved in activities related to the fisheries sector. The yield in the floodplain may vary from 50 to 400 kg ha(-1) per year and the majority of the fishes is eaten fresh. For full-time fishers, conflict over water resources can be intense during the dry season when water is required for irrigation. Flood control, drainage and irrigation schemes may obstruct the lateral migrations of rheophilic whitefish species and the passive drift of larvae from the main channel to the modified floodplains. Existing modifications to the hydrological regimes may cause reductions in catch per unit area and fish biodiversity. The area under flood control is expected to be 5.74 x 10(6) ha in 2010 resulting in a loss of ca. 151,300 t of fishes. There has been a move away from the leasing of water estates ('jalmohals') to the promotion of co-management. The open access policy, which has led to severe competition for the resources, has reduced the effectiveness of co-management. The future aim is to shift the benefits to the fishers and to ensure the long-term sustainability of the resources. Both habitat restoration and fish enhancement are important in sustaining the floodplain fisheries. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper develops a precautionary bioeconomic approach for the red grouper (Epinephelus morio) multi-fleet fishery in the Campeche Bank, Gulf of Mexico, based on a long-term analysis covering the years 1980-2000. Population structure was estimated through commercial sampling of the three fishing fleets participating in the fishery: two Mexican (one artisanal and the other industrial) and one Cuban (industrial). Length frequency distributions (LFDs) did not show significant differences between the Mexican industrial and the Cuban fleets, but differed from those of the artisanal fishery, which targets smaller individuals. The lack of differences in the LFDs between years suggests that the population structure was stable during the last two decades. However, the instantaneous coefficient of total mortality Z, estimated through length-converted catch curves, significantly increased during the 21-year period of analysis, being in average 1.22 times higher in 2000 than in 1980. Annual estimates of yield and Z, together with unit costs of effort and ex-vessel prices, were used as inputs to build a bioeconomic yield-mortality model. A sensitivity analysis was performed under three scenarios of natural mortality M (0.16, 0.25 and 0.35 per year). The yield at maximum economic yield (Y-MEY) and the associated mortality levels Z(MEY) and F-MEY were always the most conservative bioeconomic reference points (BRPs). The yield at maximum biological production (Y-MBP), Y-MEY and mortality-related BRPs were substantially lower than those based on maximum sustainable yield (MSY), thus constituting useful target BRPs for precautionary management. The bootstrap method used for determining the uncertainty associated at BRPs, shows that the best targets BRPs were Y-MEY and Y-MBP, whereas MSY is confirmed as a risky and limit BRP. A simple approach to the formulation of risk-averse management strategies was explored using the percentiles of cumulative distributions of MSY, Y-MBP and Y-MEY estimates generated from bootstrap against Z. We conclude that the red grouper fishery at Campeche Bank is overexploited and that immediate management actions are needed to prevent stock collapse. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Recently, control rules (CR) have been widely used for decision-making of fisheries management. A CR describes fishing pressure (usually fishing mortality, F) as a function of some other variable(s) related to the status of the stock. The prevailing CR aim to achieve F-MSY. The main idea of CR is to change fishing pressure based on stock conditions. Therefore, it seems irrational that the goals of prevailing CR are defined by the constant harvesting rate (CHR) strategy The objective of the present study was to develop a method by which to numerically search for the optimal CR, apart from the traditional biological reference points based on CHR. I also compared the performance of the optimal CR and those of the prevailing CR (F-MSY, 75%F-MSY, New Management Procedure of the International Whaling Committee and the CR in US guidelines). The result suggested that the limitation of maximum fishing mortality was effective for stocks with low natural mortality and large stock size estimation error, while the biomass threshold was effective for stocks with short longevity and small estimation error. This means that the optimal CR is sensitive to the life history and uncertainty of the stock. Therefore, there seems to be no 'one-size-fits-all' rule for fish stocks.

AB A model, designed to carry out soil nutrient audits, has been used to calculate nutrient balances for Africa for the period 1961-1998 for land used for arable and permanent crops. The model indicates that in Africa and most African countries, nutrient depletion has been increasing and in 1998 was 3.5 million tonnes nitrogen (17.4 kg N ha(-1) year(-1)). The corresponding data for phosphorus were 0.7 million tonnes (3.3 kg P ha(-1) year(-1)), and for potassium, 4.1 million tonnes (20.0 kg K ha(-1) year(-1)). Average total nutrients output (embodied in crop output) increased by 2.5% year(-1) between 1961 and 1998, but in the same period, output capita(-1) per year fell by about 10%.
   Nutrient audits for six countries in SSA (Kenya, Malawi, Nigeria, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe), for the period 1961-1998, show large differences in input and output rates and balances. Ill 1996-1998, total nutrient inputs (N + P + K) ranged from 23 kg ha(-1) year I (Zambia) to 81 kg ha(-1) year(-1) (Zimbabwe). Total nutrient output (crop production) for the corresponding period was in the range 21 kg ha(-1) year(-1) (Zambia) to 97 kg ha(-1) year' (Nigeria). Nutrient balance time series show that for most countries, N, P and K nutrient depletion rates have increased between 1961 and 1998 but have fluctuated considerably during this period. The depletion rate in Nigeria has increased threefold since 1980 and in 1998 was 73 kg ha(-1) year(-1). Because both inputs and outputs were low, Zambia had the lowest total nutrient depletion rate of 5 kg ha(-1) year(-1). In all cases, the highest depletion rates are for K.
   To achieve a sustainable nutrient output per capita will require a large increase in fertilizer use. It is unlikely that these consumption rates will be achieved and hence future food security could be impaired. Policy implications are discussed. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The long-run output potential of the economic process has been overstated as a consequence of the mainstream use of aggregate production functions that violate the first and second laws of thermodynamics. Use of a simulation model incorporating a non-traditional production function reveals a number of important conclusions. First, natural capital is eventually depleted if there is a desire is to continuously increase the level of production and consumption over time. Second, assuming that such a desire exists, the time it takes to deplete natural capital and for the economic process to become ecologically unsustainable depends on: (a) advances in resource-saving technology; (b) the durability of human-made capital; (c) the rate of accumulation of human-made capital; and (d) the productivity of natural capital. Third, if an ecologically sustainable pathway is instead preferred, it comes at the expense of a much lower consumption level per period-although, of course, the consumption stream is a permanent one. Finally, if economic welfare is assumed to be a function of the quantity of final goods available for consumption purposes, the desirable long-run pathway of the economic system depends on the rate at which future consumption is discounted. Indeed, for a particular set of circumstances, there is a threshold discount rate above which ecological unsustainability is, from a strictly utilitarian perspective, the preferred long-run option of the present generation. Whether a sustainable pathway is chosen rests largely on whether the present generation believes it is morally obligated to preserve natural capital stocks for the benefit of future generations.

AB Empirical research of the resource-based view (RBV) is still in its embryonic stages. Existing studies show that certain resources are associated with firm performance, that firms appear to be unique bundles of resources, and that some resources appear relatively immobile-thus lending support to RBV's main premise and its two assumptions. Another important step in systematically testing RBV is to test its main prescription that strategic assets (SAs) are sustainable sources of superior returns. The current research argues that top management team cohesion (TMTC) possesses the characteristics of an SA. Then, in a longitudinal study of 81 classroom simulation teams functioning as the top management teams of competing airlines, the authors show that TMTC is significantly associated with superior returns during the second half of the simulation. Hence, the results lend support to RBV.

TI Measuring the strategic readiness of intangible assets
SO HARVARD BUSINESS REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
AB Measuring the value of intangible assets such as company culture, knowledge management systems, and employees' skills is the holy grail of accounting. Executives know that these intangibles, being hard to imitate, are powerful sources of sustainable competitive advantage. If managers could measure them, they could manage the company's competitive position more easily and accurately.
   In one sense, the challenge is impossible. Intangible assets are unlike financial and physical resources in that their value depends on how well they serve the organizations that own them. But while this prevents an independent valuation of intangible assets, it also points to an altogether different approach for assessing their worth.
   In this article, the creators of the Balanced Scorecard draw on its tools and framework-in particular, a tool called the strategy map-to present a step-by-step way to determine "strategic readiness;" which refers to the alignment of an organization's human, information, and organization capital with its strategy. In the method the authors describe, the firm identifies the processes most critical to creating and delivering its value proposition and determines the human, information, and organization capital the processes require.
   Some managers shy away from measuring intangible assets because they seem so subjective. But by using the systematic approaches set out in this article, companies can now measure what they want, rather than wanting only what they can currently measure.

TI Masking subversion: Neocolonial embeddedness in anthropological accounts
   of indigenous management
SO HUMAN RELATIONS
LA English
DT Article
DE anthropology; ecological embeddedness; indigenous; management;
   organization; postcolonial
ID POSTMODERNISM; ETHNOGRAPHY
AB Sustainability and sound ecological management of the natural environment, allied to the expanding body of work on managing tacit and explicit knowledge, has led to an increased interest in the contribution which anthropology can make to the practical adaptation of indigenous environmental knowledge and practice to the improvement of organization in western societies. In an exemplary ethnographic study of an indigenous beaver trapper belonging to the Cree Nation, Whiteman and Cooper introduced the concept of ecological embeddedness. Their study could be considered a model that reverses the traditional practice of viewing managers as though they were primitives and applying concepts employed in studying native communities to organizations. They consider indigenous practitioners as managers, identify their management practices, and then reconsider contemporary management practice towards the environment in this light. They argue that to be ecologically embedded as a manager is to identify personally with the land, to adhere to beliefs of ecological respect, reciprocity and caretaking, actively to gather ecological information and to be located physically in the ecosystem. The present article provides a critique of Whiteman and Coopers argument and explores the ways in which, at the same time as it is purportedly represented, indigenous thought is masked and thereby subverted. We argue that much of their theorizing - as in so much anthropological accounting - is rooted in neocolonial thought and despite the authors' claims, a so-called 'indigenous land ethic' has limited, if any, relevance to current management theory and practice. This is because such a land ethic is disembedded from the indigenous consciousness of their own economic, social and political history; and similarly for its reception requires a similar disembeddedness in the receiving culture - which then applies a loose analogy or even caricature of indigenous behaviour to its own practices. Such a consciousness remains, therefore, unreflexively embedded in its own neocolonialism. We argue that these problems are not confined to Whiteman and Coopers work, but are, to a greater or lesser degree, found in a wide range of anthropological accounts and constitute a problem with which the field is still struggling. To import these features into organizational theorizing without recognizing the deeply problematic nature of contemporary anthropological practice can only produce a reductionist and romanticized picture of native ontologies.

ID HONG-KONG; POLITICS; GOVERNANCE
AB Much recent analysis of the political economy of development in East Asia focuses on questions of market liberalization and the adequacy of the international institutions involved in the economic crisis of the 1990s. Focusing on political institutions, this article urges an emphasis on liberal constitutionalism as a long-term strategy. Authoritarian regimes with markets and currencies that were protected fared reasonably well. Democracies with liberal institutions were resilient. The combination of authoritarian developmental ism and market liberalization fared the worse. But authoritarian developmental ism is not sustainable. Constitutionalism, if properly conceived, may provide the institutional reliability and accountability upon which sustained development depends.

TI Participatory groundwater management in Jordan: Development and analysis
   of options

AB Groundwater over-exploitation has been on the rise in Jordan. Competing demands have grown in the face of perennial water shortages, a situation which has been exacerbated by drought conditions in the past decade. This paper reports findings of a project in which management options to address over-exploitation were developed for one of Jordan's principal aquifer systems, the Amman-Zarqa Basin. Options for addressing the situation were developed through a participatory approach that involved government officials and various public and private sector interest groups. Particular efforts were made to involve well irrigators, who are likely to be heavily impacted by the changes required to reduce groundwater pumping to a sustainable level. With information obtained from a rapid appraisal survey as well as from interviews with farmers, community groups, government officials, and technical experts, an extensive set of options was identified for evaluation. Based on integrated hydrogeologic, social, and economic analysis, five complementary management options were recommended for implementation. These included the establishment of an Irrigation Advisory Service, buying out farm wells, placing firm limits on well abstraction and irrigated crop areas, exchanging treated wastewater for groundwater, and measures to increase the efficiency of municipal and industrial water use. Various combinations and levels of these options were grouped in scenarios, representing possible implementation strategies. The scenarios were designed to assist decision makers, well owners and other stakeholders in moving gradually towards a sustainable abstraction regime. Social and economic aspects of each option and scenario were analyzed and presented to stakeholders, together with a summary of legal, institutional and environmental ramifications. Combining scientific analysis with a participatory approach in the Amman Zarqa Basin groundwater management was devised as a prototype to be used in the management of other groundwater basins in Jordan. This participatory management approach would also be useful in other parts of the world that are experiencing similar groundwater over-exploitation problems.

AB The aim of this paper is to use an economic framework to derive decision making rules for river basin management with a focus on groundwater resources. Using an example from northern Nigeria, the paper provides an example of how decision making for sustainable water resources management may be facilitated by comparing net benefits and costs across a river basin. It is argued that economic tools can be used to assess the value of water resources in different uses, identify and analyze management scenarios, and provide decision rules for the sustainable use and management of surface and ground water resources in the region.

   management; water policy; water conservation; sustainability
AB Substantial progress has been made within central Arizona in moving towards a more sustainable water future, particularly in transitioning the urban demand from a primarily nonrenewable groundwater-based supply(1) to increasing dependence on the Colorado River, Salt River and effluent. Management efforts include a wide range of regulatory and voluntary programs which have had mixed success. The Department of Water Resources has learned a number of key lessons throughout the years, and this paper attempts to establish the water management context and identify those lessons for the benefit of others who may want to evaluate alternative approaches to groundwater management. Themes to be discussed include evaluating water management approaches in a public policy context, the effectiveness of alternative management approaches and the relative merits of regulatory vs. nonregulatory efforts, and the importance of high-quality data in making management decisions.

AB This study presents the establishment of sustainable development and management policies for the Kucuk Menderes River Basin aquifer system in western Turkey. Geological, hydrogeological, and geophysical data are used conjunctively to define various hydrogeological units and their geometry. Distributions of hydraulic-parameter values and recharge are estimated by geostatistical methods and hydrologic simulations, respectively. A finite-difference groundwater flow model is used to represent the unconfined flow in the aquifer system. The model has been calibrated under steady state and transient conditions. The resulting model was used to test seven management scenarios for a planning period of 21 years to determine the so-called safe yield and sustainable yield of the aquifer system and to investigate the potential impacts of four planned surface water reservoirs on groundwater resources in the basin. The results demonstrate that the continuation of the present pumping rates exceeds both the safe yield and the sustainable yield of the aquifer system. Consequently, the growing need for irrigation water should be met by the construction of the planned surface water reservoirs and the implementation of efficient water management policies and plans.

AB The Quaternary Aquifer of the North China Plain is one of the world's largest aquifer systems and supports an enormous exploitation of groundwater, which has reaped large socio-economic benefits in terms of grain production. farming employment and rural poverty alleviation. together with urban and industrial water-supply provision. Both population and economic activity have Grown markedly in the past 25 years. Much of this has been heavily dependent upon groundwater resource development. which has encountered increasing difficulties in recent years primarily as a result of aquifer depletion and related phenomena. This paper focuses upon the hydrogeologic and socio-economic diagnosis of these groundwater resource issues, and identifies strategies to improve groundwater resource sustainability.

ID DRINKING-WATER; BANGLADESH
AB Contamination of groundwater by arsenic from natural geochemical sources is at present a most serious challenge in the planning of large-scale use of groundwater for drinking and other purposes. Recent improvements in detection limits of analytical instruments are allowing the correlation of health impacts such as cancer with large concentrations of arsenic in groundwater. However. there are at present no known large-scale technological solutions for the millions of people-mostly rural-who are potentially affected in developing countries. An overall framework of combating natural resource degradation is combined with case studies from Chile. Mexico. Bangladesh and elsewhere to arrive at a set of strategic recommendations for the global, national and local dimensions of the arsenic "crisis". The main recommendations include: the need for flexibility in the elaboration of any arsenic mitigation strategy, the improvement and large-scale use of low-cost and participatory ground-water quality testing, techniques, the need to maintain consistent use of key lessons learned worldwide in water supply and sanitation and to integrate arsenic as just one other factor in providing a sustainable water supply, and the following of distinct but communicable tracks between arsenic-related developments and enhanced, long-term, sustainable water supplies.

ID SOLID INSULATION; ARAMID FIBERS; GROWTH
AB The technique of pre-stressing electrical insulation by the inclusion of fibers in tension during the curing process has been used to establish a region of balancing compressive stress adjacent to the fibers and through which growing electrical trees have to pass. It has been known for many years that compressive stress has a retarding effect on tree growth (and tensile stress has an accelerating effect). The compressive stress, therefore, set up due to pre-stressing decelerates tree growth and long treeing times have been observed. Room temperature cured epoxy resin readily demonstrates the pre-stressing phenomenon but, as a result of its relatively low glass transition temperature, it is unable to sustain the pre-stress at temperatures in excess of 40degreesC. Post curing at 100degreesC raises the glass transition temperature and although a greater initial fiber tension is required to produce the same degree of pre-stress, the pre-stress is subsequently sustainable at temperatures up to and beyond 80degreesC. This has been demonstrated by the determination of the remnant stress in the cast-in fibers using Raman spectroscopy and by the enhanced treeing times observed in high temperature cured samples.

AB Exergy analysis is shown to be an important tool for achieving sustainable development. By noting that energy can never be "lost," as it is conserved according to the first law of thermodynamics, while exergy can be lost due to internal irreversibilities, the study suggests that exergy losses, particularly due to the use of nonrenewable energy forms, should be minimized to attain sustainable development. Furthermore, several key thermodynamic concepts and the potential usefulness of exergy analysis are discussed, the linkages between exergy and environmental impact and sustainable development are introduced; and several key issues regarding sustainability and its consequences are addressed. Several case studies highlight the insights revealed using exergy and exergetic aspects of sustainability. It is concluded that the potential usefulness of exergy analysis in addressing sustainability issues and solving environmental problems is substantial.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GREEN ENERGY

   building; hybrid HVAC system; heat pump; wind energy
AB Heating and air-conditioning systems have very low exergetic efficiency as they dissipate primary energy resources at low temperatures usually between 90 and 60 degrees C. This compounds the problem that buildings spend approximately 30% of all the energy consumed in the U.S. for heating and air-conditioning. The overall result is a large entropy production and long-term environmental degradation that can be resolved only by substituting primary energy resources by low-temperature, waste, or alternative energy resources, usually available below 50 degrees C. For such a replacement to be feasible the environmental cost of exergy production must be factored into calculations and compatible HVAC systems must be developed without any need for temperature peaking or equipment oversizing. This article addresses environmental and often-conflicting problems associated with exergy production by HVAC systems and presents an analytical optimization and control algorithm. Results indicate that when a careful design optimization is accompanied by a dynamic control of the split between radiant and convective means of satisfying thermal HVAC loads, exergy efficient sustainable buildings may be cost effective and environmentally benign.

AB An external ultrasound system was developed for the heating of subcutaneously implanted tumours in small animals. This small animal hyperthermia ultrasound system (SAHUS) was designed to be compatible with a microPET (small animal positron emission tomography) scanner to facilitate studies of hyperthermia effects on tumour hypoxia. Collimation and localization of energy deposition, a specific goal for the new device to avoid regional and/or systemic heating of small animals, was demonstrated using thermoradiography following high-power short-time heating of a layered gel phantom. The in vivo heating capabilities of the SAHUS were tested using PC3 cell line tumours (2000-2700 mm(3)) grown in the lateral proximal thighs of Nu-/Nu- nuBR nude mice. Intratumour temperatures were recorded during heating trials with deep and superficial interstitial thermocouples. The experimental data showed that the SAHUS could produce hyperthermia in 8 +/- 2 mm diameter tumours in small animals to a target temperature of 41.5degreesC and maintain it within a narrow temperature range (+/-0.3degreesC) for up to 4 h without raising the core temperature of the animals. PET imaging studies, data to be published separately, were conducted before and during SAHUS-induced hyperthermia. Both devices performed as expected and there was no significant decrease in image quality. In this paper, the new SAHUS is described and data from phantom and in vivo experiments presented.

AB Purpose: To test the hypothesis that breast cancer patients could have a predisposing defect in the induction of TP53 tumor suppressor protein (known as p53) that could be a marker of genetic instability and increased cancer susceptibility. The accumulation of p53 was triggered by ionizing radiation, and its transcriptional activity was estimated from the induction of CDKN1A (known as p21).
   Methods and Materials: Using Western blot, we studied the radiation induction of p53 and p21 proteins in 28 fibroblast cell strains derived from 7 healthy donors (Control), 3 ataxia telangiectasia (AT), 3 AT heterozygous, and 15 breast cancer patients. Contact-inhibited plateau phase cells were irradiated with 6 Gy, and proteins were assessed 3, 6, and 24 h later.
   Results: The control group showed a high induction of p53 at 3 h postirradiation followed by a relative decrease at 6 h, and approached the basal level at 24 h. This was associated with a parallel induction in p21. The response of fibroblasts derived from the breast cancer group was not significantly different from the control. Similar results were obtained with the AT heterozygous group at 3 It postirradiation; however, sustainable increase in p53 and p21 induction was observed at 24 h. AT cells showed a statistically significant highly reduced accumulation of p53 and a delayed and reduced induction of p21 (p less than or equal to 0.05). Furthermore, a correlation was observed between these two proteins at the 3-h induction point, confirming the high dependence of p21 on p53.
   Conclusion: Although severe deficiency in p53 and p21 induction was observed in fibroblasts derived from the cancer-prone AT syndrome, these results do not support the assumption that breast cancer patients have a predisposing defective induction in these proteins after ionizing irradiation.

AB There is no routine prenatal screening for sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in pregnancy in Samoa. Testing for chlamydial infection is not available. To gather information on pregnant women, a prevalence survey was conducted in Apia, Samoa, utilizing two prenatal hospital clinics. Pregnant (n = 427) women were tested for Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis and Trichomonas vaginalis using polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and for syphilis (n = 441) by rapid plasmid reagin (RPR) and HIV (n = 441) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Results were: chlamydia 30.9% (132); trichomoniasis 20.8%; gonorrhoea 3.3%; syphilis 0.5%; and HIV 0%. Overall 42.7% had at least 1 STD. Young women aged < 25 years were three times more likely to have a STD than older women (odds ratio = 3.0, 95% confidence intervals 2.0, 4.5). The lack of inexpensive, reliable field diagnostics remain a barrier to sustainable STD control programmes for pregnant women living in developing countries.

AB Background: There is a continuing need to evaluate sustainable interventions for prevention of mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of HIV type 1. We evaluated different concentrations (0.25%, 1%, and 2%) of chlorhexidine (CHX) for perinatal maternal and infant washes to identify the maximum tolerable concentration of CHX for such an intervention.
   Methods: Women were enrolled during their third trimester at the maternity unit of the Chris Ham Baragwanath Hospital in Soweto, South Africa, and perinatal maternal and infant washes were completed. Subjective maternal symptoms as well as infant examinations were used to assess tolerability of the washes.
   Results: The 0.25% concentration of CHX was well tolerated by the mothers (n = 29). Ten of 79 women (13%) with 1% CHX washes complained of mild vaginal area burning or itching, and washes were stopped in 5 (6%). Twenty-three of 75 women (31%) in the 2% CHX wash group had subjective complaints, and the washes were stopped in 12 (16%). There were no clinical indications of toxicity of the CHX washes among infants.
   Conclusion: A 1% solution of CHX appears to be a safe and tolerable concentration of CHX for consideration in an MTCT prevention trial.

AB Background. The gap between nursing research and practice is readily acknowledged in literature, with a variety of strategies suggested for reducing this gap. It is necessary not only to address problems of research implementation in practice, but also to find strategies that strengthen the influence of practitioners on research agendas through more collaborative relationships in order to have an impact on care of patients. A multi-centre research project was therefore initiated by two universities and three health care facilities, aiming to improve quality of care for patients with advanced cancer through a knowledge-exchange programme between nurse researchers, practitioners and students.
   Aim. The aim of this article is to explore how clinical staff reason about care provision for patients with advanced cancer, through analysis of 20 focus group discussions conducted with staff in three different health care facilities in two Swedish cities. An initial analysis based on grounded theory was complemented with consideration of the interactive process in the focus group discussions, and carried out by a team consisting of senior nurse researchers, clinical experts and nursing instructors.
   Findings. The findings of the focus group discussions emphasize the complexity of caregiving for patients with advanced cancer. The tension between caregiving ideals and limits imposed by the realities of caregiving in today's health system were striking. Practitioners discussed the organization of care, different constellations of relationships between patients, family members and professionals, and theoretical and experiential knowledge as equally important aspects in dealing with all concrete situations in daily practice. The importance of reflective practice, use of self and ethical reasoning also permeated the focus group discussions.
   Conclusions. These findings highlight an integrated need both to influence organizational structures and working relationships, along with increasing knowledge, if sustainable change is to be effected.

AB Intensive irrigated rice system is the most important food production system in the world. Continued population growth necessitates increased rice production to meet the increased need of food production through increased rice productivity to ensure food security. In contrast, the recent slowdown in yield growth in intensive irrigated rice-based cropping systems as a result of deterioration of soil health and decline in productivity level is a serious cause for concern. The objective of this research was to investigate the soil organic carbon (SOC) build-up and its dynamics in rice-rice cropping system by including a green manure (GM) crop Sesbania rostrata Berm. either during fallow and/or intercrop at 4 : 1 ratio as additive series without changing rice geometry. The results revealed that there is a gradual build-up of SOC when S. rostrata included and in situ incorporated at flowering stage as a basic means of improving soil quality in rice-rice cropping system. Further, the soil organic matter fractions viz. humic acid and fulvic acid were also improved in all GM-incorporated systems. In general, the proportion of fulvic acid was higher than humic acid. Cropping system involving three GMs viz. S. rostrata-rice/S. rostrata-rice/S. rostrata registered significantly higher SOC and was 10.63 percent higher than traditional rice-rice cropping system (A(1)). This was followed by S. rostrata-rice/S. rostrata-rice system. Although the traditional rice-rice cropping system (A(1)) also conserved SOC (0.29 and 1.69 % higher than initial during first and second annual cropping cycle, respectively), the magnitude was very low. Repeated application of S. rostrata as GM improved SOC, which formed the basis for sustainable management of soil resources. It can be concluded that S. rostrata would affect the rate of loss of SOC in cropping systems and its ultimate level in soils.

AB 1. The demise of tropical rain forests will lead to a large-scale extinction of genetic diversity, particularly of arthropods. Curtailing these trends might be facilitated by (i) reducing rates of habitat loss and degradation, (ii) enhancing systematics and (iii) increasing the flow of primary information on tropical biodiversity.
   2. We emphasize the need to examine alternative approaches that could generate a constant stream of data from tropical ecosystems. We argue that data collecting by parataxonomists (local assistants trained by professional biologists) represents one of the most efficient approaches to the study of tropical ecosystems available to date.
   3. Parataxonomists can provide high-quality biological specimens and ecological information; statistical power will be high due to large sample sizes of data; database growth will be rapid and results will be published in a timely manner; and there will be collateral education of local people in conservation biology by the parataxonomists themselves.
   4. We stress that training local parataxonomists to inventory and monitor biodiversity is a promising and efficient strategy that deserves more attention in conservation biology. In particular, it may be one of the most feasible approaches for the biological monitoring of small and cryptic organisms in species-rich environments, such as invertebrates in tropical rain forests.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Permanent botanical plots yield a wealth of data on the organization of tropical forests, and their numbers should be increased to monitor tropical biodiversity. Likewise, augmenting the number of local parataxonomist groups in various tropical countries and networking these contingents to monitor functionally diverse taxa may provide an efficient biological monitoring system in tropical forests.

AB 1. A parataxonomist is a resident, field-based, biodiversity inventory specialist who is largely on-the-job trained out of the rural work force and makes a career of providing specimens and their natural history information to the taxasphere, and therefore to a multitude of users across society.
   2. Any large inventory effort will benefit from a team of parataxonomists, not only through the large quantity of material and information they will gather and process, but through its among-year and within-season continuity.
   3. Parataxonomists' accuracy increases substantially with pride of workplace ownership, experience, and detail and continuity of iterative feedback from users of specimens and information.
   4. Being drawn from the pool of rural workers into activities that are normally the privilege of university-educated citizens, parataxonomists require continuous mentoring and encouragement to compensate for their potential social isolation from their former peer groups and the defensive disdain with which they may be treated by more elevated social classes.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Parataxonomists are a key element in setting up wild biodiversity for non-damaging sustainable development, not only through finding and making biodiversity available, but also by being employed locally by its development. The parataxonomist is to the neighbouring forest as both a literate person and a reference librarian are to a library.

AB This paper presents a new systematic procedure to help process designers synthesizing a separation process that is economically efficient and environmentally sustainable. The proposed methodology is a hybrid method consisting of algorithmic and heuristic processing of symbolic and numeric data. The heuristic approach, applying experience-based rules and thermodynamic insights for selection of separation operations, is used to reduce the complexity and size of synthesis search space. The algorithmic approach using mathematical modeling is then used to formulate and solve the remaining problem. All environmental impacts are evaluated through all input and output of process and product life cycles. All criteria are simultaneously considered, and the multi-criteria optimization problem, which is formulated using existing computer-aided molecular design and selection tools, and computer-aided process design and analysis techniques, is solved to construct a trade-off set. The constructed trade-off set is then further analyzed to select a promising solution. The proposed methodology is implemented using available software tools. Application of developed methodology is illustrated in a case study. We investigate process for phenol recovery from wastewater. This process is used in phenolic-resin manufacturing. The developed methodology can select solutions that are minimal environmental impacts at a desired economic performance.

AB We have been studying the reduction of carbonyl compounds by using heterogeneous catalysts in the liquid phase. The reducing reagents were simple primary or secondary alcohols, e.g. 2-propanol. The supported Sn and Zr oxides catalysts were active and selective for the reduction of crotonaldehyde (C-4-unsaturated aldehyde: CH3CH=CHCHO) to crotyl alcohol (the corresponding unsaturated alcohol: CH3CH=CHCH2OH) with 2-propanol or 2-butanol as a reducing reagent. The reaction proceeded via hydrogen transfer from alcohol to carbonyl compounds. The reagent, 2-propanol, was converted to only acetone, which could be regenerated by a simple hydrogenation reaction over a conventional metallic catalyst. Silica and MCM-41 supports were superior to TiO2 and Al2O3 for the reaction. This suggests that the surface of porous support should be inert for the hydrogen transfer reaction. The reduction of the Sn catalysts in H-2 was necessary for the reaction. The Sn and Zr oxide catalysts were available to the selective reduction of cinnamaldehyde, acrolein, leaf aldehyde, and acetophenone. The corresponding alcohols were selectively formed over the supported Sn and Zr oxide catalysts. The hydrogen transfer reaction will provide various unsaturated alcohols in high selectivity without toxic reducing agents. These results indicate that the hydrogen transfer reaction is one of the Green Sustainable Processes for the production of various alcohols.

   STRATEGY
AB Over three billion people are currently micronutrient (i.e. micronutrient elements and vitamins) malnourished, resulting in egregious societal costs including learning disabilities among children, increased morbidity and mortality rates, lower worker productivity, and high healthcare costs, all factors diminishing human potential, felicity, and national economic development. Nutritional deficiencies (e.g. iron, zinc, vitamin A) account for almost two-thirds of the childhood death worldwide. Most of those afflicted are dependent on staple crops for their sustenance. Importantly, these crops can be enriched (i.e. 'biofortified') with micronutrients using plant breeding and/or transgenic strategies, because micronutrient enrichment traits exist within their genomes that can to used for substantially increasing micronutrient levels in these foods without negatively impacting crop productivity. Furthermore, 'proof of concept' studies have been published using transgenic approaches to biofortify staple crops (e.g. high beta-carotene 'golden rice' grain, high ferritin-Fe rice grain, etc). In addition, micronutrient element enrichment of seeds can increase crop yields when sowed to micronutrient-poor soils, assuring their adoption by farmers. Bioavailability issues must be addressed when employing plant breeding and/or transgenic approaches to reduce micronutrient malnutrition. Enhancing substances (e.g. ascorbic acid, S-containing amino acids, etc) that promote micronutrient bioavailability or decreasing antinutrient substances (e.g. phytate, polyphenolics, etc) that inhibit micronutrient bioavailability, are both options that could be pursued, but the latter approach should be used with caution. The world's agricultural community should adopt plant breeding and other genetic technologies to improve human health, and the world's nutrition and health communities should support these efforts. Sustainable solutions to this enormous global problem of 'hidden hunger' will not come without employing agricultural approaches.

SO JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY

DT Article
DE CCA; DCA; diversity indices; fish assemblages; lowland river; oxbow lake
AB Four oxbow lakes and two neighbouring sections of their parent Warta River (Odra River system, Poland) were sampled to investigate differences in fish assemblages between habitats in 1999-2000. Additional comparisons were made with 12 other oxbow lakes in this section of the river that were sampled 30-40 years ago. Downstream of a man-made reservoir, higher species number, diversity and evenness were recorded in oxbow lakes than in the river channel. Upstream of the reservoir, differences in these variables from both habitats were insignificant. Fluvial and stagnant water samples were clearly separated in the multivariate space of a detrended correspondence analysis (DCA). For two oxbow lakes and two neighbouring sections of the Warta River, 12 abiotic and biotic environmental variables were available, and only velocity, water temperature and conductivity were significantly correlated with canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) axes. Fish assemblages of four recently investigated oxbow lakes were clearly separated in the multivariate space of DCA from other neighbouring oxbows sampled 30-40 years ago. Species previously subdominant were becoming rare. Oxbow lakes that are continuously or at least periodically connected with the channel are indispensable for maintaining high biodiversity and a sustainable fishery in the river system.

TI Better governance in academic health sciences centres: moving beyond the
   Olivieri/Apotex Affair in Toronto
SO JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ETHICS
LA English
DT Article
ID INTIMATE EXAMINATIONS; STUDENTS
AB The Toronto experience suggests that there may be several general lessons for academic health sciences complexes to learn from the Olivieri/Apotex affair (OAA) regarding the ethics, independence, and integrity of clinical research sponsored by for profit enterprises. From a local perspective, the OAA occurred when there already was a focus on the complex and changing relationships among the University of Toronto, its medical school, the fully affiliated teaching hospitals, and off campus faculty because of intertwined interests and responsibilities. The OAA became a catalyst that accelerated various systemic reforms, particularly concerning academic/industry relations. In this article, the evolving governance framework for the Toronto academic health sciences complex is reviewed and these policy and process reforms discussed. These reforms have created collaborative activity among research ethics boards and contract research offices of the partner institutions, and allowed the joint university/hospital ethics centre to play a role in governance and policy, while respecting the missions and mandates of the involved institutions. Although few of the policies are dramatically innovative, what is arguably novel is the elaboration of an overarching governance framework that aims to move ethics to a central focus in the academic complex. Time alone will tell how sustainable and effective these changes are.

AB The most sustainable way to eradicate iron deficiency is through food fortification. Elemental iron powders are commonly utilized as fortificants due to their low cost and few sensory problems. However, their bioavailability is unknown. Our goals were to measure the bioavailability of elemental iron in Mexican style corn masa flour tortillas and to evaluate the effects of Na(2)EDTA. We used a stable isotope of H-2-reduced iron powder, with and without Na(2)EDTA in tortillas prepared with corn masa flour. Two groups of 5- to 7-y-old children (n = 12/group) were fed tortillas to which was added 3 mg/100 g of H-2-reduced Fe-58 with a mean particle size of 15 mum. In one group, Na(2)EDTA was incorporated at a ratio of 1:2 mol/mol. The next day, Fe-57 ascorbate was given as a reference dose. After 14 d, blood samples were analyzed for isotopic enrichment. When normalized to 40% absorption of the reference dose, the geometric mean (+/- range 1 SD) bioavailability of reduced iron in tortilla was 3.8% (2.7-5.3). The addition of Na(2)EDTA, tended to increase it [P = 0.18) to 5.1% (2.8-9.2). This observed low absorption was compounded by the use of iron isotopes with smaller particle size (mean diameter 15 mum) than typical of commercial elemental iron powder (<45 &mu;m). We conclude that H-2-reduced iron powder is an ineffective fortificant in corn tortillas.

A new account of the implications of John Rawls's political liberalism for the 'basic structure' of education is developed. The prima facie incompatibility of political liberalism and the promotion of an environmental ethic is misleading. Rawls's political liberalism requires-as a matter of intergenerational justice-the promotion of the 'sustainability virtues'. Moreover, it permits the promotion of 'greener' ideals.

AB Nowadays, energetic needs are mainly covered by fossil energies leading to pollutant emissions mostly responsible for global warming. Among the different possible solutions for the greenhouse effect reduction, hydrogen has been proposed for energy transportation. Indeed, H-2 can be seen as a clean and efficient energy carrier. However, beside the difficulties related to hydrogen production, efficient high capacity storage is still to be developed. Hydrogen can be stored as a compressed gas, in liquefied tanks or absorbed in solids. Many metals and alloys are able to store large amounts of hydrogen. This latter solution is of interest in terms of safety, global yield and long time storage. However, to be suitable for applications, such compounds must present high capacity, good reversibility, fast reactivity and sustainability. In this paper, we will review on the structural and thermodynamic properties of metallic hydrides. Their solid-gas hydrogenation behaviour and the related absorption-desorption isotherm curves are examined as a useful criterion for the selection of suitable materials for applications. The storage performances obtained with these alloys are reported and some solutions to common problems such as corrosion, passivation, decrepitation, poor kinetic and short cycle life are discussed.

AB Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) has been evolving from a sectoral policy of farm commodity support into an integrated policy for rural development and environmental enhancement. Rural development policy is closely linked to two concepts: diversity (multifunctionality) and sustainability as achieving optimal diversity at community level is a key in the rural development problem. In this paper rural development at community level and the impact of support redistribution, resulting from recent CAP reforms, are analyzed in the framework of privately provided public goods. It is shown that CAP support. redistribution can importantly impact rural community development and household welfare, conditional on households' technology (opportunity costs) of contributing to development, their current levels of contribution, and the form of community development function.

DT Article
ID OXIDE FUEL-CELL; HYDROGEN-SULFIDE; CATALYSTS
AB A high-performance composite anode has been developed for H2S-air solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs). The anode design is based on the requirements of three-phase boundary theory. The anode material comprises a mixture of composite metal sulfide (Mo-Ni-S) catalyst prepared from MoS2 and NiS (1: 1 weight ratio), admixed with up to 10% each of Ag as electronic conductor and yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) as ionic conductor. The optimum composition is about 90 wt % Mo-Ni-S, 5 wt % Ag, and 5 wt % YSZ. A fuel cell using a 0.2 mm thick YSZ membrane produced a maximum sustainable current density over 480 mA cm(-2) at 750 degreesC and over 800 mA cm(-2) at 850 degreesC, and maximum power density 50 mW cm(-2) at 750 degreesC and over 200 mW cm(-2) at 850 degreesC.

TI Specific difference in photorespiration activity in C4 subtype plants
   and its relationship with drought tolerance of leaf photosynthesis
SO JOURNAL OF THE FACULTY OF AGRICULTURE KYUSHU UNIVERSITY
LA English
DT Article
ID TRANSPORT
AB Carbon dioxide gas exchange rate (CER), stomatal conductance (Gs), and photosystem II quantum yield (Phi(e)) were measured with three C4 subtype plants, corn (Zea mays L., NADP-ME type), common millet (Panicum miliaceum L., NAD-ME type), guineagrass (Panicum maximum Jacq., PEP-CK type) and a C3 type plant, mung bean (Vigna radiata L.) grown in droughts. The specific difference in drought tolerance in photosynthesis was discussed in relation to their photorespiratory activity. The C4 plants were superior to mung bean in both photosynthetic sustainability in droughts and photosynthetic recovery under re-watering after droughts. CER and Phi(e) of corn showed a large reduction with a lenient decrease in leaf water potential (Psi(L)) compared to those of the other two subtypes. In both guineagrass and common millet Phi(e) was sustained at a relatively higher level when their CER was decreased in droughts. A similar specific feature to this was found in leaves measured in the air with low CO2 concentrations. This may suggest that there is an inter-subtype difference in photorespiration activity. Having a higher photorespiration activity is regarded as a cause for guineagrass and common millet to have superiority in drought tolerance. The inter-subtype difference in photorespiration activity was also able to be estimated from Phi(e) of film-sealed leaves.

AB The water diversion project from south to north, which is under construction in the East Diversion Route and that of the Middle and West Diversion Routes which are to be started in the near future, will substantially alleviate the acute shortage of water resources in the northern area and will realize the optimal allocation of water resources in China. The Nansi (South Four) Lakes Basin in Shandong Province as the hydraulic hinge of the Eastern Route Project under construction during the period 2001-2010 will receive water downstream of the Yangtze River and divert it to the Tianjin area, Shandong and Hebei provinces. However, the water is heavily polluted at present, rendering it unsuitable as a drinking water source. An integrated water management strategy of around 4 billion Yuan RMB or about US$49 million for the construction of municipal wastewater treatment plants and sewerage systems to combat point source pollution has been drawn up for the Nansi Lakes Basin in China. The scheme pays attention to non-point source pollution control and water reclamation and reuse, to ensure that the project of diverting water from south to north performs adequately, as well as to pave a way for sustainable development.

AB The Wallerawang colliery, located 15 km north of Lithgow in the western coalfields of NSW, utilised a coal fines briquetting (agglomeration) process to aid in site rehabilitation. The project was used to establish a void of approximately 200 000 m(3) for the burial of sulfidic (acid producing) coarse washery reject by turning a waste material into power station fuel. The briquetting process utilised a double roll press to produce approximately 70000 tonnes per annum of 50 mm diameter briquettes from drained coal tailings (fine coal washery reject) stored within the site tailings dam.
   To the best of our knowledge, a briquetting project for the reprocessing of coal tailings as a fuel for conventional power stations had not previously been successfully operated. With extensive energy resources stored within coal tailings dams worldwide and the difficulties sometimes encountered with tailings dam rehabilitation, the potential for the development and future use of this process is considered large. As such, the project represents an innovative example of the implementation of the principles of Cleaner Production and Ecologically Sustainable Development in the coal mining industry of New South Wales, Australia.

AB In 1998 the BGS, in collaboration with Tarmac, initiated an industrial mineral waste project known as REFILL which was funded by the EU BriteEuRam programme. BGS was responsible for the characterization of quarry waste from certain aggregate quarrying operations across the UK. During the work it became clear that there was little information available on the quantity and technical quality of mineral waste in the UK. Also, BGS assisted Tarmac in research work to find uses for the fines produced at a coastal aggregate quarry in southern Ireland.
   In 1999 BGS developed a further research project, known as 'Minerals from Waste', which was funded by the UK Government Department for International Development (DfID). This project aimed to improve the sustainability of mining communities by investigating the use of mineral waste as a source of construction and industrial minerals. The types of waste found in a range of extractive operations were reviewed. Case studies were carried out in Namibia and Costa Rica including investigations of the properties of the waste, mineral product evaluations, market and economic appraisals and social and environmental impact assessments of local communities. Overall, this work aimed to benefit not only mine and quarry engineers, but all those involved in the management of mine waste. (C) 2003 NERC. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The mountain ecosystems of Sri Lanka are now in crisis, with rap id degradation of the productive resource 4 base and the environment. There are unmistakable symptoms of unsustainability in current production practices and patterns of resource use in tea agroecosystems. The present study was undertaken with the overall objective of examining the sustainability of resource use, with special reference to the land management practices on tea plantations on the Uva highlands of Sri Lanka. Eight different tea plantation units were randomly selected for detailed study, representing a total area of 4548 ha. The information related to the management of the plantations was mainly collected from plantation records. The findings of the study confirmed that the ecological capital of the plantations is in a critical state. Private management companies have been exercising a strategy aimed at short-term profits by extracting higher yields with the aid of inorganic fertilizers and other agrochemicals. Hence activities such as replanting, infilling and bush management have been neglected. Shortage of skilled labor is a major threat to the future of the tea estates. An inter-estate analysis of the quality of the management of tea plantations indicated that most of the tea estates had become marginal. Longterm management plans need to be formulated and implemented in order to make the tea plantations ecologically and economically sustainable.

DE ecotype; native seed production; native plant materials enhancement;
   sustainable agriculture; ecotype education
AB Following settlement, Missouri lost over 99.4% of its original natural tallgrass ecosystem to human development and agriculture, resulting in the rapid decrease of most grassland wildlife species. Loss of diversity became an increasing concern of resident biologists and the agencies entrusted with the care and protection of the Missouri natural heritage. Many prairie restoration and natural area enhancement projects were possible but native seed from local sources was in short supply. A cooperative task force from several agencies initiated a program that would bridge the gap between the volume of seed produced and the volume of seed needed for conservation area management and broad-scale restoration efforts. Ecozones within state boundaries were defined based on climate and soil similarities. The primary goal of the Missouri Native Ecotype Program was to create a commercially available seed supply comprised of several native plant species developed from seed of local origin to fill the needs of conservation area managers and restorationists. By autumn 2004, the program will have 33 species developed as ecotypes from two predominantly prairie ecozones. In its sixth year, the program is providing technical and marketing assistance to ecotype seed producers, FFA chapters, and nursery owners throughout the state by offering hands-on workshops and printed materials, an interactive website, and one-on-one training.

   resources management; dense forest; forest; woodland
ID ACCURACY
AB Forest resources play a key role and provide many basic needs to communities in developing economies. To assess the patterns of vegetation cover change, as a corollary of resource utilization, satellite imagery, ground truth data, and image processing techniques can be useful. This article is concerned with identifying change in major vegetation types in East Timor between 1989 and 1999, using Landsat Thematic Mapper data. The results highlight a significant level of deforestation and decline in foliage cover. All major vegetation cover types declined from 1989 to 1999, and there was a sizeable increase in degraded woodlands. This decline has had considerable impact on the livelihoods of rural and urban communities. Causes for these changes include: economic exploitation of abundant resources; and implications of transmigration policies implemented during Indonesian rule, resulting in increased competition for land and woodland resources. As the new nation of Timor-Leste establishes itself it must consider its current stock and distribution of natural capital to ensure that development efforts are geared towards sustainable outcomes. Without the knowledge of historical patterns of resource consumption, development efforts may, unwittingly, lead to continuing decline in forest resources.

AB Inadequate trade policies, globalization of the fishing industry, dominance of Europe's distant waterfleets, declarations of exclusive economic zones (EEZs) by neighbouring West African nations, overfishing and a lack of good governance contributed to the decline of Ghana as a regional fishing nation, a position it had held since the 18(th) century. The prohibitive cost of access arrangements limited Ghana's access to distant waters. The country's marine environments have been impacted by overexploitation of stocks and the use of destructive methods. Subsistence fishing has become the sole means of survival for many fishers. The decline of the fishing sector has limited the country's ability to meet domestic demand and threatened the economic and food security of many Ghanaians.
   The article traces the early history of Ghana's fisheries, their gradual decline during the last four decades, and outlines recommendations for policy changes to address the situation and steer the nation on a course towards sustainable fisheries.

AB This article develops a practical proposal for progress on sustainable development law. It examines the prospects for an international sustainable development law to provide a framework for more effective, coherent governance. Sustainable development law is briefly defined and an analytical framework is provided. Different degrees of integration between economic, social and environmental law are described. Certain principles of international law related to sustainable development are also highlighted. It is argued that these principles may serve to guide law-makers and jurists where social, economic and environmental law and policy conflict or overlap. Continuing, underlying questions of sustainable development governance are addressed and its global frameworks analysed. The article also focuses on the 2002 World Summit on Sustainable Development, held in Johannesburg in August-September 2002, and its specific mandate for the United Nations Commission on Sustainable Development (UNCSD) to take related legal developments into account. The article advances a proposal: that governments, economic, social and environmental intergovernmental organizations and other actors establish a 'network of inquiry' with members from relevant groups, including legal and academic organizations, and other expert groups, in order to follow, research, analyse and debate legal developments in a balanced way.

AB Background and aim: Clinical governance is important. Clinical audit is part of clinical governance. The aim of this study was to perform a clinical governance exercise, and the reporting arrangements at an independent hospital provided the opportunity to do this over two phases between 1999 and 2002. Six physicians from four different UK National Health Service (NHS) trusts participated.
   Methods: Reports were shown anonymously to between two and five of the physicians who had not produced the report. Reports with at least one disagreement were reviewed by the group in order to reach concensus as to whether the disagreement was non-sustainable (NS), trivial (T) or non-trivial (NT), the last two, respectively, judged to make an insignificant or potentially significant impact on patient management.
   Results: In phase 1,239 audits were produced on 83 reports (2.9 per report), and in phase 2, 636 on 137 reports (4.6 per report). In phase 1, 14 (17%) reports attracted at least one disagreement (NS, five; T, four; NT, five). Of 239 audits, there were 20 disagreements of which five were NS. Moreover, nine audits agreed with a report with a NT disagreement, giving 14 suboptimal audits (5.9%). In phase 2, 80 (58%) reports attracted at least one disagreement (NS, 31 (P<0.003 vs phase 1); T, 35 (P<0.001); NT, 14 (P>0.05)). Of 636 audits, there were 153 disagreements, of which 37 were NS (P<0.05 vs phase 1). Twenty-five audits agreed with a report with a NT disagreement, giving 62 suboptimal audits (9.7%) (P>0.05). Overall, 19/220 reports (8.6%) were thought NT, an error rate comparable to reporting elsewhere in radiology. After phase 1, auditors became more aggressive but the quality of auditing tended to decline, as did the quality of reporting (although not significantly).
   Conclusion: This study provides a useful framework for monitoring performance. (C) 2004 Lippincott Williams Wilkins.

AB An understanding of the influence of soil management practices on the distribution, form and solubility of trace metals in soils is required to formulate appropriate guidelines for the applications of organic manures and inorganic fertilizers for sustainable soil fertility and environmental protection. The distribution, forms and solubility of Cu were investigated in a savanna soil under long- term cultivation and varying management practices which included fertilization with NPK, farmyard manure (FYM), NPK + FYM and a control which received neither NPK nor FYM for 50 years. Total Cu varied between 5 and 13 mg kg(-1). Long- term application of FYM and FYM + NPK significantly increased DTPA extractable Cu in the surface horizon, and in the subsurface horizon in FYM fertilized fields. Averaged across the sampling depths, cultivation and management history did not affect the concentration of DTPA extractable Cu, water- soluble Cu, organically complexed Cu and residual Cu. But fertilization with FYM and FYM + NPK significantly increased organically complexed Cu in the surface layer as compared to NPK fertilization. Solubility equilibria studies indicated that Cu2+ activities in soil solution approached an apparent equilibrium with cupric ferrite (CuFe2O4), suggesting that the control on Cu2+ solubility was either a CuFe2O4 or a Cu solid with solubility similar to cupric ferrite. The soil management practices involving combined application of inorganic fertilizers and farmyard manure did not seem to pose any risk of inducing Cu deficiency, but sole application of inorganic NPK poses such a risk.

TI Nitrogen fertilizer equivalencies of organics of differing quality and

DT Article

ID DECOMPOSITION; MANAGEMENT; HIGHLANDS; RELEASE; MAIZE
AB Decline in crop yields is a major problem facing smallholder farmers in Kenya and the entire Sub- Saharan region. This is attributed mainly to the mining of major nutrients due to continuous cropping without addition of adequate external nutrients. In most cases inorganic fertilizers are expensive, hence unaffordable to most smallholder farmers. Although organic nutrient sources are available, information about their potential use is scanty. A field experiment was set up in the sub- humid highlands of Kenya to establish the chemical fertilizer equivalency values of different organic materials based on their quality. The experiment consisted of maize plots to which freshly collected leaves of Tithonia diversifolia (tithonia), Senna spectabilis (senna) and Calliandra calothyrsus (calliandra) (all with % N > 3) obtained from hedgerows grown ex situ (biomass transfer) and urea (inorganic nitrogen source ) were applied. Results obtained for the cumulative above ground biomass yield for three seasons indicated that a combination of both organic and inorganic nutrient source gave higher maize biomass yield than when each was applied separately. Above ground biomass yield production in maize (t ha(-1) ) from organic and inorganic fertilization was in the order of senna + urea (31.2), tithonia + urea (29.4), calliandra + urea (29.3), tithonia (28.6), senna (27.9), urea (27.4), calliandra (25.9), and control (22.5) for three cumulative seasons. On average, the three organic materials (calliandra, senna and tithonia) gave fertilizer equivalency values for the nitrogen contained in them of 50, 87 and 118%, respectively. It is therefore recommended that tithonia biomass be used in place of mineral fertilizer as a source of nitrogen. The high equivalency values can be attributed to the synergetic effects of nutrient supply, and improved moisture and soil physical conditions of the mulch. However, for sustainable agricultural production, combination with mineral fertilizer would be the best option.

SO NUTRIENT CYCLING IN AGROECOSYSTEMS

AB The sustainability of agroforestry systems in Amazonia was assessed from their litter dynamics and decomposition. Litter fall and litter stocks were determined from July 1997 to March 1999 in four sites in central Amazonia: a primary rainforest, a 13- year- old secondary forest, and two sites of a polyculture forestry system which consisted of four planted tree species of commercial use amidst upcoming secondary growth. The average annual litter fall in the undisturbed primary rainforest (FLO) was 8.4 t ha(-1) year(-1), which is within the range of litter fall in other rainforests in the region. It was similar in one of the two polyculture sites ( 8.3 t ha(-1) year(-1) ), but lower in the secondary forest and in the second polyculture site. In the litter fall in secondary forest and agroforestry sites, the leaf portion was higher ( 76 - 82% of total litter fall ) than in FLO, due to reduced fine matter and wood fall. Leaf litter fall variability was much lower in the plantation sites than in the forests, which is explained by the much more homogeneous stand structure of the plantations. The quality of the produced litter, measured as C/ N ratio, differed significantly between the primary forest site and one polyculture and the secondary forest site. The cumulative input of nitrogen through litter fall was 144 kg ha(-1) year(-1) in FLO, and 91 - 112 kg ha(-1) year(-1) in the polycultures and the secondary forest. Litter fall was not correlated with soil parameters, but had a significant linear regression with canopy closure. For the primary rainforest, litter fall was also (inversely ) correlated with monthly rainfall. Litter fall was higher in the first year (1997 - 1998; an El Nino period) than in 1998 - 1999. Litter stocks on the forest floor were highest in the secondary forest (24.7 t ha(-1) ), and much lower in the polyculture sites (15.1 - 16.2 t ha(-1) ) and the primary forest (12.0 t ha(-1) ). There were no differences in the relative N content (C/ N ratio) of the litter stocks between the sites, but the larger stocks led to higher absolute N contents in the litter layer in the secondary forest. From the monthly values of litter stocks ( S ) and litter fall ( P ), the decomposition coefficient k(e) = P/ S was calculated, which was, on average, highest for the primary forest ( 0.059 ), followed by the polyculture systems ( 0.040 - 0.042 ), and by the secondary forest ( 0.024 ). Thus, due to low decomposition rates, the secondary forest site showed large litter accumulations in spite of a relatively low litter fall. In contrast, the primary forest showed high litter fall but low stocks, due to high decomposition rates. The decomposition coefficients of the polyculture systems ranged between the primary and the secondary forest. The reduced decomposition rates in the man- managed agroecosystems indicate quantitative and/ or qualitative changes in the decomposer communities of these systems that lead to a higher build- up of litter stocks on the forest floor. However, the decomposer systems in the polyculture sites still were more functional than in the site of non- managed secondary growth. Thus, from a soil biological viewpoint, ecologically sustainable low- input agroforestry in Amazonia will benefit from the application of these polyculture systems.

AB The concept of a minimal cell is discussed from the viewpoint of comparative genomics. Analysis of published DNA content values determined for 641 different archaeal and bacterial species by pulsed field gel electrophoresis has lead to a more precise definition of the genome size ranges of free-living and host-associated organisms. DNA content is not an indicator of phylogenetic position. However, the smallest genomes in our sample do not have a random distribution in rRNA-based evolutionary trees, and are found mostly in ( a) the basal branches of the tree where thermophiles are located; and (b) in late clades, such as those of Gram positive bacteria. While the smallest-known genome size for an endosymbiont is only 450 kb, no free-living prokaryote has been described to have genomes < 1450 kb. Estimates of the size of minimal gene complement can provide important insights in the primary biological functions required for a sustainable, reproducing cell nowadays and throughout evolutionary times, but definitions of the minimum cell is dependent on specific environments.

AB For some years now the Belarusian authorities have been making efforts to reduce the country's dependence on energy imports from Russia by means of energy-saving and decentralized forms of energy generation. Alternative and renewable sources of energy have played an important role. Thanks to these endeavours, Belarus is now the most energy-efficient state in the CIS. Even greater gains would be possible if state support for NGOs and private firms were to replace the current policy of relying largely on dirigiste methods. These are the actors with the greatest potential for innovation in the search for appropriate ways of using alternative and renewable forms of energy.

AB Soil labile (biologically active) organic carbon fractions under different crop rotation systems in Jiangsu Province, China, were investigated after 10 years of rotation. The rotation systems, including green manure-rice-rice (GmRR), wheat-rice-rice (WRR), wheat-rice (WR) and wheat/corn intercrop-rice (WCR) rotations, were established on paddy soils using a randomized complete block design with three replicates. The total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (TN) and water-soluble organic carbon (WSOC) in the soils under different systems were greater in the GmRR and WRR than in the WR and WCR rotation systems because the soils under triple cropping often received more crop residues than the soils under double cropping. Both the WSOC and the microbial biomass carbon (MBC) contents in the soils of the GmRR rotation system were significantly greater than those in the other crop rotation systems, which was due to the return of green manure to the fields of the GmRR rotation system. The results of a C-13 nuclear magnetic resonance (C-13-NMR) analysis indicated that the structural characteristics of soil WSOC were similar under the four crop rotation systems with carbohydrates and long-chain aliphatics being the major components. Correlation analysis showed that the content of the WSOC was positively correlated with that of the MBC (P < 0.01), and all had significantly positive correlations with TOC and TN. The coefficients of variation (CVs) for WSOC and WSOC/TOC were greater than the other indices (e.g, MBC, TOC and TN), suggesting that WSOC in the soils was more sensitive to these rotation systems. The results above indicated that the soil amended with green manure could not only increase the usable C source for soil microorganisms, but could also enhance soil organic matter content; hence, rotation with green manure would be a good strategy for sustainable agriculture.

AB Soil properties were investigated in sites where three succeeding generations of Chinese fir (Cunninghamia lanceolata (Lambert) Hooker) in Nanping, Fujian, China, were cultivated in order to show the impact of a repeated monoculture on site productivity. Compared with the first generation (FG) stand the soil structure deteriorated in the second generation (SG) and the third generation (TG) stands. For instance, the destruction rate of the peds increased by 55%-115% in the SG and the TG stands compared to the FG stand. Soil nutrient storage and nutrient availability also decreased in the SG and the TG stands. For surface soils of 0-20 cm, the organic matter content, total N and P, and available N and P decreased by 3%-20% relative to those in the FG stand. For many soil parameters, the differences between the FG stand and the SG and the TG stands were statistically significant (LSD test, P < 0.05). Furthermore, with each succeeding generation of Chinese fir, the total number of soil microbes declined, the soil enzyme activity weakened, and the soil biological activity decreased. In order to maintain sustainable site productivity, new silvicultural practices need to be developed for management of Chinese fir plantations.

AB Principal mental disorders affecting the geriatric population include dementia and depression. A lack of trophic support is thought to contribute to the pathology of these disorders. Physical activity and antidepressant treatment increase the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the young rat hippocampus. Herein, we investigated the responsiveness of the aging rat hippocampus to antidepressant treatment and voluntary exercise. In situ hybridization revealed that, in young animals, exercise, antidepressant treatment, or their combination elevated BDNF mRNA levels in several hippocampal regions, most notably in the CA3, CA4, and dentate gyrus (DG). This effect was rapid (detectable at 2 days) and sustainable to 20 days. In aged (22-month-old) rats, hippocampal responsiveness to antidepressant treatment and exercise was also rapid and sustainable, but evident mostly in the CA1 and CA2. Daily swimming also revealed that small amounts of activity led to marked elevations in hippocampal BDNF mRNA. The differences in regional patterns of BDNF mRNA elevations between young and aged animals observed with running were maintained with this different exercise modality. Our results indicate that the aged brain is responsive to exercise and antidepressant treatment, and changes in regional response patterns may reflect shifts in hippocampal physiology during the lifespan.

AB Previous analyses of a large ensemble of stock markets have demonstrated that a log-periodic power law (LPPL) behavior of the prices constitutes a qualifying signature of speculative bubbles that often land with a crash. We detect such a LPPL signature in the foreign capital inflow during the bubble on the US markets culminating in March 2000. We detect a weak synchronization and lag with the NASDAQ LPPL pattern. We propose to rationalize these observations by the existence of positive feedback loops between market-appreciation/increased-spending/increased-deficit-of-balance-of-payment/larger-foreip-surplus/increased-foreign-capital-inflows and so on. Our analysis suggests that foreign capital inflow has been following rather than causing the bubble.
   We then combine a macroeconomic analysis of feedback processes occurring between the economy and the stock market with a technical analysis of more than 200 years of the DJIA to investigate possible scenarios for the future, three years after the end of the bubble and deep into a bearish regime. We conclude that the low interest rates and depreciating dollar are the indispensable ingredients for a lower sustainable burden of the global US debt structure and for accompanied by a weak stock market on the medium term as the growing Federal deficit is consuming a large part of the foreign surplus dollars and the stock market is remaining a very risky and unattractive investment. Notwithstanding strong surge of liquidity in recent months orchestrated by the Federal Reserve, this macroeconomic analysis which incorporates an element of collective behavior is in line with our recent analyses of the bearish market that started in 2000 in terms of a LPPL "anti-bubble". We project this LPPL anti-bubble to continue at least for another year. On the short term, increased availability of liquidity (MI) and self-fulfilling bullish anticipations may hold the stock market for a while. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Allene oxide synthase (AOS) is a key enzyme for the biosynthesis of jasmonic acid (JA). We identified four AOS gene homologs, named OsAOS1-4, in the database of a japonica rice genome and cloned a full-length cDNA of OsAOS1. The analysis of deduced amino acid sequences indicated that only OsAOS1 has a chloroplast transit peptide among all the identified monocot AOSs including OsAOSs. We found that the transcripts of OsAOS1 and OsAOS4 are up-regulated by red and far-red light in seedling shoots. The response in OsAOS1 transcripts occurred rapidly and transiently, while the response in OsAOS4 transcripts was slower and more sustainable; the maximal enhancement was greater in OsAOS1 transcripts than in OsAOS4 transcripts. The transcript of OsAOS1 was also up-regulated transiently in response to wounding, as reported for dicot AOSs. No wound-induced enhancement occurred, however, in OsAOS4 transcripts. Our results also indicated that OsAOS1, responding to both light and wounding, is the most highly expressed of all the OsAOSs in seedling shoots. By using phyA mutants of rice, it was demonstrated that the photoregulation of the AOS transcript level is mediated by phytochrome. It is suggested that this transcriptional photoregulation participates in the phytochrome-mediated inhibition of rice coleoptile growth.

AB If social scientists are to provide a more useful contribution to international debates over population and environment, we must find ways to combine the insights of our competing theoretical traditions. Political economy, rational choice, and cultural institutionalist perspectives are each associated with a different assessment and characterization of the population "problem", as well as divergent strategies of response, prioritizing in turn the goals of equity, efficiency, and cultural identity. The principal argument of this paper is that these three perspectives, and the goals which they embody, are like the three legs of a stool; none is sufficient and each is necessary to uphold socially acceptable responses to population growth in the context of broader challenges of sustainability. Each perspective is reviewed in turn, distinguishing narrow and polarizing applications that trivialize the way social and economic systems rely on the natural environment from applications that are useful in fashioning a more integrated approach. The paper concludes with reflections on how this approach may support and enrich a focus on sustainable livelihoods in development planning.

DT Article
AB Last month a new sustainable energy centre opened in Beijing. It was formerly the Integer Hong Kong Pavilion, a unique British-inspired industry showcase for sustainable high-rise construction that attracted over 100 000 visitors during 2001 and 2002. The pavilion combines a multi-media exhibition and two demonstration apartments known as 'flats of the future'. It also demonstrates many examples of sustainable, low-waste construction techniques in its own design and construction not least its re-usability.

AB When Traffic in Towns I was published in 1963, the UK motor-vehicle fleet was probably as large a proportion of the world fleet as it has ever been or has been since. While motorisation had proceeded apace in North America in the 1930s, it had not really taken off elsewhere. The UK was one of the first countries outside the US to see a rapid burgeoning in motor-vehicle ownership after the Second World War, with the number of cars growing by 280% and road traffic by 190% between 1938 and 1963. In 1963, the UK road-vehicle fleet comprised almost 7% of the world total. Today it is a little over 4%. It is not surprising, therefore, that we saw the urban traffic-congestion problem as something that was characteristically British. Today, urban traffic-congestion from motor vehicles is to be found in many countries and, severe as our problems can be, it is in cities such as Bangkok, Mexico City, Cairo and Delhi where the largest incidences of urban traffic-congestion are to be found. This paper looks at urban travel in different parts of the world to see how the problems of actual and incipient mass-motorisation considered in Traffic in Towns I are manifesting themselves. It leans heavily on the work done in compiling the report Mobility 200 1: World Mobility at the End of the Twentieth Century and its Sustainability 2 for the World Business Council for Sustainable Development, produced by a team from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (to which the author was the senior transport consultant) and Charles River Associates, but the arguments and conclusions here are the responsibility of the author alone.

AB If human-environment geography is central to the discipline, then human-environment courses should be a sizable segment of the undergraduate curriculum. Undergraduate educational offerings are inadequate, however, meaning that geography departments are shortchanging their majors, missing opportunities to attract and inform the general student body, and failing to meet the needs of future K-12 educators. Unless geography provides satisfactory human-environment education, it will likely have much less impact on twenty-first-century environmental science.

DT Article
AB At the International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) that was held in Cairo, Egypt, in 1994, participants acknowledged that population, economic growth, and sustainable development are concepts that are closely linked, and important strides were made in terms of increased recognition of sexual and reproductive rights. The Programme of Action ratified at that Conference was adopted as a platform for designing national and international policies in the areas of population and development for a period of twenty years. However, in Latin America and the Caribbean all types of obstacles-financial, institutional, and human-still stand in the way of attaining the goals of the Programme of Action, and some governments have established measures that undermine their people's exercise of sexual and reproductive rights. The Caribbean Subregional Meeting to Assess the Implementation of the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development 10 Years after its Adoption was held in Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago, in November of 2003. At the meeting, which was attended by representatives from 20 Caribbean countries and territories, a call was made for more rational use of available resources and for mobilization of additional funds for developing and implementing population and development programs and policies in the Caribbean. The meeting also saw the approval of the Caribbean Declaration, which lays out the challenges that should serve as the roadmap for taking actions to consolidate the progress achieved so far and come closer to attaining the goals established by the ICPD. In the Declaration, the countries and territories of the Caribbean asserted their commitment to continue legislative reforms at the national level while seeking to enforce these reforms in an effort to ensure implementation of the ICPD's Programme of Action and of the Caribbean Plan of Action for Population and Development that was adopted in 1996 by the Economic Community for Latin America and the Caribbean.

DE goat industry; international trade development; goat milk; goat cheese;

AB Goats are considered to be very important for their contribution to the development of rural zones and people. In a fast changing world, this statement has to be confirmed by considering how the organisation of the goat industry can support sustainable development. The situation of each goat production (milk, meat, fibre and skin) was analysed and compared. Each economic factor and its role in the processes of production, transformation, and marketing were analysed by taking into account the present situation and prospects of markets. From this approach, the organisation of a goat milk sector appears to be very dependent on the existing competitive situation with the cow milk sector, since goat milk is generally still not widely sold but consumed locally. The sensory specificity of goat milk for cheese making has very different impacts depending on the taste of consumers in different countries. The dietary properties of goat milk are still discussed, and seem to have a positive effect on increasing the global demand. The fibre sectors are clearly global markets world-wide and a few buyers control a speculative and cyclic market, where many sellers are often disorganised small-scale farmers. Most of goat meat is consumed directly by the producer or locally, and only about 0.5% of the goat meat is officially traded internationally. World trade has risen quickly over the past decade with fast growing prices. The Mediterranean area is the main goat milk and goat cheese producer (18%) outside of India (22%), which has the greatest goat milk volume of all countries, but keeps mainly only dual purpose goats (meat and milk). Australia is the most important (60%) world goat meat exporting country, South Africa the major (50%) Mohair producer, and China the principal (65%) cashmere exporter. As the goat industry becomes step by step a truly significant economical sector, its real advantages cannot be over-estimated. The local initiatives to promote quality labels and innovative products for cheeses, meat and fibres could help goats in keeping a role for sustainable development in an eco-friendly environment all over the world. However, the future of the goat industry as a significant economic activity will also be very dependent on the standards of living in the countries where there is a market for the goat products.

ID IMPROVED LIVELIHOODS; PRODUCTIVITY
AB The objective of this paper is to contribute to progress in the choices of strategies for further development of goat farming in the 21st century. During the last 20 years, the number of goats around the world increased (by about 60%) not only in the countries with low income (75%) but also in those with high (20%) or intermediate (25%) income. This situation is due to the capacity for adaptation by goats to very different environments, to the development of goat farming in developing countries where subsistence farming, barter economy and community culture are important, and where the market economy is relatively limited, and to the ecological image of goat farming and products in developed countries. Goat farming is in a good position to pursue its development in the 2 1 st century, if a satisfactory policy is applied tactfully. For that, the factors explaining goat farming success during the end of the 20th century must be maintained and developed as the social aspects of goat farming in developing and developed countries, particularly in land management and the sociological integration into an economically sustainable life. Moreover we have to improve or maintain the good image of goat products. The two main improvements to bring into goat farming in the 2 1 st century concern research organisations, which must encounter the needs of goat farmers and be well adapted to different production systems in order to lower the research deficit in the goat sector, and investments for better supplies particularly to the poor goat farmers.

TI User fees at a public hospital in Cambodia: effects on hospital

AB User-fee programs have been introduced at health care facilities in many developing countries. Difficulties have been encountered, however, especially at public hospitals. This report describes the effects of user fees introduced in April 1997 at a public hospital, the National Maternal and Child Health Center (NMCHC) of Cambodia, on patient utilization, revenue and expenditure, quality of hospital services, provider attitudes, low-income patients, and the government, by reviewing hospital data, patient and provider surveys, and provider focus group discussions.
   Before the introduction of user fees, the revenue from patients was taken directly by individual staff as their private income to compensate their low income. After the introduction of user fees, however, revenue was retained by the hospital, and used to improve the quality of hospital services. Consequently, the patient satisfaction rate for the user-fee system showed 92.7%, and the number of outpatients doubled. The average monthly number of delivery of babies increased significantly from 319 before introduction of the system to 585 in the third year after the user-fee introduction, and the bed occupancy rate also increased from 50.6% to 69.7% during the same period. As patient utilization increased, hospital revenue increased. The generated revenue was used to accelerate quality improvement further, to provide staff with additional fee incentives that compensated their low government salaries, and to expand hospital services. Thus, the revenue obtained user fees created a benign cycle for sustainability at NMCHC.
   Through this process, the user-fee revenue offered payment exemption to low-income users, supported the government financially through user-fee contributions, and reduced financial support from donors.
   Although the staff satisfaction rate remained at 41.2% due to low salary compensation in the third year of user-fee implementation, staff's work attitude shifted from salary-oriented to patient-oriented-with more attention to low-income users. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Reforming health care financing in Bulgaria: the population perspective
SO SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
DE Bulgaria; reform; values; attitudes; population
ID PAYMENTS; SECTOR
AB Health financing reform in Bulgaria has been characterised by lack of political consensus on reform direction, economic shocks, and, since 1998, steps towards social insurance. As in other eastern European countries, the reform has been driven by an imperative to embrace new ideas modelled on systems elsewhere, but with little attention to whether these reflect popular values. This study explores underlying values, such as views on the role of the state and solidarity, attitudes to, and understanding of compulsory and voluntary insurance, and co-payments. The study identifies general principles (equity, transparency) considered important by the population and practical aspects of implementation of reform. Data were obtained from a representative survey (n = 1547) and from 58 in-depth interviews and 6 focus groups with users and health professionals, conducted in 1997 before the actual reform of the health financing system in Bulgaria. A majority supports significant state involvement in health care financing, ranging from providing safety net for the poor, through co-subsidising or regulating the social insurance system, to providing state-financed universal free care (half of all respondents). Collectivist values in Bulgaria remain strong, with support for free access to services regardless of income, age, or health status and progressive funding. There is strong support (especially among the well off) for a social insurance system based on the principle of solidarity and accountability rather than the former tax-based model. The preferred health insurance fund was autonomous, state regulated, financing only health care, and offering optional membership. Voluntary insurance and, less so, co-payments were acceptable if limited to selected services and better off groups. In conclusion, a health financing system under public control that fits well with values and population preferences is likely to improve compliance and be more sustainable. Universal health insurance appears to attract most support, but a broader public debate involving less empowered people is needed to resolve misunderstandings and create realistic expectations.

AB Comanagement, while widely recognized as an important tool for sustainable resource management, is not easily achieved without a process of trial and error. This article reports on participatory research as a means to progress toward comanagement, using a case study of coastal resource management in San Felipe, Yucatan, Mexico. Research methods included geographical information system (GIS) mapping, surveys, interviews, and a community workshop. The results show strong interest from various community groups in the protection of important habitats and in the management of the coastal resources. Through this participatory research, community members, scientists, and government officials entered into a dialogue, suggesting potential for a future comanagement regime.

TI "Sustainability" as a dialogue of values: Challenges to the sociology of
   development
SO SOCIOLOGICAL INQUIRY
LA English
DT Article
AB Even in an increasingly polarized climate of global policy-making, the ideal of "sustainable development" retains currency across a remarkably broad swath of the political spectrum in debating alternative scenarios for the future. By adapting Weber's classic categories of value spheres and collective rationality, I distinguish contemporary approaches to operationalizing the concept of sustainability and elucidate the practical implications of each. For some, the social, ecological, and economic dimensions of sustainability are synergistic components of a single meaningful goal, pursued by either an overarching technique or a unifying ethic. In contrast to these unifying models, one may conclude that the dimensions of sustainable development invoke values that inevitably conflict in any complex social interaction to derive strategies for collective action. Framing the concept in such terms, as a dialogue of values, highlights the need to adapt social institutions to mediate value conflict at different scales, and points to opportunities for engaging development debates through applied research on comparative governance.

AB In the Horqin Sandy Land of eastern Inner Mongolia in northern China, wind erosion in farmland is very common in a period from thawing of frozen surface soil in mid-March to sowing of crops in the end of April, largely because of dry and windy weather. However, little is known about the magnitude of wind erosion and associated nutrient losses due to erosion and the addition of nutrients by airborne dust deposition to farmlands during this period. A field experiment was conducted in an Entisol with sand origin under corn (Zea mays L.) production to investigate daily changes in wind speed and wind erosion intensity (as measured by soil transport rate) over a period from 20 March to 30 April 2001. We also measured daily rates of airborne dust deposition during the spring seasons with the high frequency of dust storm occurrence. The rates of soil transport by wind varied greatly from 13.2 to 1254.1 kg ha(-1) per day, averaging 232.1 kg ha(-1) per day, largely attributable to great variation between days in wind speed within the study period. The potential losses of nutrients through wind erosion were 0.26-24.95 kg ha(-1) per day (averaging 4.62 kg ha(-1) per day) in organic matter, 0.02-1.64 kg ha(-1) per day (averaging 0.31 kg ha(-1) per day) in nitrogen and 0.01-0.7 kg ha(-1) per day (averaging 0.13 kg ha(-1) per day) in phosphorus. The mean rates of airborne dust deposition ranged from 4.0 to 48.9 kg ha(-1) per day, averaging 19.9 kg ha(-1) per day, during the spring seasons. The potential addition of organic matter, nitrogen and phosphorus by dust input to the experimental field was, on average, 0.54, 0.04 and 0.02 kg ha(-1) per day, respectively. Although the addition was a fraction of the losses due to erosion, nevertheless, dust input in the spring seasons is one of the major suppliers of soil nutrition. The fact that the addition of nutrients by dust is about 1/10 of the losses of soil nutrients through wind erosion suggests that developing and adopting more effective management practices to reduce soil erosion losses and to improve soil fertility are crucial to achieve a sustainable agricultural system in a fragile, semiarid sandy land environment.

AB Following land reform in China in the early 1980s, farm management practices, such as the type of crops grown and their rotations, intensity of cropping and fertilizer and pesticide use, underwent drastic changes. To investigate how these changes affected soil properties and ultimately the sustainability of agricultural production, a case study was conducted in Daxing County (southern Beijing Municipality). Soil in the Daxing area was sampled in 1982 at the onset of land reform and again in 2000. Surface soil (0-20 cm) samples were collected and analyzed for organic matter (OM), total nitrogen (TN), and available N (AN), P (AP) and K (AK) contents. The soil OM, TN, AN, and AP all increased significantly while AK decreased slightly, but significantly, for the sampling area over the 18-year study period. Increased crop yield (higher biomass production) with increasing fertilizer application combined with soil conservation measures that have retained more crop residue on land, are responsible for the increases in soil OM, N and P concentrations. However, the slight decreases in AK reflect the increased cropping intensity and low AK supplying power of these coarse textured soils as well as the low K fertilizer input.

AB We evaluated the influence of several organic matter management practices on the characteristics of carbohydrates in water-stable aggregates and soil aggregate stability at three Nigerian locations (Abakiliki, Nsukka and Umudike) where forests had been converted to arable farming. The effect of management practices to enhance aggregate stability was site-specific. The highest aggregate stability was obtained with Gliricidia sepium at Abakiliki, with Cajanus cajan followed by rice mill wastes (RW) at Nsukka and with the forested soil at Umudike. While none of the treatments at all sites was able to enhance the C and N contents of the soils to the levels obtained in the forested sites, a net improvement in carbohydrate and organic carbon (OC) content was found for some management practices. The carbohydrate status increased with G. sepium at Abakiliki, and with Dactylodenae bacterii alone or in combination with Pentaclethra species at Umudike, while at Nsukka all organic inputs increased carbohydrate content over the control and forested soils. However, neither total OC nor the carbohydrate content were significantly correlated to the variability in aggregate stability of these soils. The delta(13)C values found for acidic hydrolysates were constant within the soil aggregate sizes and generally distributed around -29 to -30parts per thousand, suggesting that the OC from these sites originated from C3 plants. Our results indicate that in these tropical Nigerian soils, aggregate stability and OC content are generally preserved by alley-cropping in well structured soil, whereas treatments with organic wastes are sustainable management practices in more fragile soils.

DT Article
AB The Committee on Earth Observation Satellites (CEOS) coordinates international civil space-borne missions designed to observe and study planet Earth. With over 100 Earth observation satellites expected to be launched during the next 10 years, it is clear that collaborative opportunities have not been fully maximized. In 2003 CEOS has been focusing on articulating a more comprehensive satellite data utilization approach and in following up on its significant involvement in the World Summit on Sustainable Development. The CEOS Chair also serves as Co-Chair of the Integrated Global Observing Strategy (IGOS) Partnership, which seeks to reduce observation gaps and unnecessary overlaps and to harmonize and integrate common interests of space-based and in situ systems. IGOS focused in 2003 on development of a number of themes, including Carbon Cycle, Water Cycle and GeoHazards. The IGOS Ocean Theme is now in its implementation phase. NOAA, while chairing CEOS and co-chairing IGOS, has also been actively involved in organizing and hosting a ministerial-level Earth Observation Summit with a follow-on Group on Earth Observations (GEO) charged with developing the framework for a comprehensive global Earth observation system(s). All these activities demonstrate the commitment to developing more coherent and sustained Earth observation strategies for the good of the planet. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The practical application of systemic sustainability analysis (SSA; Bell and Morse, 1999) as applied in-a project instigated and managed by 'Blue Plan', one of the regional activity centres of the Mediterranean Action Plan, is set out and explained in this paper. The context in which SSA was applied and adapted to SPSA (systemic and prospective sustainability analysis). is described in the Mediterranean, primarily in Malta.
   The SSA process is summarized, its extension and linkage to the prospective approach is described and the comments of stakeholders in the context are added. Some preliminary outcomes are suggested. The pauticular focus of the paper is on the lessons learned from doing SSA/SPSA within a classic blueprint project framework. It is-not assumed that SSA/SPSA is 'finished' or 'definitive'. Rather, we suggest that it is a developing and changing approach that practitioners can adapt and change to meet the specific needs of the circumstances that confront them.

AB Under the influence of economic growth theories, the idea of sustainable development has been revised to sustainable economic development. As a result, cultural concern has often given way to economic calculation in the course of development. This has been evident in the case of China, where economic construction has destroyed a number of invaluable heritage sites. Development in China, therefore, may not be sustainable, since the major concern of its development policy is focused on sustainable economic development rather than sustainable development.

AB Sustainable waste management is a core issue facing local and national governments. It is widely acknowledged that although producers of goods and materials have a role to play in reducing waste, the general public, in the way that we consume and utilize products, have a key role in delivering sustainable waste management. This paper supports this assertion with data from a study of waste management attitudes and reported behaviours in southwest England. The paper presents a conceptual framework for examining attitudes and behaviours towards waste management, incorporating environmental values, situational factors and psychological variables. Using this framework, the paper demonstrates the range of influences acting on attitudes and actions towards sustainable waste management practices, focusing especially on recycling behaviour. The paper argues that the framework could provide a useful tool for examining the variety of factors influencing a range of public actions relevant to sustainable development.

TI Systems/operational research and sustainable development: Towards a new
   agenda
SO SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB At the 2002 International Sustainable environmental planners. In a literature Development Research Conference in Manchester, a great number of the 53 papers presented addressed exciting methodological developments associated with action research. Many of these initiatives can be linked with the rich tradition of operational research (OR). OR and environmental planning for sustainable development share three traditions: first, both have wide boundaries in terms of clientele, range of methodological approaches used and attention to multiple (and often conflicting) values; second, both traditions have an interest in fostering interdisciplinarity; third, both OR and environmental planning are concerned with the implementation, as well as the design, of planning strategies. Given these shared traditions, we recently engaged in a systemic intervention project to explore the possibilities of improved collaboration between OR practitioners and environmental planners. In a literature review and interviews with stakeholders, three generic issues were found to recur: complexity and uncertainty (regarding the unpredictability of natural and social phenomena); multiple and often conflicting values (of those involved in environmental planning) and political effects (on those not involved in planning processes, including non-human nature). This paper reveals a pattern of how these generic issues are perceived in the public, business and voluntary sectors, and explains how, through a series of workshops and a mini-conference, three interrelated agendas for future action took shape.

DE manufacturing strategy formulation
ID INFORMATION-TECHNOLOGY
AB Recent developments of the World Trade Organisation and other international trade agreements have forced industries worldwide to face a new era of intense global competition. Manufacturers will have to compete effectively not only in the local context, but in wider regional and global marketplaces. Global competition has offered numerous opportunities and problems for the manufacturing industry. This paper investigates the determinants of strategy formulation (SF) in manufacturing enterprises and consolidates the empirical findings of a longitudinal study from 1994-2001 in Hong Kong. It also discusses the experiences from some leading Hong Kong manufacturers in managing the competitive pressures and gaining sustainable competitive advantages. The paper attempts to complement the literature base of SF practices with empirical evidence. The findings presented address the identification of success factors and problematic areas that provide manufacturers with guidance and references for formulating viable strategies to meet their business and operations needs.

AB A dramatic surge in information technology (IT) around the world and an evolving global economy are subjecting firms to megacompetition, thereby compelling them to develop a resilient structure for survival. The construction of a co-evolutional structure between enhancement of core competences and agile correspondence to dynamically changing external circumstances, including dynamic change in customer preferences and competitive conditions, is thus essential. While technological innovation for developing new functionality is a strategic option, given the huge risks and uncertainty indigenous to technological innovation, a high level of dependence on this process can lead to a vulnerable structure. The fluctuating nature of external circumstances can also have the same result. Thus, sustainable firm development can only be expected using systems resilience incorporating a stable innovation orbit. Prompted by this postulate, this paper attempts to identify a resilience structure for high-technology firms that are experiencing megacompetition through a comparative empirical analysis of factors governing operating income to sales for R&D intensive Japanese pharmaceutical and electrical machinery firms over the last two decades.

AB This article describes the catalytic routes that are available for converting unsaturated fatty acid esters and related compounds, obtained from renewable resources, into useful chemical products via the olefin metathesis reaction. These routes offer new possibilities for the oleochemical industry as a contribution to a sustainable chemical industry. Highly selective homogeneous as well as heterogeneous catalyst systems have been developed for these metathetical conversions. Supported rhenium oxide catalysts are already active at room temperature, can be easily separated from the reaction mixture, and can be regenerated many times. New well-defined homogeneous ruthenium complexes are very effective catalysts, showing high turnover numbers. The present knowledge about the catalyst systems and the possibilities for practical applications for the metathetical conversion of unsaturated fatty acid esters and oils will be discussed.

AB Tourists' perspectives of indigenous tourism are not fully understood. This paper explores the nature of demand for indigenous tourism with particular attention to the appreciation of indigenous culture gained by tourists. The latter is explored using in-depth interviews with international tourists visiting New Zealand to examine tourists' motivations, perceptions and experiences of Maori culture. Findings of the present study provide some evidence to support anecdotal conclusions about the similar demands tourists require from their encounters with indigenous peoples. Five central dimensions of experience from which tourists come to appreciate the cultures of indigenous peoples are reported, namely; gazing, lifestyle, authenticity, personal interaction and informal learning. Important issues of product development and options for the sustainable development of indigenous communities are considered. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The Lizard Peninsula is an isolated area of unique and sensitive ecology and the occurrence of damaging ozone concentrations over the peninsula in spring challenges the successful sustainable management of the area. Ozone concentrations over Goonhilly Downs on the Lizard Peninsula in Cornwall were measured in spring 2002 using continuous monitoring and spatial mapping (diffusion tubes). Data obtained using a continuous ozone monitor (1/03/02 to 31/03/02) showed that the AOT40 5-day values were in a range from 2 to 800 mug m(-3) hr (AOT40 is the sum of the differences between the measured hourly ozone concentration (mug m(-3)) and 80 mug m(-3) (when the concentration exceeds 80 mug m(-3)) for the hours when global radiation exceeds 50 Wm(-2)). Contour mapping of ozone concentrations measured with diffusion tubes suggested that over a 2 km(2) sampling area significant microscale variations were occurring with ozone concentrations ranging between 48-129 mug m(-3) for one two-week period and 62-210 mug m(-3) for the other. Unusually high diurnal variations in ozone concentrations were also observed at Goonhilly. It is thought that temperature inversions caused the entrapment of ozone at the surface level.

AB In the present paper a process for removal of ions from wastewater or from washing water of contaminated soil by using the weakly basic water-soluble polymer polyethylenimine (PEI) as chelating agent and the Cu2+ ion as model in combination with an ultrafiltration process was investigated. The complexing agent was preliminarily tested to establish the best operative conditions of the process. Next, ultrafiltration tests by using five different membranes were realised to check membrane performance like flux and rejection. Finally, the possibility for recovering and recycling the polymer was tested in order to obtain an economically sustainable process. Obtained results showed that complexation conditions depends on pH: indeed, at a pH > 6 PEI-Cu2+ complexes are formed, while at pH < 3 the decomplexation reaction takes place. Saturation condition is 0.333 mg Cu2+/mg PEI, meaning a ratio PEI/Cu2+ = 3 (w/w). UF tests showed good results using the PAN 40 kDa membrane reaching an average copper concentration in the permeate of 2 mg/l and a flux of 135.4 and 156.5 l/h.m(2) at 2 and 4 bar, respectively. Metal rejection, permeate flow rate, and possibility to regenerating and recycling the polymer makes the polymer-assisted ultrafiltration process (PAUF) very interesting for metal ion removal from waters.

AB The loss of stored water from surface water reservoirs through evaporation is inevitable and can be significant in arid and semi-arid climates. One way of compensating for this inevitable loss is to explicitly include the evaporation process in the reservoir planning analysis, thus ensuring that the resulting capacity estimate will be capable of meeting both the intended consumptive demands and the evaporative losses. However, because evaporation measurements are often unavailable and because there are few reservoir planning techniques that can explicitly accommodate evaporation consideration, this solution is often not applied. The result is that there is currently little guidance regarding the allowance for evaporation losses during reservoir planning in such regions. This study has used data from the Urmia region in Iran to develop a rule for evaporation correction during reservoir planning. The way to use the rule is explained and suggestions about how the study can be extended are offered.

AB Irrigation, until recently a major water user in Bulgaria, has been drastically affected by the political and economic changes that came about after the collapse of the socialist system. Collective action might be a way for societies to overcome the well-known common-pool resource dilemma, thereby securing sustainable water management. This article questions whether measures to facilitate local self-governance could be successful in Bulgaria. Empirical results suggest that local actors use power asymmetries to maintain their opportunistic strategies, and the governance of information plays an especially important role. Moreover, distrust between community members plays a crucial role in constraining the evolution of social capital, which is a prerequisite for collective action. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Patients with schizophrenia have consistently been found to exhibit cognitive deficits, particularly in memory, which have been suggested to mediate functional outcomes. Several recent reviews of cognitive retraining have concluded that these deficits respond to training, although the sustainability of cognitive improvement following completion of training has not been adequately evaluated. Most studies had small samples and very short follow-up periods. As part of a larger study, we examined performance on two memory tasks in two groups of participants: those who received computerized cognitive remediation training in addition to work therapy (n=45), vs. those who only received work therapy (n=49). Computerized cognitive remediation included hierarchical training on a computerized digit span task and a computerized words serial position task. Assessments using the same computerized tasks were made at three time points: baseline, end of active intervention, and 6-month follow-up. Compared to the active control condition (work therapy only), the group receiving computerized cognitive remediation in addition to work therapy showed significantly greater improvements on the trained digit span task following training. These improvements were maintained at the 6-month follow-up. There were no significant group differences on the word serial position task at any time point. Results indicate that computerized training can lead to sustained improvements on some. but not all, training tasks. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Equity in climate change treaty
SO CURRENT SCIENCE

AB The Kyoto Protocol of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change seeks to achieve climate stability and sustainable development through global cooperation. Even with spectacular advances in climate science, projected economic and health benefits of greenhouse gas mitigation, and presence of all the key elements for an effective treaty in the Kyoto Protocol, climate change negotiations remain inconclusive. Arguably, this is so because a widespread concern on equity is yet to be resolved. Here I reexamine the equity in climate change treaty. Political leadership, scientific community and civil society in several nations have maintained that the democratic norms for climate governance are a prerequisite for crafting a successful climate change treaty. Principle of equal p er capita emission entitlements is now emerging as the key option beyond current impasse. Although not required under the Kyoto Protocol, several developing nations are taking responsible action to mitigate climate change. Principle of equal per capita emission entitlements is a just solution to successfully implement climate treaty aimed at climate change mitigation, adaptation and sustainable development. Without a full and unequivocal commitment to equity and democratic governance by a cohesive humanity, any international climate change treaty will have only limited utility.

ID HIV; HEALTH
AB The UN has launched an initiative to place 3 million people in developing countries on antiretroviral AIDS treatment by end 2005 (the 3 by 5 target). Lessons for HIV/AIDS treatment scale-up emerge from recent experience with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. Expansion of treatment for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis through the multipartner mechanism known as the Green Light Committee (GLC) has enabled gains in areas relevant to 3 by 5, including policy development, drug procurement, rational use of drugs, and the strengthening of health systems. The successes of the GLC and the obstacles it has encountered provide insights for building sustainable HIV/AIDS treatment programmes.

TI Natural N-15 abundance in soils under young-growth forests in Ethiopia
SO FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
DE delta N-15; forest soil
ID BRAZILIAN AMAZON BASIN; NITROGEN; PASTURE; HIGHLANDS
AB In Ethiopia, plantation forestry for the purpose of soil conservation and wood production is established mainly on degraded mountain slopes. These forests with a rotation age of 12-34 years consist of mainly exotic tree species; and have great potential to provide maximum wood production and economic incentives at the age of 8-20 years. N-15 natural abundance in soils under a 25-year-old forest on Mt. Yegof has been used to determine if the short rotation forests result in significant inputs of N to soils and improve the degraded soils before harvest at the rotation age of 12-34 years. Since I have previously described the fractional contributions of the present forest vegetation to the build-up of soil organic matter (SOM) on Mt. Yegof, patterns of delta(15)N and delta(13)C values were compared to determine if shifts in soil N-15 are related to vegetation shifts by afforestation. On Mt. Yegof, soil delta(15)N values were 0.9-3.9parts per thousand in soil at 0-5 cm and >6parts per thousand in soil at 30-50 cm. Plant delta(15)N values ranged from -4.6 to -0.7parts per thousand. Despite the negative delta(15)N values of the vegetation cover, the high delta(15)N values in the topsoil indicate that return of N to soils by litter-fall is minimal on Mt. Yegof and, hence, the present forests do not change very much the soil N-15 signals at the surface layer. At this site, the high delta(13)C values throughout the soil profiles is clear evidence of a long phase Of C-4 grass dominance or cultivation of C-4 crops along the entire elevation gradient. The slight shift towards lower delta(15)N values in soil at 0-5 cm indicate only a trend of N-15 depleted SOM build-up through litter-fall from the present forest vegetation. This and previous studies show that the planted forests on Mt. Yegof did not result in significant changes in the inputs of C, N and SOM, and hence, cannot signify the improvement of degraded soil conditions during a 25-year forest growth. Thus, these forests made need a rotation period much longer than 25-year period to signify ecological rehabilitation and to establish a sustainable forest ecosystem with less N losses on the fairly steep slopes at Mt. Yegof. From the points of view of soil conservation and soil fertility management, it could be suggested that forest harvest at the time of maximum wood production may not necessary be considered if ecologically sustainable forests are to be managed on highly degraded mountain slopes in the Ethiopian highlands.

AB Riparian communities (those near open water) have often been shown to display high structural and compositional diversity and they have been identified as potentially serving a keystone role in the landscape. Thus, they are the focus of specific management guidelines that attempt to protect terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. We used a digital forest inventory database for a portion of the boreal mixed-wood forest in Alberta, Canada, to examine whether proximity to a lake affects forest composition, age, or configuration. Two analyses were employed: (1) forest composition (dominant canopy species, proportional composition of different species) and age (decade-of-origin) in bands of 50 m width and varying distance from small lakes were compared to forest in a similar spatial configuration but away from open water and (2) forest composition, dominant canopy species, age, and stand shape metrics were examined along transects emanating out from lakes in two regions, which varied in topography and dominant forest cover. We found no effect of distance from lake on forest age. The proportion of the landscape covered by forest of the predominant canopy species increased with distance from lake, but this was largely due to a corresponding decline in cover of non-forest vegetation rather than a change in forest canopy composition. At the spatial resolution of forest management planning, riparian forests in this region are of similar age and composition as those away from lakes. Since there is no natural analogue for riparian buffer strips around lakes, they may not be justified in the context of ecosystem management following the natural disturbance paradigm. Management of riparian forests should focus on meeting defined management and conservation objectives through, for example, protection of finer scale features of riparian zones and landscape-level planning for allocation of uncut forest.

AB Tree biomass plays a key role in sustainable management and in estimating forest carbon stocks. The most common mathematical model in biomass studies takes the form of the power function M = aD(b) where a and b are the allometric coefficients to be determined by empirical data, and M the total aboveground tree dry biomass for a specific diameter at breast height, D.
   In this study the development and comparison of three methods for simplifying allometric equations of aboveground biomass estimation are reported. Based on the criterion of the relative difference (RD) between observed and predicted biomass data, the small trees sampling scheme (SSS) predicted quite accurate estimates for raw data reported in 10 studies. The SSS equation was based on the hypothesis that information provided in published allometric equations, in conjunction with two pairs of empirical M-D values, are enough to obtain reliable predictions for aboveground stand biomass. In addition, predictions of M based on theoretical values of b were also tested with the RD criterion, but reliability of predictions in 10 studies is questioned. Finally, fractal geometry was used to develop a 'reductionist' model for M estimation and implications from its implementation in biomass studies are discussed. We totally based our investigation on a metadata set derived from published aboveground biomass allometric studies conducted for different species spanning the globe. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

ID FOREST MANAGEMENT
AB We present here a proof of concept for a new study of the forest management practices in Georgia, USA. The study is based on a long-term wood supply analysis of the current forest resources. We pursue questions about the sustainable bases of existing practices and significance of hypothetical scenarios relating to various management practices and regulatory constraints. The study is based on research in areas of regional growth and yield dynamics, intensive silviculture, and forest practices code. At this introductory stage the analysis is based on basic inventory information provided by the USDA Forest Service Forest Inventory Analysis unit, approximate locations of about 10,000 permanent sample plots, limited GIS information, Landsat TM imagery, and simplified assumptions about the spatial distribution of different forest cover types. We present here the preliminary results and identify the directions and resources for future developments. The results of the simulations suggest that the current forest practices in Georgia are based on sound and sustainable principles with the existing harvesting far below the maximum sustainable level. The preliminary analysis, for the current land base held constant, suggests that at the current harvesting level of approximately 42 million m(3) a year, the volume of mature and over-mature stands available for harvesting in Georgia may initially decrease during the first several years from about 550 to 400 million m(3), but after that it would increase to nearly double and eventually level off, exceeding 550 million m(3). The total volume of Georgia forests is expected to increase in the first 50 years from its current level of about 950 to 1150 million m(3), and then it will gradually decrease to about 1 billion m(3) over the next one-and-a-half century.

AB Developing uneven-aged structure in mature stands of longleaf pine requires scientifically based silvicultural systems that are reliable, productive and sustainable. Understanding seedling responses to varying levels of site resource availability within forest gaps is essential for effectively converting even-aged stands to uneven-aged stands. A project was initiated on the Apalachicola National Forest in Northwestern Florida to examine these relationships, particularly as they would apply to the group selection forest reproduction method.
   This study used a line transect technique to examine gaps formed in mature stands of longleaf pine by either natural disturbances or prior intermediate silvicultural operations (i.e., thinnings). The expanded gap sizes ranged from 32 to 1161 m(2); however, 86% of all gaps sampled in this study were less than 600 m(2) in size. Mean and median expanded gap sizes were 402 and 334 m, respectively. Gap shapes were irregular and significantly different from a circle. Seedling stocking ranged from 0 to 43% and density ranged from 0 to 9800 seedlings ha(-1). Neither gap size nor shape significantly affected seedling numbers or root collar diameters (RCDs). In contrast, proximity to mature longleaf pine affected both seedling numbers and RCD. Seedling numbers increased considerably greater than or equal to5 m from mature trees. Significant decreases in seedling RCD, resulting from interspecific competition with mature longleaf pine, were detected and most strongly expressed outside the gaps (average RCD = 21 and 16 mm inside and outside gaps, respectively). In general, seedling stocking within the gaps was low (average 16%). (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The sustainable load of fibre delay line buffers, defined as the load at which a system with infinite buffering capacity becomes unstable, is discussed. Owing to the particularities of fibre delay line buffers, namely their finite delay granularity, this sustainable load is generally less than 100%. It is further shown that the packet-size distribution has some impact too.

AB Whenever life wants to invade a new habitat or escape from a lethal selection pressure, some mutations may be necessary to yield sustainable replication. We imagine situations like (i) a parasite infecting a new host, (ii) a species trying to invade a new ecological niche, (iii) cancer cells escaping from chemotherapy, (iv) viruses or microbes evading anti-microbial therapy, and also (v) the repeated attempts of combinatorial chemistry in the very beginning of life to produce self-replicating molecules. All such seemingly unrelated situations have a common structure in terms of Darwinian dynamics: a replicator with a basic reproductive ratio less than one attempts to find some mutations that allow indefinite survival. We develop a general theory, based on multitype branching processes, to describe the evolutionary dynamics of invasion and escape. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB MOVPE-grown GaSb(100) surfaces were investigated with in situ RAS, LEED, and UPS. The in situ signals turned out to be very useful in determining suitable growth parameters and in monitoring the critical deoxidation procedure. Undoped Gasb(100) films were grown with triethylantimony and triethylgallium as precursors. Characteristic differences in the in situ signals were correlated with surface sensitive measurements after having transferred the samples with a patented procedure from the MOVPE reactor into ultrahigh vacuum chambers. p-type doping was accomplished with the precursors ditertiarybutylsilane and carbon tetrabromide, that are sustainable alternatives compared to silane and carbon tetrachloride. LEED images of the surfaces displayed a c(2 x 6) surface reconstruction. Doping levels in the range from 10(17) to 10(20) cm(-3) were observed with SIMS and Hall measurements. Characteristic RAS peaks at the E-1 and E-1 + Delta(1) interband transitions were attributed to the linear electro-optic effect and were found to increase linearly with the dopant concentration.

AB The complete utilization of Israel's water potential (safe yield) (1800 Mm(3)/y) was combined with wide and intensive reuse of most wastewaters (300 Mm(3)/y), reduced to minimum water outflows to the sea. Irrigation is a "consumptive" type of water use - most of the water being "lost" by evapo-transpiration, leaving the mineral salinity in the soil solution and in the excess (residual) water seeping, penetrating to underlying unsaturated layers on its way to groundwater. Thus, the complete use and reuse of water bring about a high rate of salt accumulation in soils, in the unsaturated zones, and eventually in groundwater. This poses a serious risk of salinization of the country's lands and aquifers. Effects of salinization of soil and water are felt on a time-scale of tens of years. In several regions in Israel, salinization of the soil has already been encountered, and there is a permanent increase in water salinity at the coastal aquifer. Reports of many studies indicate a significant salinity increase in the unsaturated zones and at upper interface layers of the groundwater table. Also, accumulation (fixation) of specific heavy metals can be seen in soils irrigated with reclaimed wastewater. Though negative effects of heavy metals have not been felt up to now, the rate of accumulation predicts such effects in 10 to 30 years of continuing practices of such irrigation. The accumulation of salinity in general, combined with the accumulation of specific elements, can be defined as a chemo-desertification process. Partial desalination (using membrane processes) of reclaimed wastewater is needed to reduce the salinity load, to "purge salt " from the country, and to prevent salinization of land and water to enable sustainable reuse.

AB Results of a watershed optimization model that specifies the future amount of land for each land use type at a sub-area level are incorporated into a GIS-based spatial allocation model to provide specific location recommendations based on existing land use, slope, distance to surface water and conversion preference. Thus, more detailed interpretation and implementation of optimal development scenarios can be obtained. This integrated approach was applied in Lake Erhai basin, China. This prototype land allocation system combines the strength of optimization modeling and GIS. A decision maker knows where and what type of land use changes should be made to achieve an environmental and economic sustainable future. That is, the modeling results provide support for answering questions of "what should I do?" and "how do I do it?" in land use planning and decision-making.

AB This study investigated the establishment of 17 species of North American prairie forbs and grasses by field sowing in Sheffield, a city in northern England. The purpose of the work was to see whether it was feasible to use this sown, naturalistic plant community as a more sustainable alternative to traditional herbaceous plantings in urban parks. Key variables in the study were, sowing season (summer and winter), soil type (topsoil, subsoil, and sand mulched topsoil) and sowing rate (0.625, 1.25, and 2.5 g/m(2)). All experimental plots were baited with metaldehyde containing pellets to reduce the impact of slug predation. For the sown community as a whole, the highest seedling emergence was recorded on subsoil plots sown in winter, and overall, winter sowing was superior. The lowest emergence was recorded on sand mulched plots sown in summer, although even in this treatment emergence was satisfactory in terms of landscape practice. For individual species, high levels of emergence were dependent upon specific combinations of soil type and sowing season. High seedling densities were recorded: from 64 seedlings/m(2) at the low rate, to 315 seedlings/m(2) at the high rate. The most successful species were: Echinacea pallida, Echinacea purpurea, Monarda fistulosa, Ratibida pinnata, and Solidago rigida. The least successful species were: Coreopsis tripteris, Solidago ohioensis, Sporobolus heterolepis, and Veronicastrum virginicum. Soil type had a significant influence on weed density in the experiment, with sand mulched plots the least weedy, and topsoil the most weedy. The study has shown that given control of mollusc predation during the emergence period, all of the species chosen could be established by sowing in situ in northern England. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

AB In a power grid with significant components of distributed generation and insufficient spinning reserve, the quality of delivered power may not meet the requirements of advanced manufacturing. A system design for power quality security which uses solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) technology is described. Critical parameters for system performance are continuous supply voltage at the nominal voltage and frequency. The grid chosen for this study has significant voltage fluctuations and periodic voltage drops and surges, including total power loss. A supply of methane from a sewer sludge digester is scrubbed Of CO2 and used for continuous standby operation, with excess stored to enable 8 h operation of an uninterruptible power supply (UPS). The system employs a modular, thermally coupled, SOFC architecture that includes steam reforming of the methane fuel, a rectifier, power controls, and control system. Continuous operation of a 125 kW tubular SOFC stack maintains operating temperature and steam for fuel reforming in a secondary SOFC stack, by exhausting through it before a gas turbine expands the exhaust to supply the plant air and fuel compression. Modelling of the energy balance of the system demonstrates the standby and full power operating modes. The system is sized at 250 kW to supply secure power for a manufacturing facility.

AB In order to evaluate the extractive use potential of Desmoncus orthacanthos, various matrix models were employed to assess population structure and dynamics. To this end, populations of this liana palm were investigated in southern Quintana Roo, Mexico, at two localities showing contrasting fragmentation levels arising from different land use regimes. In one case continuous forest (CF) are maintained under forestry management, while in the other (fragmented forest, FF) isolated forest patches remain inside of a matrix of crop and livestock lands. Three forest conditions: mature forest (MF), young forest (YF) and forest edge (FE) were nested in each fragmentation level. Results showed that more plants were encountered under FF situations than under CF conditions; however, no differences were noted in exploitable shoots (i.e., total numbers and lengths) when both were compared. Under forest conditions, number and length of exploitable shoots did not differ between FE and MF populations, however these values were smallest in YF populations. Intrinsic population growth rates (lambda) were lower under FF than under CF, as reflected by periodic matrix values of 0.964 and 1.594, respectively. With respect to forest conditions, lambda for FE > lambda for YF > lambda for MF and periodic matrix values were 1.441, 1.193 and 1.075, respectively. Elasticity analyses for annual matrices showed that the demographic process having most influence on variations in lambda was (periodic matrix values) permanence (43-63%), followed by growth and retrogression (15-22% and 14-23%, respectively); fecundity had the lowest influence in changes of lambda-values (8-13%). Analyses of the simulated extraction of shoots greater than or equal to5 m suggested that FE and CF populations might support harvest rates of 40% per year, since lambda > 1; however, simulation of harvest rates as low as 20% in other populations always resulted in lambda < 1. Interestingly, the simulated addition of nursery-raised juveniles resulted in a notable increase in lambda, especially for FE populations; simulations combining shoot extraction with the addition of juveniles suggested that high levels of harvest may be possible, even while maintaining lambda > 1; but only if sound forest management is practiced and agricultural fires are restricted. This work showed the value of matrix models for analyzing populations dynamics in establishing sustainable use strategies for D. orthacanthos as opposed to static evaluation of population numbers.

AB Long-term fertility experiments (LTFEs) are a tool to investigate the sustainability of cropping systems. The present study analyzed two LTFEs for intensive rice-based irrigated systems in the Senegal River valley at Ndiaye and Fanaye (Sahel savanna). The trials were established in 199 1, contain six different fertilizer treatments and rice is grown two times per year. Soil types are a typical Orthithionic Gleysol and an Eutric Vertisol at Ndiaye and Fanaye, respectively. The objectives of the presented study were to analyze the effect of intensive irrigated rice cropping on the soil resource base by studying the changes of soil characteristics over time and by comparing soil N, P and K pools in different fertilizer treatments. In the LTFE at Ndiaye, topsoil pH values increased significantly from 5.5 to about 6.5 and electrical conductivity was high but remained stable. Soil organic carbon (SOC) and total soil nitrogen (TSN) dropped slightly after 16 consecutive seasons but the difference was statistically not significant. At both sites, exchangeable N ranged between 1.6 and 2.8% of TSN and fixed N accounted for 5.5-8.2% of TSN, with slightly higher values in Fanaye. Treatment differences in N dose had no significant effect on these parameters. Results of delta(13)C analysis showed a decrease due to rice cropping at both sites, and the measurements indicate high turnover rates of soil organic matter. Soil analyses of total soil P and K and of different pools indicated only small changes when these elements were applied at medium quantities. In contrast, treatments with N application only showed considerable soil P and K depletion, and rice cultivation without P and/or K application cannot maintain soil fertility. The soil mining process is relatively quick for P due to the naturally low soil P status, whereas the high soil K reserves buffer even important negative K balances for decades. It is concluded that irrigated lice cultivation in the region can maintain soil fertility if at least medium P doses are applied together with nitrogen. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID EXAMPLE; DESIGN
AB MULINO, an ongoing project financed by the European Commission, has released the prototype of a Decision Support System software (mDSS) for the sustainable management of water resources at the catchment scale. The software integrates socio-economic and environmental modelling, with geo-spatial information and multi-criteria analysis. The policy background refers to the EU Water Framework Directive. The challenging multi-disciplinary context was approached by developing an innovative and dynamic implementation of the DPSIR framework, originally proposed by the European Environmental Agency. In mDSS integrated assessment modelling provides the values of quantitative indicators to be used for transparent and participated decisions, through the application of value functions, weights and decision rules chosen by the end user. Simple routines for the sensitivity analysis and comparison of alternative weight vectors also provides effective decision support by exploring and finding compromises between conflicting interests/perspectives in a multi-stakeholder context.

ID MANAGEMENT; DESIGN
AB Computer-based methods of integrated modelling and assessment provide an important means for reviewing policy choices in natural resource management (NRM). Research in support of NRM needs to address a wide range of issues involved, from point-scale biophysical, to business-scale human, to regional-scale planning issues. Research covering the full scope of such issues is by default multi-disciplinary and integrative and therefore analytically, methodologically and operationally challenging. The recently initiated Ord-Bonaparte Program is an example of a research and development program attempting to achieve both levels of integration in an applied NRM context. One key requirement for the success of the program lies in developing a systems framework that: (i) enables the integration of the various disciplinary research activities; and (ii) facilitates the implementation of research outputs by making integrated science relevant to decision-makers and translating new knowledge into outcomes for sustainable regional development. This paper proposes an approaches for such a systems framework. (C) 2003 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Polyketides of the pederin group are highly potent antitumor compounds found in terrestrial beetles and marine sponges. Pederin is used by beetles of the general Paederus and Paederidus as a chemical defense. We have recently identified a group of putative pederin biosynthesis genes and localized them to the genome of an as yet unculturable Pseudomonas sp. symbiont, the likely true pederin producer. However, this polyketide synthase cluster lacks several genes expected for pederin production. Here we report additional polyketide synthase encoded on a separate region of the symbiont genome. It contains at least three novel catalytic domains that are predicted to be involved in pederin chain initiation and the formation of an unusual exomethylene bond. The region is bordered by mobility pseudogenes; this suggests that gene transposition led to the disjointed cluster organization. With this work, all putative pederin genes have been identified. Their heterologous expression in a culturable bacterium will provide important insights into how sustainable sources of invertebrate-derived drug candidates can be created.

AB Leaching of ashes in sulfuric acid (pH 1.0, liquid-to-solid (L/S) ratio 10:1, 25 degreesC) has been characterized with respect to the neutralizing capacity and the dissolution of dominant ions and trace elements. The conditions mimic the oxidation stage of a biohydrometallurgical process for base metal production from sulfidic mineral concentrates. Direct acid leaching of ash, integrated with this metallurgical process, offers a feasible route to the sustainable handling of metal-rich ashes. The treated ash will be deposited together with the inert mineral residue. Cd, Co, Cu, Ni and Zn are effectively leached and can be recovered utilizing existing hydrometallurgical technology, but the recovery of other readily dissolved metals, notably Mn, U and V, requires that additional steps are implemented. We make two recommendations for industrial processes. The first is to replace limestone with ash from biofuels, except peat, for pH control in biohydrometallurgical processing. This requires a modest increase of fresh alkali compared with limestone. The second is to implement sulfuric acid leaching of fly ash from the combustion of solid waste and other metal-rich fuels (used wood, tires), thereby avoiding costly ash-deposits. There is a significant economic incentive for these changes, since no costly ash-deposits and less limestone will be needed. (C) 2001 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID EVOLUTION; COOPERATION; MECHANISM; BEHAVIOR
AB The concept of altruism is used in very different forms by computer scientists, economists, philosophers, social scientists, psychologists and biologists. Yet, in order to be useful in social simulations, the concept "altruism" requires a more precise meaning. A quantitative formulation is proposed here, based on the cost/benefit analysis of the altruist and of society at large. This formulation is applied in the analysis of the social dynamic working of behaviors that have been called "altruistic punishments", using the agent based computer model Sociodynamica. The simulations suggest that "altruistic punishment" on its own cannot maintain altruistic behaviors. "Altruistic behavior" is sustainable in the long term only if these behaviors trigger synergetic forces in society that eventually make them produce benefits to most individuals. The simulations suggest however that "altruistic punishment" may work as a "social investment", and is thus better called "decentralized social punishment". This behavior is very efficient in enforcing social norms. The efficiency of decentralized social punishment in enforcing norms was dependent on the type of labor structured of the virtual society. I conclude that what is called "altruistic punishment" emerges as a type of social investment that can evolve either through individual and/or group selection, as a successful device for changing or enforcing norms in a society. Social simulations will help us in better understanding the underlying dynamic working of such devices.

AB The main purpose of this work was to study the phytoremediation capacity of Miscanthus x giganteus to soils contaminated with heavy metals and also to evaluate the environmental risks due to its utilisation as a biomaterial. Indeed, the concentration of metals in the aerial part of the plant might represent a question of its future use. Four levels of contamination were studied: P-0 = 0 t; P-50 = 50 t; P-100 = 100 t; P-200 = 200 t domestic sludge.ha(-1). The results obtained permit to conclude that in terms of the productivity there are significant differences among the plants obtained with different levels of contamination. P50 and P100 presented significantly higher values. In relation to the ash, nitrogen and phosphorous contents, the results showed an increase in mineral matter and an accumulation in nitrogen and phosphorous, in the plants, with the increase of the level of contaminants. But this increase was not significant. No significant differences were observed in the plants among the different levels of sludge, for most of the metals studied. This fact leads to the conclusion that the utilisation of the biomass, obtained in those contaminated fields, is possible, as a biomaterial. Thus, contributing not only to increase its economical value but also to a sustainable agriculture.

DE powder metallurgy; sustainable development
AB One of the key concepts of the sustainable development definition by the World Commission on Environment and Development (1992) is the idea of limitations imposed by the state of technology and social organisation on environment's ability to meet present and future needs. A measure of the environmental impact can be stated by the equation:
   Environmental Impact = (World Population)(2) x(Standard of Living)(2)/(Environmental Efficiency of the Technology)(4)
   Regarding these concerns, together with economical and legislative reasons, today's state of the art of Powder Metallurgy (PM) fits some of the needs, targeting a higher standard of living of the population. Being a more correct approach to the production of a vast number of metal products, PM, as an improved efficiency process, leads to considerable savings amongst others, in material, energy and manpower, reducing environmental impact.
   On this paper, some of the major aspects of PM as an environmental efficiency process are stated, being quantitatively compared with real parts produced by conventional methods. Benefits of PM on automotive industry are stated as well, under the same focus.

AB Networks and flows are everywhere in society, nature and virtual world organizing versatile resources and behaviors. Breaking boundaries, this keynote establishes a scenario of the future interconnection environment - a large-scale, autonomous, live, sustainable and intelligent network environment where society, nature, and the environment harmoniously co-exist, cooperatively work and evolve. It automatically senses and collects useful information from the nature, transforms raw information into resources in the environment, and organizes resources in semantic rich normal forms that can be easily understood by both machine and human. Geographically dispersed people and resources can work in cooperation to accomplish tasks and solve problems by actively participating material flows, energy flows, technology flows, information flows, knowledge flows and service flows in the environment through roles and machines, improving the environment and the nature. Parameters, characteristics and principles of the environment are proposed from the system methodology point of view. A case study on a live semantic link network under a reference model of the environment is presented. As a practice, the advanced architecture and technology used in China Knowledge Grid e-science environment IMAGINE-1 is introduced.

TI Gendered ritual dualism in a patrilineal society: Opposition and
   complementarity in Kulere fertility cults
SO AFRICA
LA English
DT Article
ID CENTRAL NIGERIA; SPIRITS; IRIGWE
AB Although a favourable position for women is usually anticipated where they occupy important economic roles in the context of matrilineal descent, such a position may well exist in a patrilineal society, especially if women organise as in West Africa. Here there exist well-organised women's cult associations which are well known from Liberia and Sierra Leone and occur also in western Cameroon and south-eastern Nigeria. The present article demonstrates the existence of a comparable women's association in middle-belt Nigeria among the Kulere. The article focuses mainly on the manner in which through the cooperation of certain men's and women's associations 'gender symmetry' was ritually expressed in the sphere of agriculture and fertility. The practical foundation of this symmetry in fertility cults was a relatively even division of labour between the sexes and a favourable position for women in marriage, since they could decide independently whether to stay with a husband or leave him. Cult associations were predominant in public life. Women were strictly excluded from men's associations which held political-ritual offices and channelled advantages in ritual consumption to men. Notwithstanding this exclusion, women had their own association in which they could regulate their own affairs as well as pass decisions for the whole community including the men. The women's organisation held major responsibilities for the protection and the fertility of the fields, both practically as well as ritually. In this responsibility the women's association cooperated with a men's association which otherwise intimidated women. This association of males protected the fields through the presence of supernatural guardians which was sometimes staged in masquerades. The corresponding duties and cooperation of both associations were enacted ritually through the use of common shrines and when the women contacted water spirits to increase the harvest under the protection of male masqueraders. The Kulere case shows a patrilineal society where women had a relatively independent position which was publicly acknowledged through gender dualism in the ritual organisation of agriculture in which their special capabilities with respect to fertility and sustainability were recognised.

AB The 2001 Reykjavik Declaration on Responsible Fisheries in the Marine Ecosystem and the Plan of Implementation of the 2002 World Summit on Sustainable Development highlighted the need in fisheries to look beyond considering only the target species and to consider in fisheries management the impacts of fishing on the ecosystem as a whole, as well as the impacts of the ecosystem on fisheries. This paper examines the practical implications of progressing towards ecosystem approaches by reference, in particular, to the FAO technical guidelines on the topic. It goes on to examine the major fishery types in South Africa and the southern Benguela, and to consider the probable impacts of those fisheries on target species, bycatch species and the ecosystem, as well as the indirect impacts on other affected species. The review reveals that all fisheries have impacts beyond the target species and that an ecosystem approach is required in order to ensure the long-term sustainability of the living marine resources of the southern Benguela and the ecosystem as a whole. Finally, the likely obstacles to successful implementation of an ecosystem approach to fisheries in the southern Benguela are discussed.

AB Comparing multiple models applied to the same system can be highly instructive, both with regard to the system of interest and the models. In this case, three ecosystem simulation models (ECOSIM, Bay Model 2 [BM2] and the Integrated Generic Bay Ecosystem Model [IGBEM]) were tuned to data from Port Phillip Bay, Australia. ECOSIM is a dynamic biomass model; the other two are biogeochemical ecosystem models. Scenarios of environmental change (altered nutrient loading) and alternative fisheries management strategies (economically and ecologically motivated policies) are run for each model. A comparison of the predictions made by the models for these runs led to several general conclusions, first that large, shallow and enclosed bays, with many fish groups dependent on spawning stocks from outside the immediate area (e.g. Port Phillip Bay), may react more strongly to eutrophication than to fishing. The second conclusion is that a selected set of indicator groups (in this case, sharks, seagrass and chlorophyll a) seems to capture the major ecosystem impacts of alternative management scenarios. This has obvious implications for system monitoring in an adaptive management approach. The third is that multispecies or ecosystem models can identify potential impacts that a series of single-species models cannot (such as non-intuitive changes in biomass when species interactions outweigh fishery-induced pressures). Finally, policies focusing on the protection of species or groups only at higher trophic levels can fail to achieve sensible ecosystem objectives and may push systems into states that are far from pristine. These four findings have important ramifications for sustainable multiple-use management of shallow marine ecosystems.

AB A review of indicators for an ecosystem approach to fisheries management is presented, focusing on multispecies fisheries and limited resources for assessments and implementation, as often is the case in developing countries. Emphasizing the need to link indicators to management objectives, indicators from the literature are grouped into four categories, relating to the immediate fisheries resource base (single-species and multispecies indicators) and the wider ecosystem (habitat structure and ecosystem functioning). The usefulness of these indicators is assessed along three dimensions of acceptability among stakeholders, observability, and relation to fisheries management using a traffic light approach. The top ranking indicators are highlighted as a generally good start for any particular fishery management case. It is, however, argued that, even with similar management objectives, indicators need to be specific to both ecosystems and the institutional set-up if they are to be effective for management, and that indicators may consequently differ considerably between individual management applications.

AB Fertilising with phosphorus (P) ensures continuous supply of an essential growth factor as necessary for productive and sustainable agriculture. The amounts of P required to attain and maintain an adequate P status in the soil were investigated in field experiments at 22 sites in Finland on soils containing large amounts of residual fertiliser P. The effects of five rates (0, 15, 30, 45 and 60 kg ha(-1)) of annual P application were measured in the soil by chemical methods after 9 to 15 experimental years, and the changes in soil test P values (STP) were compared with P balances. Stratification of P in ley soil by broadcast application of fertilisers was assessed at four sites. The mean changes of STP in the whole topsoil caused by P fertilisation expressed as per cent of the balance difference were 3.5% (0.0159 mg dm(-3))/(kg ha(-1)) in the acid ammonium acetate test (P-Ac) 4.7% (0.0214 mg dm(-3))/(kg ha(-1)) in water extraction (P-w) and 9.7% (0.058 mg kg(-1))/(kg ha(-1)) in sodium bicarbonate extraction (modified Olsen P). Initially high P-Ac values tended to slowly decrease at zero P balance, while low values did not change without some particular reason, such as soil acidification or mixing of the topsoil with some of the less fertile subsurface soil. A thin layer of the uppermost soil was quickly enriched by broadcast application of P fertiliser.

AB Agriculture is one of the oldest and global sources of human livelihood. It has matured from simple cultivation to sophisticated practices. Collectively, this complex situation exemplifies the sustainable agriculture dilemma.
   From the symposium on "Agricultural Applications in Green Chemistry" (ACS, Orlando, 2001) and through this book we try to show that green chemistry offers an array of innovative approaches to agricultural practices and it looks for ways to accomplish more benign chemistry, through guidance by nature in agriculture. There is much to indicate opportunities for increased agricultural yield, economic benefits for manufacturers and end users, and enhanced environmental performance through this dynamic synergism.

AB The concept of sustainable agriculture is not new, and its desired characteristics are clearly stated. Green chemistry, though more novel, provides substance in scientific research and ultimately affords a path toward sustainable agriculture. The desired qualities and areas of focus in sustainable agriculture are delineated. These lead to perceived obstacles. These challenges offer to green chemistry novel possibilities for fruitful research utilizing its priciples and practices.

AB Management of organic resources plays a decisive role in the viability of mixed-farming systems in West African savannas. For this reason in this study carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) flows initiated by the different uses of organic resources were quantified in the different land-use systems of a village in southern Senegal. Livestock, crop harvest, and wood and straw collecting were responsible for, respectively, 59, 27 and 14% of the C outflows from the area exploited by the village. Livestock accounted for nearly 80% of C, N and P returns to the soil. As a result of these transfers and of on-site recycling of herbaceous biomass, high C inputs were brought to staple crops in the compound ring. Nitrogen and P depletion of the system amounted to -4 kg N and -1 kg P ha(-1) year(-1) only when other abiotic flows were included. This study also suggests that population growth is likely to rapidly alter the sustainability of this mixed-farming system at least due to a modification in the balance between the supply of and demand for organic resources.

TI Examining traditional irrigation methods, irrigation scheduling and
   alternate furrows irrigation on vertisols in northern Ethiopia
SO AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
DE alternate furrows-scientific scheduling; every furrow-scientific
   scheduling; water productivity; economic returns (productivity)
AB In northern Ethiopia, where traditional (farmers) irrigation management on Vertisols is widely practiced, sustainable food security has always been a challenge. The reasons for this are multi-dimensional, but of utmost importance is, low-tech irrigation water management. The main objective of the present study is, therefore, to examine technologies of irrigation water management that might enable farmers to increase water productivity (WP) on vertisols.
   A comparative study has been undertaken between the traditional irrigation management (every furrow-traditional scheduling) and alternative water management options on maize plots in northern Ethiopia. The options include alternate furrows-scientific scheduling and every furrow-scientific scheduling. A field experiment was undertaken over two irrigation seasons (1998/1999 and 1999/2000). Results were compared on the basis of yield, WP and economic productivity concepts.
   Yield-based comparison has shown that every furrow-scientific scheduling generates the highest yield levels followed by alternate furrows-scientific scheduling. The yield increase (by every furrow-scientific scheduling) over the traditional management was found to be 54%.
   WP-based comparison has shown that alternate furrows-scientific scheduling generates the highest WP values followed by every furrow-scientific scheduling. The increase (by alternate furrow irrigation, scientific scheduling) over the traditional irrigation management was 58%.
   Economic productivity-based comparison has shown that the highest economic return was obtained from every furrow-scientific scheduling followed by alternate furrows-scientific scheduling. The increase in income (by every furrow-scientific scheduling) over the traditional irrigation management was 54%.
   The overall observation is that depending on the availability of water and labour resources, one can decide to use either of the alternate management options to obtain economically reasonable yield. In northern Ethiopia, where water is limiting (and not labour), every furrow-scientific scheduling can be an option. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID GARDENS
AB Homegardens are considered a sustainable production system in the tropics, which contributes to biodiversity conservation. The aim of this study was the description of crop diversity, structure and management of homegardens in Central Sulawesi and their classification. In 30 homegardens randomly selected from three villages adjacent to the Lore Lindu National Park, species diversity and abundance were assessed and the Shannon index was calculated. Overall 149 crop species were identified, mainly fruit, vegetable, spice, or medicinal plants. The number of vegetation layers differed depending on age and size of homegardens. Cluster analysis of crop species composition was used to classify different garden types. Not only the spectrum of species cultivated in the homegardens but also the occurrence of these garden types was different among the three villages. This finding was supported by Sorensen's coefficient. Homegardens from one village, mainly inhabited by transmigrants, contrasted strongly with those from the other two. A markedly lower number of crop species was cultivated there, and species composition was clearly different. The number of crop species and species composition found in homegardens may be attributed to socio-economic conditions of garden keepers as well as to soil quality. Both productivity and sustainability can be enhanced, e.g., by improved soil fertility management such as applying available farm yard manure.

TI Live fences in Segou, Mali: an evaluation by their early users
SO AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article
DE adoption; cassava; household; market-gardening; tenure
AB Market-oriented production of gardening crops and cassava (Manihot utilissima) in the dry season is an increasingly frequent practice in Segou, Mali. Traditionally, these crops are protected from roaming livestock with the help of dead fences. In order to provide a sustainable alternative to dead fences, the International Centre for Research in Agroforestry (ICRAF) began promoting the use of live fences, living trees planted closely together around a field plot. This study was conducted with the first farmers to use these live fences. These farmers expressed satisfaction with the protection offered by the trees and their ability to provide a variety of medicinal, economic, and food products. The form of land tenure, the social status of farmers within their families, and the availability of labour seem to be important factors in the decision to test the live fence. This raises questions about the accessibility of this technique and its possible contribution to the social and economic differentiation of its users.

AB A fallow enriching tree, Macaranga denticulata Muell. Arg., has been shown to increase rice yield in a rotational shifting cultivation system in northern Thailand through increased accumulation of mineral nutrients. As arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi may play an important role in nutrient accumulation, AM fungi in the rhizosphere of M. denticulata and the effects of the indigenous soil inoculum on the host plant were investigated. The diversity and abundance of AM fungi were documented for the rhizosphere of M. denticulata in the field for two years. Based on morphology, 29 species of AM fungi were found in the rhizosphere of M. denticulata growing in farmers' fields. Root colonization ranged from 63.5 to 81.5% in the first year and 68.7 to 79.9% in the second year of study. The highest spore density was observed at the end of the wet season. The effects of indigenous soil inoculum, and N and P fertilizers on the host plant were investigated in pots for four months. Inoculation with soil-containing AM fungi strongly increased plant growth and nutrient contents when P was limiting but N was applied. Application of N and P together strongly depressed root colonization and spore density of AM fungi, whereas applying them separately had much less effect. AM fungi may play an important role in nutrient accumulation in M. denticulata-rich fallow and thus in nutrient cycling that is beneficial to the maintenance of upland rice yield and sustainability of the rotational shifting cultivation system.

DT Article
ID SOIL QUALITY; PRODUCTION SYSTEMS; SUSTAINABILITY; FRAMEWORK
AB Approaches to assess the effects of management practices on agro-ecosystem functions are needed. This paper describes a computer program designed to assess the relative sustainability of management practices using agronomic and environmental data. The program, entitled AgroEcosystem Performance Assessment Tool (AEPAT), utilizes performance-based index methodology to derive a relative ranking of agroecosystem performance among management practices for functions and indicators included in the procedure. The program is organized into eight major steps: Introduction, Input Files, Assign Indicators to Functions, Describe Indicators, Assign Weights, Select Output File, Calculate Agroecosystem Performance Scores, and Save Agroecosystem Project. Help windows as well as a tutorial are provided within the program to assist users through each step. Users must keep in mind the assumptions and drawbacks inherent to performance-based indices while using AEPAT. Additionally, the program requires data on many indicators to provide useful information on agroecosystem performance. Therefore, its use is intended primarily for clientele conducting long-term agroecosystem experiments.

TI Enabling households to support successful migration of AIDS orphans in
   southern Africa
SO AIDS CARE-PSYCHOLOGICAL AND SOCIO-MEDICAL ASPECTS OF AIDS/HIV
LA English
DT Article
AB Most southern African orphans are cared for by extended families but the implications of the spatial dispersal of such families are seldom recognized: orphans often have to migrate to new homes and communities. This paper, based on qualitative research conducted with children and guardians in urban and rural Lesotho and Malawi, examines orphans' migration experiences in order to assess how successful migration might best be supported. Most children found migration traumatic in the short term, but over time many settled into new environments. Although much AIDS policy in southern Africa stresses the role of communities, the burden of care lay with extended family households. Failed migrations, which resulted in renewed migration and trauma, were attributable to one of two household-level causes: orphans feeling ill-treated in their new families or changes in guardians' circumstances. Policy interventions to reduce disruption and trauma for young AIDS migrants should aim at facilitating sustainable arrangements by enabling suitable households to provide care. Reducing the economic costs of caring for children, particularly school-related costs, would: allow children to stay with those relatives ( e. g. grandparents) best able to meet their non-material needs; reduce resentment of foster children in impoverished households; and diminish the need for multiple migrations.

AB In the course of time, forests and their utilization steadily gained importance for mankind. Woodlands initially served solely to cover an individual's elemental needs. When mining came into being, timber was then used for many other purposes and thus, systematic forestry was developed. Exploitation and timber scarcity resulted in strict regulations and mandatory reforestation. The principles of sustainability in timber utilization were increasingly prevalent.
   New tools were developed, the one-man saw was introduced and the new labor sytems, processes and methods transformed forest labor to forest technology, characterized by the use of modern machinery.
   Apart from increasing performance and reducing costs, we now need to throttle energy consumption in machinery, use low-pollutant fuel, minimize damaged soils, stands and timber and develop computer-aided applications (functions and accessibility maps).

AB Objectives.-Goals and objectives of the APA/HRSA National Faculty Development Scholars Program are described in a companion article in this supplement. Program objectives of the Community-Based Teaching Track were to 1) identify individuals with faculty development skills to serve as regional leaders, conducting local and regional workshops; 2) create a national network of leaders, thereby promoting sustainability; and 3) increase educational contributions of office-based preceptors. Participant objectives were to 1) meet expectations of the program; 2) possess knowledge, skills, and attitudes needed to recruit and retain community-based preceptors; 3) possess knowledge and skills needed to conduct faculty development workshops for practitioners; and 4) form local and national collegial networks.
   Methods.-Academicians and practitioners were selected to form 2 cohorts, starting in 1999 (N=20) and 2000 (N=22), respectively. Workshops were developed on the basis of projected needs and iterative needs assessments of the participants. Each participant was required to conduct workshops between meetings, first locally and then regionally or nationally.
   Outcomes.-Forty-two participants conducted 307 workshops attended by 3815 individuals. Participants reported specific knowledge and skills gained from the program and increases in multiple areas of competence. Networks were formed, leading to collaborative regional and national presentations and formation of an APA Faculty Development Special Interest Group. Participants reported increased recruitment of training sites and preceptors, with enhanced relationships.
   <LF>Conclusion.-Program and participant objectives of the Community-Based Teaching Track were met, including implementation of multiple new workshops, development of skills, and creation of a support network to enhance the sustainability of that success.

SO ANNALS OF APPLIED BIOLOGY

DT Article
ID CHALLENGE; WHEAT
AB A European Commission sponsored conference on the "Optimisation of Water Use by Plants in the Mediterranean, OPTIMISE" (INCO-MED ICA3CT-2002-50005) was held in Palma de Mallorca, Balearic Islands, Spain in March 2003. The aim of the workshop was to bridge the gap between cutting edge research scientists working in molecular, genetic physiological and environmental research, with the end users of their science. More significantly, this workshop aimed to ensure that research scientists were fully aware of the needs of the politicians, policy makers and agronomists. OPTIMISE specifically targeted contact between the EU and the Mediterranean partner countries (Algeria, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco, Palestine Authority, Syria, Tunisia and Turkey).
   Water is essential for sustaining human and environmental health. Where fresh water supplies are limited, sustainable development and stability require the efficient management of water resources. Water is already scarce in up to 10 Eastern and Southern Mediterranean countries. Agriculture is by far the largest user of water resources accounting for around 75% of consumption. However, forecasts suggest that demand for agricultural products will double to support population growth forecasts for the Mediterranean, but drought is the major constraint for growing many crops. The predicted change in climate as a result of global warming and salinisation of coastal aquifers, will further exacerbate the situation (Wang et al., 2003) and also impact on natural ecosystems (Clary et al., 2004).
   Increasing the efficiency of water use within agricultural systems is critical to ensure food security and stability of agricultural production systems. Despite several initiatives there is still a gap between the research scientists and politicians and agronomists. Recent advances in molecular and genetic research have added substantially to our understanding of basic biological processes that may lead to novel technologies. To exploit these fully it is vital to improve communication between research scientists and end-users (policy makers and politicians for policy determination - agronomists for sustainable production).
   Developing germplasm to match the complex ecosystems, requires exploitation and integration of a variety of technologies (Humphreys et al., 2003; Thomas, 2003; Elouafi & Nachit, 2004). The correlation of phenotype with the pattern of gene expression (the transcriptome) may be considered one way of bridging the gap between genotype and phenotype (Wilson et al., 2003). Underpinning some approaches to crop improvement, is the ability to routinely transform major crop species (e.g. wheat, Pastori et al., 2001; Sparks et al., 2001) and to identify key genes and regulatory elements by tagging or mutagenesis (e.g. wheat, Salguero et al., 2002). However, the more traditional disciplines such as crop physiology, still have an important role to play in providing a better understanding of the physiological and morphological traits associated with desired characteristics such as crop yield and quality, resource use efficiency and tolerance of drought (Masclaux et al., 2001; Slafer, 2003; Araus et al., 2003; Forster et al., 2004; Lefi et al., 2004). In addition, the contribution of effective management of the available water resource through agronomic practice cannot be ignored (Peterson & Westfall, 2004).

AB In the Great Plains of North America potential evaporation exceeds precipitation during most months of the year. About 75% of the annual precipitation is received from April through September, and is accompanied by high temperatures and low relative humidity. Dryland agriculture in the Great Plains has depended on wheat production in a wheat-fallow agroecosystern (one crop year followed by a fallow year). Historically this system has used mechanical weed control practices during the fallow period, which leaves essentially no crop residue cover for protection against soil erosion and greatly accelerates soil organic carbon oxidation. This paper reviews the progress made in precipitation management in the North American Great Plains and synthesises data from an existing long-term experiment to demonstrate the management principles involved.
   The long-term experiment was established in 1985 to identify dryland crop and soil management systems that would maximize precipitation use efficiency (maximization of biomass production per unit of precipitation received), improve soil productivity, and increase economic return to the farmers in the West Central portion of the Great Plains. Embedded within the primary objective are subobjectives that focus on reducing the amount of summer fallow time and reversing the soil degradation that has occurred in the wheat-fallow cropping system.
   The experiment consists of four variables: 1) Climate regime; 2) Soils; 3) Management systems; and 4) Time. The climate variable is based on three levels of potential evapotranspiration (ET), which are represented by three sites in eastern Colorado. All sites have annual long-term precipitation averages of approximately 400-450 mm, but vary in growing season open pan evaporation from 1600 mm in the north to 1975 mm in the south. The soil variable is represented by a catenary sequence of soils at each site. Management systems, the third variable, differ in the amount of summer fallow time and emphasize increased crop diversity. All systems are managed with no-till techniques. The fourth variable is time, and the results presented in this paper are for the first 12 yr (3 cycles of the 4-yr system). Comparing yields of cropping systems that differ in cycle length and systems that contain fallow periods, when no crop is produced, is done with a technique called "annualisation". Yields are "annualised" by summing yields for all crops in the system and dividing by the total number of years in the system cycle. For example in a wheat-fallow system the wheat yield is divided by two because it takes 2 yr to produce one crop.
   Cropping system intensification increased annualised grain and crop residue yields by 75 to 100% compared to wheat-fallow. Net return to farmers increased by 25% to 45% compared to wheat-fallow. Intensified cropping systems increased soil organic C content by 875 and 1400 kg ha(-1), respectively, after 12 yr compared to the wheat-fallow system. All cropping system effects were independent of climate and soil gradients, meaning that the potential for C sequestration exists in all combinations of climates and soils. Soil C gains were directly correlated to the amount of crop residue C returned to the soil. Improved macroaggregation was also associated with increases in the C content of the aggregates. Soil bulk density was reduced by 0.01g cm(-1) for each 1000 kg ha(-1) of residue addition over the 12-yr period, and each 1000 kg ha(-1) of residue addition increased effective porosity by 0.3%. No-till practices have made it possible to increase cropping intensification beyond the traditional wheat-fallow system and in turn water-use efficiency has increased by 30% in West Central Great Plains agroecosystems. Cropping intensification has also provided positive feedbacks to soil productivity via the increased amounts of crop residue being returned to the soil.

AB Mediterranean environments are characterised by cool wet winters and hot dry summers. While native vegetation in Mediterranean-climatic zones usually comprises a mixture of perennial and annual plants, agricultural development in the Mediterranean-climatic region of Australia has led to the clearing of the perennial vegetation and its replacement with annual crops and pastures. In the Mediterranean environments of southern Australia this has led to secondary (dryland) salinisation. In order to slow land degradation, perennial trees and pasture species are being reintroduced to increase the productivity of the saline areas.
   The annual crops and pastures that form the backbone of dryland farming systems in the Mediterranean-climatic zone of Australia are grown during the cool wet winter months on incoming rainfall and mature during spring and early summer as temperatures and rates of evaporation rise and rainfall decreases. Thus, crop and pasture growth is usually curtailed by terminal drought. Where available, supplementary irrigation in spring can lead to significant increases in yield and water use efficiency. In order to sustain production of annual crops in Mediterranean environments, both agronomic and genetic options have been employed. An analysis of the yield increases of wheat in Mediterranean-climatic regions shows that there has generally been an increase in the yields over the past decades, albeit at a lower rate than in more temperate regions. Approximately half of this increase can be attributed to agronomic improvements and half to genetic improvements. The agronomic improvements that have been utilised to sustain the increased yields include earlier planting to more closely match crop growth to rainfall distribution, use of fertilisers to increase early growth, minimum tillage to enable earlier planting and increase plant transpiration at the expense of soil evaporation, rotations to reduce weed control and disease incidence, and use of herbicides, insecticides and fungicides to reduce losses from weeds, insects and disease. Genetic improvements include changing the phenological development to better match the rainfall, increased early vigour, deeper rooting, osmotic adjustment, increased transpiration efficiency and improved assimilate storage and remobilisation.
   Mediterranean environments that are subjected annually to terminal drought can be both environmentally and economically sustainable, but to maximise plant water use efficiency while maintaining crop productivity requires an understanding of the interaction between genotypes, environment and management.

AB This study addresses the sustainable use of water resources in the Mediterranean basin, particularly in the Southern and Eastern parts of the region, and the many problems generated by water scarcity and misuse. Water economy in the region is beset by two specific problems: high irrigation needs and changes in consumer demands (especially after population shifts from rural to urban areas and because of increasing tourism and industrialisation). The challenges presented by the water crisis are even greater because of growing populations and estimated future climatic changes in the region. The integrated management of limited water resources in the Southern and Eastern parts of the Mediterranean involves several areas of research. Those most directly related with agriculture concern improving water (and nutrient) use in agriculture through the management and breeding of irrigated and rain-fed crops. However, these fields of research address only one face of a multi-factorial equation that affects water sustainability in the region. Thus, other research fields include the design of comprehensive water policies and integrated planning, and technologies for advanced water treatment and re-use. Moreover, local problems and socio-economic aspects must be considered when addressing research issues.

AB Two challenges for researchers of school-based action are to identify effective approaches to prevent problem behaviors and promote positive youth development and to support the widespread implementation and sustainability of evidence-based preschool through high school practice. In this article, the authors describe integrated social, emotional, and academic education as a useful framework for conceptualizing school-based positive youth development programming. We then review findings from selected exemplary studies and research syntheses to support this perspective. We conclude with guidelines for implementing integrated social, emotional, and academic learning programs.

AB We studied the oxygen consumption of two megachilid bees (Hymenoptera: Megachilidae), Megachile rotundata (F.) and Osmia lignaria Say, at selected, biologically relevant intervals throughout their respective life cycles. The U-shaped oxygen consumption curve and the static weights of wintering (nonfeeding) prepupae that we observed during the life cycle of M. rotundata support previous arguments for a winter diapause similar to that observed in other Hymenoptera. For O. lignaria, which overwinters as an adult, we found stepwise increases in oxygen consumption and continuous weight loss throughout the wintering period. However, our observations on adult O. lignaria wintering requirements are consistent with the previously published results for overwintering M. rotundata prepupae and reveal sharply increasing survival rates when wintered for a minimum of 3 mo. We interpret the greatly reduced survival in both M. rotundata and O. lignaria, as an indication that a critical biological process, diapause, is disrupted among individuals wintered for <3 mo. In the continued development of these two species as commercial scale pollinators on an ever-increasing list of target crops, any similarities or contrasts observed between the "summer bee," M. rotundata, and the "spring bee," O. lignaria, although of interest from a biological perspective, will probably have important implications in the continued development of sustainable population management protocols.

SO ANNALS OF TOURISM RESEARCH

DT Article
DE sustainable; standards; certification; GATS; trade
AB Programs to certify "green" or sustainable tourism standards are rapidly growing, and it is possible that certification might change in function and effect from awarding excellence to becoming defacto requirements to trade. Because certification often relies on governmental support, it could be perceived as an anti-competitive barrier to trade in the context of international practice such as the General Agreement on Trade in Services, which could reduce the appeal of standards as a self-regulatory method. This paper provides a pro-sustainability standards reading of the agreement and related World Trade Organization documents to discuss what policies and practices might be criticized as trade-restrictive and provides arguments against such criticisms.

AB This paper describes a cohesive, integrated full life cycle product reliability and safety management process and an electronic database tool to facilitate the process. This system a) collects field failure data b) tracks/drives corrective actions c) pulls the lessons learned from the corrective actions d) places those lessons learned in the proactive analysis tools used in product development e) drives product development to use the proactive analysis tools f) keeps a library of proactive analyses to act as guides for future development g) provides the proactive analysis for direct use by a root cause team driving to analyze and correct a field failure h) tracks and drives all activities - allowing instant summary "dashboards" or "scorecards" to be created. Proactive and Reactive records are stored coincidently in a single database system - allowing real-time feedback. Reactive case resolution teams can tap into the development analyses or development teams can incorporate all relevant lessons learned from reactive case resolutions. All tools are attached to the database - to drive consistant usage and facilitate the integration of analysis libraries. All activities are mapped to a business process with pre-specified milestones and tracked to target dates - making this a real-time product reliability and safety management tool. Each record instantly becomes an ISO 9001 controlled quality record upon closure. A record tree structure allows cases/records to follow the configuration management of the product. The culmination of these features allows the user community to achieve product safety and reliability business management system over the full life cycle of a product. After two years of implementation and continuous improvement, a fundamental truth is proven. The process will only be sustainable and the database tool will only achieve long term success if the users feel their personal workflow facilitated by the system.

AB The modem technological society mobilizes and uses a very large number of materials. These substances are derived from rocks, sediments, and other natural repositories, and most undergo transformation prior to use. A large fraction of the materials is eventually returned to the environment. Natural processes do the same but not necessarily with the same suite of materials. For purposes of better understanding industrial development and potential environmental impact, it is important to know, even approximately, the elemental cycles of all materials potentially useful for modem technology. In this review, we examine and summarize cycle information for 77 of the first 92 elements in the periodic table. Mobilization calculations demonstrate that human activities likely dominate or strongly perturb the cycles of most of the elements other than the alkalis, alkali earths, and halogens. We propose that this pattern is ultimately related to the aqueous solubilities of the predominant chemical forms of the elements as they occur in nature: Human action dominates the cycles of the elements whose usual forms are highly insoluble, nature those that are highly soluble. Examples of the utility of anthropogenically dominated cycle determinations for resource supply analyses, environmental impact assessment, and public policy are presented and discussed. If the rapid rise in the use of materials by the technological society in the twentieth century continues into the next century, anthropogenic dominance of the cycling of a majority of the elements of the periodic table will only increase.

AB No other industry in the United States uses more materials by weight than the construction industry. Because of its economic strength and societal importance, it is also a significant polluter and a target of growing stakeholder scrutiny. This review offers an extended, supply chain inclusive framework for the study of the construction industry that serves all the life-cycle stages of society's infrastructure Systems, and it summarizes selected literature on the life-cycle environmental assessment of construction materials, designs, and processes. On the basis of identified knowledge gaps, a research agenda is discussed for lesser-studied questions in order to first understand and then eventually reduce the environmental impacts of construction materials, processes, and activities.

AB A management system of individual transferable quotas was introduced in the Tasmanian commercial rock lobster fishery in 1998. The market for quota units has since become increasingly capitalised. Fishers without substantial wealth find it difficult to participate in this market. Instead, investors purchase quota units. Consequently, fishery managers are somewhat disillusioned with the hidden hand of the market and are seeking a different way to conceptualise what is happening in the fishery. Marx's writings on the hidden abode of production suggest one such way. I bring Marx's work together with quota management and the views of participants as an alternative way of framing these changes in the fishery.

TI Polymer type and aluminum chloride affect screened solids and phosphorus
   removal from liquid dairy manure
SO APPLIED ENGINEERING IN AGRICULTURE
LA English

DE phosphorus; water quality; solids; liquid manure
ID SWINE MANURE; AGRICULTURAL PHOSPHORUS; SEPARATION
AB Solids removal in flushed dairy systems by mechanical solid separators is about 20% efficient, resulting in several management problems. Due to the daily solids influx into the lagoon, storage capacity is continually reduced and frequent pumping is required to maintain capacity. Since the liquid portion of the waste is consistently applied to the same areas, soil test phosphorus (P) levels rapidly increase above crop needs, thus increasing the environmental risk of P loss in the runoff. A more sustainable system must be developed that dramatically reduces the solids and P content in liquid manure prior to reaching the lagoon. This project evaluated the effectiveness of different polyacrylamides (PAMs or polymers) and aluminum (Al), alone and in combination, for removing solids and P from liquid dairy manure.
   The eight different PAMs evaluated ranged in charge (-, 0, and +) and charge density (high, medium, and low). After testing the PAMs alone and in comparison to the control, the cationic (+) PAMs significantly increased solids removal by almost two times and reduced the amount of total P (TP) in the filtrate by one quarter The addition of Al in combination with both anionic (-) and cationic (+) PAMs increased removal of both solids and TP; however the concentration range over which the cationic PAMs exhibited an increase in solids and TP removal was wider and more consistent than the anionic PAMs. Combinations of Al and PAM decreased the TP retained in the filtrate by as much as three times when compared to the control. Treatment concentrations of Al was the only factor affecting the amount of soluble reactive P (SRP) retained in the filtrate with some treatments producing <5% retention.

AB Effective application of livestock manures on rice paddy fields provides nutrient recycling and can improve the environmental sustainability of animal operations. However current manure slurry application methods have two major disadvantages: poor application uniformity and nuisance odor emissions. The objective of this study was to develop and evaluate a multi-hose manure spreader for use in rice paddies with reduced odor emissions and increased application uniformity when compared to currently used systems. Both swine and dairy slurries were applied to a 0.5-ha field. The multi-hose spreader showed improved application uniformity and reduced odor intensity compared to the conventional splash-plate applicator Splash-plate spreaders are generally reported to have a coefficient of variation of approximately 25% to 27% (not tested in this study), while coefficients of variation for the multi-hose spreader ranged from 7% to 14%. Odor indices measured using three different methods all indicated that the multi-hose spreader notably reduced odor emissions. Additionally, it was determined that the highest application uniformity was achieved with a high rotor speed (250 to 330 rpm) for both dairy and swine slurries. Higher rotor speeds provided more pressure in the distributor resulting in more uniform distribution.

TI Hydrogeochemical processes in shallow quaternary aquifers from the

SO APPLIED GEOCHEMISTRY

DT Article
ID EVOLUTION
AB Groundwater is the most important source of water supply in Datong city. However, the levels of shallow Quaternary groundwaters from urbanized areas have been declining continuously and groundwater quality deteriorating in recent years. Understanding the geochemical evolution of groundwater is important for sustainable development of the water resources in Datong. Mineral hydrolysis of alumino-silicate minerals such as plagioclase and clinopyroxene, is the primary process controlling the concentration of H4SiO4 in the study area. Speciation calculations using the geochemical modeling code PHREEQC indicated that hydrolysis of bedrock, mainly composed of basalt and metamorphic rocks, is the major hydrogeochemical process controlling groundwater chemistry. The study area can be divided into 3 hydrogeochemical zones: A. Recharge (unimpacted) zone, B. Intermediate (industry-impacted) zone, and C. Discharge (agriculture-impacted) zone. Ion exchange and industrial and/or agricultural contamination contribute to the increase of Na+ from Zone A to Zone C, where the concentration of NO3- is up to 461.5 mg/l with a mean value of 101.5 mg/l, indicating that agricultural practice seriously affects groundwater. Sulfate concentration in groundwaters in an alluvial fan at Datong is extremely high, up to 1172.9 mg/l, and shows a close relationship with the concentrations of trace elements, especially Ni and Co, indicating that coal mining is the main contamination source for groundwater from the alluvial fan, in addition to agricultural activities.

AB Indicators are commonly recommended as tools for assessing the attainment of development, and the current vogue is for aggregating a number of indicators together into a single index. It is claimed that such indices of development help facilitate maximum impact in policy terms by appealing to those who may not necessarily have technical expertise in data collection, analysis and interpretation. In order to help counter criticisms of over-simplification, those advocating such indices also suggest that the raw data be provided so as to allow disaggregation into component parts and hence facilitate a more subtle interpretation if a reader so desires. This paper examines the problems involved with interpreting indices of development by focusing on the United Nations Development Programmes (UNDP) Human Development Index (HDI) published each year in the Human Development Reports (HDRs). The HDI was intended to provide an alternative to the more economic based indices, such as GDP, commonly used within neo-liberal development agendas. The paper explores the use of the HDI as a gauge of human development by making comparisons between two major political and economic communities in Africa (ECOWAS and SADC). While the HDI did help highlight important changes in human development as expressed by the HDI over 10 years, it is concluded that the HDI and its components are difficult to interpret as methodologies have changed significantly and the 'averaging' nature of the HDI could hide information unless care is taken. The paper discusses the applicability of alternative models to the HDI such as the more neo-populist centred methods commonly advocated for indicators of sustainable development.

AB This paper analyses factors influencing the adoption of land management practices in two mountain watersheds of Nepal based on information collected through a questionnaire survey of 300 households. Farmers in both watersheds have adopted several types of structural and biological land management practices to control land degradation. The stepwise multiple linear regression model ran using SPSS revealed 10 variables significantly influencing the adoption of land management technologies. The variables found significant are: extension service, caste affiliation of farmers, household agricultural labor force, landholdings with fluvents, dystrochrepts, and rhodustalfs soils, training on land management, schooling period of the household head, participation in joint land management activities, and landslide density in farmlands. The predicted R value of 0.62, R square of 0.37, and adjusted R square of 0.35 indicate moderate explanatory power of the model as a whole. However, the acceptance of the variables included in the model helps us to draw very useful policy conclusions for sustainable land management. All above mentioned variables have positive influence on the adoption of land management technologies, but remarkably, extension services were revealed as the strongest factor influencing the adoption of technologies. This indicates the positive influence of the extension service provided by the Phewatal Management Project and the need for provision of similar type extension service for farmers elsewhere in the hills of Nepal.

DE traditional ecological knowledge; sustainable development;
   community-based natural resource management; controlled-hunting area
AB The advent of community-based natural resource management (CBNRM) in Botswana in the late 1980s ushered in a new paradigm in natural resource management. The strategy marked a change from state-controlled to community-controlled wildlife management. The expectation is that under community control, local expertise on biodiversity, termed in this paper as traditional ecological knowledge (TEK), plays a significant role that is supposedly facilitated through local institutions and traditional practices. This paper examines the incorporation of TEK in the CBNRM projects in KD 1, which is a controlled-hunting area (CHA) in the north-western part of the Kgalagadi North sub-district, Botswana and illustrates that the projects acknowledge and demonstrate the utility value of TEK in sustainable natural resource management. It concludes that TEK systems and institutions could serve as entry points into sustainable natural resource utilisation and management. This could be achieved through the exploration of cultural practices of the local people and integrating useful aspects into the modern natural resource management expertise. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

AB We tested the hypotheses that management of the soil food web in the fall would enhance grazing on bacteria and fungi by microbivorous nematodes in the spring, consequently increasing N availability in cover-crop driven organic and low-input farming systems. The food web was manipulated by irrigating the dry soil of late summer and/or providing carbon sources. By creating conditions conducive for biological activity, we increased the abundance of bacterivore and fungivore nematodes in the fall and the following spring. Greater biological activity in the soil enhanced concentrations of mineral N available to the subsequent summer tomato crop. Mineral N concentration in the spring was associated with abundance of bacterivore nematodes, and with the corresponding Enrichment Index (EI) provided by nematode community analysis. Because environmental conditions that favour increase of bacterivore nematodes probably also favour other microbial grazers, including protozoa, the abundance of bacterivore nematodes may be an indicator of overall grazing activity and N mineralisation rates from soil fauna. Decomposition pathways in the spring, inferred from nematode bioindicators, were dominated by bacteria in plots that had been irrigated the previous fall while fungi were more prevalent in those that had not. The responses of omnivore and predator nematodes to our treatments were not consistent and there was no evidence that regulation of opportunist species by predators would be enhanced by the management practices imposed.

AB For millennia oasis agriculture has been the backbone of rural livelihood in the desertic Sultanate of Oman. However, little is known about the functioning of these oasis systems, in particular with respect to the C turnover. The objective was to determine the effects of crop, i.e. alfalfa, wheat and bare fallow on the CO2 evolution rate during an irrigation cycle in relation to changes in soil water content and soil temperature. The gravimetric soil water content decreased from initially 24% to approximately 16% within 7 days after irrigation. The mean CO2 evolution rates increased significantly in the order fallow (27.4 mg C m(-2) h(-1)) < wheat (45.5 mg C m(-2) h(-1)) < alfalfa (97.5 mg C m(-2) h(-1)). It can be calculated from these data that the CO2 evolution rate of the alfalfa root system was nearly four times higher than the corresponding rate in the wheat root system. The decline in CO2 evolution rate, especially during the first 4 days after irrigation, was significantly related to the decline in the gravimetric water content, with r = 0.70. CO2 evolution rate and soil temperature at 5 cm depth were negatively correlated (r = -0.56, n = 261) due to increasing soil temperature with decreasing gravimetric water content.

AB Species diversification is today considered as a major issue for the sustainable development of the Mediterranean aquaculture. For successful propagation of any species however, larval rearing is considered a bottleneck and therefore the development of appropriate tools is essential. Mesocosm is a semi-intensive technology that facilitates larval rearing of several species integrating principles of both intensive and extensive aquaculture, which solves biological problems and many of their technical, human and economical consequences. The extensive ( and now even the semi-extensive) strategy is used in the most critical segments of the rearing process during the early developmental stages, when larvae are still extremely weak, sensitive to intensive environment, easily stressed and difficult to feed. The intensive strategy is used as soon as larvae are considered mature enough to be reared easily using classical methods. The technology was used for the rearing of two species, with potential for aquaculture, the sharpsnout seabream (Diplodus puntazzo) and the white seabream ( Diplodus sargus sargus). Three groups of each species were monitored for a period of 50 - 70 days post hatching. Survival for both species was about 54% at the end of the trials. Sharpsnout seabream larvae reached 19.6 =/- 0.9 mm total length and 107.2 +/- 31.9 mg body weight 50 days post hatching. White seabream larvae 60 days post hatching reached 32.7 +/- 2.7 mm total length and 450 +/- 70 mg body weight. In order to verify the economical viability of the technology, the individual production cost for each species was estimated and reached E0.027 for white seabream and E0.043 for sharpsnout seabream. Results indicate the reliability of the technology for the larval rearing of the two species.

AB The extensive zero-water exchange shrimp farming system in the periphery of Chilka lagoon (Orissa, India) was studied. The study aimed to describe this unique farming system with special reference to dynamics of macrozoobenthos, production characteristics and economics. The study conducted was based on a general survey as well as monitoring of five individual farms over a complete production cycle. The fanning practice in this area is characterized by complete absence of water exchange during rearing. Ponds in this area are generally shallow (mean 72 cm). Most of the water and soil quality characteristics of these farms are within acceptable levels. Macrozoobenthos belonging to 12 taxa were collected, amphipods (81%) and polychaetes (13%) being most numerous. Overall macrobenthic density of farms studied varied from 968 to 11,470 individuals/m(2) with a gross mean of 5644 individuals/m(2). There was no general pattern to the variation in abundance of various taxa in different phases of the rearing cycle, suggesting a low predatory pressure by shrimp in the farms studied. Shrimp production was highly variable (91-250 kg/ha), but generally low with a mean of 145 kg/ha. The net income of these farms was estimated to be Rs. 63,250 per crop per ha. Compared with shrimp farming system with regular water exchange in the same area, Chilka farms generated high benefit-cost ratio indicating high profitability and sustainability.

AB 1. Some of the key life history characteristics that make modular marine invertebrates such as corals vulnerable to disturbance and stress are susceptibility to damage, slow growth, longevity, and philopatry. This may be particularly so for marginal populations at the limits of their range and, for instance, that are attractive to scuba divers.
   2. In this study we examined the population structure and incidence of damage, quantified growth rates and estimated gene flow to assess the effects of divers on the deep-water emergent populations of the fragile red coral Errina novaezelandiae in the Te Awaatu Marine Reserve in Fiordland, New Zealand.
   3. We found that population structure in red corals is skewed, with small colonies the most abundant. Damage was up to eight times higher in dived than in non-dived populations of red coral, and large colonies were more likely to be damaged. Growth in red corals can be high (up to 7 cm yr(-1)), although net growth is much lower (0.7 cm yr(-1)) due to the effects of partial mortality. On the basis of the slow growth rate, we estimate that large corals (> 20 cm diameter) will be in excess of 30 yr old. We also found high genetic subdivision among red coral populations and evidence of inbreeding, indicative of limited larval dispersal among neighbouring populations.
   4. Overall, our results indicate the shallow-water populations of red coral in Fiordland will be susceptible to impacts from scuba diving, and the development of a management strategy to ensure ecologically sustainable tourism and to minimize the effects of divers will be essential for their conservation.

AB Along with the growing body of knowledge of seamount ecosystems has come the realisation that the targeting of associated fish populations is currently unsustainable. For the most part, the target species are long-lived and slow to mature, with low fecundity. Benthic communities are also seriously damaged through disturbance by fishing gear and exotic species collection and could be impacted further in the future by exploitation of marine mineral resources. At current levels of knowledge concerning the structure and integration of seamount ecosystems, and in the light of experience with associated fisheries to date, Sustainable exploitation cannot be envisaged. Accordingly, an holistic conservation strategy is required. This paper explores the elements of such a strategy based upon defining seamounts as fishery no-take zones and as areas protected from the full spectrum of human activities. Given the apparent individuality of seamount systems studied so far, this paper argues that a protective regime must be based on a large network of well-managed marine protected areas (MPAs), encompassing seamounts in all biogeographic zones, in order to conserve biodiversity effectively.

DT Article
AB A close, inseparable, and historical relationship with the land and its resources has become one of the central features of the cultures of indigenous peoples throughout the world, including the Inuit. The intimate attachment and sense of belonging to the landscape emphasize local bonds to place, as well as the extensive time span in which people have experienced it. This concern with locality is, among other things, framing the political use of local knowledge. Senses of locality and attachment to place have become important ingredients in the sustainability discourse in the Arctic as well as around the world. The article examines conflicts over caribou hunting and dog sledge versus snowmobile use in a discussion of the possibilities and limitations of such an emphasis on locality.

AB Salt-affected black soils (Vertic Haplustepts), due to high salinity and nutrient deficiency associated with erratic rainfall pattern pose management problems for sustainable agriculture. Cultivation of economic halophytes is considered as an alternative management strategy for bringing such problematic soils under production. Salvadora persica, a facultative halophyte and a good source of seed oil has been found to be highly salt tolerant. Attempts have been made to develop the agro-management strategies for its domestication. The growth, biomass and seed and oil yield of S. persica grown on highly saline black soil with salinity ranging from 25 to 65 dS m(-1) and cost/benefit ratio are reported in this article along with its cultivation and other uses. The seed yield declined by 40-47% at high salinity of 55-65 dS m(-1) when compared to that of 25-35 dS m(-1). The seed oil content, however, did not vary much under these salinity classes. The study indicated Salvadora persica, a medium-sized tree can be cultivated for restoration of highly saline black soils which are not suitable for conventional arable farming.

AB The paper deals with support of natural intelligence employing the concept of two factors utility which characterizes the sustainable development. The first factor represents the long-term expected profit of generalized capital investment.
   The second factor represents the worse case profit necessary for survival of crises. Using that concept it is possible to support the individual decisions connected with choosing the best alternative.

AB There has been a rapid and remarkable recovery in Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, China, during the 1990s, of a distinctive cuisine whose origins can be traced back to, at least, the building of the Grand Canal between Beijing and Hangzhou in the 600s AD and the stimulus to trade and migration, that was provided. This, along with exceptional health indices in the region, provides a basis for a new integrative study of the food chain, food culture and food science in regard to the human condition, which would be manifest by the degree of environmental sustainability, economic progress, social cohesion, health status, well-being and happiness that these dimensions of "food for humans" should support. Collectively, these have rarely been subject to systematic scholarly pursuit. Through the endeavours of the Zhejiang Association for Science and Technology, representing some 150000 professionals and the international community, represented principally by the International Union of Nutritional Sciences (IUNS) and its partners in WHO, the FAO Network of Excellence and the Hangzhou University of Commerce, this field has been brought together through the papers in this issue of Asia Pacific Journal of Clinical Nutrition. The report builds on related endeavours in recent times, notably "The Okinawan Roundtable on Nutrition and Cardiovascular Disease" which recognizes the exceptional and distinguishing features of the Okinawan diet in health protection, and the assessment of the place of fatty fruits, like red palm fruit amongst "North and West African Foods".

AB Migration challenges traditional female roles, yet Asian immigrant women's hold on their ethnic heritage usually remains quite strong. Daughters of Asian immigrants thus live much of their childhood wedged between two cultures. The intense pressure to conform to American ideals while retaining ethnic customs results in a perplexing sense of duality. Five young adult Asian-American daughters were interviewed about their experiences, with particular emphasis on the impact of Asian cultural tradition on their fives. In their own words, these young women discuss Asian concepts of family, child rearing, and daring customs. Analysis reflects the unique ways these daughters choose to maintain their Asian heritage.

AB This paper presents the findings of a knowledge audit conducted to determine the knowledge requirements of a large service-based enterprise in South Africa. The objective of the knowledge audit was to identify and describe the current and future knowledge requirements of the enterprise. The results indicated that employees have some basic knowledge and information needs that must be satisfied before any further investigations take place. Once the fundamental building blocks of knowledge content are established, it is recommended that more sophisticated solutions can be developed. Broad recommendations for establishing a knowledge management strategy that will be a source of sustainable competitive advantage are proposed.

AB A series of seed and seedling studies was undertaken in northern New South Wales for the temperate perennial grasses phalaris ( Phalaris aquatica cv. Sirosa and Australian), tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea cv. Demeter), perennial ryegrass ( Lolium perenne cv. Kangaroo Valley), and 2 wallaby grasses (Austrodanthonia bipartita syn. Danthonia linkii cv. Bunderra and A. richardsonii syn. D. richardsonii cv. Taranna). Studies were conducted to determine the level of dormancy in freshly harvested seed and the time required to overcome it, effects of alternating daily temperatures on the germination of non-dormant seed, effect of time-of-sowing on seedling emergence ( 2 studies) and survival, levels of seed production and soil seedbanks, and the effect of litter cover and soil type on the emergence of Sirosa phalaris seedlings.
   Grass species, time, and their interaction all had a significant effect ( P < 0.05) on both dispersal unit and caryopses germination. One month after harvest, germination of caryopses was lower ( P < 0.05, 2 and 1%, respectively) for Taranna and Bunderra than for Sirosa (79.5%). In March 1993, germination of the 2 wallaby grasses was also lower ( P < 0.05) than that of Sirosa. Dormancy of freshly harvested seeds of Sirosa was mainly associated with the structures surrounding the caryopses (7.7 v. 79.5% mean germination), but for Taranna and Bunderra it was related to physiological dormancy of the caryopses.
   Germination levels that were not significantly different to the maximum occurred for temperature ranges of 35/30 - 15/10 &DEG;C [ Sirosa ( commercial)], 35/25 - 15/10 &DEG;C ( Australian phalaris), and 35/30 - 15/05 &DEG;C ( Kangaroo Valley ryegrass). In contrast, maximum germination of wallaby grasses only occurred for Taranna in the temperature range 25/20 - 20/10 &DEG;C, and for Bunderra at 25/15 and 20/15 &DEG;C.
   Seedling emergence in the field was episodic, occurring on only 3 occasions from 1993 to 1996. No seedlings of Sirosa phalaris, Demeter tall fescue, or Kangaroo Valley ryegrass were successfully recruited, but Taranna and Bunderra successfully recruited new plants from natural seedfalls. Whereas seed production of the perennial grasses studied was relatively high (&SIM; 10000 seed/m(2) in 1992), soil seedbank levels were much lower ( generally < 1000 seeds/m(2)). These data were used to indicate the likely successful establishment of sown perennial grasses or by regeneration from natural seedfall.

SO AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH

DE skimming wells; raingun sprinkler systems; intermittent pumping;
   unconfined aquifer; groundwater irrigation; root zone salinity; Pakistan
AB In the Indus Basin of Pakistan, multi-strainer shallow tubewells often called 'skimming wells' are used to extract groundwater from thin fresh lenses underlain by saline groundwater. Most of these wells face problems such as deteriorating water quality and reduction in discharge due to inadequate design and poor operational and management strategies. This paper evaluates the current practices of farmers in the Chaj doab area of Pakistani Punjab and suggests improvements in design and operation of skimming wells to ensure long-term sustainability of irrigated agriculture in the area. The effect of existing design and operation of skimming wells on pumped groundwater quality was evaluated using MODFLOW. To study the long-term effects of skimmed groundwater use on crop production and soil salinity development, the soil water flow and solute transport model SWAP was applied. The results revealed that farmers could reduce the number of strainers from 16 to 6 without reducing the anticipated discharges. For the conditions considered, the maximum discharge of skimming wells should be 4-8 L/s and they should not be operated for more than 2-4 h per day. Increasing discharge rate or daily operational hours can disturb the interface between fresh and saline groundwater resulting in reduced quality pumped groundwater. Weekly operational schedules together with recommended discharge rate and operational hours will be the best strategy to use skimmed groundwater for achieving optimal crop yields while maintaining root-zone salinity within acceptable limits. To avoid aquifer degradation, skimming wells should be used for supplemental irrigation rather than full irrigation of crops. Due to low discharge rates, skimming wells cannot be used to irrigate crops through surface irrigation methods. Therefore, pressurised irrigation methods should be used. The results also suggest that continuation of present irrigation practices could lead to serious problems of land and aquifer degradation. Therefore, farmers need to adjust their irrigation and leaching requirements annually considering crop evapotranspiration, precipitation, and salinity status of soils.

AB High watertables and land salinisation threaten the sustainability and prosperity of the irrigated dairy industry in the Murray-Darling Basin of Australia. High watertables and salinisation result from excessive deep drainage. Spatial and temporal trends in deep drainage data pertinent to the dairy industry in the Murray-Darling Basin are reviewed with a view towards reducing deep drainage. The reviewed data indicate that deep drainage under border-check irrigated pasture is generally greater than the leaching requirement and can be reduced without affecting pasture growth. Deep drainage through levee soils is likely to contribute significantly to regional groundwater. Consideration needs to be given to the appropriateness of using the border-check irrigation system on levee soils. Pressurised irrigation systems or land use change may be required to reduce deep drainage under these soils. The majority of deep drainage under floodplain soils occurs during winter and spring, when rainfall exceeds pasture water use. Developing a soil water deficit prior to winter will reduce deep drainage. This can be achieved by ending the irrigation season earlier. A later start to the irrigation season also offers potential to divert more winter rainfall into evapotranspiration rather than deep drainage.

AB Two field experiments in southern Australia investigated a farming system of over-cropping wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) into established lucerne (Medicago sativa subsp. L.) varieties of different winter activity ratings. The study was completed at Roseworthy, South Australia, and Katanning, Western Australia, between August 2000 and May 2003 in seasons receiving below average and average rainfall. Comparative lucerne persistence and biomass, wheat biomass, grain yield and protein contents, and soil water contents were measured. Wheat grain yield was reduced by 13-63% by over-cropping lucerne compared with wheat monoculture. Winter-dormant lucerne (winter activity Classes 0.5 and 2) reduced the yield penalty compared with winter-active varieties (Classes 6 and 10) in 2 of the 4 evaluations. The positive response to applying N at sowing in the second year of over-cropping wheat at Katanning was greatest in the most winter-dormant lucerne treatment (winter activity 0.5). Soil water contents were similar under the lucerne/wheat over-cropping and lucerne monoculture treatments irrespective of lucerne winter activity. Deficits of up to 43 mm at Roseworthy and 88 mm at Katanning were measured in the 0-200-cm soil pro. le at the start of the third summer of the study. The study shows that it can be more efficient in terms of land area to over-crop wheat into lucerne than to grow monocultures on separate parcels of land akin to phase farming. The improved productivity of over-cropping is associated with the separation of growth patterns of winter wheat and summer-active lucerne. This farming system offers great potential for improving sustainability and productivity in southern Australian cropping rotations.

AB Vulpia is a widespread weed of temperate Australian pastures, and readily replaces more productive species. Short-term management of vulpia is possible with herbicides but densities rapidly increase in poorly competitive pastures after herbicide application. A field experiment at Wagga Wagga, NSW, examined the effect of 2 fertility levels and 4 pasture types [subterranean clover sown at 1, 25, 100 kg/ha, and subterranean clover (25 kg/ha)+ annual ryegrass (20 kg/ha)] on 2 densities of vulpia (50, 500 plants/m(2)) from 1990 to 1994. Initially vulpia plant density was inversely related to sowing rate of subterranean clover, but over time this effect declined as the subterranean clover populations converged. Presence of annual ryegrass always resulted in lower vulpia plant, panicle and seed densities compared with treatments where subterranean clover only was present. Respective densities per m(2) in 1993 for the average of the subterranean clover monocultures and for annual ryegrass plus subterranean clover were: plant 1315 v. 265; panicle 6700 v. 130; seed 542 400 v. 3460. The effect of drought in 1994 and presence of annual ryegrass were shown to significantly lower the sustainable population of vulpia at Wagga Wagga from 5000-6000 to <1000 plants/m2. The short-term nature of herbicide application for control, and the need to ensure that competitive species were present to slow recruitment of vulpia in any long-term management strategy, were highlighted.

AB Closterocerus mirabilis sp. n. is described from Victoria, Australia. This species is a parasitoid of several species of leafmining Agromyzidae, and a potential biological-control agent for invasive agromyzid species. Due to the generalist nature of leafmining pests, conservation biological control utilising indigenous natural enemies should be the starting point for sustainable control measures against newly invading pests. This new species becomes part of the knowledge base for creating a contingency plan against invasive dipterous leafminers.

AB The Australian Entomological Society was founded in 1965 and provides a journal of world-class and annual scientific meetings for members. The world-wide impact of entomology publications is growing faster than that of the Australian Journal of Entomology, and membership of the society is declining slowly. In a recent survey members were generally happy with the society, but much of the exciting research involving insects is probably being published in specialist journals. Challenges identified for the future include building membership through greater connection with amateur entomologists and with students interested in ecology and insects. The growth area for entomology is seen to be in the application of insect biodiversity to the sustainable management of Australia's ecosystems. This special issue of the journal includes 10 papers illustrating the breadth and depth of entomology in the society.

AB To determine the effectiveness of black plastic mulch alone and in combination with row covers, on growth and physiological changes of cucumber plants, 6 treatments were established in a randomised complete block design with 4 replications: bare soil (control); black polyethylene mulch alone (B); B plus a clear cover of perforated polyethylene (BRCP); B plus a white cover of perforated polyethylene (BRWP); B plus an Agribon cover of polypropylene (BRA); and B plus a Kimberly farm row cover (BRK). For the plants grown with mulch or mulch combined with row covers, the dry weight of leaves 50 days after seeding (DAS), and the dry weight of whole plants (at 50 and 110 DAS) were significantly (P<0.05) different from the control. Early yields of treatments B, BRCP, BRWP, BRA and BRK were 2.1, 1.9, 2.6, 1.9 and 2.4 times higher than the control, which yielded 10 t/ha. Total yields were increased by 9.7, 15.4, 19.8, 14.9 and 20 t/ha, over the control which yielded 104 t/ha. Increases in plant dry weight explained the changes in yield. Stomatal conductance may explain in part, the increase in photosynthetic rate, but may not explain yield increase.

TI Simulating the water balance of border-check irrigated pasture on a

SO AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL AGRICULTURE

ID HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY; SOLUTE TRANSPORT; MODEL; INFILTRATION
AB The irrigated dairy industry relies on perennial pasture and is a major user of water in the Murray-Darling Basin of Australia. The sustainability of the irrigated dairy industry is threatened by high watertables and land salinisation. Options to alleviate these problems by reducing deep drainage are required. This paper assesses the potential to use the simulation model 'SWAP' to appraise options for reducing deep drainage. Minor modifications were made to SWAP so that it could simulate border-check irrigated pasture on a cracking soil. The model was tested against lysimeter data describing the water balance of irrigated pasture. Evapotranspiration, runoff, infiltration, soil water storage and deep drainage were well simulated when infiltration through soil cracks was modelled using the physically based approached in SWAP. Large errors in evapotranspiration, infiltration, runoff, soil water storage and deep drainage occurred when the process of infiltration through cracks was not simulated. Slight improvements in model predictions were achieved by specifying monthly crop factors, as opposed to a constant annual crop factor. However, a constant annual crop factor should be sufficiently accurate for most studies of deep drainage under border-check irrigated pastures.

ID SUPPORT-SYSTEMS
AB The widespread adoption of research findings by the farming community has traditionally been challenging. Addressing this challenge is a priority as the products of research often aid and underpin the implementation of environmental objectives to ensure that natural resources are used in a sustainable manner. One approach to tackling this challenge is to develop products that are tailored to meet the needs of the users. The Analytical Irrigation Model (AIM, a software tool) was developed with the intention of creating a field-tool to assist farmers to improve their management of border-check irrigation. Using AIM as a case study, this paper demonstrates the value of using a qualitative approach in assessing potential users of research findings, and understanding their requirements. While developing AIM, anecdotal feedback suggested that widespread adoption of the envisaged research products, namely a field-tool, was unlikely. The qualitative study found that service providers to the dairy industry were likely to be the primary users of products of the AIM research. From conducting this qualitative study, service providers identified 4 types of research products that would suit their needs. Incorporating their perspectives enabled the development of products that were more likely to be adopted and consequently increased the effective targeting of the AIM research findings.

AB Surface runoff can represent a significant part of the hydrological balance of grazed pastures on the north-west slopes of New South Wales, and is influenced by a range of rainfall characteristic, soil property, and pasture conditions. Runoff plots were established on grazed pastures at 3 sites as part of the Sustainable Grazing Systems National Experiment (SGS NE). Pastures were either native (redgrass, wallaby grass and wire grass) or sown species (phalaris, subterranean clover and lucerne) and a range of grazing management treatments were imposed to manipulate pasture herbage mass, litter mass and ground cover. Rainfall and runoff events were recorded using automatic data loggers between January 1998 and September 2001. Stored soil water in the surface layer (0-22.5 cm) was monitored continuously using electrical resistance sensors and automatic loggers. Pasture herbage mass, litter mass and ground cover were estimated regularly to provide information useful in interpreting runoff generation processes.
   Total runoff ranged from 6.6 mm at Manilla (0.3% of rainfall) to 185 mm at Nundle (5.7% of rainfall) for different grazing treatments, with the largest runoff event being recorded at Nundle (46.7 mm). Combined site linear regression analyses showed that soil depth, rainfall depth and rainfall duration explained up to 30.3% of the variation in runoff depth. For individual sites, these same variables were also important, accounting for 13.3-33.6% of the variation in runoff depth. Continuous monitoring of stored soil water in relation to these runoff events indicated that the majority of these events were generated by saturation excess, with major events in winter contributing substantially to regional flooding. Long-term simulation modelling (1957-2001) using the SGS Pasture Model indicated that most runoff events were generated in summer, which concurred with the number of flood events recorded at Gunnedah, New South Wales, downstream of the SGS sites. However, floods also occurred frequently in winter, but the simulations generated few runoff events at that time of the year. These results have important implications for sustainability of grazed pastures and long-term simulation modelling of the hydrological balance of such systems, since runoff generation processes are likely to vary both spatially and temporally for different rainfall events.

AB Soil salinity of non-irrigated farmlands in Australia has been largely attributed to tree clearing and their replacement by annual pasture and crop species. This paper deals with the effects of sowing perennial ryegrass and greater inputs of fertiliser, and the effect of grazing management, on water use and the potential to improve recharge control on a gravelly soil derived from basalt.
   In 1991, neutron access tubes were inserted into plots on a project established in 1989 to examine the impact of upgrading the pasture on sheep productivity. These plots were subdivided in 1996 to examine the impact of grazing management (tactical v. set-stocking) and pasture type (pastures dominated by annual species v. upgraded pastures) on productivity. Neutron probe readings were taken periodically from tubes in each plot, at depth intervals of 25 cm (December 1991-March 1995) or 20 cm (August 1995-April 1999) to 170 cm. There was no effect of treatment on soil moisture. Data for 2 wet years ( 1995 and 1996) indicate that the effective soil water storage capacity to 170 cm depth for these pastures was a mean of 125 mm of water. This represents the potential buffer before winter rainfall exceeds the water use by the pasture, fills the soil profile to capacity and then either runs off or allows deep drainage to occur.
   We did not achieve a significant reduction in soil water storage, and therefore potential recharge of groundwater, by re-sowing the pasture with perennial ryegrass and applying more fertiliser, or by altering the grazing management to a form of rotational grazing. Compared with set-stocked annual pasture, the impact of such treatments was to reduce soil water storage to a depth of 170 cm in autumn by less than 20 mm/year. There was no association between total herbage production and soil water storage, however, an increased percentage of perennial ryegrass in the pasture was associated with a small reduction in soil water storage in 1 year. Greater use of soil water may depend upon using deeper-rooted perennials or maintaining a higher proportion of perennial species in the sward (the perennial ryegrass in the re-sown pastures declined from 53% in October 1996 to 4% in October 1998).

   TEMPERATURE
AB Evapotranspiration is the major component of the hydrological balance of grazed pastures on the North-West Slopes of New South Wales, representing up to 93% of annual rainfall. Nearly 80% of evapotranspiration may occur as bare soil evaporation, however, representing water not available for plant growth. Few studies have reported daily values of actual evapotranspiration for pastures, particularly in northern New South Wales. The studies reported here were conducted to measure actual evapotranspiration using an evaporation dome technique, for plots with a range of pasture, litter and ground cover. Measurements were taken in each season between autumn 2000 and autumn 2001, with both wet and dry soil surface conditions, to document the range of values that might be expected. Similar measurements were conducted in areas of natural pasture, to quantify values under grazed conditions. A range of other variables were also quantified in association with each evapotranspiration measurement; these included components of net radiant energy, atmospheric conditions, pasture physical characteristics, ground cover and soil water content. These data were used to identify the most important variables, which may be influenced by or interact with grazing management, that account for variation in daily evapotranspiration values.
   Hourly evapotranspiration ranged from 0.02 to 0.82 mm/h and daily values ranged from 0.2 to 7.6 mm/day, in winter to summer, respectively. Linear regression models that included variables of solar radiation, herbage mass, vapour pressure deficit and soil water content accounted for up to 93% of the variation in daily evapotranspiration values. These models predicted that high litter mass (3000 kg DM/ha) may reduce evaporation by up to 1 mm/day for wet soils, making a substantial contribution to the annual hydrological balance. A simulation study of a grazed pasture, using the Sustainable Grazing Systems Pasture Model, indicated that grazing management may influence the partitioning of transpiration and evaporation from canopy, litter and bare soil. With rotational grazing, predicted soil evaporation was lower and transpiration and canopy evaporation were higher than with continuous grazing. Hence, pastures may require different management between summer and winter, so that bare soil evaporation and canopy interception losses are minimised, to maximise stored soil water available for pasture use. Pastures with lower evaporative losses are likely to have higher productivity and sustainability.

AB A survey of 29 sheep producers was conducted to benchmark current sheep production practices and producer attitudes to sheep and pasture management in the Victorian Mallee. This report describes the farming systems, defines current sheep management practices and identifies management issues that are limiting production. It also highlights limitations of adoption, suggests potential adoption rates of specific practices by producers, and estimates increases in productivity achievable. Sheep producers could achieve small gains in farm productivity (an estimated average 0.3% annually) by adopting sheep management practices including using superior genetics, reducing ram numbers and introducing supplementary feeding. Possible reasons why recommended practices have not been adopted are discussed. The difficulty of integrating sheep into current short cropping systems was considered to be a key limitation to the adoption of management that could substantially increase productivity, such as higher stocking rates and winter-spring lambing. Important benefits to both productivity and environmental sustainability may be achieved through the replacement of fallowed land with improved pastures. However, a lack of data on the feed base and sheep production in relation to a changing feed base made it impossible to estimate the size of these benefits. It was concluded that further research is needed to collect data and benchmark pasture and livestock enterprises to allow quantification of the potential impact on farm profit of changes to pasture and sheep management in this region.

AB The relative performance of 3 alternative pasture legumes, in comparison with subterranean clover, grown in a 1:1 pasture: crop rotation was investigated during 1997-2001, at 2 sites in the high rainfall (>500 mm/year) zone of southern Australia. Seedling densities of the pasture legumes (before and after crop) were examined, along with herbage dry matter production, growth pattern and seed production. After 2 cycles of a 1: 1 pasture: crop rotation, average seedling densities of balansa (Trifolium michelianum Savi var. michelianum), Persian (T. resupinatum L. var. resupinatum Gib. and Belli), arrowleaf (T. vesiculosum Savi.) and subterranean (T. subterraneum L.) clovers at the 2 sites were 6810, 2910, 680 and 630 plants/m(2), respectively. Average cumulative herbage mass in 2001 was 7.49, 5.21, 8.53 and 7.76 t DM/ha. year, respectively. All clovers produced a large seed pool: balansa, 71.8 g/m(2); subterranean, 38.9 g/m(2); Persian, 35.5 g/m(2); and arrowleaf, 35.4 g/m(2). The results suggest that a 1:1 pasture: crop rotation is sustainable, in terms of pasture seed-seedling dynamics for each of the legumes, and that under this system the pasture legumes need to be sown only once.

AB In the Murray-Darling Basin, irrigated agriculture, which produces rice, dairy, cotton and citrus, is a large consumer of water resources. Effective management of the water resource is therefore important to ensure sustainability of irrigated agriculture. In the lower Gwydir and Macquarie valleys, respectively located in northern and central New South Wales of Australia, extensive irrigated-cotton production is an important contributor to the nation's export earnings. However, there are problems of excessive deep drainage (DD) in these regions. To address them requires soil and water quality information, but there is little quantitative information to plan for and implement improved water use efficiency. In this paper, we explore methods that could efficiently generate data on natural resources. First, we carried out an electromagnetic induction (EM38) survey to characterise broad soil profile types in the Ashley (lower Gwydir valley) and Trangie (lower Macquarie valley) districts. From the resulting apparent electrical conductivity (ECa, mS/m) data collected using an EM 38 (vertical mode of operation), soil profile sites were selected and sampled, followed by laboratory analysis carried to determine exchangeable cations and clay content. The soil data collected were analysed with a salt and leaching fraction (SaLF) model, based on specific water quality and quantity parameters, such as electrical conductivity of irrigation water (ECiw, dS/m) and rainfall (R, mm/year). Various water application rates (I) were also considered, to simulate irrigated cotton (I=600 mm/year) and rice production (I=1200 mm/year) as well as shallow water reservoirs (I=1800 mm/year). For each irrigation scenario, DD values (mm/year) were estimated. An exponential function was used to describe the relationships between ECa values obtained with the EM38 and estimated DD. These relationships were then used to estimate DD at each of the EM38 survey sites, whereupon cut-off (z(c)) values were used for indicator transforms of the data. Using indicator kriging (IK) and various irrigation scenarios, we demonstrate the usefulness of this approach in identifying areas of high risk of DD exceeding various cut-off values (z(c)=50, 75, 100 and 200 mm/year). Thus, we show where improvements in water-use efficiency could be achieved in the irrigated cotton growing districts of Ashley and Trangie.

AB There is increasing interest in developing environmental management systems to ensure that agricultural industries are sustainable; invertebrate indicators provide one potential tool for monitoring sustainable production. As a first step in developing invertebrate indicators for viticulture, we compare the efficiency of 3 common trapping methods in assessing populations of relevant orders of invertebrates. Yellow sticky traps were more effective in trapping Hymenoptera, Thysanoptera, Hemiptera, Diptera, Araneae and Coleoptera; transparent sticky traps were best for Lepidoptera and Neuroptera; and pitfall traps for Collembola and the family Formicidae. Numbers collected differed among months and December was the best month, overall, for trapping. Preliminary guidelines are developed for assessing key orders. While several methods are required for assessing invertebrate biodiversity, most orders can be sampled with a single method, particularly the yellow sticky trap. Our results indicate that changes in numbers of beneficial orders, due to changes in management practices, can be detected. Power analyses suggest a relatively small number of yellow sticky traps would be sufficient to detect changes of around 30%, or greater.

TI The role of applied science in helping farmers to make decisions about
   environmental sustainability
SO AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL AGRICULTURE

ID FARMING SYSTEMS; MANAGEMENT
AB Decision making about environmental sustainability is complex, involving both factual and value-based judgements by farmers. Some of the factors involved in making these decisions, such as the financial implications and riskiness, the urgency of the problem, ease of implementation and trialling and compatibility have been addressed elsewhere. The current paper discusses a number of less-explored issues involved in this type of decision making, including the need for multiple sources of knowledge such as farmers' values and goals, an understanding of social and demographic issues, and consideration of the catchment or landscape context in which farmers live. It highlights scientific knowledge as only one of these knowledge sources, with other sources also needed in complex decision making. Evidence from a Western Australian case study suggests that there has been a shift in farmers' values over the past few decades and that there is now a greater responsiveness to management solutions which include environmental considerations, even among the 40% of farmers driven primarily by monetary goals. Changing social conditions, particularly the roles of women on farms and of off-farm income, suggest greater potential for the incorporation of environmental considerations into farm management. However, demographic issues, particularly issues such as limited employment opportunities, the declining provision of services in areas dominated by an agricultural economy, and the trend of increasing privatisation of extension services, suggest that there remains potential for greater environmental exploitation in some areas. The role of scientists in helping farmers to address environmental sustainability is discussed, with an acknowledgment that there are insufficient scientists with the required skills available. Scientists need to work in teams with local people to develop a sufficient depth of understanding to translate abstract research findings into solutions that are relevant at the farm level. Highly participatory approaches (which empower farmers rather merely inform them) can help scientists to understand farmers' needs and motivations, but involve losing control of highly focused research agendas. Environmental Management Systems are one way in which scientific research and group learning can help empower farmers to understand and make better decisions about the environment.

AB A range of potential commercial applications of cloning and genetic modification in cattle has been suggested over the last decade. It includes the rapid multiplication of elite genotypes, production of valuable human proteins, altered production characteristics, increased disease resistance and milk with improved nutritional value and processing capabilities. However, an economic return from the sale of product is far from reality in any of these areas. One impediment to achieving economic sustainability is the extremely low efficiency in producing healthy offspring from transferred cloned embryos. Other significant impediments are societal concerns surrounding such technologies, animal welfare issues and regulatory requirements. This review will focus on current biological limitations and technical capabilities in commercial settings, the changes required to allow the production and sale of products at economically sustainable levels, cryopreservation and the progress towards automation of cloning techniques.

AB In this study soil hydro-physical properties such as soil texture, available water capacity, and organic carbon, along with existing land use and topography of a representative watershed of eastern India (Kadalipal watershed, 20.80 - 20.86 degreesN and 85.54 - 86.50 degreesE, Dhenkanal district, Orissa), were spatially mapped after collecting data from different sources (ground-truthing, profile survey, remote sensing satellite imagery). Since availability of water is confined to the south-west monsoon period ( rainy season, June - September), eastern India is mainly mono-cropped, dominated by rice but second crops can be planned based on the soil hydro-physical properties, mainly water retention and available water of the soil profile utilising residual soil moisture. Keeping the existing land use as a base and considering the potential and prospects of soil hydro-physical properties in different topographies, in this investigation, an alternative land-use plan was developed in different parts of the watershed and tested in its rainfed rice area. Since direct measurement of available water capacity or soil water constants over a large area is time-consuming, pedo-transfer functions were also developed to predict soil water constants using easily measured parameters ( e. g. cation exchange capacity, organic carbon, oven-dry bulk density, soil texture, calcium carbonate, etc.) of arable land of the watershed. Results of implementation revealed that the new cropping system was practical for increasing production, productivity, profitability, and sustainability of the rainfed rice area of the eastern India.

AB Metabolic physiology, morphology, activity patterns, performance traits and movement kinematics are thought to have coevolved in lizards. We examined links between these parameters for the thorny devil (Moloch horridus), a morphologically and ecologically specialised agamid lizard ( body mass similar to30 g). It has a maximum sustainable metabolic rate (VO2max) of 0.99 mL O-2 g(-1) h(-1) while running at a velocity of 0.11 m s(-1) at 35degreesC. This VO2max is typical of that for other lizards (except varanids), but its burst speed (1.21 m s(-1)) is slower than for a typical agamid (e.g. Ctenophorus ornatus at 3.59 m s(-1)) and its endurance is appreciably higher. The kinematic pattern of hind-limb movement for M. horridus is different to that of a 'typical' similar-sized agamid, Ctenophorus ornatus, which is a fast-moving lizard that shelters in rock crevices. It is also different to the ecologically equivalent Phrynosoma platyrhinos. The slow and erratic ventilation of M. horridus (2.3 breaths min(-1)) at its maximum sustainable aerobic running speed occurs when it stops running. This might be a consequence of the hypaxial muscles being used for both lung ventilation and locomotion, which might be impairing pulmonary ventilation when running, but might also contribute to its high endurance. M. horridus is metabolically typical of agamids, but its body shape, movement patterns and locomotory performance traits are different, and might have coevolved with its specialisation for eating ants.

AB In Brazil, cacao is mostly planted beneath shade trees. The diversity of shade trees varies from monospecific to highly diverse canopies, characteristic of pristine Atlantic Forest. This study evaluates the relationships between family richness of Hymenoptera-Parasitica and Chrysidoidea, and tree species richness and density, the species richness of herbaceous understorey, and the area and age of the cacao agroforestry system. We sampled 16 cacao agroforestry systems, with canopy diversity ranging from one to 22 tree species per hectare, in three seasons: summer (March), winter (August) and spring (November). Parasitoids were sampled using eight Malaise-Townes traps per site. Tree species richness and density were enumerated within 1 ha at each site, and herbaceous plant species richness was calculated in eight 1 m 2 plots, within the hectare. The number of parasitoid families increased with tree species richness and density in spring and summer, but decreased in winter. Neither species richness of herbaceous plants nor area and age of the system affected parasitoid family richness. We suggest that the increase of parasitoid diversity with tree species richness and density in warmer seasons reflects increasing heterogeneity and availabitity of resources. The decrease in parasitoid family number with tree density in winter may be due to local impoverishment of resources, leading to parasitoid emigration to neighbouring forest remnants. This result implies that a higher diversity of shade trees will help to maintain high parasitoid levels and, in consequence, higher levels of natural enemies of cacao pests, particularly in the warmer seasons. This prediction is borne out in the experience of cacao producers. The proper management of shade tree diversity will. play a vital role in maintaining the sustainability of cacao agroforestry production systems in the tropics and, concurrently, will. maintain high biodiversity values in these locations.

AB Across the biosphere, rapid and accelerating changes in land use, climate and atmospheric composition driven primarily by anthropogenic forces are known to exert major influences on the productivity, biodiversity and sustainable provision of ecosystem goods and services. Thus far, many studies assessing the ecological consequences of global change have focussed on single trophic levels. However, understanding these changes and predicting their consequences may benefit from unravelling how interactions between primary producers, primary, and secondary consumers (plants, herbivores and carnivores) are being affected. Conservation and restoration may be improved when assessing species and their interactions on appropriate scales, while acknowledging that above- and belowground biota are ecologically linked. Selection pressures on one species may depend on others, so that species loss means more for diversity than just loss of a single taxon. It may also result in the loss of other species of the same or different trophic levels and in the dilution, or even loss, of various selection pressures. We review a number of discussions on trophic interactions in a changing world in relation to (i) the scale of ecosystem response to environmental change with emphasis on the soil subsystem, (ii) the linkage of above- and belowground subsystems and (iii) natural selection and the stability of community structure and ecosystem functioning. We discuss the need to bring together isolated sub-disciplines of ecology in order to understand the implications of global changes for ecosystem processes. (C) 2004 Elsevier GmbH.

AB The rate and scale of human-driven changes can exert profound impacts on ecosystems, the species that make them up and the services they provide that sustain humanity. Given the speed at which these changes are occurring, one of society's major challenges is to coexist within ecosystems and to manage ecosystem services in a sustainable way. The effect of possible scenarios of global change on ecosystem services can be explored using ecosystem models. Such models should adequately represent ecosystem processes above and below the soil surface (aboveground and belowground) and the interactions between them. We explore possibilities to include such interactions into ecosystem models at scales that range from global to local. At the regional to global scale we suggest to expand the plant functional type concept (aggregating plants into groups according to their physiological attributes) to include functional types of aboveground-belowground interactions. At the scale of discrete plant communities, process-based and organism-oriented models could be combined into "hybrid approaches" that include organism-oriented mechanistic representation of a limited number of trophic interactions in an otherwise process - oriented approach. Under global change the density and activity of organisms determining the processes may change non-linearly and therefore explicit knowledge of the organisms and their responses should ideally be included. At the individual plant scale a common organism-based conceptual model of aboveground-belowground interactions has emerged. This conceptual model facilitates the formulation of research questions to guide experiments aiming to identify patterns that are common within, but differ between, ecosystem types and biomes. Such experiments inform modelling approaches at larger scales. Future ecosystem models should better include this evolving knowledge of common patterns of aboveground-belowground interactions. Improved ecosystem models are necessary toots to reduce the uncertainty in the information that assists us in the sustainable management of our environment in a changing world.

AB Restoration of floodplain forests has become a primary aim of sustainable forestry in Europe. Although several studies have investigated the conversion of coniferous stands outside of their biogeographical area and on unsuitable sites, none focused specifically on alluvial areas. We surveyed 208 riverine stands, distributed homogeneously throughout the Grand-duche de Luxembourg (western-central Europe) for the abundance of woody forest species (trees, saplings, seedlings and shrubs). The influence of both the canopy nature (Norway spruce or deciduous) and the biogeographical region (Oesling or Gutland) on the understorey regeneration were tested. The mean species richness was 10.5 woody plants per stand. Correspondence analyses showed that canopy tree regeneration was not different between the two forest types. Following an analysis of variance, we found that functional species group distribution (regarding mode of dispersal, type of seed bank and establishment strategy) was more determined by the biogeographical variable than by the canopy variable. Most woody species were significantly more abundant in deciduous forests and in the Gutland area. Only Rubus idaeus, Sambucus racemosa and Sorbus aucuparia were strongly associated with Norway spruce stands or the Oesling region. The differences between deciduous forests and coniferous stands are mainly due to shrub abundance and not to the canopy tree regeneration. In conclusion, Norway spruce plantations act as nurseries for late-successional riverine species like Fraxinus excelsior, Acer pseudoplatanus and Quercus robur.

TI Disability as a field of welfare politics. Towards a systematization of
   disability policy
SO BERLINER JOURNAL FUR SOZIOLOGIE
LA German
DT Article
AB Disability policy is a determining factor for the sustainability of the welfare state due to its large, and increasing, share of social policy expenditures. Despite expanding research over the past years, our knowledge about the living conditions of disabled people and the impact of disability policies is negligible. This gap in social policy knowledge is caused by the particular nature of disability policy as a cross-sectional task that is linked to different security systems and also by the difficulties relating to the objectification of the social category of disability.
   This article presents different goals and functions as well as the broad spectrum of tasks within the field of disability policy. A typology of ideal-types is developed to recognize some structures within complex programs and myriad rights. This typology applies the distribution criteria of David Miller (needs, deserts, rights) to emphasize the typical normative characteristics, benefits, and rights as well as to describe the differences between the types. Based on this theoretical foundation, national disability policies can be represented as a policy mix of the three distinct types and compared with one another.

AB Pea is one of the most developed model plants for genetic studying the developmental processes leading to formation of nitrogen-fixing symbiosis (NFS) and arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM). More than 250 symbiotic mutants with respect to NFS were independently obtained in different laboratories throughout the world. More than 100 mutants have been involved in genetic analysis carried out by several research teams. As a result more than 40 symbiotic genes have been identified to date. Five of those genes have been cloned and sequenced. Analysis of mutant phenotypes allowed subdividing the NFS establishment and the AM formation into discrete developmental stages controlled by different groups of pea genes. The stages can be considered as elementary traits for genetic and phenotypic analyses. At least 8 such stages have been identified for colonization process in NFS, 4 stages were identified for nodule tissue differentiation in NFS and 3 ones have been identified for AM. The existence of common plant genes and plant molecular products for both symbioses makes it possible to conclude that legumes have joint genetic system controlling the development of a tripartite symbiotic system. This conclusion allowed to initiate an analysis of genetic polymorphism of pea by effectiveness of tripartite symbiosis and, a series of highly symbiotically effective varieties from the collection of N. 1. VAVILOV'S Institute for Plant Breeding have been identified. These reference varieties along with commercial cultivars bred regardless of their symbiotic traits were used in field trials to estimate a potential of tripartite symbiotic system in sustainable agricultural production. It has been shown that it is possible and necessary to exploit a tripartite symbiosis to decrease application of mineral fertilizers in agriculture.

AB Protected conventional and organic farming systems for watermelon and melon were compared over a two-year period in the Mediterranean Amik plain of southern Turkey. Yield, fruit quality and growth responses of the vegetable crops were measured and compared as a function of conventional management, and three composted sheep-cattle manure treatments of 6 kg m(-2), 12 kg m(-2) and 18 kg m(-2). On average, total and marketable yields of watermelon and melon grown organically under low plastic tunnels showed a two-fold increase under the organic treatments of 12 kg m-2 and 18 kg m(-2) relative to the protected conventional management system (p < 0.05). There was no significant difference in watermelon and melon yields between the manure application levels of 12 and 18 kg m(-2). There were significant changes in mean fruit weight and width between the control and the manure level of 18 kg m(-2) for watermelon and in mean stem diameter between the control and the manure levels of 12 and 18 kg m(-2) for melon (p < 0.05). Multiple linear regression (MLR) models accounted for about 49% and 52% of variations in marketable yields of melon and watermelon as a function of the control and the manure levels of 12 and 18 kg m(-2), respectively. The findings indicate that protected organic watermelon and melon systems in this Mediterranean region can produce more total and marketable yields than protected conventional systems. Protected organic farming systems can assist in compliance with maximum residue limits imposed on exported agricultural commodities and reduce dependency on industrial fertilizers as well as emissions of fertilizer production-related greenhouse gases.

TI The performance and nutrient use efficiency of two contrasting systems

SO BIOLOGICAL AGRICULTURE & HORTICULTURE

AB During a four year study, two contrasting systems of organic milk production were studied to determine differences in soil nutrient status, crop production, milk output and quality, efficiency of feed conversion and the effect on animal performance. The key aim of the first system was to increase the levels of both self-sufficiency and sustainability of the system by establishing a balanced crop rotation and minimizing the imports of nutrients. The second system was based on increasing the output and flexibility of the system by establishing a forage-only cropping strategy and importing purchased concentrate feeds into the system.
   The results showed that increasing the level of self sufficiency led to an improved nutrient input/output balance and improved efficiency of milk production from forage but not an increased efficiency of total feed utilization. This type of system is dependent on the production of highenergy forage to meet the cow's nutrient requirement and avoid problems of reduced milk persistency during early lactation, lower milk quality and reduced fertility. In the system based on purchased concentrate feeds, higher levels of both crop energy and milk output were recorded without any adverse effects on milk persistency during lactation. The flexibility of the system ensured that any potential deficiency or imbalance in the availability and quality of the forages produced within the system was avoided by the import of concentrate feeds. However, the reliance on purchased rather than home-grown concentrate feed reduced the sustainability of the system and also led to both a lower efficiency of forage utilization and reduced milk output from forage.

AB In in incremental exercise the heart (HR) and stroke (SR) rates can be periodically synchronized suggesting that changes in the course of a relationship between power output (PO) and HR. recorded in the Conconi test as the deflection point (DP). may be related to changes in SR. In view of this. the aim of the present study was to analyse the course of the PO/HR, PO/SR. and SR/HR relationships in lite progressive incremental exercise as well as to evaluate the accuracy of determination of anaerobic threshold (AT) based on die above three relationships. In the investigation. 12 kayakers performed the following tests on a special ergometer: the Conconi test (CT), the 30-min test (PET) with power output at DP (PODP,) the critical power test (CP), and the graded exercise test until exhaustion (GT), in which power output at the anaerobic threshold (POAT4, PODmax) was determined based on the blood lactate level (LA). The lack of DP in the PO/HR and the PO/SR relationships was detected in two and one athlete, respectively. In contrast, in the SR/HR relationship DP was recorded in all the tested subjects. The times of occurrence of DP did not significantly differ. Although, as judged by the LA dynamics in PET, the intensity of exercising exceeded that at the maximal lactate steady state (MLSS), all the athletes managed to complete the test. No significant differences were detected between PODP and POAT4, PODmax or CP, and the agreement of the results obtained in CT with those collected in CP and GT was similar to that determined within each of the tests. The obtained results suggest that the changes in the course of the PO/HR relationship may be associated with spontaneous changes of SR. The lack of diversity among the times of occurrence of DP in the three relationships tested allows for an easy and non-invasive determination of AT even in case of a linear PO/HR relationship. The power output estimated with use of the presented method is higher than that at MLSS, but it is sustainable for at least 30 min. The accuracy of determination of anaerobic threshold based on the analysis of the three DPs appears to be comparable with that obtained with use of AT4, Dmax, and CP.

AB As a renewable source of energy, biomass is expected to play more prominent role in our future metallurgical applications as a sustainable energy and reductant source. In this respect, an understanding of the thermal decomposition of biomass is clearly of great importance because thermal degradation is always the first step in the conversion process. The present study investigates thermal decomposition of wood samples using an advanced computational thermal analysis method. With this method the apparent specific heats of selected biomass samples were estimated during continuous heating at 10 degreesC/min for the temperatures of up to 600 degreesC. The rate of change in the heat of reaction with respect to temperature (DeltaH/DeltaT) was determined from the measured data and the consequent heats quantified for each sample. The results indicated that biomass pyrolysis has an overall exothermic effect with an endothermic decomposition of its cellulosic component. The exothermic reaction of wood at higher temperatures was primarily affected by its lignin content and the char formation reactions. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB An overview of biomass for production of densified biofuels on a global scale is given. Bioenergy production as heat, electricity, and liquid fuels represents about 14% of the World's primary energy supply. About 25% of the usage is in industrialised countries and the other 75% is used in developing countries. There is an estimated 3870 (10(6)) ha of forest worldwide. The average area of forest and wooded land per inhabitant varies between 6.6 ha in Oceania, 0.2 ha in Asia, and 1.4 ha in Europe. The world's total above-ground biomass in forests amounts to 420 (10(9)) tonnes, of which more than 40% is located in South America. Estimates by FAO (2000) show that global production and use of woodfuel and roundwood reached about 3300 (10(6)) m(3) in 1999. About 55% is used directly as fuel, e.g. as split firewood, and about 90% of this is produced and consumed in the developing countries. The remaining 45% is used as industrial raw material, but about 40% of this is used as primary or secondary process residues, suitable only for energy production. The total sustainable worldwide biomass energy potential is about 100 EJ/a (the share of woody biomass is 41.6 EJ/a), which is about 30% of total global energy consumption today. About 40 EJ/a of available biomass is used for energy. Nearly 60% of this biomass is used only in Asia. A comparison between the available potential with current use shows that on a worldwide level about two-fifths of the existing biomass potential is used, and in most areas of the world the current biomass use is clearly below the available potential. Only in Asia does the current use exceed the available potential. Therefore, an increased biomass use is possible, e.g. for production of densified biofuels, in most countries. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

AB A decision support system for forest biomass exploitation for energy production purposes is presented. In the proposed approach, geographic information system based techniques are integrated with mathematical programming methods to yield a comprehensive system that allows the formalisation of the problem, decision taking, and evaluation of effects. The aim of this work is to assess the possibility of biomass exploitation for both thermal and electric energy production in a given area, while relating this use to an efficient and sustainable management of the forests within the same territory. The decision support system allows for the locating of plants and the computing of their optimal sizing (defining which kind of energy is convenient to produce for the specific area), taking into account several aspects (economic, technical, regulatory, and social) and deciding how to plan biomass collection and harvesting. A case study applied to a small Italian mountain area is presented. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID EXPOSURE
AB Women in rural areas of India play an important role in household energy management. Programmes designed to help them administer these needs more effectively by providing alternative, sustainable energy solutions, however, have met with limited success. Women's roles and energy needs are rarely a main focus of rural energy programmes and there are few mechanisms for creating a more meaningful role for them throughout the programme lifecycle. This paper presents the results of a joint Tata Energy Research Institute (TERI), India and University of Waterloo (UW), Canada project, which aimed to develop a participatory rural energy planning methodology that defines and creates a space for women in the rural energy development process. The paper begins with a brief background on the rural energy scenario in India, the official responses and programme performances. We discuss the role of women in household energy management with respect to gender variations in roles and decision-making and the failure to recognise these differences in policy formulation. Within this context, we present a participatory process for designing household energy programmes with rural women. A case study drawn from work in rural Haryana, India illustrates the method. This methodology fills an existing need for tools and approaches within the rural energy sector to provide concrete ways to include women as full partners in the development process.

ID CHARCOALS
AB It is demonstrated that dispersed biomass residues (bagasse, sawdust) can be processed into hard carbonaceous blocks, panels or boards with good strength and thermodynamic properties. There are two possible approaches: to mould dispersed biomass charcoal with a phenol-formaldehyde binder or to produce this material by carbonising the biomass fiberboard prepared by making use of steam explosion autohydrolysis pulp or steam explosion lignin as a binder.
   In the first step, steam explosion lignin, as a modifier and a binder is introduced to the lignocellulosic biomass by impregnation or during the hot pressing process to form a hard fiberboard. By subsequent carbonisation of the fiberboard panels or blocks, carbonised panels or blocks with high bending and crushing strength and suitable thermodynamic properties are obtained due to the formation of an internal lignin reinforcement in cell lumina and impregnation of cell walls with lignin solution or molten lignin. The carbonised panels demonstrate a good dimensional stability after a standard treatment with water. The bending strength of the carbonised panels after 24 h soaking in water is 93% of that in dry state. The thermodynamic properties and porosity of the carbonised panels demonstrate their suitability for use as a building material. Lignin, a natural binder of fiberboards, has proven to be suitable for preparation of cabonaceous panels and boards.
   In this respect new carbon building blocks and panels from moulded biomass and carbonised steam exploded biomass act as a concentrated form of long term carbon storage and will be a factor stabilizing the growing CO2 concentration in the atmosphere.

AB Emissions of greenhouse gases, such as CO2, need to be greatly reduced to avoid the risk of a harmful climate change. One powerful way to mitigate emissions is to switch fuels from fossil fuels to renewable energy, such as biomass. In this paper, we systematically investigate several bioenergy processing options, quantify the reduction rate and calculate the specific cost of reduction. This paper addresses the issue of which option Sweden should concentrate on to achieve the largest CO2 reduction at the lowest cost. The results show that the largest and most long-term sustainable CO2 reduction would be achieved by refining the woody biomass to fuel pellets for coal substitution, which have been done in Sweden. Refining to motor fuels, such as methanol, DME and ethanol, gives only half of the reduction and furthermore at a higher specific cost. Biomass refining into pellets enables transportation over long distances and seasonal storage, which is crucial for further utilisation of the woody biomass potential. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

AB In this study we present an alternative for the management of the excess of shrub species that nowadays take up around 800 000 ha in Galicia (NW Spain). This alternative is based on the exploitation of the energetic resources contained in the excess of shrubs by their combustion in specially designed plants for production of electric energy.
   The different species were sorted into three groups: Ulex europaeus L. (furze), Sarothamnus scoparius (L.) Link (broom) and Erica sp. (heaths). Their LHV were calculated through measurements of the corresponding HHV and resulted 7600, 7300 and 7200 kJ kg(-1) respectively. Biomass productions (T ha(-1)) were also calculated resulting 20 T ha(-1) (furze), 30 T ha(-1) (broom), and 15 T ha(-1) (heaths). Analyses of all these values make these species very valuable for their energy exploitation. Samples were collected over one year in different zones to study the effect of the environmental conditions on the calorific values. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB With the aim of solving the wastewater treatment problem in small villages, treatment performance of a pilot-scale subsurface-flow constructed wetland (SFW) was evaluated for removal efficiency of biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), chemical oxygen demand (COD), total suspended solids (TSS), total and faecal coliform and faecal streptococci bacteria from raw municipal wastewater. Studies of the composition and thermal behaviour of the harvested biomass were achieved in order to assess their possible utilisation as a fuel.
   Two different hydraulic application rates (150, and 75 mm day(-1)) and two macrophytes, cattail (Typha sp.) and reed (Phragmites sp.), were assayed.
   High levels of BOD, COD and TSS removal for all treatments were obtained. The best removals were obtained in those beds with the lowest hydraulic application rate. With regard to the type of plant, no significant differences were found between cattail and reed performance; however, cattails showed to be by far (almost a factor of 2) the greatest producer of biomass (22t [d.m.]ha(-1)). Both cattails and reeds presented high heating values (17-20 MJ kg(-1)).
   According to these results, it can be concluded that the wetland system utilised in this research could be A suitable solution for raw wastewater as a stand-alone treatment, although a previous pre-treatment in order to remove grit, heavy solids and floatable materials would be necessary. Besides, the obtained biomass could be utilised as fuel in a small boiler for domestic uses. (C) 2003 Silsoe Research Institute. All rights reserved Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Marine sponges (Porifera) are producers of the largest variety of bioactive compounds among benthic marine organisms. In vitro culture of marine sponge cells has been proposed for the sustainable production of these pharmacologically interesting compounds from marine sponges but with limited success. The development of a suitable growth medium is an essential prerequisite for sponge cells grown in vitro. The MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay was adapted to screen for potential nutritional factors in formulating a growth medium for primary cell culture of Suberites domuncula. In 96-well plates, the effects of nutritional factors including glutamine, pyruvate, iron citrate, silicon, RPMI 1640, and Marine Broth 2216 on the viable cell density were examined in primary cell culture of S. domuncula 36 h after inoculation. Ferric iron (Fe3+) and pyruvate were found to significantly improve cell viability in a dose-dependent manner. Silicon and glutamine showed limited improvements at certain concentrations. The supplement of RPMI 1640 and Marine Broth 2216 did not increase cell viability. As a result, several improved media able to maintain higher cell viability in a short-term culture of primary sponge cells could be formulated.

AB The link between socioeconomics and conservation and the role of legislation in conservation work was discussed in the group with participants from nine European countries. Interest and knowledge among the general public, stakeholders and managers is the key to successful conservation of native crayfish species. Exploitation and conservation do not necessarily exclude each other. A controlled fishery, where it can be sustained, may be an essential tool for conservation by increasing the general awareness and involving more people in the task of protecting the native crayfish species. This strategy is mainly possible for the noble crayfish in the northern part of its distribution, where strong traditions connected to crayfish also exist. A balance between utilisation and overexploitation has to be found and local guidelines for sustainable exploitation produced. Media, the Internet and educational material aimed at schools and stakeholders are excellent ways of reaching a wide audience with information. Universal objectives, rules and regulations at the European level are desirable and the noble crayfish and the stone crayfish should be included in Annex 11 of the Habitat Directive. Based on this framework detailed regulations are best worked out at the national level, considering the specific crayfish situation in the country. Information about the legislation, the purpose of the legislation and the consequences when not obeying it should be distributed. Stricter regulation of the trade with live alien crayfish is vital because of the associated risk of introducing new diseases and species.

AB In recent years, partnership in development assistance has received a great deal of attention. This paper evaluates an alternative form of partnership, a business-NGO partnership, that provides rural people with access to telecommunications in Bangladesh. Despite market liberalization, the traditional provision mechanisms may not provide universal access to people living in rural areas of developing countries. Attainment of universal access, therefore, may require alternative institutions. Based on three criteria of universal service provision nondiscriminatory access, uniform pricing, and quality restrictions - this study finds that the business-NGO partnership complies with the first two criteria. In addition, the partnership ensures economic sustainability for both the business and the NGO.

AB Using a space-for-time substitution procedure, we assessed the patterns of variation during stand development of the humic epipedon and vegetation diversity in a pure European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) forest and in a mixed beech-hornbeam (Carpinus betulus L.) forest. The humic epipedon was investigated through macro morpho logical characteristics (thickness of the OL, OF, OH, and A horizons) and pH measurements (pH(KCl), pH(H20), and DeltapH). Vegetation diversity was assessed using correspondence analysis and hierarchical cluster analysis to identify the main plant community succession groups. The groups were compared using three diversity measures (species richness, Shannon index, and evenness index) and three indices describing the community composition (similarity index between stands and index of heterogeneity at the stand and herbaceous layer levels). The pH measurements revealed an acidification of the A horizon during pure beech stand maturation. Macromorphological characteristics showed an alternation of an organic matter accumulation phase and organic matter disappearance along the two silvicultural cycles. Vegetation diversity measures showed small differences between the two forests. Indices accounting for community composition revealed a homogenizing effect of the pure beech silvicultural type on species composition of plant communities occurring during stand development. They also revealed a strong heterogeneity at the herbaceous level. Comparison of species composition indicated an increasing occurrence of acidophilous species in the pure beech forest. We discuss the interest of these results for future sustainable management decisions.

AB Canadian oat breeders have developed and released more than 130 cultivars since 1886, but no systematic analyses of the genetic diversity of Canadian oat have been made. Ninety-six Canadian oat cultivars released between 1886 and 2001 were examined for genetic diversity and relationships using amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers. Ten AFLP primer pairs were applied and over 442 polymorphic bands were generated for each cultivar. Most of the cultivars were found to be interrelated, although a few genetically distinct cultivars were also identified. The genetic variation observed among these cultivars was low. Only 42.8% of the total scorable bands were polymorphic, of which 59 polymorphic bands were observed frequently (f greater than or equal to 0.90) and 130 bands were detected infrequently (f less than or equal to 0.01) among the 96 cultivars. The mean proportion of fixed recessive bands for all cultivars was high (60.2%) and ranged from 52.3% in cultivar 'Erban' to 65.2% in cultivar 'Glen'. The genetic variability did not change significantly in the Canadian oat breeding programs; only about 1% of the AFLP variation might have been fixed during the 115 years of oat breeding. These findings demonstrate the narrowness of the Canadian oat gene pool and the urgent need to broaden the gene pool for sustainable oat improvement in Canada.

TI Illegal extraction of forest products in Laguna de Apoyo Nature Reserve,
   Nicaragua
SO CARIBBEAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE
LA English

ID SUMU INDIANS; MANAGEMENT; OPTIONS
AB Unregulated wood extraction has placed great pressure on many protected areas in Nicaragua. One example is the Laguna de Apoyo Nature Reserve, located on the edge of the most densely populated region in Nicaragua. Biomass extraction from this Reserve was principally for fuel wood (78%), followed by construction wood (13%) and other forest products (9%), the latter being dominated by broomsticks. Women and children, who accounted for 37% of the workforce involved in extraction activities, removed lower quantities of forest products per person than men. Although tree species richness in the reserve is still high, total wood extraction was estimated to occur at up to 50% of the maximum rate of biomass replacement by photosynthesis. Extraction rates were greater in areas with vehicular access. We conclude that the forested regions of the Reserve are under stress by heavy and irrational forest use, and recommend a community-based strategy to protect biodiversity and natural resource productivity that incorporates the promotion of sustainable harvesting techniques for fuel wood and non-timber forest products.

AB There are many reasons to decrease the dependency on oil and to increase the use of other energy sources than fossil fuels. The wish for energy security is balanced by a wish for sustainable growth. Catalysis plays an important role in creating new routes and flexibility in the network of energy sources, energy carriers, and energy conversion. The process technologies resemble those applied in the large scale manufacture of commodities. This is illustrated by examples from refinery fuels, synfuels, and hydrogen and the future role of fossil fuels is discussed.

AB Environmental policy of European Union aims at elimination or reduction of use of chemically hazardous materials and sustainable use of natural resources and waste. 6th Action Programme defines the strategy of managing risks from chemicals and recommends development and use of most efficient technologies. Piezoceramics, with its most common representative, the lead titanate/lead zirconate family (PZT), is in focus and substantial effort has been dedicated to both the development of new lead free materials and improving manufacturing technologies of existing materials in order to obtain better efficiency and reduce the volume of chemical waste. Preliminary results of this work, supported by the 5th Framework Programme Growth will be presented in the paper. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.1. All rights reserved.

DE composite wheat blends; dough; farinogram
ID CASSAVA FLOUR; BREAD; QUALITY; BAKING; PRODUCTS; VARIETY
AB Properties of composite dough were investigated on blends of Kenyan bread wheat and upto 20% of each of the following non-wheat flours: maize, sorghum, cassava, sweet potato, arrowroot, banana, cowpea, soybean, and sunflower. Composite doughs were prepared from the various blends and evaluated on farinograph for water absorption, peak time, tolerance and stability. Non-wheat flours generally increased farinograph characteristics of wheat to varying extents depending on replacement level and type of non-wheat flour used. The effects of various non-wheat flours on dough quality vary considerably and can be summarized as follows: sweet potato < maize < banana < cassava < arrowroot < cowpea < sorghum < soybean, sunflower.
   However, dough prepared from the following composite flours were still acceptable: Wheat/maize (80/20); Wheat/sorghum (85:15); Wheat/cassava (80:20); Wheat/sweet potatoes (85:15); Wheat/arrowroot (15%); Wheat/banana (90:10); Wheat/cowpea (90:10); Wheat/Soya (95:5); and Wheat/sunflower (90:10). It was concluded that both cereals and tuber crops investigated are high potential low level partial substitutes for wheat. This would increase the nutritive value of bread and spread out the utilization of limited available wheat, in order to would improve health and food resources. The data is therefore crucial to the baking and milling industry for selecting most suitable composite flour for sustainable commercial bread production, a measure that would put bulk of Africa's food crops into the local market.

AB The development of a new product in the chemical industry is still driven by needs like technical properties, price/performance ratio, biodegradability, or product safety. However, in terms of improving more and more on ecological criteria, summarized under such catchphrases as sustainable development or green chemistry, another important aspect is to use renewable resources as starting materials. This is not significantly new in fragrance chemistry, and there are a lot of raw materials in the perfume oils that are derived from molecules of renewable resources. Two commonly used materials are: longifolene (from turpentine oil) and cedrene (from cedarwood oil). These compounds are very suitable for the synthesis of woody and ambery notes, and even though it seemed that all possibilities were exhausted, it is actually still feasible to discover new molecules with excellent olfactory properties such as Ambrocenide(R) (50a), which is available in three steps from alpha-cedrene. Some of these molecules will be treated in this review, both with respect to synthesis as well as structural and sensory aspects.

SO CHIMIA

DT Article
DE corrosion protection; diffusion barrier layers; hydrogen storage;
   nanotechnology
AB The versatile role of nano-textured layers and their advanced performances have been elucidated in selected R&D projects. The aim was to overcome the limitation of conventional thin films due to micro defects like pinholes and scratches by nano-texturing the functional layers. Our concept allows the development of highly effective diffusion barrier layers for reactive gases in order to prevent their loss to the environment during storage. A second application describes the nanoactive corrosion protection for metallic products due to the combination of a passive physical barrier consisting of a highly cross-linked hydrocarbon layer and the adjustment of the electrochemical potential by incorporating metallic clusters. Tiny amounts of added metals like zinc substitute toxic metals used for conventional corrosion protection so far which enables a management of sustainable materials.

AB Equity is a humanitarian issue that gained strength during the transition from the 20th to the 21st century due to the mounting global discussion and social crisis involving human rights, health, and work. This article aims at (1) introducing the concept of equity as it applies to work environments, particularly to situations involving demanding work schedules, (2) discussing the role of science in equity issues related to work, (3) introducing a new scientific society dedicated to working-time issues, and (4) presenting an overview of new research on working time and health as addressed by the series of manuscripts published in this special issue of Chronobiology International devoted to the XVIth International Symposium on Night and Shiftwork, held in Santos, Brazil, November 2003. The concept of equity has a political as a well as a scientific dimension. Many worldwide organizations, e.g., civil society, academia, and occupational health research institutions, advocate prompt actions toward equity as a strategy to attain sustainable development and to reduce poverty. The analyses of current tendencies in work settings reveal a general situation of disrespect for equity principles, which is expressed by heavy workloads, long work hours, poor work conditions, and deregulation of established labor laws, mainly in (but not restricted to) developing countries. In spite of the great contribution of science in the past five decades, obstacles stand in the way of effectively improving good working conditions, particularly in times of precarious employment. The Working Time Society is a new scientific society that aims at promoting research into working time and health and offers practical advice on how to minimize adverse effects of working hours on workers' health and well-being. An updated view of the research on working times and health includes studies on the relationship between work schedules, worker health, and well-being; effects of night and shiftwork on the internal synchronization of circadian rhythms and laboratory and field interventions; new methods of investigation or new approaches in shift-work studies; and prediction of risks in night and shift work. Current tendencies of work organization contribute to the amplification of inequality across groups and populations, revealing that equity remains a challenge to achieve.

DE sustainable product; design; product life cycle
AB Sometimes, products resulting from design for environment (DFE) endeavours are sub-optimisations from an environmental perspective, because the tool determines the process and not vice versa. For a more systematic way of getting the focus right, a hierarchy of focusing is introduced:
   1. What is the function provided and what is the optimal way of providing it while making a business out of it? Which product should the company then produce?
   2. Where are the "environmental hot spots" in the life cycle of this product?
   3. Which DFE tool supports optimisation of the product by reducing these hot spots?

AB As attention to environmental problems grows, product life cycle management is becoming a crucial issue in realizing a sustainable society. Our objective is to provide the functions necessary for such a society while minimizing material and energy consumption. From this viewpoint, we should redefine the role of maintenance as a prime method for life cycle management. In this paper, we first discuss the changing role of maintenance from the perspective of life cycle management. Then, we present a maintenance framework that shows management cycles of maintenance activities during the product life cycle. According to this framework, we identify technical issues of maintenance and discuss the advances of technologies supporting the change in the role of maintenance.

ID GHG EMISSIONS
AB In the coming years the international debate on commitments for the second commitment period under the Kyoto Protocol will intensify. In this study, the Global Triptych approach is put forward as an input for international decision-making concerning the differentiation of commitments by 2020. It is a sector- and technology-oriented approach, and we calculated quantitative emission limitation objectives and global emissions starting from bottom-up information on long-term reduction opportunities. Central to the calculations were long-term sustainability targets for the year 2050, formulated for (1) energy efficiency in the energy-intensive industry, (2) greenhouse gas intensity of electricity production, and (3) per capita emissions in the domestic sectors. Calculated emission limitation objectives for 13 world regions ranged from about -30% to more than +200%. The ranking of world regions in the differentiation turned out to be independent of the levels chosen for the long-term sustainability targets. The objectives seem sufficient to maintain the long-term possibility of stabilizing atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations at about 550 ppm CO2-eq, but will require severe emission reductions. These may be relaxed to a certain degree if stabilization at 650 ppm CO2-eq is aimed for. We conclude that the bottom-up character of the approach made it possible to examine important basic principles of the Climate Convention, including equity, the needs and circumstances of developing countries, cost-effectiveness and sustainable development.

AB The selection of individuals to represent a group for any purpose can commit the effort to success or failure from the very outset.The description of this group must reflect what is, in reality, the purpose for which the group is being studied. Considering that reference intervals are designed to assist clinicians during diagnostic triage, criteria must reflect the nature of the subjects entering the system for care.The majority of people seeking care have nonlifethreatening, yet troublesome complaints. In other words, persons who are in a reasonable state of health and who are not suffering from significant illness.Therefore the relevant cohort should fit this description, not individuals who lack any clinical or laboratory issues. Our focus is to employ reference intervals to exclude disease and not to define normality. Normality in the eyes of statisticians is quite different from the word as viewed by clinical staff, yet the term is used interchangeably without concern for its ultimate use. As a result medicine today stumbles over this issue at every turn. Scientists and artists do not speak the same language.
   Compounding this awkward situation has been the conviction that by increasing laboratory precision and accuracy, the utility of laboratory data, reference intervals in particular, will improve clinical understanding. This has, after many years, not proven to be the case. What has become very evident, however, is that unsustainably large sums of money are being devoted to improving laboratory performance. To what end, when we are unable to grasp the significance of what is available now including published reference intervals for common test values?
   A realistic perspective on the value of prevailing laboratory performance, as illustrated by reference intervals, must be adopted.The obligation of laboratories, its regulators and professional groups is to create a sustainable mechanism to provide clinically usable information, in a timely and affordable manner, to our population and to those legions of less fortunate humans.

AB Stresses impacting the coastal zone in the Asia-Pacific region are briefly reviewed under the headings of sustainable coastal activities, coastal ecosystem management, community/resource interactions, coastal resource economics and sustainability, coastal area planning, and integrated coastal policies. Recent contributions on mitigation of these stresses are introduced, with emphasis on the Coastal Zone Asia-Pacific Conference, held in Bangkok, May 2002, where various innovative approaches to research, education, information sharing, and coastal policies aiming at improving the state of the coastal areas were presented. These include the roles of community in integrated coastal management; tools and planning for management of coastal areas; education program and capacity building; and the establishments of national and regional frameworks for integrated coastal management. As appropriate information and its transfer are critical to these processes, an analysis is presented of the content of the database on coastal projects in the region, highlighting areas of research interests, funding sources, and achievements. Another database on coastal ecosystems, currently under development, is presented as an example of the type of resource that can be expected to help advance our knowledge and ability to improve the management of coastal areas. Overall, these tools should allow us, given the political will, to improve the state of coastal areas.

AB The Tubbataha Reefs Natural Marine Park, a UNESCO World Heritage Site in the Sulu Sea, Philippines, is an offshore marine protected area well known throughout the scuba diving community for its coral reefs and marine diversity. To address the perennial problem of park financing, the Tubbataha Management Board developed a fee collection and permit system in cooperation with the diving community. A willingness-to-pay survey conducted among divers in 1999 showed that the average diver was willing to pay U.S.$41 per visit. Using these results, a two-tiered pricing scheme was developed for foreign and local divers. After two years of fee collection, the total fee collected amounted to U.S.$65,000, which covered 28% of the annual recurring costs and nearly 41% of the core costs to protect Tubbataha. The experience shows the contribution of willingness-to-pay surveys in instituting user fees for long-term sustainable financing.

ID MARINE PROTECTED AREAS; FISHERIES MANAGEMENT; LEGITIMACY
AB Community-based coastal resources management has become a popular approach to marine conservation and sustainable fisheries management in the Asia-Pacific region. One premise of this approach is that enforcement of community management initiatives is the primary responsibility of the community and that, in most instances, they have the capability to effectively enforce locally developed regulations and rules. The socioeconomic theory of resource management compliance is reviewed and applied to community-based case examples from North Sulawesi, Indonesia. Compliance with nondestructive exploitation practices in several village sites, empirically measured by changes in live hard coral cover, was related to reef distance from a settlement area and not significantly related to visibility from a settlement. A typology of enforcement strategies relative to the type of violator and violation is presented. In certain instances, a comanagement approach is preferred in order to achieve effective enforcement and high compliance.

AB This article explores existing educational materials available to support integrated coastal management (ICM) in the Philippines and Indonesia. Emphasis is placed on materials gathered from informal education institutions (i.e., nongovernmental organizations, donor-sponsored projects, national initiatives, etc.). Over 100 sets of educational materials were collected and evaluated based upon criteria such as interactive qualities, availability, target audience, geographical focus, etc. Several deficiencies and gaps in the content and coverage of ICM materials were observed. Most significantly, it appears that improved coordination of education programs and dissemination of educational materials is needed. Accessibility and the choice of delivery mechanism (i.e., books, Internet, videos, etc.) also emerged as important considerations when designing educational materials. Surveys conducted with ICM practitioners in the Philippines and Indonesia further illustrate the challenges and opportunities in ICM education. Findings from the assessment of educational materials and surveys facilitated the development of several recommendations for future ICM educational materials, including improved local-level ICM education and focusing on ICM and ICM process sustainability.

DE corpus linguistics; Johannesburg; sustainable development; lexical
   analysis
AB The recent Johannesburg Summit on Sustainable Development was an important symbolic moment, in spite of the poor results some people claim to have emerged from it. The very fact that official written texts were produced for a wide discussion in many participating countries is a positive side-effect, as it enables the almost unique possibility of using parallel corpora for the analysis of the respective language and underlying assumptions. This could lead to the identification of some potential causes for conflicts and misunderstandings. Both texts were produced according to a (supposedly, at least) common intention, so they may be seen as functionally equivalent. In spite of that, there are obviously huge differences, not only in extension, but also in the type of lexical combinations and stylistic features used. Words like ambiente, in the Portuguese language, and Umwelt, in German, as well as natureza/Natur, appear in very different lexical environments, so that one can, by means of a distributive methodology, obtain a picture of what might be intended with their use in the two countries. Another issue brought about by this analysis was a reflection on the concept of,foreign,, language. This raises the question not only of knowing whether, or to what extent, written texts like these are really intended to have an effect on (local) people's minds, but also about pragmatic/cultural constraints that have influenced their very shaping.

TI Courage you can't understand: How to achieve the right balance between
   shaping and policing commerce in disputes before the World Trade
   Organization
SO COLUMBIA JOURNAL OF TRANSNATIONAL LAW
LA English
DT Article
AB This Article assesses the degree to which the World Trade Organization ("WTO") system today achieves a workable, consistent, and predictable balance between the policing function of international commercial rules and the shaping function. Policing is defined as keeping the channels of commerce free from barriers. Shaping is defined as regulating commerce in ways designed to achieve ends that may or may not, strictly speaking, be commercial. The Article examines this issue in the context of decisions by WTO panels and the WTO Appellate Body interpreting key provisions of the WTO Agreements: Articles III and XX of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994, and four provisions of the WTO Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures. The Article offers seven proposals for improving the shaping-policing balance in the WTO agreements, concluding that the application of existing rules is unlikely, of itself, to establish a sustainable shaping-policing balance.

AB Soil organic carbon (SOC) is a dynamic soil property and a key component of the quality and sustainability of agricultural soils. Predictions of SOC change often rely on correlations between SOC and other soil physical and chemical properties that are assumed to be more stable over time. The objective of this study was to examine the long-term stability of relationships between SOC, physiochemical properties, and years under cultivation in a common rice (Oryza sativa L.) soil (i.e., a fine, montmorillonitic, thermic, Typic Albaqualf) of the Mississippi Delta region of the south-central United States. The field site consisted of an undisturbed native prairie and three agricultural fields that have been cultivated for 15, 26, and 44 years, respectively, in 2001. Neither SOC concentration nor mass was significantly correlated with sand, silt, or clay content, but both were significantly correlated with pH in 1987. Soil OC concentration and mass were significantly correlated with both silt and clay, but not sand content, and pH in 2001. However, the relationship between SOC concentration and sand content changed significantly, while the relationships between SOC and pH and silt and clay content remained stable and did not change significantly from 1987 to 2001. Soil OC decreased exponentially as years under cultivation increased, but the modeled relationship appeared to remain stable from 1987 to 2001. Results indicate that continuous cultivation of the Typic Albaqualf of this study will result in SOC stabilizing around 8-10 g kg(-1) which is less than 50% of the SOC in the adjacent undisturbed, native prairie soil. The results of this study can be used to strengthen predictions of how ecosystems, particularly flood-irrigated rice agroecosystems, will respond to future changes in management practices towards more sustainable use of the soil resource.

AB Traffic-induced soil compaction and tillage systems can impact the productivity and sustainability of agricultural soils. The objective of this study was to assess the response of soil microbial populations to wheel-traffic in two tillage systems on a Norfolk loamy sand (Typic Kandiudults; FAO classification Luxic Ferralsols). Experimental variables were with and without traffic under conventional tillage (disk harrow twice, chisel plow, field cultivator-planter) vs. no tillage employed in a split-plot design with four replications; main plots were traffic and subplots were tillage. Soil samples were collected from 0-2 and 2-4-cm depths, sieved (2 mm), and used to assess soilwater content, microbial biomass nitrogen (N), dehydrogenase, and microbial characterization using phospholipid ester-linked fatty acid (PLFA) analysis. Traffic increased soil-water content, had little affect on microbial biomass N, and increased microbial activity (no-till plots only) likely due to increased amounts of residue. Soil-water content, microbial biomass N, PLFA estimates of microbial biomass, and microbial activity were all consistently higher in no-till compared to conventional tillage plots. Data from this study suggest that conventional tillage results in a lower, more static, possibly more mature community of microbes while the microbial community under no-till appears to be a younger, more viable growing population. Finally, these data suggest that overall soil quality, at least in the surface soil layer, is improved in agricultural systems employing no-till operations.

AB Food grade fisheries have reached their sustainable limits while aquaculture production has increased to meet consumer demands. However, for growth in aquaculture to continue and utilise sustainable, feeding ingredients, alternatives to fish oil (170), the predominant lipid component of fish diets, must be developed. Therefore, there is currently considerable interest in the regulation of fatty acid metabolism in fish in order to determine strategies for the best use of plant oils in diets for commercially important cultured fish species. Plant oils are characteristically rich in C-18 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) but devoid of C-20 and C-22 highly unsaturated fatty acids (HUFA) found in FO. The fatty acyl desaturase enzyme activities involved in the biosynthesis of HUFA from PUFA are known to be under nutritional regulation and can be increased in fish fed diets rich in plant oils. However, fatty acid desaturase activity is also known to be modulated by "water temperature in fish. The present study aimed to investigate the interaction between water temperature and diet in the regulation of fatty acid metabolism in rainbow trout. Trout, acclimatized to 7, 11 or 15 degreesC, were fed for 4 weeks on diets in which the FO was replaced in a graded manner by palm oil. At the end of the trial, fatty acyl desaturation/elongation and beta-oxidation activities were determined in isolated hepatocytes and intestinal enterocytes using [1-C-14]18:3n-3 as substrate, and samples of liver were collected for analysis of lipid and fatty acid composition. The most obvious effect of temperature was that fatty acid desaturation/elongation and beta-oxidation were reduced in both hepatocytes and intestinal enterocytes from fish maintained at the highest water temperature (15 degreesC). There were differences between the two tissues with the highest desaturation/elongation and beta-oxidation activities tending to be in fish held at I I degreesC in the case of hepatocytes, but 7 degreesC in enterocytes. Correlations between fatty acid metabolism and dietary palm oil were most clearly observed in desaturation/elongation activities in both hepatocytes and enterocytes at I I degreesC. The highest beta-oxidation activities were generally observed in fish fed FO alone in both hepatocytes and enterocytes with palm oil having differential effects in the two cell types.

AB We describe our experiences with computational science and engineering (CS&E) education at the University of Colorado at Boulder in order to illustrate the difficulties associated with such a course of study. Our CS&E offerings began with a course on high-performance scientific computing (HPSC) developed under a CISE Educational Infrastructure grant from the National Science Foundation. The course was taught from 1991 through 1998 when various practical concerns ended its run. The course was revived in 2003 to meet the demands of several emerging programs in computational science. In this paper, we outline the rise, fall, and restoration of the HPSC course. We identify the technological developments that presently make such a course less labor intensive and more sustainable.

AB The current worldwide concern about tropical deforestation raises questions about the sustainability of avian populations in isolated forest fragments. One of the most important issues concerns the sizes of forest fragments necessary to maintain populations and the genetic variation within them. We address this by: (1) using mtDNA sequence variation to infer aspects of the population structure of four species of understory birds from four sites in southern Costa Rican rainforest; and (2) determining whether forest fragmentation that has occurred in the last 50 years has had an effect on the amount of within-population variation for the species in question. High levels of between-population differentiation (D,,) were found over a relatively small geographic scale (<130 km) for white-breasted wood-wren (Henicorhina leurosticta), bicolored antbird (Gynmopithys leucaspis), and gray-headed tanager (Eucometis penicillata), suggesting that these species are highly sedentary and exhibit strong female philopatry. No mtDNA variation was found in Plain Antvireo (Dysithammus mentalis). In all three of the polymorphic species there was a significant decrease in mtDNA nucleotide diversity in populations isolated by forest fragmentation as compared to populations in contiguous primary forest. Even in relatively large (250-1000 ha) forest reserves, sedentary avian species have lost roughly half (range: 43-85%) of the nucleotide diversity in mtDNA over a relatively short period of time. Our results indicate that sedentary avian species in forest fragments isolated by clearing have undergone severe reductions in effective population size due to population bottlenecks perpetuated by prolonged isolation and potential edge effects.

AB The growth of PFI (private finance initiative) and PPP (private public partnerships) is fundamentally changing the nature of the construction industry from a product and to service base. This involves moving the balance from capital investment to revenue generation. As a consequence the costing and scheduling associated with the maintenance phase has gained significant importance. This paper constitutes part of a broader research work which proposes a holistic model that provides a radical approach to decision making concerning the design, construction and maintenance of buildings and structures. This is in reaction to the need for buildings and structures to provide increased functional performance through their design life at reasonable cost, while including measures aimed at conservation and sustainability of the earth's non-replaceable resources. A model is proposed comprising of three parts namely, data, simulation and presentation. With an associated web-based decision tool that consumes data and generates knowledge, the supply side of data is primarily through facilitating access by product suppliers and manufacturers, as well as data generated through lab-based research work and actual monitoring of material degradation. The knowledge generated by the system will benefit a whole range of stakeholders within and peripheral to construction industry.

AB The Mexican vulgate, which long dominated the historiography of the French Revolution, and which was broadly accepted in the social sciences, is no longer sustainable. But newer attempts to frame the issue of class in entirely linguistic terms, producing the claim that France had no bourgeoisie because few people explicitly described themselves as "bourgeois," are not entirely convincing. The Revolution brought into being, and helped to sustain, a new social group: the "state bourgeoisie," which defined itself by its education and by state service, and which was socially cohesive and exclusive. Thus, the Revolution can be seen as "bourgeois" not in the sense of having been caused by a rising bourgeoisie, but in the sense that it caused one to rise.

AB Around the world, approximately 5 million people became infected with HIV in 2001, an estimated 70% via sexual transmission. Numerous studies have demonstrated that it is difficult to achieve total protection from vaginally or rectally acquired HIV/SIV when using parenteral immunization. Mucosal immunization was seen as the best approach to achieve sustainable immune responses at mucosal sites of viral entry. This was further emphasized when several studies implicated rectal and vaginal mucosa as latent reservoirs for the HIV virus and virus-specific CD8+ T cell immune responses in gastrointestinal mucosa were shown to be less efficient than in systemic tissues. Mucosal vaccines utilizing various routes of immunization including intranasal, intrarectal, intravaginal and oral immunization have been tested for their potency to induce virus-specific immune responses systemically but especially at mucosal sites of viral entry. The unsatisfactory results in initiating simultaneously sufficient immune responses at mucosal and systemic sites are being overcomed by use of appropriate and novel adjuvants such as Cholera toxin, Escherichia coli heat-labile toxin, immunostimulatory CpG motifs, coinjection of cytokines and others. Various routes of immunization are now being compared and combinations of mucosal immunization and parenteral boost and vice versa have also been tested. Generations of new vaccines, such as DNA-based vaccines, multipeptide, lipopeptide and alphavirus replicon particles-based vaccines have been created and studied for their efficiency.

AB The proper function of the genome largely depends on the higher order architecture of the chromosome. Our previous application of nanotechnology to the questions regarding the structural basis for such macromolecular dynamics has shown that the higher order architecture of the Escherichia coli genome (nucleoid) is achieved via several steps of DNA folding (Kim et al., 2004). In this study, the hierarchy of genome organization was compared among E. coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Clostridium perfringens. A one-molecule-imaging technique, atomic force microscopy (AFM), was applied to the E. coli cells on a cover glass that were successively treated with a detergent, and demonstrated that the nucleoids consist of a fundamental fibrous structure with a diameter of 80 nm that was further dissected into a 40-nm fiber. An application of this on-substrate procedure to the S. aureus and the C. perfringens nucleoids revealed that they also possessed the 40- and 80-nm fibers that were sustainable in the mild detergent solution. The E. coli nucleoid dynamically changed its structure during cell growth; the 80-nm fibers releasable from the cell could be transformed into a tightly packed state depending upon the expression of Dps. However, the S. aureus and the C. perfringens nucleoids never underwent such tight compaction when they reached stationary phase. Bioinformatic analysis suggested that this was possibly due to the lack of a nucleoid protein, Dps, in both species. AFM analysis revealed that both the mitotic chromosome and the interphase chromatin of human cells were also composed of 80-nm fibers. Taking all together, we propose a structural model of the bacterial nucleoid in which a fundamental mechanism of chromosome packing is common in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Copyright (C) 2004 S.

AB How to develop the capability of an enterprise is a vital problem to many knowledge based enterprises. This paper argues that an enterprise can achieve dynamic development of its capabilities by constructing cooperative knowledge network (CKN). The network can provide the enterprise with multiple learning opportunities and the enterprises in the network can dig out, acquire and exploit all kinds of knowledge resources in the network. Development of the enterprise's capability needs an established basic capability as the foundation together with sustainable learning ability and transformation capability. Based on theoretical analysis, a case is discussed about a high-tech enterprise, Nanjing SVT Group, constructing the CKN for IC design. The paper concludes that construction of CKN is an effective way to acquire internal and external knowledge to improve the capability of the enterprise.

AB Under the socialist regime that prevailed until the start of the 1990s, Mongolia made great progress in improving human development indicators, and poverty was virtually unknown. Political and economic transition in the 1990s ushered in a rapid rise in asset and income inequality, and at least a third of the population has been living in poverty since 1995. Many workers made redundant from uneconomic state-owned enterprises were absorbed into the extensive livestock sector in rural areas and by the growing informal economy in urban areas. The livestock sector grew dramatically, with herders accounting for over a third of the total population and half of the active labour force by the late 1990s. Three consecutive years of drought and harsh winters in 1999-2002 then drastically reduced the national herd. These trends are viewed against a backdrop of relative neglect of the livestock sector in development priorities and a concomitant decline in agricultural productivity. Pressures on common pasture have mounted, and conflict over grazing is becoming endemic. In such a context, sustainable management of Mongolia's pastoral commons should be central to the country's economic development agenda in general, and to its poverty reduction strategy in particular. This article draws on the findings of a country-wide participatory poverty assessment conducted in 2000. Blending quantitative and qualitative data, these findings help to bring into sharper relief the broad outlines of an integrated approach to building secure and sustainable livelihoods both on and off the pastoral commons.

AB Digital libraries may have extraordinary impact on education, especially in Asia where vast communities could benefit from improved teaching and learning. We highlight opportunities and challenges, drawing upon three case studies. Thus, we explore how CITIDEL, a discipline-specific Digital Library for Education (DLE), oriented toward computing, has evolved, and constitutes a part of the US National Science Digital Library (NSDL), which includes over 160 projects. By way of contrast, we describe the grass-roots and low-cost global movement toward electronic theses and dissertations led by NDLTD. Summarizing lessons learned from these case studies, we suggest ways forward so that DLEs in Asia may engage the diverse stakeholders whose serious involvement can ensure sustainable success.

AB The evidence base derived from the research literature has clearly established that type 2 diabetes mellitus may be prevented or delayed through pharmacological interventions and, most efficaciously, through lifestyle interventions. Unfortunately, efforts to translate the research results into programs that may be applied to the clinical or healthcare system setting are lacking. The purpose of this article is 3-fold: (i) to briefly review the results of the major trials conducted in the area of type 2 diabetes; (ii) to outline an approach that may guide the design and development of type 2 diabetes prevention programs for clinical care; and (iii) to present a protocol that may support the process of implementation in the practice setting.
   The literature review clearly delineates critical type 2 diabetes prevention program outcomes, i.e. modest weight loss, dietary changes, an increase in physical activity level and, in the case of pharmacological interventions, good adherence to medication regimens. Guided by evidence-informed approaches to translation, this article outlines a set of critical program design principles that guide the development of type 2 diabetes prevention programs, and are systematically included and recognized in the programs; these principles are termed the '4Ss': (i) effect size; (ii) program scope; (iii) scalability; and (iv) long-term sustainability in the real-world setting.
   Based on additional literature that addresses operational feasibility and principles of design and evaluation, this paper describes a protocol that may help healthcare systems and care delivery settings design such prevention programs and successfully document desired impacts that are meaningful to their customers. The protocol is designed to include the total membership of a healthcare system and it systematically allows for the identification and stratification of the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Individuals are assigned to one of three risk strata: (i) low risk of developing type 2 diabetes; (ii) high risk of developing type 2 diabetes; or (iii) active disease (already diagnosed with type 2 diabetes). The high-risk group is subsequently invited to participate in risk-reduction strategies that are designed to reduce the incidence of type 2 diabetes.

AB Between 1993 and 2001, 106 patients with esophageal cancer were reviewed at a multidisciplinary clinic and treated with palliative intent by chemoradiation therapy. This study assesses the palliative benefit on dysphagia and documents the toxicity of this treatment. The study population comprised 72 men and 34 women with a median age of 69 years. Patients were treated with a median radiation dose of 35 Gy in 15 fractions with a concurrent single course of 5 FU-based chemotherapy. Dysphagia was measured at the beginning and completion of treatment and at monthly intervals until death, using a modified DeMeester (4-point) score. Treatment was well tolerated, with only 5% of patients failing to complete therapy. The treatment-related mortality was 6%. The median survival for the study population was 7 months. The median baseline score at presentation was 2 (difficulty with soft food). Following treatment, 49% of patients were assessed as having a dysphagia score of 0 (no dysphagia). Seventy-eight per cent had an improvement of at least one grade in their dysphagia score after treatment. Only 14% of patients showed no improvement with treatment. Fifty-one per cent maintained improved swallowing until the time of last follow-up or death. This single-institution study shows that chemoradiation therapy administered for the palliation of malignant dysphagia is well tolerated and produces a sustainable normalization in swallowing for almost half of all patients.

TI Ecological economics as a policy science: rhetoric or commitment towards
   an improved decision-making process on sustainability
SO ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS

DT Article
DE ecological economics; policy science; political economy; decision-making
   process; sustainability
ID ENVIRONMENT; PHILOSOPHY; COMMUNITY; CHINA
AB With sustainability issues currently attracting increasing political and policy attention, this paper examines the impact of the rise of ecological economics in the policy world and its potential influence on the decision-making process. This study emphasises that ecological economics development is coevolved with, and modified to fit, specific social, economic, political and cultural contexts. As a policy science, ecological economics is context-sensitive and action-oriented. Explaining why it is so, and what to do about it, has become imperative for ecological economists. This paper attempts to address the questions such as: What are the macroeconomic conditions and political processes that make the formulation and implementation of ecological economic policy possible? How should this alternative social reality engage with the dominant decision-making process? Does ecological economics provide the necessary means for prescribing policy measures to achieve sustainable development? Endeavouring to understand these dimensions of ecological economics has been a dynamic social process, and understanding this complex process might provide an opportunity to bridge the divide between policy rhetoric and reality in practice rather than maintain the status quo. In order to achieve an improved decision-making process on sustainability, it highlights the imperative to explicitly study the institutional setting through which sustainable development policy discourse is mediated.

ID MARINE CAPTURE FISHERIES; SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT; INDICATORS;

AB Indicator systems are seen as central tools for ecosystem-based fisheries management, helping to steer fisheries towards sustainability by providing timely and useful information to decision-makers. Without testing hypotheses about the links between policies and outcomes, however, indicator systems may do little more than promote ad hoc policies, possibly even prolonging the transition to sustainable fisheries. The Institutional Analysis and Development (IAD) framework is a robust framework that has been used extensively to design policy experiments and empirically test theories and models linking ecological-economic systems, institutions and the sustainability of common pool resource systems. A modified IAD framework is developed that transparently encompasses both process-oriented pressure-state-response (PSR) and structurally oriented sustainable livelihood indicator frameworks, thus providing a platform for ecosystem-based fisheries management policy experiment design and monitoring. An institutional approach to fisheries management facilitates critical examination of important cross-cutting issues, including assumptions regarding what comprises sustainability and how market, government and civil society organizations use strategic investments in capital assets and institutions to achieve sustainability objectives. The emphasis on capital assets keeps attention on the relative merits of alternative investment options in policy experiments. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper describes the general concepts, meaning, and definitions of sustainability and proposes the use of soft methodologies, particularly fuzzy set theory, for its assessment. Criteria and indicators (C&I) are described as instruments to assess forest sustainability. Basic elements and concepts of fuzzy sets are described, including membership functions and their interpretations in the context of sustainable forest management. Moreover, fuzzy operators that can combine the operational concepts of sustainability, namely criteria and indicators are described. A simple illustrative example is described to demonstrate the application of these methodologies. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Ecological restoration is one of the fastest growing fields in applied ecology providing new ideas and opportunities for biological conservation and natural resource management. Despite countless attempts in the past, large portions of restoration projects have been considered unsuccessful mainly due to: unrealistic goals; inadequate restoration plans based on an ad-hoc approach; lack of explicit and quantified evaluation criteria for restoration success; lack of ecological understanding; social, economic, and political constraints; or combinations of these factors. Existing ecological theories, particularly succession theories, may provide a conceptual framework for a restoration trajectory. However, projecting a 'desirable' trajectory and outcome is often challenged by the unpredictability of ecological communities in the changing environment. Particularly, the sustainability of reconstructed 'historic' ecosystems appears to be an unlikely goal in the ever-changing and unpredictable future environment. This paper calls for a shift in the restoration paradigm from 'historic' to 'futuristic.' A 'futuristic' restoration is: (i) to set realistic and dynamic (instead of static) goals for future, instead of past, environment; (ii) to assume multiple trajectories acknowledging the unpredictable nature of ecological communities and ecosystems; (iii) to take an ecosystem or landscape approach, instead of ad-hoc gardening, for both function and structure; (iv) to evaluate the restoration progress with explicit criteria, based on quantitative inference; and (v) to maintain long-term monitoring of restoration outcomes. A theoretical framework for 'futuristic' restoration, in terms of goals, trajectories, evaluation criteria, and monitoring, along with a historical perspective is presented in this paper.

AB The foundation of ecological restoration is how to preserve biocoenoses (i.e. functional ecosystems) and how to restore and reconstruct them where they were destroyed. One of the most important challenges is the restoration of complex, multilayer forests representing the potential natural vegetation. Native forests have functions in disaster mitigation and environmental protection, as well as providing the basis of existence for local people and maintaining gene pools for the future. Through vegetation surveys in Japan and South-east Asia, we have established basic principles in vegetation-ecological restoration of forests. We have been restoring expected disaster-mitigation and environmental protection forests, as experimental reforestation projects, since the 1970s at more than 750 sites throughout the 3000 km long Japanese Archipelago, and since the 1980s in parts of South-east Asia, China and South America. The restoration movement has spread from a local activity to a global movement. We aim for the sustainable development of human society through ecological restoration of living environments.

ID LONG-RUN GROWTH; INCOME TAXATION; ECONOMIC-GROWTH; MODEL; TAX; HEALTH
AB In this paper I address the links between life expectancy, retirement age and economic growth. I build a finite horizon OLG model with exogenous retirement in which human capital accumulation drives endogenous growth. The return on individual investment in human capital depends positively on the remaining active years. Postponing retirement age raises the return and investment in human capital, and the proportion of working individuals, thus increasing the sustainable growth rate. Increments in life expectancy do not increase the growth rate by themselves, but reduce it: optimal investment in human capital is not affected and the proportion of retirees becomes larger. Therefore, increases in life expectancy lead to higher growth rates only if they are accompanied by simultaneous increments in the working period. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The paper considers the implications for the EU accession candidates of Central and Eastern Europe of the fiscal-financial constraints imposed by the Stability and Growth Pact and the Maastricht Treaty. Our findings apply also to those current EU members whose initial conditions (e.g., infrastructure and progress in state pension reform) or other structural characteristics (e.g., demographic structure, growth potential, Balassa-Samuelson equilibrium real exchange rate appreciation) differ significantly from the EU average. We find the existing criteria to be seriously flawed and propose an alternative rule, the Permanent Balance Rule, based on a strong form of tax smoothing.

AB The forest fire regime was characterized for the boreal forest of western Quebec using the provincial government's digital databases (1945-1998). Lightning- and human-caused fires account for 71% and 29% of the total area burned, respectively. With regard to ignition sources, lightning was responsible for 38% of the fires while humans were the ignition agent for 62% of fires. The fire regime parameters (burn rate, fire occurrence, and size) were subjected to a stepwise regression analysis on the basis of regional landscape units. Models indicate that climatic factors, particularly summer precipitation and maximum temperatures, play a primary role in forest fire dynamics, regardless of the ignition source. Fire occurrence models were the most predictable with R-2 values of 0.79 and 0.60 for lightning fires and human-caused fires, respectively. Models of burned areas reached an R-2 value of 0.63 for lightning but only 0.22 for human-caused fires; on the other hand, the fire-size model for human-caused fires showed an R-2 value of 0.57 but only 0.24 for lightning fires. In the case of human-induced fires, the density of the road network and sand deposits were important in fire occurrence and burned areas models. Once characterized, landscape units tend to group together naturally, forming extensive areas in which the fire regime is relatively homogeneous. The results of the regionalization based on lightning fire regimes are discussed from the standpoint of sustainable forest management.

DE indicators; landscape functions; Environmental Minimum Requirements;

AB In view of the poor integration of environmental issues into agriculture, and due to the impossibility to maintain the high subsidies after the EU-enlargement, far-reaching reforms of the agricultural policy are necessary. An important contribution to improve the inclusion of environmental aspects is provided by the EU-project AEMBAC, which comprises partners in 7 European countries. All relevant ecological, economic and social aspects as well as the specific characteristics of the landscape and the agricultural system are taken into consideration. The methodology is starting from a strong landscape-ecological approach: state and pressure indicators are chosen and analysed, and various landscape functions are assessed. Further steps are the definition of Environmental Minimum Requirements, the evaluation of land use sustainability, the proposal of realistic policy targets, and the development of specific agri-environmental measures. By involving farmers and other stakeholders a transdisciplinary perspective is achieved.

DE Socotra Island; vegetation tiers; geobiocoenological differentiation;
   pasturage; agroforestry
AB Socotra Island (Republic of Yemen) is inhabited by descendents of a primeval south-Semitic language group for some 3000 years. The main way of living is traditional pasturage husbandry and in the lesser extent also fishery. Pasturage is practised in a similar extensive way as on continental Yemen. Increasing anthropogenic pressure on the natural resources is thus above all driven by livestock grazing and by excessive wood depletion used for construction and fuelwood. As a matter of fact, grazing practice influenced plant communities and notably contributed to the contemporary distribution and structure of tree populations around the island, including endemic Commiphoras, Boswellias, Dendrosicyos socotrana and Dracnena cinnabari. Consequently, the most extensive vegetation type is low grazed forest dominated by some Euphorbiaceae representatives as Croton sp. or Jatropha unicostata, species unpalatable to the livestock. Preservation of the biological richness of Socotra Island will not be, therefore, possible without restrictions aimed at pasturage husbandry, at least in the key structural segments of the ecological network. Precise geobiocoenological differentiation is needed for recognizing the detailed state of natural conditions of the island.

AB The sustainability concept as an emerging global development paradigm in connection with different notions like development, live/living, society, future, etc. became not only topical but also popular among different subjects including researchers and scientists, soon after the appearance of the World Commission on Environment a Development Report "Our Common Future" in 1987, the Second World Conservation Strategy called Caring for the Earth-A Strategy for Sustainable Living (IUCN, UNEP and WWF, 1991), and mainly after the UN Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED, Rio de Janeiro, 1992). It represents an important challenge for the geography, landscape ecology, human ecology and other environmentally oriented disciplines, which highlight the holistic, integrated or synthetic approaches to the environment or better said, to the system of relationships between man and his/her environment (note: for the purpose of this study we will abstract from the differences among these scientific disciplines).

DE integrated land utilisation; solar age; ecologisation;
   transdisciplinarity
AB To promote a higher degree of territorial integration with the accession countries within the Danube region a network of excellence called 'ACADEMIA DANUBIANA' will be established. As a model for the future, it should offer a transdisciplinary approach within social, economic, technological and human science structures to implement it within the political-adminstrative system and the universities.
   The solar age needs a change from fossile fuels and materials to renewable energy systems, and it requires a brand new access to science and design.
   This transdisciplinary program called 'Ecologisation of the Danube region' is about the working out of perspectives, concepts and study-programs to develop sustainable models of integrated land utilisation.
   Elaborating integrated land utilization requires transdisciplinary methods to conceptualize knowledge integration for different systems, disciplines, qualities and interests.
   Therefore, Ecological design is a system of assembling conceptual, material and strategic components in a pattern which functions to benefit life in all its forms. It implies any form of design that minimizes environmentally destructive impacts by integrating itself with living processes to minimize resource depletion, preserve water cycles and respects species diversity, etc.
   The 'okologische Moderne' offers three strategies to start preserving and conserving our living spaces, then regenerating and repairing our living tissues and finally strenghtening corporate responsibility with a sophisticated stewardship.

AB Study area of the current contribution is Borsod hills in the Northern Hungarian Mountains, which consists of two small landscapes: Sajo valley and Putnok hills. Besides collecting data on flora and vegetation, traditional agricultural land use methods were also observed. Those habitats that preserved botanical values due to maintained land uses are presented with endangering factors and recommendations towards sustainability. Most valuable areas are hayfields, pastures, extensively cultivated orchards, extensively cultivated arable lands and mosaic-like agrarian habitats, on which 80 nature protected or rare plant species can be found. Even a new species for the Hungarian flora, Geunz rivale L. was found during this research.

AB The recent landscape is the result of the long-lasting social and economic human activities. The landscape is created by elements which are influenced by human activities, elements which are partly or definitely changed. Landuse and the spatial organisation of the human activities has the significance with the connection of the negative phenomenons or conflicts, which are the result of the anthropogenical influences.
   Landuse forms evaluation is the one of the possibilities of the landscape evaluation. Landuse forms are created by the landscape elements which are connected with the social needs. The spatial structure of the landuse forms in the landscape refers on the enlargement of the urbanised areas, areas for transport, areas of the arable land. These types of the landuse forms has an influence on the recent landscape structure, landscape biodiversity and stability.
   Landuse forms mapping and its evaluation is the supposition of the complex landscape evaluation on the base of the sustainable management. The landuse forms and the sustainable management were evaluated in the Danube lowland area.

DE time-spatial transformation; cultural landscape; sustainable land use
AB In the first part of the paper there are presented main theoretical principles of the time-spatial transformation of the landscape and its possible influence on biosphere reserve zones along with the references for future theoretical-methodical approach to this issue. The time-spatial potential and its parts as continuity, inertia and time accumulation potential are considered to be very important phenomenon in the development of the cultural landscape. In the second part this paper presents an approach to the study of the transformation of the Pol'ana Biosphere Reserve cultural landscape (its transition zone) and its meaning for the sustainable use. The time-spatial potential of the landscape was identified by multitemporal analyses of historical maps. The overlay of these maps in GIS resulted into following categories of land use changes: 1. no change (the highest stability), 2. occasional change (medium stability), and 3. permanent change (the lowest stability). An intensity of the occurred change (in sense of the distance between natural and anthropogenic land use forms) was also examined. The most stable areas (with no change) were situated on the lowest and the highest parts of the study area. On the other hand the most labile areas (with permanent changes) laid mostly where mountain and lowland zones meet. The most stable areas overlaid with physical conditions in the form of a geo-complex model indicate a strong mutual relationship. These areas also represent the spots with the highest time-spatial potential of the landscape and should therefor be the core areas for the management of the cultural landscape.

DE Climate Alliance; communal policy; alternative energy; global warming;
   mobility; financial support
AB The influence of policies and education on fostering landscape-ecological awareness and environmental impact assessment among the population is being increasingly accepted by ecologists and scientists in general. A successful legislation to protect sustainable global, regional, and local climatic conditions largely depends on a well-balanced and transparent information policy, implementation strategy and a sound educational basis: Being aware of the fact that policy as decision making authority on its various administrative levels to a large extent influences and controls shaping and reshaping of our cultural landscapes and physical environment the main aim of this contribution is to analyse the (real) attitude of mind of communal politicians as to climate protection since through deliberately joining Climate Alliance in Austria they bound themselves to attribute actively to reaching the above goal.
   The method chosen for getting the necessary information is that of an open standardized interview because it, normally, allows a clear reality-related insight into the mental attitudes, political feelings and personal preferences of the 63 interviewees (mayors or responsible community officials) out of 74 Climate Alliance Communities in Styria, (i.e. appr. 12% of all communes). The analysis of the questionnaires reveals the general discrepancy between political declaration of intention and reality of everyday political life resulting from the fact that politicians are subject to reelection within relative short periods, too short for a far-sighted implementation of environmental goals.

AB Solution to the cross-section problem of the sustainable development of the society and the environment requires an integrated approach of several sciences. The spectre of the participating problem-oriented sciences must widen with the increasing complexity of interpretation of sustainable development while the intensity and their co-operation and aggregation must also increase.
   The ever increasing complexity of global problems and the efforts of science to respond leads to the state when the development of the sustainable development concept including the issue of indicators used for quantification, assessment and communication of this development acquires the metascientific nature. It is a challenge for integrated landscape, society and environmental sciences with geography, landscape ecology, human ecology and environmental science standing in the foreground. Constitution of learning/science about sustainable development of the society and the environment dealing with its metascientific, theoretical-methodical, empirical and applied aspects may represent an important progress in improvement of the not sufficiently satisfying relationship between the science and the concept of sustainable development. On the one side, establishing of such scientific discipline is determined by the proper attributes of the science in general and nature i.e. its inner content and structure of the sustainable development concept on the other.

AB In spite of present relatively higher level of Slovakia's external debt, the situation need not be evaluated as dramatic, especially with regard to the basic ratio indicators measuring external debt (which are still positive), to the net external debt (creditor position) and also with regard to the structure of the Slovak short term debt. On the other hand the question of debt sustainability (working lip the optimal level of Slovak external debt) remains topical.

The concept of multidimensional sustainability based on capital theory, consisting of production, human, social and natural capital is introduced as major methodological approach.
   Based on this, Slovak NUTS II regions were compared using selected indicators of four above mentioned types of capital. Results demonstrates that regional disparities measured as multidimensional variables can be considered as vital contribution to real convergence among EU regions and that the principle of sustainable development has potential significantly influence transformation to the knowledge based society and the formation of adequate partnerships in the regions.

AB The need to measure and evaluate urban development has led to the development of numerous social-economic indicators. However, depending upon the large set of indicators, we find difficulties in interpreting the progress and often reach different conclusions regarding economic and social development of towns and evaluating the sustainability. The aim of the research reported in this paper was to develop the research methods and analysis tools for assessing and implementing the goals of sustainable urban development, including the presentation of information needed for decision making in the Internet. The research presented in this paper uses factor and cluster analysis methods to generate a set of underlying attributes (factors) that capture the sustainable urban development. Based upon the factor scores of systems', the study finds the towns with similar characteristics (clusters). We demonstrate an application of the model using a database of economic and social development of towns in Lithuania.

AB The potentialities of information technology, together with economic concerns, have been forcing various organizations to go electronic in order to reposition themselves toward a sustainable future. This has also happened to libraries, whose primary value lies not only in their collections but also in their contribution to education through smart organization and management of collected information, which they make easily usable and accessible to users. The paper addresses these issues and discusses such aspects as what is meant by "learning", how can it be pursued and managed in the library environment, what is the functionality of the e-learning library; and how the e-learning resources are included and organized in the e-learning library.

AB This paper investigates the role of fundamentals in the speculative episodes experienced by the Czech Republic and Poland during the 1990s. The evidence suggests that the currency crises of the two Central and Eastern European countries are significantly related to macroeconomic fundamentals. The analysis has implications for the design of macroeconomic policies in transition economies and for the sustainability of an exchange rate commitment.

ID GENERATION
AB Achieving sustainable development is a target that is now widely seen as important in worldwide public opinion. In this context, the utilization of renewable energy resources such as solar, geothermal and wind energy appears to be one of the most efficient and effective ways of achieving this target. Recently, power generation from geothermal energy has become of big importance in Turkey, which is located on the Mediterranean sector of the Alpine-Himalayan Tectonic Belt and is among the first seven countries in abundance of geothermal resources around the world. The main objective in doing the present study is twofold, namely: (a) to investigate Turkey's geothermal energy potential for power generation and (b) to overview the Denizli-Kizildere geothermal power plant (DKGPP) with an installed capacity of 20.4 MWe, which is at present the only operating geothermal power plant of Turkey. Based on the drilling data, which have been gathered to date, Turkey's geothermal energy potential for power generation is determined to be 764.81 MWe. Electricity generation projections of Turkey are also 500 MWe from Germencik, Kizildere, Tuzla and several of the other fields by the year 2010 and 1000 MWe by 2020. The Denizli-Kizildere geothermal field has an estimated capacity of 200 MWe. The DKGPP was put into operation in 1984 and has been operated since then. It produced an electrical energy of 89,597 MWh in 2001, representing an electric power of 10.6 MWe in the same year. Present applications have shown that in Turkey, geothermal energy is a promising alternative and can make a significant contribution towards reducing the emission of greenhouse gases. As the public recognizes the projects, the progress will continue. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT; BIOMASS ENERGY
AB The overall objectives of energy-related environmental policies in Turkey are to ensure sufficient, reliable and economic energy supplies to support sustainable economical and social development while protecting and improving the environment. The country's environmental policy considers that energy policy should take into account environmental problems and that a balance should be found between increases in energy demand are required for economic development and environmental concerns. Turkey's high rate of energy-related carbon emissions growth is expected to accelerate, with emissions climbing from 60 million tons in 2002 to almost 220 million tons in 2020. Carbon intensity in Turkey is higher than the western developed country average. Energy-intensive, inefficient industries remain under government control with soft budged constraints, contributing to undisciplined energy use. Planned industrial privatisations may close the oldest and most inefficient operations and modernize surviving ones. Elimination of energy price subsidies could stimulate energy conservation, reducing energy and emissions growth below current projections. This paper reviews energy consumption and climate change mitigation in Turkey.

DE electricity sector; biomass; market implementation
ID SUSTAINABILITY; SHIFTS
AB Energy from biomass is expected to be the most important renewable energy source in the Netherlands on the short term. Nevertheless, the implementation of many projects using biomass is considerably delayed, while other projects are abandoned. In this paper, the discrepancy between national policy goals on the one hand and actual implementation on the other is therefore investigated. A multi-level model is introduced in which technological development is understood as the interaction of developments at the level of technological regimes, niches and the broader context of the socio-technical landscape. Subsequently, the model is used to analyze the developments in the electricity regime and the niches for manure digestion and co-combustion. The main conclusion is that the delay of the projects is explained not only by a lack of stability within the electricity regime, but also by a mismatch of the rules of respectively the agricultural regime and the waste regime.

TI Tradable green certificates in Flanders (Belgium)
SO ENERGY POLICY
LA English
DT Article
DE green certificates; renewable energy; policy instruments
AB The paper provides details on green certificate systems in Belgium. The Flemish region has established a system and the Walloon region is preparing a slightly different one. The lack of uniformity and consequently of transparency in one country emphasises the need for more EU leadership in the field. The main part of the article analyses the established Flemish system. Green certificates are complementary to other instruments that promote renewable electricity, e.g. direct subventions on the feed-in price of green electricity or direct subventions on capital investments. Certificates execute a forcing effect on the actual development of green power if the imposed shares of green power in total sales are significant and if the fine level is at the height to enforce the quota. If the fine is too low the incentive effect turns into a financing tax effect. When the green certificate system does the job it is designed for, i.e. operating at the edge of the RES-E development and organise the transition from a non-sustainable to a sustainable power system, certificate prices will be high and reduce end-use consumption of electricity. A segmentation of the RES-E sector along the various RES-E technologies is a necessity to keep any certificate system affordable, effective and efficient. One can segment the tradable certificate market or one can assign a different number of certificates to a different RES-E technology project. Both solutions require an intensive follow-up of cost structures and of other policy measures (subventions), but given the infant state of understanding and experience segmenting markets may be best in the nearby years.

AB In March 2000, OPEC decided to stabilise oil prices within a range of 22-28 US-Dollar/barrel of crude oil. Such an oil-price-level is far beyond the short and long run marginal costs of oil production, beyond even that in regions with particularly high costs. Nevertheless, OPEC may achieve its goal if world demand for oil increases substantially in the future and oil resources outside the OPEC are not big enough to accordingly increase production. In this case OPEC, which controls about 78% of world oil reserves, has to supply a large share of that demand increase. If we assume OPEC will behave as a partial monopolist on the oil market, which takes into consideration the reaction of the other producers to its own sales strategy, it can reach its price target. Lower prices before 2020 are probable only if the OPEC cartel breaks up. Higher prices are possible if production outside OPEC is inelastic as assumed by some geologists, but they would probably stimulate the production of unconventional oil based on oil sand or coal. Crude oil prices above 30 US-Dollar/barrel are therefore probably not sustainable for a long period. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB We consider urban sustainability issues in developing countries, with a focus on urban growth. The need for urban management tools that are able to provide prospective scenarios is addressed. Urban simulations can represent a useful approach to understanding the consequences of current planning policies-or their incompleteness. Nevertheless, simulations of future urban growth are usually quite difficult without tools which embrace the complexity of the urban system. We describe an urban-growth simulation for the city of Lagos in Nigeria, in which an urban cellular automata (CA) prototype is used. We propose a bottom-up approach which integrates land-use factors with the dynamic approach of CA for modelling future urban land-use scenarios. The model for Lagos was calibrated and tested with the aid of measured time-series data on land use, through a set of spatial metrics and kappa-coefficients. A twenty-year simulation, until 2020, was run. The simulation results are realistic and achieve a high level of detail, confirming the effectiveness of the proposed model.

AB The connections between people, parks, and tourism have received significant attention in recent years, recognizing the potential for mutually beneficial relationships. Ecotourism has been promoted and widely adopted as a strategy for funding conservation initiatives, while at the same time contributing to the socioeconomic development of host communities and providing for quality tourism experiences. Parks are among the most common ecotourism destinations. Employing interviews, observations and secondary sources, this study assesses the current status of ecotourism at two protected areas in Hainan, China, where it is being promoted as a strategy for balancing regional economic growth and conservation objectives. Through an evaluation of the existing tourism-park-community relationships, opportunities and constraints are identified, Ecotourism development was found to be at an early stage at both study sites. Socioeconomic benefits for the local communities have been limited and tourism activity has not contributed revenues towards conservation to date. Community residents, nevertheless, generally support conservation and are optimistic that tourism growth will yield benefits. In light of the study findings and the salient literature, planning direction is offered with the intention of enhancing the capacity of ecotourism to generate benefits for both communities and the parks, and thus contribute to the sustainable development of the region more generally. Lessons derived have broad applicability for ecotourism destinations elsewhere.

AB Because environmental conservation can remove scarce natural resources from competing uses, it is important to gain support for conservation programs by demonstrating that management actions have been effective in achieving their goals. One way to do this is to show that selected significant environmental variables (indicators) vary between managed and unmanaged areas or change over time following implementation of a management regime. However, identifying indicators that reflect environmental conditions relevant to management practices has proven difficult. This paper focuses on developing a framework for choosing indicators in a coral reef habitat. The framework consisted of three phases: (1) information gathering to identify candidate variables; (2) field-testing candidate variables at sites that differ in intensity of human activity, thus identifying potential indicators; and (3) evaluating potential indicators against a set of feasibility criteria to identify the most useful indicators. To identify indicators suitable to measure the success of a management strategy to reduce anchor damage to a coral reef, 24 candidate variables were identified and evaluated at sites with different intensities of anchoring. In this study, measures that reflected injuries to coral colonies were generally more efficient than traditional measures of coral cover in describing the effects of anchoring. The number of overturned colonies was identified as the single most useful indicator of coral reef condition associated with anchoring intensities. The indicator selection framework developed here has the advantages of being transparent, cost efficient, and readily transferable to other types of human activities and management strategies.

ID WASTE-WATER TREATMENT; OPERATION
AB The complexity of environmental problems makes necessary the development and application of new, tools capable of processing not only numerical aspects, but also experience from experts and wide public participation, which are all needed in decision-making processes. Environmental decision support systems (EDSSs) are among the most promising approaches to confront this complexity. The fact that different tools (artificial intelligence techniques, statistical/numerical methods, geographical information systems, and environmental ontologies) can be integrated under different architectures confers EDSSs the ability to confront complex problems, and the capability to support learning and decision-making processes. In this paper, we present our experience, obtained over the last 10 years, in designing and building two real EDSSs, one for wastewater plant supervision, and one for the selection of wastewater treatment systems for communities with less than 2000 inhabitants. The flow diagram followed to build the EDSS is presented for each of the systems, together with a discussion of the tasks involved in each step (problem analysis, data collection and knowledge acquisition, model selection, model implementation, and EDSS validation). In addition, the architecture used is presented, showing how the five levels on which it is based (data gathering, diagnosis, decision support, plans, and actions) have been implemented. Finally, we present our opinion on the research issues that need to be addressed in order to improve the ability of EDSSs to cope with complexity in environmental problems (integration of data and knowledge, improvement of knowledge acquisition methods, new protocols to share and reuse knowledge, development of benchmarks, involvement of end-users), thus increasing our understanding of the environment and contributing to the sustainable development of society.

AB Soil protection requires the improvement of agricultural land use, its planning and its management, in order to achieve a sustainable development. Land evaluation analysis is considered an interface between land resources survey and land use planning and management. The application of information and communication technology has exerted an impact on sustainable land use decision support. Since the early 1990s and following this trend, MicroLEIS (Mediterranean Land Evaluation Information System) has evolved towards an agro-ecological decision support system. The original project corresponds to a set of qualitative land evaluation methods converted to PC computer programs to automate their application. Today, MicroLEIS DSS is a set of useful tools for decision-making which in a wide range of agro-ecological schemes. The design philosophy follows a toolkit approach, integrating many software tools: databases, statistics, expert systems, neural networks, Web and GIS applications, and other information technologies. The MicroLEIS DSS system, in English and Spanish simultaneously, is available ready-for-use from the following website address: www.microleis.com. The new, re-designed MicroLEIS DSS will provide considerable opportunities for greater cooperation in interdisciplinary research and in the application of knowledge to solve problems of soil protection.

AB Many catchments in Australia have experienced increased sediment and nutrient loadings and concomitant declines in water quality and increases in problematic blue-green algal blooms over the past several decades. This paper describes an integrated hydrologic, sediment and nutrient export modelling framework known as catchment-scale management of diffuse sources (CatchMODS). The modelling framework is designed to simulate and assess catchment-scale land and water management activities designed to reduce nutrient and sediment delivery to receiving waters. The Ben Chifley Dam Catchment in New South Wales, Australia is used as a case study for describing the development of the framework. Improving water quality through reduction of sediment and nutrient loads will reduce the probability of algal bloom occurrence in the dam. The innovation of the system is the integration of otherwise separate modelling approaches to enable biophysical and economic assessment of different management options. The outputs from the research are used to improve and focus on-ground remediation, targeted to specific stream reaches or subcatchment areas, as well as to encourage sustainable management practices more broadly in the catchment. With minimal modification, the methods developed are applicable elsewhere to address water quality decline. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper presents a bioeconomic model where fishing effort exerted has multiple impacts on the recruitment process of a sedentary shellfish population. Recognizing that sedentary populations generally possess metapopulation characteristics at the recruitment stage, we show that fishing effort exerted not only influences the recruitment process indirectly by limiting the number of adults that spawn, but also directly by affecting the habitat in which shellfish larvae recruit. Depending on the recruitment characteristics, fishing can have negative and positive direct and indirect effects on the recruitment process. Next, a positive direct effect that fishing can have on the growth rate of the shellfish population if space to recruit to is limited is studied. General characteristics of sustainable fishing are analyzed for the case that recruitment occurs immediately once spawning has occurred as well as for the case that recruitment takes place over a longer period of time. Conditions are identified under which shellfishing should be encouraged in order to facilitate the recruitment process of juveniles. The paper ends by analyzing how fishing alters the optimal sustainable solution when it contributes to habitat destruction.

AB Background. Taiwan's geography and limited stock of sandstone have caused sandstone resources to gradually decline to the point of exhaustion after long-term excavation. Moreover, the Taiwanese government has continuously increased the amount of land area near rivers that cannot be excavated to facilitate riverbed remediation and promote conservation of water resources. Accordingly, predicting and managing the annual production of construction aggregates in future construction projects, and dealing appropriately with some thorny problems, for instance, demand that excess supply, excessive excavation, unregulated excavation, and the consequent environmental damage, will significantly affect the efficient use of natural resources in a manner that accords with the national policy of Sustainable Development (SD).
   Methods. This study establishes an empirical model for forecasting the annual production of future construction aggregates using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), based on 15 relevant socio-economic indicators, such as indicator of annual consumption of cement. A sensitivity analysis is then performed on these indicators.
   Results and Discussion. This work applies ANN to estimate the annual production of construction aggregates; the estimates, the verification of the model and the sensitivity analysis are all acceptable. Furthermore, sensitivity analysis results indicate that the annual consumption of cement is the indicator that most strongly influences the production of construction aggregates, as well as whether construction waste can be recycled and steel structures can be used in buildings, helping to reduce the future production of construction aggregates in Taiwan.
   Conclusions. The elaborate prediction methodology presented in this study avoids some of the weaknesses or limitations of conventional linear statistics, linear programming or system dynamics. Additionally, the results not only provide a short-term prediction of the production of construction aggregates in Taiwan, but also provide a viable and flexible means of verifying quality certification of the production data of construction aggregates in the future by incorporating those relevant socio-economic indicators.
   Recommendations and Outlook. The continuity and quality of the database of relevant indicators used in this study should be closely scrutinized in order to ensure the SD means of exploiting resources.

AB Background, Aim and Scope. For decades, very large areas of former military sites have been contaminated diffusely with the persistent nitroaromatic explosive 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT). The recalcitrance of the environmental hazard TNT is to a great extent due to its particulate soil existence, which leads to slow but continuous leaching processes. Although improper handling during the manufacture of TNT seems to be a problem of the past in developed countries, environmental deposition of TNT and other explosives is still going on unfortunately, resulting from thousands of unexploded ordnance or low order explosions at munitions test areas and at current battlefields.
   Objective. Sustainable phytoremediation strategies for explosives in Germany, which intend to use trees to decontaminate soil and groundwater ('dendroremediation'), have to consider that most of the former German military sites are already covered with woodlands, mainly with conifer stands. Therefore, parallel investigation of the remediation potential is necessary for both of the selected hybrids of fast growing broadleaf trees, which are waiting for planting and forest conifers, which have already proven for decades that they are able to grow on explosive contaminated sites.
   Main Features. A short literature review is given regarding phytoremediation. of TNT with herbaceous plants and some general aspects of dendroremediation are discussed. Furthermore, an overview of our TNT-dendroremediation research network is introduced, which has the strategic goal to make dendroremediation more calculable for a series of potent trees for site-adapted in situ application and for the assessment of tree remediation potentials in natural attenuation processes.
   Results and Discussion. Some of our methods, results and conclusions yet unpublished are presented. For a preliminary calculation of area-related annual TNT dendroremediation potential of five-year-old trees, the following values were assessed: Salix EW-13 6.0, Salix EW-20 8.5, Populus ZP-007 4.2, Betula pendula 5.2, Picea abies 1.9 and Pinus sylvestris 0.8 g m(-2) a(-1). For a 45-year-old spruce forest, an annual natural attenuation potential of 4.2 g TNT m(-2) a(-1) was found.
   Conclusion, Recommendations and Perspective. Our main results deliver quantitative proposals for dendroremediation strategies in situ and provide decision aids. Also aspects of growth of raw materials for energy production are considered. Our dendroremediation research concept for TNT and its congeners can be easily completed for other trees of interest and it can also be applied to herbaceous plants. Knowing the current bottlenecks of phytoremediation and considering the known environmental behaviour of other contaminants, elements of our methodological approach may be easily adapted to those pollutant groups, e.g. for pesticides, pharmaceuticals, PAHs, chlorinated recalcitrants and, with some restrictions, to inorganics and to multiple contaminations. Our dynamical dendrotolerance test systems will help to predict tree growth on polluted areas. To provide some light into the black box of TNT dendroremediation, experimental data regarding the uptake, distribution and degradation of [C-14]-TNT in mature tree tissues will be reported in the second part of this publication.

AB Background, Aim and Scope. With respect to the enormous increase of chemical production in the last decades and the tens of thousands of individual chemicals on the market, the permanent improvement of chemical management is a permanent target to achieve the goals of sustainable consumption and production set by the WSSD in Johannesburg 2002.
   Main Features. Several approaches exist to describe sustainability of chemistry. However, commonly agreed criteria are still missing. There is no doubt that products of modern chemistry help to achieve important goals of sustainability and that significant improvements have occurred regarding direct releases from production sites, but several, facts demonstrate that chemistry is far from being sustainable. Still too many chemicals exhibit hazardous characteristics and pose a risk to health and environment. Too many resources are needed to produce chemicals and finished products.
   Results and Conclusion. Therefore, a strategy for sustainability of chemistry should be developed which comprises the following main elements:
   1. Sustainable chemicals: sustainable chemical management includes a regulatory framework which makes no difference between new and existing chemicals, contains efficient information flow through the supply chain which allows users to handle chemicals safely and offers an authorisation procedure and/or an efficient restriction procedure for substances of high concern. This regulatory scheme should promote the development of inherently safe chemicals.
   2. Sustainable chemical production: Sustainable chemical production needs the development and implementation of emerging alternative techniques like selective catalysis, biotechnology in order to release less CO2 and less toxic by-products, to save energy and to achieve higher yields. Information exchange on best available techniques (BAT) and best environmental practices (BEP) may help to promote changes towards more sustainability.
   3. Sustainable products: An integrated product policy which provides a framework for sustainable products promotes the development of products with a long-term use phase, low resource demand in production and use, low emission of hazardous substances and properties suitable for reuse and recycling. This may be promoted by eco-labelling, chemical leasing concepts and extended information measures to enhance the demand of consumers and various actors in the supply chain for sustainable products.
   Recommendation and Perspective. Important tools for the promotion of sustainable chemistry are the abolition of barriers for innovation in legislation and within the chemical industry, more transparency for all users of chemical products, a new focus on sustainability in education and research, and a new way of thinking in terms of sustainability.

AB Background, Aim and Scope. Problems of long-term existence of the environmental contaminant 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) and necessities for the use of trees ('dendroremediation') in sustainable phytoremediation strategies for TNT are described in the first part of this paper. Aims of the second part are estimation of [C-14]-TNT uptake, localisation of TNT-derived radioactivity in mature tree tissues, and the determination of the degree of TNT-degradation during dendroremediation processes.
   Methods. Four-year-old trees of hybrid willow (Salix spec., clone EW-20) and of Norway spruce (Picea abies) were cultivated in sand or ammunition plant soil (AP-soil) in wick supplied growth vessels. Trees were exposed to a single pulse application with water solved [U-C-14]-TNT reaching a calculated initial concentration of 5.2 mg TNT per kg dry soil. Two months after application overall radioactivity and extractability of C-14 were determined in sand/soil, roots, stem-wood, stem-bark, branches, leaves, needles, and Picea May sprouts. Root extracts were analysed by radio TLC.
   Results. 60 days after [C-14]-TNT application, recovered C-14 is accumulated in roots (70% for sand variants, 34% for AP-soil variant). 15-28% of C-14 remained in sand and 61% in AP-soil. 3.3 to 14.4% of C-14 were located in aboveground tree portions. Above-ground distribution of C-14 differed considerably between the angiosperm Salix and the gymnosperm Picea. In Salix, nearly half of above-ground-C-14 was detected in bark-free wood, whereas in Picea older needles contained most of the aboveground-C-14 (54-69%).
   TNT was readily transformed in tree tissue. Approximately 80% of C-14 was non-extractably bound in roots, stems, wood, and leaves or needles. Only quantitatively less important stem-bark of Salix and Picea and May shoots of Picea showed higher extraction yields (up to 56%).
   Discussion. Pulse application of [C-14]-TNT provided evidence for the first time that after TNT-exposure, in tree root extracts, no TNT and none of the known metabolites, mono-amino-dinitrotoluenes (ADNT), diaminonitrotoluenes (DANT), trinitrobenzene (TNB) and no dinitrotoluenes (DNTs) were present. Extractable portions of C-14 were small and contained at least three unknown metabolites (or groups) for Salix. In Picea, four extractable metabolites (or groups) were detected, where only one metabolite (or group) seemed to be identical for Salix and Picea. All unknown extractables were of a very polar nature.
   Conclusions. Results of complete TNT-transformation in trees explain some of our previous findings with 'cold analytics', where no TNT and no ADNT-metabolites could be found in tissues of TNT-exposed Salix and Populus clones. It is concluded that 'cold' tissue analysis of tree organs is not suited for quantitative success control of phytoremediation in situ.
   Recommendations and Outlook. Both short rotation Salicaceae trees and conifer forests possess a dendroremediation potential for TNT polluted soils. The degradation capacity and the large biomass of adult forest trees with their woody compartments of roots and stems may be utilized for detoxification of soil xenobiotics.

AB Yancheng Biosphere Reserve (YBR) is located along the coastal zone of the Yellow China Sea with 900 km long in Jiangsu Province. Human activities have greatly interfered the original wetlands in YBR for migratory birds using this region as the Flyway with rapidly economic development since 1980. Much of the experimental zones and buffer zones are transferred to agriculture, aquaculture, transportation or buildings, etc. which directly results in many birds losing their habitats and becoming globally threatened, such as the Spotted Greenshank (Tringa guttifer) and the Spoon-billed Sandpiper (Eurynorhynchus pygmeus). So since 1993 some constructed wetlands have been created in the core zone of YBR in order to protect those threatened and near-threatened shorebirds. How to evaluate the sustainability of these original and constructed wetlands is a concern to managers, scientists and local stakeholders. This paper is an initial study on emergy evaluation of original wetlands and recently constructed wetlands in YBR, China. Two new emergy indices, base emergy change (Bee) and net profit (Np), are presented in order to compare the ecological-economic benefits of these different kinds of wetlands. Results show that a waterfowl pond, constructed for ecological reasons at the edge of the core zone of YBR, has much more Bee than the original wetlands and fishponds, while its Np is negative and much lower than the other sites. Fishponds built for economic reasons in the buffer zone have negative Bee while their Np is the highest. However, the emergy yield ratio (Yr) of the original wetlands is the highest. The constructed waterfowl pond can draw more coastal birds than before. Likewise the constructed fishponds can win large economic benefits to maintain the feedback to the waterfowl pond. But no more fishponds should be constructed due to the highest emergy yield ratio of the original wetlands and high Bee in the waterfowl pond. Finding the best way to harmonize conservation and development in the YBR is of great importance to a sustainable future. (C) 2004 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI Adapting food systems of the Indo-Gangetic plains to global

DE Indo-Gangetic plain; GEC; food systems; adaptation
AB The Indo-Gangetic plain (IGP; including regions of Pakistan, India, Nepal, and Bangladesh) is generally characterised by fertile soils, favourable climate and an abundant supply of water. Nevertheless, the challenge of increasing food production in the IGP in line with demand grows ever greater; any perturbation in agriculture will considerably affect the food systems of the region and increase the vulnerability of the resource-poor population. Increasing regional production is already complicated by increasing competition for land resources by non-agricultural sectors and by the deterioration of agri-environments and water resources. Global environmental change (GEC), especially changes in climate mean values and variability, will further complicate the agricultural situation and will therefore, have serious implications for food systems of the region. Strategies to reduce the vulnerability of the region's food systems to GEC need to be based on a combination of technical and policy options, and developed in recognition of the concurrent changes in socioeconomic stresses. Adaptation options need to be assessed with regard to their socioeconomic and environmental efficacy, but a greater understanding of the interactions of food systems with GEC is needed to be able to do this with confidence. This paper discusses information needs relating to resource management and policy support to guide the development of research planning for increasing the robustness of IGP food systems to GEC. Further information is needed to develop a range of adaptation strategies including augmenting production and its sustainability, increasing income from agricultural enterprises, diversification from rice-wheat systems, improving land use and natural resource management, and instigating more flexible policies and institutions.

ID CONSUMPTION
AB Consumer's choice of food can influence the environment. In Sweden, in common with many other countries, consumers need to be given information so they can make environmentally informed shopping choices. However, what is the most advantageous dietary choice to lower greenhouse emissions? This study investigates the greenhouse gas emissions associated with food production for food consumed in Sweden annually. Specifically, this study compares greenhouse gas emissions associated with a nutritionally and environmentally sustainable diet with the average consumption of food in Sweden 1999. The study concludes that the change in energy use and greenhouse gas emission associated with this change of diet is negligible. Lowering greenhouse gas emissions by changing food production processes results in more profound changes than teaching consumers to make environmentally correct choices. There is a basic need for a reduction or a replacement of the use of fossil fuels to produce and distribute our food in order to reach any significant reduction in the emission of greenhouse gases. Swedish agricultural policy does not provide ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In Sweden therefore there is an immediate need to design policy instruments with the primary aim of reducing the greenhouse effect. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Developed countries need to promote alternatives to crops produced in excess (such as cereals), and cultivation with limited environmental impact. Hemp (Cannabis sativa L.) is a potentially profitable crop, fitting into sustainable farming systems. Interest in "new" fibre crops is in fact increasing, to find alternatives to a high-input crop such as cotton, or to relieve the pressure of the paper industry on remaining natural forests. Besides, innovative applications are provided by hemp in renewable raw materials (oils from seeds and essential oils or secondary metabolites from inflorescences for food, cosmetic or pharmaceutical industry; straw and hurds for the building industry and for energy production). The development of more specialized hemp plants,. needs a better understanding and control of metabolism. Since the renewed interest for this crop is increasing all over the World, it is important to update the knowledge on this crop, to understand whether it is a really sustainable, alternative and economically rewarding crop, and what contribution plant breeding, agronomical practice, and processing techniques are making, or could further make, to improve the relevant traits. The symposium "Hemp: perspectives for advanced utilization", held in Bologna (Italy) on March 2004, was an opportunity to update the research carried out in different fields.

TI Rethinking suburban development in Australia: A Melbourne case study
SO EUROPEAN PLANNING STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
AB This article considers suburban development in Australia through the lens of its second largest city, Melbourne. Contemporary urban policies have focussed on the low densities within Australia's capitals and tried to achieve sustainability through urban consolidation policies. The article argues that these policies are often based on a distorted understanding of the relationship between housing markets and labour markets in Australia's large metropolises. The analysis of suburban development in Melbourne shows that suburban development involves complex links between changes in housing and job location and that urban sustainability policy needs to include actions designed to change the distribution of employment as well as the location and density of housing. The article shows that the vast spread of the Melbourne population masks closely linked regional labour and housing markets.

AB This article seeks, first, to respond to some of the more pertinent points raised in the 'new regionalism' debate, like how 'regions' are constituted and how the 'regional scale' relates to other scales in what I call the 'multi-level polity' in the European Union. Second, it explores the potential of regional innovation strategies in the context of less favoured regions and argues that they have an important role to Play in regional renewal even though their impact to date has been modest. Finally, it suggests that the most limiting aspect of the 'new regionalism' debate is that virtually all contributions tend to confine themselves to an inordinately narrow metric of development and, wittingly or not, this tends to conflate what is instrumentally significant with what is intrinsically significant, a conflation of means and ends.

AB To survive in today's competitive software market, software developers must maintain contact with their customers and users and adopt a flexible organization which allows response to feedback and the changing requirements from the use-context. This also requires a software development that enables change proposals and error reports to be acted upon quickly. The present article uses a case study of a flexible development practice which so far has proved to be sustainable and successful to reconsider user involvement and software development practices of small software providers from an agile perspective. Implementing an agile process may allow for competitive flexibility without necessarily jeopardizing quality.

DT Article
ID CLERKSHIP; PROJECT; STUDENTS; ENVIRONMENT; EXPERIENCE; HEALTH
AB Background and Objectives: Traditional medical school department-based clerkship structures can lead to redundancy and/or gaps in curriculum, inefficient administrative systems, and academic isolation for clerkship directors. This paper describes the approaches, successes, and challenges three institutions experienced when implementing an interdepartmental collaboration to create an integrated primary care clerkship experience. Methods: Each school combined family medicine, ambulatory pediatrics, and ambulatory medicine into contiguous clerkship blocks. In all institutions, each clerkship maintained certain distinct features while the integrated aspects contained longitudinal curriculum of certain primary care topics. Results: Evaluations by students demonstrated favorable responses to the new content and integrated methods of teaching, as did results of the Association of American Medical Colleges graduation survey. Faculty at each institution reported that their multidisciplinary approach has stimulated important educational collaborations, many of which require an economy of scale not often achievable within a single clerkship. These included innovative evaluation/documentation efforts; centralization of administrative tasks; enhanced recruitment, retention, and development of community-based faculty; an increase in the active core group of local and national primary care leaders; and an increase in scholarly activities. The collaborations have not occurred without challenges, primarily in the need for identifying sustainable resources for these and future collaborative educational endeavors. Conclusions: The benefits involved in developing an integrated primary care experience include expansion of curriculum content and methods, as well as enhancement of collegial support and resources to community-based and academic faculty. These integrations do, however, bring added challenges, time, and costs to traditional independent clerkships.

TI Key issues in the practice of youth development
SO FAMILY RELATIONS
LA English
DT Article
AB Three significant trends in youth development practice are discussed: movement toward consensus in models guiding practice, movement toward science-based practice, and increasing resources available to practitioners. Consensus on an ecological framework for risk reduction and competence building among advocates for prevention, resilience, and developmental paradigms improves selection of appropriate strategies for all youth audiences, as does research-based evidence on effective programs. Practitioners enjoy an increasing number of print and Internet resources for information, curriculum, program evaluation and improvement, and professional training. Continued improvements in programming and research can significantly enhance existing programs and related areas, but cuts in funding for program sustainability and expansion to all cultural groups represent a major threat to youth development.

   level
SO FINANCE A UVER- CZECH JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS AND FINANCE
LA English
DT Article
DE pension reform; Slovakia; fiscal debt; pension level; asset returns;
   risk
AB This paper considers two aspects of a recent pension reform in Slovakia: the financial balance of the former pay-as-you-go system, and the level of retirement pensions in a newly introduced two-pillar system. Generally, there are three important steps to sustainable pension reform: a change of pension indexation, a raised retirement age, and the launch of a fully funded (Second) pillar. With regard to fiscal debt, the two-pillar system is superior to the pay-as-you-go system in the long term. Having considered the risk of returns on savings in the funded pillar, the authors show that while pensions under the two-pillar system should be higher than under a one-pillar system, it is not a certainty.

TI Atlantic cod stock structure in the Gulf of Maine
SO FISHERIES
LA English
DT Article
ID FLUCTUATIONS; TRENDS
AB Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) in the Gulf of Maine provide an important but depleted fishery that needs to be made sustainable. However, restoring and maintaining robust population components to achieve sustainability is made difficult when their distribution and character is unknown. This study clarifies the structure of the Gulf of Maine CO2 cod grouping by deriving the distribution, movements, and behavior of population components from 1920s data and surveys of retired fishermen. These derivations are consistent with current cod populations and with the existence of localized spawning components. Nearly half the coastal spawning grounds of 50 to 70 years ago are abandoned today and their spawning components have disappeared, suggesting depletion, undetected by system-wide assessments, may have been well advanced by the 1980s.

AB The population structure of the shad, hilsa Tenualosa disha, was investigated with both allozymes and morphometric analysis. Fish samples were collected from nine sites within Bangladesh and compared with samples from four other countries that covered the entire species range. Five polymorphic loci, Idh-1, Idh-m, Mdh-1, Mdh-m and Pgm, were interpretable in liver and muscle with starch-gel electrophoresis, although levels of variation were low. No significant differences in allele frequencies were detected within Bangladesh or within the Bay of Bengal (SE India and Myanmar) samples. Significant differences in allele frequencies occurred between Kuwait, Bangladesh and Indonesia.
   Nine morphological measurements and two meristic counts were compared among the same fish that were collected for genetic analysis. Discriminant function analyses (DFA) of transformed measurement ratios varied widely between sites, even those separated by short distances (<100km). The results showed that hilsa vary greatly in shape and this showed little geographic concordance. Indonesian and Indian hilsa were more distinctive than the most distant sample from Kuwait. Cross-validation of the classification revealed that sites in the middle reaches of the Meghna River in Bangladesh (Chandpur, Goalando, Bhairob Bazar) and Cox's Bazar had less than half the fish correctly classified to their origin. Fish from other countries were much more distinctive. We suggest the morphological results reflect local environmental conditions rather than any population-level differences. The allozyme results suggest that there is substantial gene flow between groups of hilsa within the Bay of Bengal. This means that there is a need for Bangladesh to take into account actions and management decisions in India and Myanmar in order to sustainably manage their fishery. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Policy-makers in most countries now recognise the need to conserve biodiversity, forest productivity and the prosperity of forest dependent communities in the long-term. There is wide recognition of the importance of forested watersheds to hydrological regimes and water quality and the significant cultural, social and aesthetic values of forests. Policies are now directed at achieving sustainable forest management (SFM). Criteria and indicators (C&I) define SFM but obtaining agreement on what SFM is has proven to be a difficult task internationally and nationally. International activities including the work of the International Tropical Timber Organisation (ITTO), the European Union (EU) and the Montreal Process (MP) for temperate and boreal forests outside Europe, have, over the past decade refined C&I for SFM to the point now that there is substantial agreement between them. This paper reviews progress towards defining SFM and shows through a synthesis of the ITTO, EU and MP C&I the emergent consistency in defining SFM. The implication is that there are now sufficiently specific and agreed principles, C&I to guide policy-makers towards SFM. While much work remains to be done to operationalise the C&I, the gap between these agreed criteria and current practice for forest management is so wide that progress can be made within the frameworks while refinement continues.

AB With the start of economic reforms in 1978, China's forest sector was caught up in a whirlwind of change. It began with the devolution of forest tenures in rural areas, but led to reform of state-owned forest enterprises via introduction of stumpage fees and liberalized forest product prices. From the early 1990s to 1998, while China increasingly embraced the market economy, the nation's natural forests continued to be depleted despite repeated emphasis on sustainable development. Then, in the wake of the 1998 floods in the Yangtze River basin, there was a shift in focus from timber production to environmental protection, with policy redirected toward the rehabilitation of damaged forest ecosystems, afforestation in desertified and degraded areas, and a ban on logging in natural forests. We provide an overview of the central themes of reform in China's forestry sector, identify the major factors that influenced policy formulation, and show that the outcomes of China's forest policy changes in the aggregate represent a paradigm shift.

ID SOFTWOOD LUMBER QUALITY; CONSTRUCTION
AB Changing specifier preferences regarding the use and function of construction materials may greatly affect the consumption of wood products. Since architects are often involved in the selection of materials, they were selected for this research. A national survey of 1,200 architect office owners was conducted in order to investigate their environmental concerns and other design criteria regarding wood products. The study also identified the different degrees of effectiveness of several environmental actions taken by wood products companies. According to architects, the design attribute environmentally sustainable is of medium importance, regardless of the product group (the study defined three product groups: structural; appearance; and engineered wood products). Third-party environmental certification proved to be the most effective environmental action. Communication campaigns are surprisingly effective, suggesting that additional environmental advertising efforts by wood products companies might be beneficial. The results of the study suggest that advertising tailored to architects should have a dual purpose, stressing both a quality or appearance feature and an environmental one. Importantly, the quality or appearance issue changes depending on the product group. In that respect, "uniform quality" of the material is an important quality feature in both the structural and the engineered wood product groups.

AB This paper discusses the potential of birds as indicators of sustainable forest management. Several reviews have been critical of birds as indicators of environmental change, and we discuss the major criticisms in the context of forest management. We address these criticisms by suggesting alternative approaches for an indicator research program including the use of focussed studies to identify cause-and-effect relationships, habitat modelling to act as a surrogate to extensive monitoring of populations, and spatially-explicit population modelling (1) to conduct exploratory sensitivity analysis to identify the most important parameters; (2) to incorporate the spatial configuration of habitat into consideration of the impacts of management; (3) to anticipate future impacts as an alternative to measuring past impacts; (4) and, as a means of evaluating alternative management scenarios including natural disturbance regimes. Birds are unlikely to be able to act as a precise tool for the measurement of some forest condition, but they could be useful indicators of sustainable forest management as part of an iterative research program.

AB In recent years, the increase in wood demand, the reduction in the availability of timber resources and the northern expansion of timber harvesting, along with the general perception that wildfires create ecological disasters, have favoured an increase in salvage logging in burned boreal forests. Concurrently, pioneer studies have shown that these post-fire forests may represent important habitats for several wildlife species and that intensive salvage logging, by removing standing snags, has several impacts on wildlife. However, the effects of salvage logging on biodiversity have yet to be considered in post-fire management plans. We examine the issue of salvage logging for wildlife in the boreal forest, with particular reference to Quebec as an example. We describe our current state of knowledge on the use of burned forests by some wildlife and on the impacts of salvage logging on these habitats. We conclude that snag retention at multiple spatial and temporal scales in recent burns, which will be salvage-logged, is a prescription that must be implemented to meet the principles of sustainable forest management and the maintenance of biodiversity in the boreal forest.

AB While animals may use many habitat types, relatively few are preferred and fewer yet are superior in quality (referring to individual fitness as the measure of quality). Historical reduction in habitat quality for some wildlife species has occurred such that we may now have limited reference to original superior-quality habitats. As time passes, managers may be unaware that superior habitats are slowly disappearing and that the slow but cumulative change is significant to a species at the population level. The perception of superior-quality habitat also changes with each successive generation of managers based on their experiences. This paper raises the concern that retrospective work may often be required to determine past forest habitats and associated animal populations to avoid the risk of falling into a trap of not recognizing ever-declining habitat quality through time and relegating animals to what is in fact much poorer quality habitat than those to which they are actually best adapted. Further, the relationship between relative abundance and habitat quality may often be uncertain owing to maladaptive habitat selection by animals, inappropriate survey timing or inter-annual population differences. While we have begun to appreciate aspects of habitat selection for many forest species, few data are yet available that relate selected habitats to fitness of individual animals. Hence, while we may have models to predict habitat use, considerable research remains to be done to be able to predict long-term sustainability of species in managed landscapes.

AB Sustainable forest management ideally involves five elements: 1) establishing a clear set of values, goals and objectives and, 2) planning actions that are most likely to meet desired goals and objectives, 3) implementing appropriate management activities, 4) monitoring the outcomes to check on predictions, effectiveness, and assumptions, and 5) evaluating and adjusting management depending on the outcome of monitoring. Within this framework, indicators are used to determine whether the outcome of management has met the intended goals. In this paper we provide general guidance for developing an integrated and logical monitoring system, define and differentiate between "evaluative" and "prescriptive" indicators, provide more specific advice on choosing evaluative indicators (including a comparison of types of ecological indicators), and provide specific advice on defining prescriptive indicators. Our guidelines for developing an indicator and monitoring framework are based on three principles. The first principle is to develop a logical framework, including 1) establishing clear values and goals before setting indicators and objectives, and 2) linking prescriptive and evaluative indicators directly to plan objectives, and to each other. The second principal is to use the framework to learn adaptively by: 1) designing management activities to address specific questions, 2) learning about thresholds, and 3) testing assumptions. The third principal is to create a formal plan for learning.

AB Protocols to select ecological indicators of sustainable forest management will benefit from a proactive approach that identifies species likely to be most seriously impacted by management. Here, we use an objective approach that couples forest resource inventory information from logged and unlogged landscapes in northeastern Ontario with information from the provincial vertebrate habitat suitability matrix to assess habitat suitability (the amount of used and preferred habitats) in the landscapes and to identify potential indicators of the impacts of forest management activities. Because they may be most representative of potential future logged landscapes in the region, we contrasted the oldest post-clearcut landscapes in the region (1950s and 1960s era, n = 27) with unlogged landscapes (n = 16). Each landscape was a 2-km radius circle (12.6 km(2)). In light of reported invasions of hardwood species into logged conifer sites, we considered two regeneration scenarios for very young post-harvest stands: full and partial regeneration control. Logged landscapes differed markedly from unlogged landscapes with respect to forest age and forest type. These differences resulted in strong distinctions between logged and unlogged forests for bird and mammal communities, but relatively weak separation for herpetofauna. Redundancy analysis indicated that the percent variation in habitat suitability attributable to logging was 27% for birds, 17-18% for mammals, and 8-12% for herpetofauna. More than 40% of bird and mammal species showed highly significant differences in habitat suitability between the two landscape types (P<0.01), with more species having higher suitability in unlogged than logged forests. This higher habitat suitability in unlogged forests was associated with a greater amount of older forests and a higher richness of forest types in unlogged compared to logged forests. The effect of the two regeneration scenarios was discernible for all communities, but had a relatively weak effect, with the possible exception of higher snowshoe hare (Lepus americana) densities under partial compared to full regeneration control. Various lines of evidence are presented suggesting that these differences between logged and unlogged landscapes may be maintained into the future unless actions are taken to ameliorate these effects of clearcut logging. The technique presented here may prove useful in forest monitoring and adaptive management planning because it is objective, can simultaneously consider a large number of forest taxa, focuses on real rather than projected landscapes, and outlines, in a succinct way, the main habitat-related gradients in habitat suitability matrices.

AB Site invasion by ericaceous shrubs after perturbation, either natural or human, is a major concern on some sites of the boreal forest of Quebec. A dense cover of ericaceous shrubs often induces a conifer "growth check," which can last several decades. An interaction study was initiated in 1991 with the general objective of developing silvicultural strategies to ensure plantation success on such sites. Black spruce, jack pine, and tamarack seedlings were planted. Stock type, scarification, and fertilization treatments were organised in a randomized block split plot design. We measured seedling total height periodically over a ten-year period and assessed basal area and survival ten years after plantation. Most responses to treatments were additive. Results indicated that mechanical soil scarification is of major importance to ensure seedling growth, both in height and basal area, on spruce-ericaceous shrub sites of northeastern Quebec. Scarification allowed a better expression of the site index, implying a sustainable impact on microsite characteristics that is greater than short-term effects on mineralization and nutrient availability. Fertilization positively influenced seedling growth, but less than soil scarification. Species choice had a strong impact on site productivity. Over a ten-year period, stock types only had a minor influence on plantation success, when compared to scarification or fertilization effects.

AB Yenicaga Lake is under the threat of human activities such as overexpansion of settlements and drainage of irrigable lands. It is also subjected to industrial, domestic and agricultural pollution. The aim of the study is to produce the basic limnological data that are required for sustainable development plans of the lake and its surroundings. Thus, the physical and chemical characteristics of the lake and the dominant phytoplankton species were investigated from October 1997 to August 1999 in monthly intervals.
   The ionic sequence in the lake was bicarbonate > sulfate > chloride and calcium > magnesium. Conductivity decreases during the algal blooms were related with biological removal of bicarbonate and calcium. Overall concentration of nutrients in the lake was never at low limit for the phytoplankton growth. Ammonia varied from 0.12 to 1.54 mg l(-1), nitrate fluctuated in a wide range of 0.01-8.61 mg l(-1), nitrite ranged between 0.001-0.573 mg l(-1), orthophosphate was between 0.01-1.81 mg l(-1). The algal species composition in the lake was typical for eutrophic ecosystems, and certain blue-green algae species, Anabaena spp., Oscillatoria spp., Aphanizomenon flos- aquae were found to be the dominant organism in the lake. The mean chlorophyll a content (2.26-124.49 mg m(-3)) corresponded to eutrophic level.

AB One of the biggest challenges for China is how to retrofit the industrial processes, which are based on obsolete technology, within financial, institutional and legal constraints. Ecological Industrial Parks (EIPs), based on the principles of material and energy recycle and cleaner production, has been planned and constructed, and is recognized as the third-generation industrial park in China. In this paper, several EIPs in the mainland of China are presented, and the characteristics and experiences of Guigang National Demonstration EIP, Tuopai brewing EIP, Nanhai National Demonstration Regional EIP and Tianjin Economic Development Zone are discussed.

AB Different groups of an ever increasing human population are bound to compete with each other in order to gain access to natural resource reserves, which, in turn, are decreasing in quantity and being degraded. Water is a typical resource of that kind.
   Therefore, the time has come for a deeper understanding of the need to sustainably and collectively manage our 'common' property of planet earth. Contrary to the dark 'tragedy of the commons' prophecies put forward in recent decades, the future dictates a much more rational,careful egoism' approach which might save for us time, effort, money and natural resources.
   Greek and Turkish societies are two social groups that antagonize each other in many ways, one of these being the exploitation of oil in the disputed region of the Aegean Sea. Are we able to collectively exploit this specific natural resource without frictions of any kind? Or even better, could both societies decide that the possible extraction of oil would lead to the pollution of the Aegean Sea, contribute to the greenhouse effect and distract both countries from developing alternative sources of energy? Could they, therefore, willingly leave the available oil unexploited?

AB As the responsibility of food and agriculture industry towards pollution more and more grows, a contribution shall be made hereby. In order to abate or at least to control agriculture related pollution, new methods should be developed more on chemical basis, and environmental pollution should be managed appropriately on regional level. For doing so, suitable conditions have to be created by decision makers on national level, which can only be accomplished by analyzing correctly agriculture related pollution systems and all costs and benefits involved. System analysis in turn requires the availability of sound criteria and standards providing answers for decision makers. Already on the way is the study of implications and needs for research on aspects regarding agricultural and foresty pollution, as well as the trend to develop European regional schools including university graduate programs providing additionally future resources to counteract environmental pollution.

AB Today's fast-changing business environment makes high demands on organizations for timely strategic decisions and business actions. If it was possible to analyze all the business events and promptly identify those conditions that require the attention of decision makers, the necessary adjustments and improvements could be made at the right time. In this paper, we present Event Sequence Extractor, which is our efficient solution for promptly detecting problematic sequences of business events that require action by decision makers. Event Sequence Extractor integrates the Interstage Navigator family of products, which provide faster Business Intelligence to enable decision-making in business process monitoring. The result is a more efficient and reliable business operation that leads to lower costs, protection from lost revenues, and a sustainable competitive advantage.

AB This paper proposes a new niching method named hierarchical niching, which combines spatial niching in search space and a continuous temporal niching concept. The method is naturally implemented as a new genetic algorithm, QHFC, under a sustainable evolutionary computation model: the Hierarchical Fair Competition (HFC) Model. By combining the benefits of the temporally continuing search capability of HFC and this spatial niching capability, QHFC is able to achieve much better performance than deterministic crowding and restricted tournament selection in terms of robustness, efficiency, and scalability, simultaneously, as demonstrated using three massively multimodal benchmark problems. HFC-based genetic algorithms with hierarchical niching seem to be very promising for solving difficult real-world problems.

SO GEOFORUM
LA English
DT Article
DE smallholder agriculture; rural livelihoods; drylands; diversification;
   southern Africa
AB This paper investigates the ways in which national and regional policies relate to farming activities and concerns amongst the rural population in an area of southern Africa. The struggle to make a living through farming was a common theme to emerge from research about changing livelihoods in response to both variability in the environment and changes in policy. This local discourse echoed regional debates about land and agrarian reform in post-apartheid South Africa and the uncertain future of mixed farming in Botswana. It also raised broader questions about the viability of the future of small-medium-scale farming systems in rural areas in Africa, especially those within dynamic dryland environments such as the Kalahari. This paper looks specifically at the links between poverty and asset holding and aims to identify the ways in which people are or are not able to utilise or mobilise these assets in times of need. We argue that this, can vary significantly between seemingly similar settlements, and similar households and that understanding this complexity is the key to recognising how future interventions many impact upon people's lives. Too often, in the quest to produce understandings of poverty and livelihoods, the complexity, incongruity and reality of day-to-day practices are overlooked. Thus we seek to draw out the interactions between policy and natural resource use, and the capital asset changes involved in these interactions, which influence the sustainability of livelihoods and the differing levels of poverty and vulnerability.

AB Genetic engineering is often depicted as a breakthrough solution to hunger and environmental problems in agriculture. Such claims encourage the further shift of public resources toward molecular sciences, globalized intellectual property rights, and relaxed biotechnology regulation. However, focusing on transgenic crops is a risky and inadequate response to socioeconomic and ecological challenges. The search for a universal, technological solution disregards the complex geographies of food production and trade. This article challenges claims that crop genetic engineering represents a new direction in agriculture, that transgenic crops have performed well, and that the regulatory approaches used in the United States or Europe are universally applicable. It outlines three geographies of difference that distinguish agriculture in the global North from farming in most of the global South. Those differences point to the need for more place-specific, multifaceted, and farmer-centered approaches to agricultural productivity and sustainability, approaches to which geographers have much to contribute.

DT Article
AB This article introduces the GA's 2003 Annual Conference in Derby, as well as giving a brief personal history including beginnings of interest in geography, of the 2003 GA President The Conference theme, 'Valuing Geography' is looked at from the textbook publisher in the educational world.
   The article argues that the educational system is becoming more centralised - there has been a change in the National Curriculum from a diverse, eccentric marketplace to a disciplined homogenised one. And because of this the editorial process is now more about bidding for contracts from awarding bodies than creating novel responses to educational opportunities. The Government needs to play an active role in keeping educational publishing vibrant and lively.
   The article suggests that there are three huge challenges facing the UK industry: first, achieving greater and more sustainable growth to compete on a truly global scale; second, changes in customer behaviour and understanding the needs of the end-user, and; third, digital media within a changing regulatory and technological environment.

AB Carbon (C) storage and sequestration in agricultural soils is considered to be an important issue in the study of terrestrial C cycling and global climatic change. The baseline C stock and the C sequestration potential are among the criteria for a region or a state to adopt strategies or policies in response to commitment to the Kyoto Protocol. Paddy soils represent a large portion of global cropland. However, little information on the potential of C sequestration and storage is available for such soils. In this paper, an estimation of the topsoil soil organic carbon (SOC) pool and the sequestration potential of paddy soils in China was made by using the data from the 2nd State Soil Survey carried out during 1979-1982 and from the nationwide arable soil monitoring system established since then. Results showed that the SOC density ranged from 12 to 226 t C ha(-1) with an area-weighted mean density of 44 t C ha(-1), which is comparable to that of the US grasslands and is higher than that of the cultivated dryland soils in China and the US. The estimated total topsoil SOC pool is 1.3 Pg, with 0.85 Pg from the upper plow layer and 0.45 Pg from the plowpan layer. This pool size is similar to2% of China's total storage in the top 1 m of the soil profiles and similar to4% of the total topsoil pool, while the area percentage of paddy soil is 3.4% of the total land. The C pool in paddy soils was found predominantly in southeast China geographically and in the subgroups of Fe-accumulating and Fe-leaching paddy soils pedogenetically. In comparison with dryland cultivation, irrigation-based rice cultivation in China has induced significant enrichment of SOC storage (0.3 Pg) in paddy soils. The induced total C sequestration equals half of China's total annual CO2 emission in the 1990s. Estimates using different SOC sequestration scenarios show that the paddy soils of China have an easily attainable SOC sequestration potential of 0.7 Pg under present conditions and may ultimately sequester 3.0 Pg. Soil monitoring data showed that the current C sequestration rate is 12 Tg yr(-1). The total C sequestration potential and the current sequestration rate of the paddy soils are over 30%, while the area of the paddy soils is 26% that of China's total croplands. Therefore, practicing sustainable agriculture is urgently needed for enhancing SOC storage to realize the ultimate SOC sequestration of rice-based agriculture of China, as the current C sequestration rate is significantly lower than the potential rate.

ID CONFLICT
AB Sustainable development of freshwater resources shared by two or more countries and reducing the risk of conflict between the riparians requires the development of effective international governance systems. While global and regional conventions and agreements can provide the framework for such governance, they alone are not sufficient. It is important for the countries to agree on a common vision and to develop a strategic action program to address the key threats to the transboundary water environment. Drawing from the experiences drawn from the global environment facility international waters programs and projects, the article highlights the need to implement actions to relieve stresses on the environment. The article focuses on the pivotal role of monitoring and evaluation in ensuring effective implementation of the agreed actions; in providing accountability in resource use; in focusing oil the results and impacts of pro : grams and projects; and in learning and disseminating lessons that can lead to improvement and replication of future interventions. The paper finally introduces an indicator framework that is proposed for monitoring and evaluation of GEF-funded international waters projects. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID SOIL
AB Headwaters are the zero-to-first-order catchments that form the upstream margins of all river basins. Environmental changes in headwaters, not least deforestation, can affect the quantity and quality of the water resources downstream. Headwater control is a philosophy that strives to link the perspectives of the applied scientist with the practitioner and policy maker. It emphasises practical, field scale. action research and integrated environmental management strategies that work within nature and with local communities. In Slovakia, Central Europe, where economic transition has affected forest management, measurements of sediments in 27 small headwater reservoirs showed a negative correlation with the degree of forest cover. In Honduras, Central America, where forest conversion is caused by the agricultural colonisation of very steep slopes, accelerated sediment production is not constrained by conventional cross-slope barriers of Vetiveria zizanioides (vetiver grass). Assailed by Hurricane Mitch, the steepest (65-75%) slopes became source areas for landslides that removed around 600 times more sediment than that removed annually by surface wash, producing sediments that buried fields and choked water courses down-slope. The grass barriers did little to prevent landslide Generation. but deep-rooted trees might have been more effective. Achieving sustainability in Such environments will require a longer term perspective on the significance of environmental extremes and the dangers of building reliance on structures that halt only smaller range events.

ID SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT; PIGMENTS; CARE
AB A teaching exercise is described that aims to expose undergraduate chemistry students to the type and range of complex and interacting issues that a chemist active in an industrial organisation might typically encounter. The business area selected is the titanium dioxide pigment manufacturing sector, that is meant to be representative of large-scale chemical manufacturing. Although the students are exposed to a range of chemical topics, they are also expected to understand some of the associated economic, environmental and legislative drivers that, inevitably, impinge on the business operations. Indirectly, the exercise aims to make the students aware of the concepts of sustainable development, as applied to the chemicals industry.
   The students are asked to engage in a mature discussion as to whether a new titanium dioxide manufacturing facility should be constructed within their area. The background information supplied to the students is based around a real situation that existed in 2001. Evaluation of the exercise by the students indicates a definite positive response and suggests that such teaching packages can play a positive role in demonstrating the real issues related to enhanced environmental awareness within the chemicals industry.

ID SUPERCRITICAL CARBON-DIOXIDE; SOLUBILITY PARAMETERS; MICROEMULSIONS;
   WATER; METALS
AB Green process technologies involving the use of liquid and supercritical carbon dioxide have shown much promise as sustainable extraction and reaction media in many applications such as homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis, nanotechnology, polymer synthesis, organic transformations, and the hydrometallurgical processing of zinc. Commercialization of these technologies has been limited by the high capital equipment and utility costs of CO2 based chemical processes. Incorporation of CO2-philic groups such as perfluoroethers, perfluoroalkyls, perfluoracrylates, and siloxanes in molecules has led to organic materials capable of transporting otherwise insoluble polar and organometallic compounds into carbon dioxide at relatively moderate pressures. Combining solvating extractants and carbon dioxide has shown promise in commercial and developmental zinc recovery operations; however, transport of the metal species into carbon dioxide has been limited by the solubility of the charged organometallic compounds formed. Here we show that the use of a CO2 soluble counterion such as perfluorocarboxylic acid will enhance the solubility of organometallic compounds in carbon dioxide provided the molecules are designed to strike a balance between low cohesional energy and high free volume. Following these simple thermodynamic rules, we have identified CO2 soluble organometallic complexes that readily dissolve in carbon dioxide at a low pressure and temperature of 860 psi and 25 degreesC, respectively. Even though this study focuses on the design of highly CO2 soluble organometallic compounds for hydrometallurgical processes, we surmise that our guidelines can be employed for the development of CO2-philic compounds useful in applications such as catalysis, synthesis of nanoparticles, and organic synthesis in general.

AB Ionic liquids are discussed as sustainable green solvents, but toxicity and ecotoxicity data are rare. In this paper we present our results for different ionic liquids with the acetylcholinesterase inhibition assay. The results show that the acetylcholinesterase can be inhibited by ionic liquids containing a cation with a positively charged nitrogen and a certain lipophilicity. We tested imidazolium ionic liquids with different alkyl chains at R-1 and R-2 as well as with different anions and compared these results with our findings for other cation structures such as pyridinium ionic liquids and phosphonium ionic liquids. According to our results imidazolium and pyridinium ionic liquids inhibit the purified enzyme with EC50 values as low as 13 muM. The bulky phosphonium ionic liquids were less inhibitory. These results can be rationalized by structure - activity relationship considerations.
