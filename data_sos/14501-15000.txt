ID TIME-SERIES
AB This article presents a historical analysis of the Chilean monthly growth rate and the Chilean Peso from 1987 to 2001, applying the Switching Regime methodology design by Hamilton (1989). Three scenarios were considered for each variable implying estimating a number of parameters using the expected maximization iterative procedure (EM). There is a characterization of the conditional density function for each state of the economy, defined by boom, sustainable growth, and finally, the state of an economy in recession. For the nominal exchange rate the three states are inflationary risk scenario, sustainable devaluation, and a real exchange rate appreciation environment. The estimation procedure shows that the economy moved into a recession density function scenario when the Asian Flu was evident in 1998. Currently, we are in the sustainable rate of growth scenario, with inflationary risks coming only from the exchange rate market. The mean growth in the three scenarios is 10.5%, 5.5%, and -2.4%, implying a potential non-accelerating inflationary rate of growth of around 5 to 6%. For the nominal exchange rate die mean values are 12%, 3% and -7% for each scenario. Exchange rate shows a steady state around 3% meaning a real depreciation of 0% given the inflationary target of 3 percent.

AB An experiment was conducted in semi-arid Niger to determine the influence of supplementation with groundnut cake (GC) [0 g kg(-1), 2.5 g kg(-1), 5 g kg(-1), and 7.5 g kg(-1) live weight (LW)] and P (0 g day(-1) and 3 g day(-1) animal(-1)) on diet and millet stover intake and digestibility, sheep growth rate, and nutrient excretion. Total digestible organic matter intake (DOMI, g kg(-1) LW0.75) increased 4.24 +/- 1.26 g g(-1) of GC and decreased -0.31 +/- 0.16 g g(-1) GC(2), and increased (P = 0.10) with P supplementation. Millet stover intake (g kg(-1) LW) was related to GC level by both linear (1.79 +/- 0.53 g g(-1) GC) and quadratic (-0.20 +/- 0.07 g g(-1) GC(2)) functions and to P supplementation by linear function (0.87 +/- 0.46 g g(-1) P). No effect of GC x P interaction was observed. At equal level of GC, P supplementation increased stover intake by 2-20%. Diet digestibility increased linearly (P < 0.01) with GC level, but no effect of P supplementation was observed. Digestibility of neutral detergent fibre was unaffected by either GC or P level. Animals supplemented with P had adequate P (0.24%) in their diet in contrast with those unsupplemented (0.05-0.18%). Live weight gain (g day(-1)) increased 22.10 +/- 3.10 g g(-1) GC and decreased -1.52 +/- 0.39 g GC(2). Live weight gain response to P supplementation (7.33 +/- 1.66 g g(-1) of P) was independent of GC level. Nitrogen concentration in faeces [g kg(-1) faeces dry matter (FDM)] increased linearly both by GC and P supplementation, whereas urinary N (g L-1) was only influenced by GC level. Faecal P (g kg(-1) FDM) increased about three-fold with P supplementation. It is concluded that an adequate capture of the additional N and P that is voided following supplementation, could enhance the sustainability of mixed farming systems in the Sahel.

AB In type theory based logical frameworks, recursive and corecursive definitions are subject to syntactic restrictions that ensure their termination and productivity. These restrictions however greately decrease the expressive power of the language. In this work we propose a general approach for systematically defining fixed points for a broad class of well given recursive definition. This approach unifies the ones based on well-founded order to the ones based on complete metrics and contractive functions, thus allowing for mixed recursive/corecursive definitions. The resulting theory, implemented in the Coq proof assistant, is quite simple and hence it. can be used broadly with a small, sustainable overhead on the user.

AB For grizzly bears (Ursus arctos horribilis) in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem (GYE), minimum population size and allowable numbers of human-caused mortalities have been calculated as a function of the number of unique females with cubs-of-the-year (F-CUB) seen during a 3-year period. This approach underestimates the total number of F-CUB, thereby biasing estimates of population size and sustainable mortality. Also, it does not permit calculation of valid confidence bounds. Many statistical methods can resolve or mitigate these problems, but there is no universal best method. Instead, relative performances of different methods can vary with population size, sample size, and degree of heterogeneity among sighting probabilities. for individual animals. We compared 7 nonparametric estimators, using Monte Carlo techniques to assess performances over the range of sampling conditions deemed plausible for the Yellowstone population. Our goal was to estimate the number of F-CUB present in the population each year. Our evaluation differed from previous comparisons of such estimators by including sample coverage methods and by treating individual sightings, rather than sample periods, as the sample unit. Consequently, our conclusions also differ from earlier studies. Recommendations regarding estimators and necessary sample sizes are presented, together with estimates of annual numbers of F-CUB in the Yellowstone population with bootstrap confidence bounds.

AB Managers of harvested polar bear (Ursus maritimus) populations are required todetermine current status and sustainable harvest levels. Time series population estimates are unavailable or suspect for most polar bear populations, including the Viscount Melville Sound (VM) population in Canada. Between 1974 and 1992, 194 polar bears were captured within VM. We used mark-recapture and standing age analyses to estimate population size and the rates of birth and death for this population. Both the current and historical harvest were also recorded. From mark-recapture data, we estimated (1) age and sex-specific natural andtotal survival and (2) population size from estimated capture probabilities that varied by year and were higher for females with satellite transmitters. The average population estimate for 1989-92 was 161 bears (SE = 34). We used a simulation model to estimate the population growth rate without harvest at 1.059 (SE = 0.063). Historical harvest levels and changes in the population standing sex and age distribution and sex ratio indicated that the population had been reduced by over-hunting. Using Monte Carlo simulations that utilized the estimated variability in demographic parameters, we explored the risk to this population associated with a range of harvest rates. Because of uncertainty in our estimates, we found that the population was at risk at harvest levels less than the estimated sustainable kill. The estimated risk was proportional to harvest level. Large harvest rates increased the risk of further reductions to the population and extended the recovery period that would likely be required to return the population to its current number relative to lesser harvest rates. We question the value of frequent population inventory for Viscount MelvilleSound because the small size of this population constrains both the precisionand the accuracy of demographic estimates. We recommend instead conservative and precautionary harvest policies to reduce the risk of harvest and enhance long term recovery of this population.

   uncertainty
AB Despite our rapidly increasing knowledge of bears, there are few places in theworld where we really know how bear populations are faring. I argue that bearconservation would benefit by highlighting rather than hiding this uncertainty. Assessments of bear populations often are based on records of dead animals and trends in habitat availability. These data produce dubious indications of population trend. Case studies relating to the trade in bear parts, sport harvests, and nuisance His indicate that records of human-killed bears may not be accurate and may not necessarily reflect changes in population size. Increasing bear populations may continue to rise with increased levels of human exploitation (as long as it is below the maximum sustainable take), whereas decliningpopulations may continue to plummet despite reduced exploitation. Similarly, whereas loss of habitat (forest area) probably engenders a decline (of unknownmagnitude) in bear populations, unchanging or increasing forested area may not necessarily result in stable or increasing bear numbers. Ironically, bear populations that have been managed for sustained harvests have generally fared better than populations in which hunting has been prohibited, mainly because the former better controls illicit hunting than the latter. Longterm conservation of bears requires better information on population trends, but better techniques are unlikely to be developed if faults and inadequacies of current data are not clearly recognized.

TI Technology to produce partial acidulated phosphate rock (PAPR)
SO VISION TECNOLOGICA
LA Spanish
DT Article
AB With a potential internal market of 150,000 t/year of the fertilizer "partial acidulated phosphate rock (PAPR)", the project of design and construction of a PAPR plant in the Moron Complex, Northern Venezuela, was initiated in 1995, only using national indigenous phosphate resources with the following properties: phosphate rock of 27% P205, and a mix of phosphoric acid with 26% P205, and sulfuric acid at 98% concentration, to obtain a product 0-25-0 with 12.5% of the P205 water soluble. Using a pilot plant at Intevep in 1996, the feasibility of producing PAPR via one-step acidulation/granulation process was confirmed, based on a proposed production process in the International Fertilizer Development Center's (IFDC) facilities in Alabama, USA. In November 1998, the PAPR plant initiated operation using following products: 0-25-0; 0-28-0; 0-30-0, with an acidulation between 40 and 60%. The PAPR chemical properties were evaluated in incubation and solubility tests in soils with different pH. Agronomic properties were evaluated in several crops, and they showed that PAPR can be used in permanent crops (pastures, fruits), as well as in annual crops with high demand of phosphorus (corn, rice, sorghum). The hardness and slow disintegration of PAPR favors the homogeneity of P205 dissolution in the soil, and therefore, it could be considered as a slow release fertilizer with high agronomic and ecological benefits, which are premises for sustainable agriculture.

AB With respect to sustainable development, the leachability of trace metal from solid materials in contact with water has focused much attention over the years. Portland cements produced in industrial kilns generally contain from 10 to 300 mg/kg of trace metals. The behaviour of these endogenous metals has been, in this regard, the target of different leaching studies. Many of these researches concluded that heavy metals release are lower than analytical detection limits. Although satisfying from an environmental point of view, it induces a lack in the knowledge about the trace metals behavior during the leaching of cement based material. Accordingly, we designed the CTG-LEACHCRETE device, a dynamic leaching system (modified Soxhlet type) that overcomes this difficulty and allows long term monitoring. The experimental procedure is presented and preliminary results are discussed. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Most spoils in the Lusatian lignite district have been afforested successfully. However, since soil chemical status remains very different compared to unmined locations even after decades it is still unclear if forest ecosystems develop to a self-sustainable status or if restoration will fail in the long term. To clarify this question water and element fluxes of different-aged red oak (Q. rubra L.) stands on both Quaternary pure sands and Tertiary, pyritic loamy sands were investigated and compared to a nearby, unmined location. Due to increasing interception and evapotranspiration, the deep percolation rates of red oak forests decline drastically within 30 yr. Annual groundwater recharge is about 300 mm yr(-1) (41-46% of precipitation) initially. Deep percolation of the older stands decrease to less than 15% of precipitation, independent of substrate type. Tertiary substrates are characterized by intensive leaching of H, Fe, Al, Mg, Ca, NH4-N and SO4-S due to pyrite oxidation and therefore enhanced silicate weathering. Despite of drastically declining output rates with progressing ecosystem development, they remain remarkably higher as compared to Quaternary sands. However, despite differences in soil chemistry, the aged stands act as an almost complete sink for N, P and K. Compared to adjacent oak forests on undisturbed soils the stands on reclamation sites show very similar patterns with regard to N, P, K, Ca and Mg turnover.

AB The palm oil industry is one of the major agro-industries in Southern Thailand. It requires a large amount of water for its operation and discharges considerable quantities of wastewater. This creates a serious threat to the environment and sources of potable water. This study proposes recommendations for water conservation and reuse and improvement of wastewater treatment facilities to overcome these problems.
   In order to attain the highest reduction of all problems, waste minimization is introduced as the most effective solution. Changing behaviour in housekeeping can reduce water usage. An upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) process coupled with an activated sludge plant is recommended to upgrade the wastewater treatment system. For water reuse purposes, a rock bed filtration unit is recommended to treat effluent of the treatment plant.
   The overall water balance of the palm oil mill suggests that water reuse of 322 m(3)/d will reduce raw water consumption by 27.66% and achieve a 23% reduction in the water discharged to the river.

AB The world population is expected to increase up to 8 billion by 2015. Most of the cities in the world are scattered around the fresh water resources. These cities and villages have their own interests and they constitute a power order. Therefore, we have been trying to harmonize these cities and villages in the usage of fresh water resources and the discharging of wastewater as well, by using an engineering means of water treatment. However, fresh water resources, which are essential to our lives, have a constant amount of circulation with a period of one week to ten days.
   The science and technology of the water environment should recognize the limit of fresh water resources for the sustainable development of society, because the water service industries are the essential infrastructure of the community. In order to implement an appropriate risk management it is necessary to identify the goal of environmental management considering the social, natural and economical conditions. The energy-dependent technologies should be reconsidered to consume-less energy and undertake more resource conservation engineering. Water science and technology cannot supply all the answers, therefore more comprehensive water management systems should be developed by other sectors, such as the food production industry.

AB An international survey of urban stormwater management (SWM) practice was conducted for IWA and produced contributions from 18 countries. The survey information was further expanded by a review of recent literature and summarised in this international report on SWM. The main findings of the survey include clear indications of a widespread interest in stormwater management and of the acceptance of a holistic approach to SWM promoting sustainable urban drainage systems,(SUDS). Specific implications of this philosophy include emphasis on source controls in SWM, transition from traditional "hard" infrastructures (drain pipes) to green infrastructures, needs for infrastructure maintenance and rehabilitation, formation of stormwater agencies (within larger integrated water agencies) with participation of both public and private sectors, and sustainable funding through drainage fees rather than general taxes. Further progress in this field requires targeted research and development, knowledge sharing, and above all, a high level of public participation in planning, implementing and operating stormwater management systems.

AB Sewer system design must be integrated with wastewater treatment plant design when moving towards a more sustainable urban wastewater management. This integration allows an optimization of the design of both systems to achieve a better and more cost-effective wastewater management. Hitherto integrated process design has not been an option because the tools to predict in-sewer wastewater transformations have been inadequate. In this study the WATS model - being a new and validated tool for in-sewer microbial process simulations - is presented and its application for integrated sewer and treatment plant design is exemplified. A case study on a Malaysian catchment illustrates this integration. The effects of centralization of wastewater treatment and the subsequently longer transport distances are addressed. The layout of the intercepting sewer is optimized to meet the requirements of different treatment scenarios.

DE conflicts between agriculture; drinking-water supply and ecology;
   re-organisation of land use in water-protection zones
AB One of the tasks of sustainable water-quality and resources management must be to resolve conflicts between its demands and those of agriculture and ecology. In most industrial countries, there are conflicts between the different requirements of water supply, i.e. water quality, and those of agriculture and the conservation of wetlands, i.e. water quantity. Solving these conflicts means a reorganisation of land use. A non-governmental committee has initiated a voluntary compromise program for the water-protection zone of the Donauried. On the basis of criteria assessing the significance of areas of land, a plan for the reorganisation of land use has been developed. Moreover, an action plan has been prepared; it includes steps for reducing nitrate, a program for reducing land-use intensity, a concept for re-wetting bog areas and an investigation into measures for optimising local water resources using a numerical groundwater model. This was accompanied by an economic evaluation of the measures.

AB Global concerns over the sustainable use of natural resources provided the impetus for research into water reclamation from wastewater within the Singapore context. The objective of the research is to study and develop a water infrastructure system as an integral element of architecture and the urbanscape, thereby reducing the need for the large area requirements associated with centralised treatment plants. The decentralised plants were considered so as to break up the large contiguous plot of land otherwise needed, into smaller integrated fragments, which can be incorporated within the housing scheme. This liberated more usable space on the ground plane of the urban housing master plan, enabling water-edge and waterscape relationships within both the private and public domains of varying scale.

AB In a sustainable development context, the storm water reuse in industry seems a promising and original alternative, but few experiences exist. A project, sponsored by the European Community and the Artois-Picardie Water Agency, has been carried out by the Renault MCA factory in Maubeuge, demonstrating that it can be profitable, in certain conditions, to reuse storm water in industrial processes. This article summarises this experience, and presents a decision making tool (SIRRUS) that has been developed in this framework by Anjou Recherche (Vivendi Water) to evaluate, on the basis of simple criteria, if this experience is or is not reproducible on a given site, and how much time is necessary to pay the investment back. Its application and different results are also discussed.

AB The concept of waste minimisation clubs was developed in the early 1990s to promote the exchange of experiences between geographically close manufacturers in the implementation of waste minimisation measures. It is a successful approach, resulting not only in a reduction in environmental impact, but also significant financial savings for the companies involved. Two pilot waste minimisation clubs were established in the province of kwaZulu Natal in South Africa in 1998 and 1999, to determine if this approach was a feasible method of promoting sustainable industrial development in South Africa. On conclusion of this project in December 2000, the 20 companies that participated in these clubs had saved a total of US$ 1.7 million, and reduced their water use and effluent discharge by over 2,400 MI/y.

   shared management
AB Lake Constance is the second largest prealpine European lake. Its international catchment area lies in the territories of the four European countries Austria, Germany, Liechtenstein and Switzerland. Since the fifties, a significant degradation of its state was observed as a result of the pollutants of more than 1.2 million inhabitants in its catchment area. To counteract this negative development, international cooperation was realized in the International Commission for the Protection of Lake Constance (IGKB). Thereby the phosphorus concentration in the lake water, after a maximum value of 87 mg/m(3) phosphorus in 1979, was reduced to 13 mg/m(3) until 2001. To prevent the negative effects of unfavourable climatic conditions resulting in an incomplete vertical circulation, the concentration of phosphorus must be reduced to 10 mg/m(3).
   Crucial points in future are to sustain the present successes in lake protection, to reduce existing loads as much as possible, to compensate for loads which are not avoidable and to avoid future loads. A sustainable use of the lake is ensured only by an intact lake ecosystem.

AB In this paper, two fundamentally different urban wastewater systems are assessed from an environmental impact perspective. One system represents a centralised, high-tech, end-of-pipe structure c whereas the second system is primarily based on source-separation strategies. Using material flow analysis a in combination with evaluation methods based on life-cycle assessment the systems are evaluated by means of simulation and the results are discussed. A set of priority indicators for environmental assessments of urban water systems is suggested and applied in the analysis. Energy issues are also commented upon. The main intent of the paper is to present the principles of this type of assessment rather than detailed numbers for all possible environmental effects and hazardous substances emitted to air, water and soil. It represents one of several building blocks for a future multi-criteria decision-support system to evaluate urban water management from a sustainability perspective.

AB The effects of urbanization on the aquatic environment, and solutions to the deterioration of water quality and stream ecology in the Love River have long been the main focus of environmental management in southern Taiwan. Apart from choosing the regular strategies of installing an intercept and sewer system, coastal wastewater treatment plant, and ocean outfall pipe, a new opportunity for improving the overall managerial efficiency is to design and implement a web-based Decision Support System (DSS). This DSS must be capable of managing storm water impacts when overflow is inevitable, river water quality variations leading to influences on the ecosystem, and changing land use programs along river corridors and adjacent urban areas simultaneously. This paper presents a new design framework for building such a DSS. By using the advanced information technology in the "Internet" environment, the proposed DSS may perform normal queries and statistical analyses in a web-enabled database, spatial analysis via the use of a Geographic Information System (GIS) in the Internet environment, and essential data warehousing/data mining. Possible linkage with various analytical models is anticipated. Such a DSS must be helpful for achieving the rehabilitation of the estuarine ecosystem and satisfying the goals for sustainable management in a regional sense.

AB A study was carried out to assess the water quality situation of groundwater sources in Kathmandu Valley, Nepal. Groundwater has remained to be a major water supply source for a population of 1.5 million at present in the valley. The focus of this study was to evaluate the extent and sources of groundwater contamination. Water sampling was carried out in selected deep wells and shallow sources. The level of pollution was evaluated by comparing the water quality results with WHO guidelines. The major problems with the dug wells, hand pumps and spouts were found to be the elevated nitrate and mercury contents. The deep wells located on the central aquifer were found to have a serious threat of ammonia pollution. Deep wells were also found to have iron, manganese and mercury concentrations exceeding the guideline values. Multivariate statistical analysis was carried out to cluster the sampling sources and identify the common factors describing the potential sources and possible mechanisms associated with the contaminants. The results suggested that disintegration of the sediment organic matter under strong reducing environment leads to the origin of the unusual water qualities at the central confined aquifer. This process may be microbially mediated and occurs with the simultaneous reduction of species such as arsenic, iron, manganese and sulfate. Both natural and anthropogenic water quality problems were observed in the groundwater system of Kathmandu valley. Attention should be focused to consider distinct strategies to address these problems.

AB A strategy for sustainable stormwater management is needed. This study has focused on the relative importance of stormwater as a pollutant source in a catchbasin, if Best Management Practices (BMPs) result in pollutant removal or pollutant redistribution, and methods for screening of stormwater strategies. Stormwater is most likely an important pathway for pollutants in a catchbasin perspective. True pollutant removal can only be achieved if the pollutant sources are eliminated. Until that is reached, we should have the best possible control of the pollutant fluxes in the watershed. This study indicates that the search for a sustainable stormwater strategy could be easier to handle if different "screens" could be used. The Swedish environmental objectives, which try to encapsulate all aspects of sustainability, may be used as a foundation for a "sustainability screen". By using this screen, the "unsustainable" features of different stormwater strategies could be pointed out. A "standards and legislation screen" will be based on the EU Water Framework Directive. As this study has shown, it is doubtful whether the conventional BMPs, such as stormwater ponds and infiltration facilities, produce a sufficient pollutant control.

AB Copper washed off from roofs and roads is considered to be a major contribution to diffuse copper pollution of urban environments. In order to guarantee sustainable protection of soils and water, the long-term strategy is to avoid or replace copper containing materials on roofs and facades. Until achievement of this goal, a special adsorber system is suggested to control the diffuse copper fluxes by. retention of copper by a mixture of granulated iron-hydroxide (GEH) and calcium carbonate. Since future stormwater runoff concepts are based on decentralised runoff infiltration into the underground, solutions are proposed which provide for copper retention in infiltration sites using GEH adsorption layers. The example of a large copper facade of which the runoff is treated in an adsorption trench reveals the first full-scale data on facade runoff and adsorber performance. During the first year of investigation average facade runoff concentrations in the range of 1-10 mg Cu/l are reduced by 96-99% in the adsorption ditch.

DE drinking water; infrastructures; innovative strategies; treatment

AB Viable strategies for ensuring adequate supplies of potable water are essential to long-term societal sustainability. The steadily increasing necessity for multiple reuse of water in urban societies is even now taxing our technical and financial abilities to meet ongoing needs for water suitable for human consumption. As a consequence, the current practice of treating the entire water demands of urban communities to the increasingly stringent standards required for drinking water is becoming an unsustainable practice, and thus a questionable strategy for planning and development of urban water systems. An innovative technology-based concept for implementation of a more sustainable strategy and practice for potable water is developed here. The concept is predicated on the inherent advantages of flexibility and responsiveness associated with decentralization of complex functions and operations. Specifically, it calls for strategic dispersal of flexible advanced treatment and control technologies throughout urban water transport and storage networks. This is in direct contradistinction to current strategies and practices of centralized and inflexible monolithic facilities. By integrating use-related satellite systems with critical components of existing systems and infrastructures, the concept can enable and facilitate optimal cost-effective applications of highly sophisticated advanced treatment and on-line monitoring and control technologies to in-place infrastructures in a holistic and sustainable manner.

AB Harare, the capital city of Zimbabwe, is experiencing eutrophication-related problems in its downstream potable water supply source of Lake Chivero. This is due mainly to poorly treated sewage effluent encroachment into upstream rivers, especially Marimba River. Crowborough Pasture Irrigation farm is-in the Marimba sub-catchment area and has 305 hectares of irrigated pastures. Studies started from July 2000 to August 2001 focusing on the pasture's management of nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus) and their impact on Marimba River. Water and nutrient balances were developed. Reduction efficiencies for this pasture were found to be 84% for TN and 54% for TP. Both the Crowborough sewage treatment works and the pastures are overloaded. It was therefore concluded that the current system is no longer sustainable economically and environmentally. From the results of our study we recommend that additional treatment units be constructed at Crowborough sewage treatment works to meet current flows. Moreover, pasture management needs substantial improvement. Nutrient recovery should be enhanced by regular harvesting of pasture grass and converting cow dung into an economic commodity as manure for neighbouring residents. Maize cultivation is also recommended to replace pasture grass as it is a local staple crop and has high nutrient uptake rates.

AB For many reasons it is advantageous to collect urine separately and collection systems, so called "no-mix-toilets" exist. Therefore, this work deals with some methods to make use of this urine to produce value added products: IBDU and ammonia water. It could be shown that urea can be converted to IBDU only after concentrating urine. With air stripping and absorption ammonificated urine can be treated very effectively and a solution of 10% w/w of ammonia can be obtained.

DE community participation; water services for underprivileged communities
AB Due to problems such as migration from rural areas to cities and to the difficulties generated by those displaced by violence, the water utility companies in developing counties are faced with the challenge of supplying this service to communities that have settled in an irregular and disorganized manner. The challenge public utility services face is solving the problem without letting such circumstances impinge on the financial feasibility of the company. In order to achieve this, it is essential to design programs with a prominent degree of community participation and self-management, which may even change this social problem into a commercial opportunity. This paper portrays EEPPM's experience in four successful programs within this field, illustrating their benefits as regards sustainability and replication.

AB The article presents two aspects of sludge management: regional planning and product recovery. The introduction of these two elements can reduce the cost, close the ecocycle and make the management more sustainable. A spreadsheet program to optimize the regional location of different facilities is presented. The simple example shows the potential of the model. The brief comparison of formal problems concerning sludge disposal in Poland and Sweden is also discussed. Requirements of phosphorus recovery and recycling of phosphorus to the phosphate industry make sludge fractionation in combination with product recovery a new development in wastewater handling. Phosphorus recovery from sludges with chemical bound phosphorus requires complex and expensive process technology and may therefore lead to increased regional sludge management with a central sludge treatment plant.

AB In order to attain a sound and sustainable water environment, it is important to carry out the environmental management of the watershed., For this purpose,,knowledge on the pollutant runoff mechanism from non-point sources becomes very important especially under rainy conditions. At Isahaya, Nagasaki, Japan, a big project of construction of sea-dyke and reclamation is now going on, so reducing the pollutant runoff, especially from non-point sources, becomes more important. Some runoff models of rainwater are developed to predict the rate of pollutant loads from the non-point sources, and their results are compared with each other to investigate the accuracy of prediction. In this paper, runoff analysis of both rainwater and pollutants has been carried out using three models:,the tank model, the kinematic wave (K-W) model, and a model using the digital elevation model (DEM). For precise estimation, it becomes necessary to identify the parameters included in these models. Here, total nitrogen has been considered as pollutants, and detachment rates are evaluated, correlated with a class of land use, soil type, and moisture content. Finally, it has been shown the pollutant runoff from non-point sources can be predicted fairly well, identifying the model parameter appropriately.

Tools for imegrated analysis have been developed, but there is less implementation than could be expected. That is duel to lack of adequate knowledge about important mechanisms, coupled with a significant conservatism in the business. However, significant integrated analyses have been reported. Most of them deal with the sewer system and the treatment plant, while few incorporate the receiving water as anything but the object cif the loads to be minimised by engineering measures up-stream. Important measures are local infiltration, source control, storage basins, local treatment and real time control. New paradigms have been introduced: risk of pollution due to system failure, technology for water reuse, sustainability, new architecture and greener up-stream solutions as opposed to down-stream concrete solutions. The challenge is to combine the inherited approaches with the new approaches by flexibility and adaptability.

AB Designing industrial discharge standards should reflect the numerical compromise between what can be achieved to prevent environmental pollution and sustainable development. They should involve categorical limitations for specific sources. Micropollutants represent the major concern for industrial effluents. A micropollutant-based subcategorization is needed for an effective control of industrial effluents. Regulations imposed require a comprehensive knowledge of polluting processes and sources, and technological limits of available treatment technologies.

   water productivity
AB The world is moving into a period of widespread water stress and competition, with enormous implications for food security, the health of the aquatic environment, and social and political stability. In the second half of the 20th Century water demand more than tripled, the major factor being irrigation for food production. Over the same period, the number of large dams worldwide climbed from 5,000 to 45,000 bringing about a major alteration of river hydrology and ecosystem function. Rivers have been disconnected from portions of their channels, their floodplains, their deltas, and from the seas into which they empty. The resulting loss of aquatic habitat has put freshwater life in grave jeopardy. In the 21st Century it will be possible to satisfy the needs of 8-9 billion people while protecting the health of aquatic ecosystems, but only with a fundamental shift in the way society uses, manages and values freshwater. It will likely require a doubling of water productivity over the next 25 years - including more efficient irrigation practices and greater recycling of wastewater. To guide policy, nations need to systematically determine their freshwater ecosystem flow requirements in a way that perhaps only South Africa is attempting so far. Underpinning all these measures is the need for a guiding water ethic that states that enough water should be provided for all living things before some get more than enough.

AB This paper explores some of the factors that may contribute to the sustainable use of water on irrigated dairy farms in Victoria, Australia. The paper begins with a discussion of the principles of sustainable water use as they would apply to dairy farms in the Gippsland region of Victoria. A series of indicators are used to link aspects of sustainable water use at a regional scale, and the observable trends are discussed. Of particular interest is the way that local river systems contribute to the dairy industry in this region and the aspects of dairying and other significant regional factors that may be impacting on the sustainability of river systems in this area. The indicators are structured and analysed using the Pressure-State-Response (PSR) framework developed by the OECD, most commonly used in State of the Environment reporting. The trends highlighted by the indicator set are discussed in terms of the implications that current patterns of water use may have for possible shifts towards more sustainable water use on individual dairy farms in Gippsland. Keywords Dairy industry; environmental indicators; Pressure-State-Response Framework; sustainable water-use.

ID MANURE
AB Recently, the size of livestock farms in Japan has been expanding and the pollution from farm wastes has become a serious problem in rural areas, Therefore it is necessary to design treatment strategies and improve the recycling of livestock manure for sustainability of agriculture in Japan. The dairy cattle waste management systems were studied at dairy farms in Aomori prefecture and in Hokkaido, Japan. The four farms, typical for the respective regions in Japan, were investigated on the basis of the land and livestock size, housing, overall farm and waste management, type of machinery and a farm labour force. A statistical comparison was made for housing, milking and waste handling systems of dairy farms. One of the waste handling strategies was aerobic slurry treatment and land irrigation of the treated liquid fraction. Such methods began to solve some of waste management problems created since 1967 in grassland farming areas of Hokkaido. The irrigation system supplies water fertiliser and organic material to land as well as shortening the spreading times. It recycles livestock resources, increases the soil fertility and rationalises the farm management.

AB Water - the Elixir of Life - has the potential to sustain human life and also to develop it further, and that is why various international instruments have aptly recognized its role in sustainable development. This paper reviews the global and Indian water scenario before presenting the case of Gujarat State, where perennial water scarcity has raised serious threats to the existence of millions of people and cattle and has led to environmental degradation and constrained economic development. More than 13,000 villages out of 18,028 villages of the State are facing scarcity in terms of crop failure this year. Drinking water supply is maintained by transporting water by road tankers, "water special" trains and even by ships via a sea route. Lack of access to safe and clean water for domestic use has a detrimental effect on the social fabric, and even incidences of migration and water riots are recorded. The paper discusses the efficacy of available options including rain water harvesting. The efforts of the State to harness the untapped waters of Narmada for the survival of millions and sustainable development of western India, are discussed adjudging socioeconomic and environmental impacts. The paper concludes that assured water supply is essentially critical for overall development.

DE Australia; beneficiary pays; cost-sharing; healthy rivers
AB Concerted efforts are being made at state and federal levels to restore Australia's rivers and waterways to a healthy condition. Yet, there is little consensus on what constitutes a "healthy river" and even less on how to achieve this, or how far to go towards restoration. Some advocate removal of storages and weirs along rivers to revert to some natural state. Others, particularly water users, question the trade-offs involved in leaving more water in the rivers and how the costs of restoration are to be met. At present it seems that the major share of the costs is borne by irrigators, with the wider community essentially enjoying a "free-ride". This situation is justified on the basis of the impactor pays principle whereby water diversions, primarily for irrigation, are held to have contributed most to degradation of the river systems. The alternative beneficiary pays principle - is of more relevance where demands are made on resource users to mitigate environmental impacts or bring about environmental improvements, eg. healthy rivers, where the beneficiaries are the wider public and the general community. Many resource users are voluntarily undertaking action on private land to conserve biodiversity and achieve sustainability. In these circumstances, the cost-sharing principle should apply, with governments, interest groups and the community contributing to the investment required to attain the desired resource condition objectives.

AB Community-based watershed management (CBWM) has gained prominence in developing world towards integrated resource management for livelihood enhancement of the poor, due to failure of large-scale river valley projects. This paradigm shift has enabled to narrow the divide between the state and community, and marks a beginning for the State towards a "learning organisation" that is adaptive to the changing social and environmental condition. The paper examines the role of State in institutionalising CBWM in three Indian states. It calls for the State to create an enabling institutional environment for coordination among institutions to emerge by devolving adequate responsibilities. This would offer opportunities for institutions to negotiate their concerns and build credibility for a long lasting institutional solution towards integrating resource management.

ID MEMBRANE FILTRATION; PERFORMANCE
AB The sustainability of wastewater reclamation and reuse schemes is often limited by the increase in salt concentration that occurs with each water use. In this pilot study, we show that the cost of reclaiming wastewater and removing salt can be dramatically decreased by integrating recent advances in wastewater pond design, solids separation equipment, and membrane technology. Effluent from an AIWPS((R)) Facility was clarified in a Krofta((R)) Supracell(TM) Dissolved Air Flotation (DAF) unit and a Slow Sand Filter (SSF) prior to final treatment in an Expertise S.r.l. reverse osmosis (RO) unit. The ponds of the AIWPS((R)) Facility removed an average of 82% of soluble BOD and 80% of soluble nitrogen. Following clarification, filtration, and RO treatment, the pollutant removals were > 99% for soluble BOD, > 99% for soluble nitrogen, and 98% for TDS. Based on membrane fouling rate data, the cleaning interval for the RO membranes in a full-scale AIWPS((R))-RO Facility would be over 100 days. This interval is on par with that typically seen in full-scale reclamation facilities treating secondary activated sludge effluent with microfiltration prior to reverse osmosis. A 4-MLD AIWPS((R))-RO Facility is expected to produce permeate water at substantially lower cost and lower energy consumption (US $698 and 443 kWh per million liters treated) than a system of equal capacity using conventional activated sludge secondary treatment followed by microfiltration and reverse osmosis (US $1274 and 911 kWh per million litres treated). This cost and energy differential is attributable to the lower capital and operating expenses of the AIWPS((R)) Technology in comparison with activated sludge.

AB Ongoing deterioration of the riverine environments of the Murray-Darling Basin led the Murray-Darling Basin Ministerial Council to introduce a Cap in 1995 to halt the growth in diversions of water for consumptive use. This initiative recognised the finite nature of water resources in the Basin and sought to introduce a balance between off-stream use of water and protection of the riverine environment. But the cap is only one step, albeit a fundamental one, in restoring the Basin's rivers - it, is a "stake in the ground". Parties to the Murray-Darling Basin Initiative recognise the need to reverse decades of creeping decline if the Basin's,rivers and riverine environments are to return to a more ecologically sustainable condition. In the last 12 months, Council and Commission have taken far-reaching decisions designed to restore the Basin's Rivers. Many of these decisions, even 10 years ago, would have been unimaginable. The Report Card will explain the need for a number of recent decisions that will impact on the future of the. Basin's rivers. For example, Council's decision to establish an Environmental Manager function in the Office of the Commission was made in the context of the recently agreed Integrated Catchment Management (ICM) Policy, and supporting Sustainable Rivers Audit. The role of targets and accountabilities under the ICM Policy v ill also be discussed. The Report Card will also present a snapshot of the state of the Basin's rivers and the actions being taken at a range of scales and locations in response to identified problems. Because some of the key initiatives are still in development, this Report Card will set the scene by describing where our attention is being focused and why.

AB Water is a key resource in attaining sustainability - in social and economic development as well as in the long-term carrying capacity of the planet's life support systems, but consensus on the meaning and priority of these terms is still needed. Amongst the key points identified for water professionals: it is necessary to challenge compartmentalisation in water policy and management; water management strategies must focus clearly on the interdependence of the environment and socio-economic development; water professionals have a key role but must package the information and insight they can provide in a way that is attractive to intended recipients such as policy makers.

AB Representative reserves (protected areas) are an accepted component of terrestrial and marine biodiversity conservation programs. Additionally, representative reserves have important values in protecting ecosystems of special importance, and in providing ecologically based benchmarks useful in assessing the. sustainability of management programs. However, in spite of international and national commitments, Australian State governments have been slow to establish systems of representative reserves in freshwater environments.
   A central recommendation involves the establishment of agreed national methods for the classification of, freshwater ecosystems into ("representative") categories which can e incorporated into a comprehensive national inventory. A second key recommendation involves the development of a national approach to identifying gaps in the existing reserve system relating specifically to freshwater ecosystems.

AB The wastewater management system of the Emscher region is currently being radically restructured. The receiving waters currently surviving as open sewers are to be freed of their wastewater burden and reconstituted to a state as natural as possible, while the wastewater is to be routed underground to the treatment plants, Great importance is attached to the most natural possible rainwater management, in order to buffer extreme run-off situations in the watercourses and to minimize the costs for residential-area water management engineering, Rethinking, which in many cases percolates through only slowly, is necessary in many respects for this purpose, A contest has been set up in the Emscher catchment area in order to accelerate this in the existing residential areas. Seepage, decentralized retention, disconnection and discharge into bodies of water and watercourses have been financially supported. The results are presented and the further procedure deriving from them discussed.

This article considers them in the light of the report of the World Commission on Dams and using the example of Turkey. It is argued that economic development and population growth, particularly in arid and semi-arid regions, make plain the need for dams for hydropower and irrigation, Environmental impact assessment is essential, as are effective programmes for resettlement to avoid the impoverishment of displaced people.

AB Inflow/infiltration (1/1) and infiltration/exfiltration (I/E) are interactive processes which dynamically affect sewer and groundwater performance. The incidence and condition of "critical" sewers in the UK are identified together with chemical and bacterial methods of quantifying I/E and its potential impact on sewer performance and on urban groundwater pollution. Whilst the impacts of I/E do not appear to be substantial on the basis of existing evidence, some caution is advocated in respect of long term sewer sustainability.

DE diffuse pollution; eutrophication; macrophytes; Mogan Lake; sediment
   dredging; water quality
AB Mogan Lake is an important recreational area for Metropolitan Ankara-Turkey. It is a shallow eutrophic lake with a dense growth of macrophytes. The main contributors of nutrients and other pollutants to the lake are the creeks carrying the runoff water from the watershed and upland farming land, in addition to the domestic and industrial wastewater discharges from a nearby town and industries. Hydrodynamic and water quality modeling techniques were used to determine the optimum management schemes for the lake restoration and diffuse pollution control. Management scenarios were devised and tested to control allochthonous and autochthonous nutrient inputs to the lake. Phosphorus and nitrogen load reductions were the main test elements for the control of allochthonous nutrient inputs. The scenario analysis revealed that reduction of phosphorus and nitrogen loads from diffused sources will have a marginal effect on controlling eutrophication if macrophyte growth is left uncontrolled. Scenarios employing macrophyte harvesting and sediment dredging have been evaluated for autochthonous nutrient input control. Sediment dredging alone has been shown to yield the most favorable conditions for water quality improvement in Mogan Lake. Further, control of diffuse pollution was an essential final step to achieve an acceptable long-term sustainable water quality improvement in the lake.

AB The RiverReach program has provided significant material, planning and educational resources to communities throughout the OMDB over the last three years. The devolved granting process has proven to be a valuable mechanism for the initiation of on-ground works and as a platform for the delivery of educational and awareness raising activities. The range of riverine management projects developed among riparian communities reflects both the socio-economic and the environmental circumstances. An increasing knowledge of riverine management issues among both the community and practitioners and a growing acceptance of the need for riverine management within the community has increased opportunities for sustainable riverine management in the region. While the range of riverine management. issues is diverse, and their integration complex, the combination of all three aspects (financial assistance, technical advice, and awareness raising) has enabled significant management outcomes to be achieved.

AB The formal allocation of water for the environment is a developing area of river management both scientifically and in terms of community participation. This case study, illustrating the recent use of the Barmah-Millewa Forest Environmental Water Allocation (EWA) provides a practical demonstration of community participation in environmental water management, the application of hydrological and biological "triggers" and a positive, demonstrable biological outcome from an environmental water allocation. The Barmah-Millewa. Forest covers an area of 70,000 ha across the floodplain of the Murray River, upstream of the town of Echuca. About half the forest is in NSW (Millewa) and half is in Victoria (Barmah). The Barmah Forest is a Wetland of International Importance listed under the Convention on Wetlands-Ramsar Convention. The forest is the largest river redgum forest in the world. The natural flooding cycle associated with the forest has been significantly altered by regulation of the Murray River - impacting upon the overall health of the forest ecosystem. Recognising this, the Murray Darling Basin Commission developed a water management strategy for the forest to enhance forest, fish and wildlife values. To implement this strategy, between 1990 and 1993 reports were completed and community consultation took place. In 1993 the Murray Darling Basin Ministerial Council approved allocation of 100 Gigalitres of water per year, provided in equal shares by NSW and Victoria, to meet the needs of the forest ecosystem and in 1994 the Barmah-Millewa Forum was established under the Murray-Darling Basin Agreement; The vision for the Forum is to maintain and,,where possible, improve the ecological and productive sustainability of the Barmah-Millewa. Forest and to establish a planning and operational framework to better meet the flooding and drying requirements of the riparian forests and wetlands. Between October 2000 and January 2001 the Barmah-Millewa Forest Environmental Water Allocation was used for the second time. A total of 341 GL was released as an EWA. This amount represented only 8% of the total flows downstream of Yarrawonga Weir from September 2000 and January 2001. The strategic use of the relatively small amount of water enabled flooding to be maintained and ensured significant breeding success for water birds and other biota in the Forest.

AB Ecological sanitation seems often to be taken to mean no more than an alternative toilet, whereas it should be understood more broadly as embodying a closed-loop approach to the management of human excreta. In the next 25 years the urban population of Africa and Asia is expected to double. By facilitating the revival of urban agriculture and avoiding the adverse environmental impacts of conventional treatment strategies, ecological sanitation can play a major role in providing food security and public health in a sustainable future.

DE environmental flows; irrigation; Murrumbidgee River; water management
AB The major platform of the Council of Australian Governments (COAG) water reform program is the equitable and sustainable sharing of surface and groundwater resources between the ervironment and consumptive water users. in the regulated I section of. the Murrumbidgee River below Burrinjuck Dam, approximately 2,800 GL of the available surface water (4,300 GL) is diverted or extracted for irrigation uses in the Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area and Districts, and in the Coleambally Irrigation Area.
   Environmental flow rules have been developed for the Murrumbidgee which provide for an allocation of water to the environment but on the basis of no more than a 10% impact on farm-gate income of irrigation farmers. This provision limits the volume of water that can be used for environmental purposes, so the most effective use must be made of it.
   To identify and quantify the benefits to the environment of this limited additional volume of water and to determine the most effective use of the water, an "environmental spreadsheet matrix" has been developed: This paper outlines the development and use of the matrix in the planned implementation of flow regimes appropriate to the protection and enhancement of riparian and aquatic ecosystems and ecological processes.

CY AUG 29-31, 2001
CL BRISBANE, AUSTRALIA
DE environmental flows; flow management; Murray River; water quality
   objectives
AB Over the past decade, there intense consideration of managing flows in the River Murray to provide environmental benefits. In 1990 the Murray-Darling Basin Ministerial Council adopted a water quality policy: To maintain and, where necessary, improve existing water quality in the rivers of the Murray-Darling Basin for all beneficial uses - agricultural, environmental, urban, industrial and recreational, and in 1994 a flow policy: To maintain and where necessary improve existing flow regimes in the waterways of the Murray-Darling Basin to protect and enhance the riverine environment. The Audit of Water Use followed in 1995, culminating in the decision of the Ministerial Council to implement an interim cap on new diversions for consumptive use (the "Cap") in a bid to halt declining river health. In March 1999 the Environmental Flows and Water Quality Objectives for the River Murray Project (the Project) was set-up, primarily to establish water quality and environmental flow objectives for the River Murray system. A Flow Management Plan will be developed that aims to achieve a sustainable river environment and water quality, in accordance with community needs, and including an adaptive approach to management and operation of the River. It will lead to objectives for water quality and environmental flows that are feasible, appropriate, have the support of the scientific, management and stakeholder communities, and carry acceptable levels of risk. This paper describes four key aspects of the process being undertaken to determine the objectives, and design the flow options that will meet those objectives: establishment of an appropriate technical, advisory and administrative framework; establishing clear evidence for regulation impacts; undergoing assessment of environmental flow needs; and filling knowledge gaps.
   A review of the impacts of flow regulation on the health of the River Murray revealed evidence for decline, but the case for flow regulation as the main cause is circumstantial or uncertain. This is to be expected, because the decline of the River Murray results from many factors acting over a long period. Also, the health of the river varies along its length, from highly degraded to reasonably healthy, so it is clear that different approaches will be needed in the various river zones, with some problems requiring reach or even point scale solutions.
   Environmental flow needs have been determined through two major Expert Panel reports that identified the ecological priorities for the river. The next step is to translate these needs into feasible flow management actions that will provide the necessary hydrological conditions. Several investigations are underway to recommend options for flow management. Two important investigations are described in this paper: how to enhance flows to wetlands of national and international significance, and how to physically alter or change the operation of structures (including a dam, weir, lock, regulator, barrage or causeway), to provide significant environmental benefits. Early modelling suggests that the only option which has a positive environmental effect in all zones of the River is a reduction in overall water consumption.

AB Vietnam is a riparian country located in most downstream area of the Mekong river basin which is also shared by other states namely China, Myanmar, Laos, Thailand and Cambodia. While the Central Highlands of Vietnam has a great potential for hydropower development in tributaries of Mekong river, the Mekong delta in Vietnam territory is rich in natural resources which are favorable for agricultural development. However, besides local constraints which being gradually remedied by Vietnam, the development of the Mekong delta is subject to, in both terms of quantity and quality, availability of water resources which relates to the water use of or discharge into the river of upper riparians. With a view to co-developing these resources in a sustainable and mutually beneficial manner, Vietnam has cooperated with other states through framework of the Mekong River Commission set up by the 1995 Mekong Agreement. This paper describes the strategy and action plan applied by Viet Nam National Mekong Committee to reach the sustainable development of the Mekong river basin in general and of Vietnam parts located in the Mekong, basin in particular.

AB The Queen's University/National Water Research Institute Stormwater Quality Enhancement Group has, been actively researching stormwater ponds for the past decade, using a fully instrumented online system in Kingston, Ontario, Canada as a representative field installation of this group of stormwater best management practices, along with comprehensive surveys of other facilities as well. From this body of research, the Group has concluded that there are a number of identifiable factors, termed critical issues, which will significantly influence the success, failure and sustainability of these BMPs. Such factors will be important to a very diverse group of stakeholders in stormwater management, including designers, owners/operators, regulatory authorities and the general public. These factors can be grouped within the categories of initial design, operation and maintenance, performance and adaptive design. From this work, it is concluded that the so-called first generation quantity-control ponds may be outdated today, compared with the modern focus on quantity and quality issues in the second generation systems; nonetheless, without consideration of these critical issues and flexible design practices which can account for emerging or future issues, the current systems also run the risk of becoming outdated before the end of their design lives.

AB An agricultural watershed involves manipulation of soil, water and other natural resources and it has profound impacts on ecosystems. To manage these complex issues, we must understand causes and consequences and interactions-related transport of pollutants, quality of the environment, mitigation measures and policy measures. A ten year period of economic changes has been analysed With respect to sustainable development concerning Zelivka drinking water reservoir and its watershed, where agriculture and forestry are the main human activities. It is recommended that all land users within a catchment area should receive payments for their contribution to water cycle management. Setting up the prevention principles and best management practices financially subsidized by a local water company has been found very effective in both point and non-point source pollution abatement, and the newly prepared Clean Water Programme actively involves local municipal authorities as well. The first step based on systems analysis was to propose effective strategies and select alternative measures and ways for their financing. Long term monitoring of nutrient loads entering the reservoir and hazardous events statistics resulted in maps characterising the territory including Vulnerable zones and risk factors. Financing involves providing annual payments to farmers, who undertake to manage specified areas of their land in a particular way and one-off payments to realise proposed issues ensuring soil conservation and watershed ecosystem benefits.

AB The sustainable development of environmental protection is a newly created philosophy. It means continuous development of better protection of the air, soil, water and resources, used from the industry, to be saved also for future generations. The globalization of the economy is another process, which interferes with environmental ideas, and an equilibrium with the socio-eco-sustainable development is wanted. The industry is subjected to big changes depending on economic development. Thus the treatment plants at the end of the pipe must be constructed with maximum flexibility. A removal of constructed devices, if not necessary, must be considered from the beginning as a possibility. Priority is given to integrated production processes solving wastewater problems directly by production devices. The treatment of the process wastewater streams separately will become more important. The end of the pipe solutions will be less complicated and more reliable. The reuse of valuable waste substances and treated water will reduce the total cost of the treatment plants substantially.

AB After the discovery of methane gas by Alessandro Volta in 1776, it took about 100 years before anaerobic processes for the treatment of wastewater and sludges were introduced. The development of high rate anaerobic digesters for the treatment of sewage and industrial wastewater took until the nineteen-seventies and for solid waste even till the nineteen-eighties. All digesters have in common that they apply natural anaerobic consortia of microorganisms for degradation and transformation processes. In view of this, it could be rewarding to evaluate the efficiency of natural ecosystems for their possible application. Examples of high rate anaerobic natural systems include the forestomach of ruminants and the hindgut of certain insects, such as termites and cockroaches. These "natural reactors" exhibit volumetric methane production rates as high as 35 l/l.d. The development of anaerobic reactors based on such natural anaerobic systems could produce eco-technologies for the effective management of a wide variety of solid wastes and industrial wastewater. Important limitations of anaerobic treatment of domestic sewage relate to the absence of nutrient and pathogen removal. A combination of anaerobic pre-treatment followed by photosynthetic post-treatment is proposed for the effective recovery,of energy and nutrients from sewage. This eco-technology approach is based on the recognition that the main nutrient assimilating capacity is housed in photosynthetic plants. The proposed anaerobic-photosynthetic process is energy efficient, cost effective and applicable under a wide variety of rural and urban conditions. In conclusion: a natural systems approach towards waste management could generate affordable eco-technologies for effective treatment and resource recovery.

AB Conversion and loss of coastal, riverine, and palustrine wetlands to agricultural, ill-bail, and industrial developments have had significant impacts oil waterbirds. Degradation of wetlands and associated upland habitats, and associated impacts oil several duck and rail species are ell documented. Wetland restoration and management are essential for wildlife diversity because of the magnitude of wetland destruction and hydrological modification that has occurred in most of the United States. Half of threatened and endangered species rely, upon wetlands for some portion of their life cycle, underscoring the importance of wetlands to all wildlife. Ducks Unlimited, during its 65-year history of conservation programs, has restored, protected, and enhanced nearly 4.05 million hectares of wetlands and associated uplands in North America. Despite the accomplishments of Ducks Unlimited and its private, state, provincial and federal partners, the perception remains that our efforts benefit only water fowl. However, wildlife inventories oil Ducks Unlimited projects indicate benefits to more than 900 species, Herein, we promote an integrated, habitat-based landscape approach to wetland restoration and management, lather than individual species management, to achieve biodiversity and sustainable ecosystem objectives. We discuss the development of wetland restoration and management strategies for quality wetland complexes needed for waterbirds during their annual life cycles. Further, We underscore the importance of wetland management by our state, federal and private land partners to manage wetland complexes to provide high quality habitat for a wide array of wetland wildlife.

DE native grass pstures; monitoring
AB Native grass pastures are important components of many fine-wool grazing enterprises in Tasmania. However, despite their importance, native pastures are vulnerable to overgrazing and consequent degradation, which reduces their productivity and stability, and hence the sustainability of the grazing enterprises they support. Most Tasmanian graziers have a poor knowledge of the native grasses and other species that occur in native pastures, which limits their ability to manage the pastures and to detect changes in species composition associated with pasture degradation. This paper reports on. a recently initiated project that is aiming to establish a producer-based program for monitoring native grass pastures in Tasmania. As a Oft of this program, a pasture monitoring procedure has been developed in collaboration with producers. Fifteen pasture monitoring sites have been established on a wide range of native pasture types in the Midlands, Derwent Valley and East Coast of Tasmania. The main challenge faced by the program so far has been to involve producers in pasture monitoring and discussions concerning pasture management. For producers to become committed to pasture monitoring, it appears that they first need to have a longer-term focus on the sustainability and profitability of their grazing business and an appreciation of the role played by healthy and productive native pastures.

DE farming styles; extension
AB It is recognised in the recent literature on the adoption of recommended farming practices that different types, or "styles", of farmer will have different propensities to adopt technologies and participate in learning activities, industry development and planning processes. The same literature laments the lack of tools available to allow policy developers, resource managers and extension providers to predict adoption rates or to monitor the participation of farmers in programs. This paper describes a "farming styles" tool that has potential to address this current situation.
   An understanding of the social diversity of wool producers is very important in increasing the profitability, productivity and sustainability of the Australian wool industry. By understanding the attitudes, motives and preferences of a broad range of farmers, communications and extension programs can be better targeted and designed to suit farmers who have different preferences for learning and participation, as well as different ideas about what constitutes "good" farming.
   The "farming styles" tool described in this paper was trialed in the Loddon catchment of Victoria. Respondents to a mailed survey (n = 366, representing a 42% response rate), from all agricultural industries in the region, were assigned to ten groups by K-Means clustering, using their responses to 3 1 attitude and goal statements about fanning. Significant behavioural differences were found between these groups in terms of their participation in natural resource management programs, their adoption of information technology and quality assurance, and their participation in learning activities. Subsequent research in other regions of Victoria has similarly identified significant behavioural differences between styles of farmer in terms of their adoption of recommended practices and their participation in industry development.

DE wool fashion
AB To assess the future of wool and the opportunities that exist, it is important to address "big picture" shifts within our cultural landscape and then apply the pertinent information. There is no cultural trend that specifically translates into significant demand for wool product. Cultural patterns will emerge, however, that can be interpreted to understand the market mechanisms and what opportunities exist for wool apparel.
   Due to the need for constant reinvention and discovery, we in the fashion industry are great sniffer dogs: we pick up on cultural movements and interpret them into viable concepts at a rate that doesn't compare with other industries. Working at its optimum, fashion land is a well-oiled machine, with ability for critical and creative analysis that would rival any industry.
   Historically, the industry was built on the notion of being product focused; by the 1980s, as we moved into a buyer-led era, branding became popular; and during the 1990s, this was the key focus of the industry. Branding, although initially successful as a strategy to sell more fashion product, has evolved into a phenomenon that breeds homogeneity and plagiarism within the product-development area. This has led to a consumer rejection of fashion product generally, as it doesn't offer a point of difference.
   To overcome the dilemma of "branding", we are fortunately evolving into an era where once again the product is the "hero". Creativity is returning to the domain of independent designers, and the focus is moving away from the big brands that have dominated the scene for the past few years. Consumers are responding with a move towards individualism, which is having a major impact on how we produce, market, and distribute fashion.
   It is vital within this current climate that we address the needs of the consumer. Some of the practices employed within the past 10 years have not been conducive to gaining customer confidence, and it is vital that those in the industry adapt to win back consumer trust.
   In the wake of recent world events, the consumer needs to feel comfortable with the product that is being offered. This will be reflected in a number of potential trends, including:
   the search for structure in our lives;
   fashion with a sense of humour and lightheartedness;
   the urge to dress up;
   fashion that is sustainable, having integrity and providing a sense of fulfillment;
   the revival of quality in influencing purchasing decisions; and
   product categories, including basics, classics and unique pieces, will thrive.
   Knowing there are opportunities for a turn-around in fashion, the focus should be on developing the right mix of product to now fulfil the changing needs of the consumer.

AB If, in the future, androids dream of electric sheep, what do woolgrowers, fashion designers, and consumers dream of now? (Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? by Philip K Dick is the book that Ridley Scott adapted to make his film Blade Runner in 1982).
   This paper was written in response to the lack of purchasable green wool cloth available to student fashion designers and the paucity of discussion concerning fashion design and sustainability and as an encouragement for all woolgrowers and the fashion industry to work together for a sustainable outcome and future. It will address the current response and need for green product from a fashion design prospective. The term "green" product when used in this paper will refer to sustainability in a broad sense. It will refer to not only the (usual) environmental sustainability - growth, processing, and production of the fabric for the garment, but also fashion design (innovation and imagination, balanced with economic utilisation of fabric), manufacture, distribution, disposal and include human fights and fair wages. It is proposed in this paper that there is a correlation between the organic food movement and the future trend for green labelling of fashion clothing. Dan Sands,produce manager, Murray Hill Thriftway, Portland, Oregon USA, a store that carries The Food Alliance eco-label, observed "TFA's social standards are also a big selling point. On a 'feel good' level, it's important that people know workers are not slave labor and that they're getting a living wage." (Supermarket News)
   There is a wealth of worthy writing on wool as an eco and/or green fibre but little on fashion design, wool and sustainability. There is need for discussion in this area as sustainability has for many years been debated by product rather than fashion designers. This is a paradox as clothes (although in the same price range) have a higher turnover than household appliances. It will indicate the sources of the need for green product, the consumer trends, and the markets which are waiting for this product, and why. Finally, it will provide visual examples of the flexibility of thought, which will provide added value and point of difference to Australian wool product.

AB Designers have an enormous amount of influence in shaping the things we wear, drive, live and walk on. For this reason, designers are in a position to make a difference. It could be argued designers should be held responsible for the manner in which people are living today (Papanek 1995; Datschefski 2001): choking pollution, poisoned waterways, mountains of solid waste, all designed into existence (Papanek 1984). Arguably, this was not done intentionally but, upon reflection, urges a different approach. It was an industrial designer who developed the refrigerator and allowed the generation of harmful chlorofluorocarbons (Hawken 1994) into the atmosphere, destroying the ozone layer. It cannot be denied that design is a powerful tool (Buchanan 1995) and should be well informed if the best ideas and solutions are to be realised. Environmentally sustainable design is an informed collective approach to designing products. Designers in all industries need to be cautious and recognise the role they are playing and play it well.

AB This review considers the effects of different grazing methods on pastures, animals and the environment in southern Australia. Earlier research and debate on this subject tended to ignore impacts of grazing on pastures and soils. With increased emphasis on sustainablity, there is now greater interest in management options to overcome environmental concerns. There has been a tendency for the debate on grazing methods to become polarised between claims that particular grazing methods will overcome many environmental, pasture and animal problems versus support for simple set-stocked systems. We review information and principles that allow an informed choice to be made on the most appropriate grazing method given the prevailing conditions and outcomes required.
   There are obvious trade-offs in legume:grass content and per head:per hectare animal production between set-stocked and rotational grazing systems, with set stocking generally promoting legume content and hence higher per head production. However, rotational grazing allows better control over regrowth periods and residual pasture mass and, therefore, can improve pasture growth, animal intake and per hectare production when feed demand is high relative to feed supply (for example, at high stocking rates). Little benefit in pasture growth or per hectare production is likely when there is surplus herbage available (> 2,000 kg/ha DM). These different responses reinforce the need to adopt the appropriate grazing system depending on seasonal and paddock conditions and livestock requirements.
   There is potential for grazing methods to either enhance the persistence of desirable species or to reduce the presence of undesirable species. However, while this concept has been widely promoted, with the exception of phalaris and subterranean clover, there is scant information available on the grazing methods required to ensure the persistence of key species, including perennial grasses, such as perennial ryegrass, tall fescue and cocksfoot. Given the importance of increasing the perennial grass content of pastures in southern Australia, this knowledge gap requires urgent attention. In addressing this, it is important that long-term comparisons are undertaken, as it may take many years before pasture composition reaches a steady state.
   Different grazing-methods are likely to have, a small direct impact on sustainability issues through better control of nutrient transfer. In situations where grazing method helps improve the persistence of perennial grasses, further research is required to determine the indirect benefits of this for control of ground-water recharge, soil acidification, and wind or water erosion.

AB Two opportunistic field research projects that would not have met the stringent criteria for formal industry funding were conducted in South Australia. Both studies produced new scientific information with defined practical applications and outcomes.
   The first research subject was the control of internal parasites in sheep grazing pivot irrigation systems, a problem which threatened the economic viability of this farming enterprise. "Best-bet" control strategies were tested to determine whether sustainable control of parasitism could be achieved without repeated drenching. Four pivot systems were destocked of sheep for at least 3 months before the introduction of drenched lambs on to them in summer, usually for a period of 12 to 18 weeks. Cattle either grazed the same area concurrently with the sheep or preceded them through the system. No sheep grazed the pastures during winter and spring of the first season until the process was repeated the following summer. The numbers of nematode larvae on pasture were monitored monthly. No drenching was required for lambs grazed on the pivots over 2 seasons, demonstrating that sustained production over summer is possible, providing that very strict attention is given to pasture preparation and flock sanitation. Winter/spring grazing of pastures that have been irrigated over summer may be hazardous to sheep; and if cattle are not available as an alternative, the system will probably fail in its second year. The same danger exists if spring pastures are not cleared of sheep prior to the initial introduction of young sheep in summer.
   The second research subject involved interactions between cobalt status and low levels of internal parasites in young sheep on a poor nutritional plane over summer and autumn, an annual event across large areas of southern Australia. One hundred and eighty weaner sheep in 6 equal treatment groups were grazed under nutritional stress for 7 months on a known cobalt-deficient coastal farm, which had been free of sheep for more than a year. Half of the sheep were artificially infected with low numbers of internal parasites, the other half remained "worm free". Within each of these groups, one-third received cobalt by means of an intraruminal bullet, one-third received cobalt through monthly injections of Vitamin B12, and one-third received no cobalt supplementation. There were significant negative effects of worms on body and fleece weights and staple strength but no effects on staple length and fibre diameter. Cobalt supplementation had significant positive effects on body and fleece weights. There were no significant interactions between worms and cobalt. There were no significant differences in any production parameters between methods of cobalt supplementation. Notwithstanding the fact that absolute values for body weight, fleece weight and staple strength were suboptimal because of severe nutritional stress, all showed significant benefits (15.0%, 28.1% and 60% respectively) ascribed to the combined effects of adequate cobalt nutrition and an absence of worm burdens. It is remarkable that the low worm burdens in the sheep, which would generally be considered unimportant under normal farming circumstances, had such a significant impact on production. The additive effect of concurrent low cobalt status and worm infections could have important implications for seasonal flock management in "hard years" in large areas of South Australia and Western Australia.

AB Increasing concerns for the environment are having major impacts on animal production and land use worldwide. In intensive systems, there are risks of pollution of water with nitrate and phosphorus and of air with ammonia. Approaches for mitigating these emissions are discussed. Greenhouse gas emissions, particularly of methane, are substantial in all ruminant systems. When expressed per unit of animal product, they are highest in extensive systems, such as wool production. The most effective approach to increase methane efficiency is to increase the rate of production of individual animals.
   There is much concern by society about the extinction of plant and animal species, which is proceeding at an extremely high rate, about the loss of ecological communities and habitats and more generally a demand for high biodiversity in the countryside and landscape. Plant biodiversity may give advantages, particularly in low-input systems, in terms of increased production and reduced variability of production. There may also be some opportunities for increasing profitability from premium prices for the products of systems with high biodiversity. However, intensification generally results in reductions in diversity of plants and their associated insects and birds. Fiscal and legal measures will probably be needed to encourage enhancement of biodiversity in such situations. "Agri-environmental schemes", including payment for farmers restricting management in order to satisfy biodiversity objectives, are well established in the EU; but benefits in biodiversity are not always achieved. It is argued that areas managed principally for biodiversity should be integrated in the farm with areas managed principally for agricultural efficiency, rather than a moderate level of intensity being maintained throughout. Management for biodiversity can be concentrated on those areas with particular potential for the development of biodiversity. Examples of the integrated use in production systems of areas managed in these ways are given, and this approach is particularly attractive for sheep production.

AB The effects of grazing pressure and annual applications of phosphorus (P) fertiliser (single superphosphate) on the productivity of continuously stocked sheep has been assessed since 1979 at Hamilton, Victoria, at a site now known as the Hamilton Longterm Phosphate Experiment. The perennial ryegrass, phalaris and subterranean clover pasture was sown in 1977 on an area where the Olsen P was about 4mg P/kg soil. Since 1988, the plots have been stocked with fine-wool Merinos that lamb in September. Eighteen treatments were compared. These comprised 6 levels of fertiliser in factorial combination with a low, medium or high grazing pressure. The stocking rate (SR) of the sheep was varied with fertiliser level, so that SRs were higher where more fertiliser was used, ensuring that animal production from the various systems reflected differences in pasture production and quality. Intervention to manipulate pastures has been minimal for the first 20 years, enabling long-term effects of fertiliser and SR on the pastures to be assessed. Soil fertility was monitored regularly, including an audit of nutrients to a depth of 80cm in 1994. Other measurements include-pasture growth, assessments of botanical composition, and a study on the nutritive value of the pastures. Currently, SRs range from 6 to 19 ewes/ha, and applications of P, averaged since the start of the experiment, vary from 1 to 33kg P/ha/year. Early work showed 2- to 3-fold differences in pasture growth associated with P fertiliser. The botanical composition, protein content and digestibility of pastures were improved through heavier P applications and higher SRs. Perennial ryegrass and subterranean clover were favoured by intermediate amounts of P (8 to 14kg/ha annually) and intermediate SRs. The proportion of phalaris increased as more P was applied but only when the grazing pressure was low. Increasing inputs of P on these continuously stocked pastures when the grazing pressure was high favoured capeweed. The most heavily fertilised pasture at the highest SR was dominated by capeweed (70% in spring 2000). This led to small increases in the acidity of the subsoil. The combined effects of improved yield and quality increased annual gross margins from $90 to $270/ ha. Some indicators of sustainability show that, so far, there have been no major environmental consequences of applying P fertilisers in amounts well above that used by district farmers, provided that desirable perennial grasses are maintained.

DE sustainable production; incentives
AB The potential for achieving both profitability and environmental sustainability is considered using case studies of commercially operated wool properties on the riverine plains and the hills and tablelands in south-eastern Australia. Native pastures contribute over 30% of feed supply on all properties. Data was collected on farmer goals, pasture types, livestock utilisation of pasture, current financial position and alternative farm management options. Most of these properties needed to increase income, so the study focused on how the properties might be organised to achieve this in the future. Evaluation showed that there were potential investment options on each property that were compatible with maintaining native pastures. Such investment greatly increased the capacity to afford conservation management.
   Incentives were found to be still needed to encourage conservation management, but cash payments for such activities is only one possible form that such incentives might take. It is argued that incentives directed at changing the farm production system, business organisation and management capacity have an important role. The focus on understanding environmental issues within the farm business context leads to a final conclusion that policy about native vegetation and biodiversity can ill-afford to ignore the operational detail of farm businesses.

ID VEGETATION; PASTURES; PLANTS
AB Native temperate grassland and grassy woodlands have been subject to considerable modification by livestock grazing and clearance for exotic pastures and crops. In Victoria, very little high-quality grassy vegetation persists. Consequently, native grasslands and grassy woodlands are considered endangered ecological communities and therefore are a very high priority for nature conservation.
   Most of the highest-quality grassland remnants occur in small, isolated areas on public land. The long-term persistence and resilience of these scattered remnants is uncertain. Although typical remnants on private land are of low quality, their large size means that they have the potential to play an important role in the conservation of grassy ecosystems. One of the major challenges of the future is determining how to enhance the quality of these remnants on private land while ensuring productivity for farmers.
   This paper describes the initial results of a joint project between Agriculture Division and Parks, Flora and Fauna Division within Victoria's Department of Natural Resources and Environment. This project involves collaborative work between scientists, farmers, extension officers and policy makers to develop best management practices so that native grasslands on farms are grazed in a sustainable manner.
   A detailed review of grazing management strategies in native grasslands was undertaken. As well, market research was carried out to identify the attitudes of farmers and extension officers towards grazing in native grasslands. This work identified a lack of knowledge about appropriate grazing management strategies as the major impediment to conserving grasslands within productive grazing enterprises. Four high-priority research areas were identified, as follows:
   assessment of different grazing management regimes (e.g., timing, set stocking versus cell grazing) for biodiversity enhancement or loss;
   determination of maximum productivity gains in grasslands (e.g., fertiliser rates, livestock density) beyond which there is biodiversity loss;
   cost-effective broadscale re-establishment and enhancement of native grassland; and
   identification of productivity benefits of conserving biodiversity in natural grassland ecosystems.

AB In 1981 Chile replaced a mature government-run social security system that operated on a pay-as-you-go basis with a privately managed system based on individual retirement accounts. The new system is more fiscally sustainable because pension benefits are defined by contributions. The minimum pension guaranteed to beneficiaries with at least 20 years is funded from general taxes, preserving the tight matching between contributions and benefits. The new system also eliminates several cross-subsidies. Men and women with less than secondary education gain under the new system, but single women with more education lose. Comparison of the old and the new systems reveals a complex set of factors that cause gender effects given constant behavior or change behavior across genders.

AB The Canadian government's attempt to create a sound economic system within Aboriginal communities began more than four decades ago. In the mid-1970s, the settlement of Modern Treaties started as a new approach to finding permanent solutions to Aboriginal economic and social problems. Some analysts believe that Modern Treaties provide a strong foundation for sustainable Aboriginal socio-economic development. Others argue that the financial compensations received through the agreements were inadequate to attain a meaningful transformation of Aboriginal communities. This paper examines the impact of Modern Treaties on the economic and socio-demographic status of Aboriginal communities in the Northwest Territories and Northern Quebec.

AB Since 1990 the influence of sustainable land use systems on the agro-ecosystem has been investigated on the farmland of Munich Research Association for Agricultural Ecosystems Research (FAM) in Southern Bavaria. In order to determine the change of occurrence of Cirsium arvense cover abundance were estimated and shoots were counted at 268 nodes of a 50x50 m(2) grid for each spring and summer between 1991 to 2000. After switching over the management from conventional to integrated and organic farming in autumn 1992 C arvense has heavily spread. Until 1998 in both fanning systems the occurrence of C arvense has increased up to more than 60 % (integrated fanning system) and 70 % (organic farming system) respectively. Furthermore, the cover abundance has increased in the integrated fanning system until 1998. In the years 1999 and 2000 a decrease was observed. In the organic farming system higher amounts of cover abundance were determined than in the integrated farming system. There, a decrease of C. arvense can not be found until 2000.

AB Sustainable strategies for avoiding or reducing the evolution and spread of single and multiple herbicide resistance in weed populations require changes of current production systems. For assessing the effects of cropping measures on weed populations comprehensive knowledge on population dynamics and population genetics in a spatio-temporal context is necessary.
   In the current paper, varying herbicide strategies with different active substances, the use of competitive crop cultivars and spatio different herbicide applications were assessed concerning their effect for avoiding or reducing the development of herbicide resistant weed populations. This analysis is based on a mathematical model, describing the spatial-temporal dynamics and population genetics of a weed population. To support the assessment in such a way is particularly helpful in the case of multiple resistance, as many different combinations of measures are possible and their long lasting effects are hardly to foresee.
   As the model calculations show, the spatial and temporal dynamics of resistance can be affected significantly by the different cropping measures. The application of different active substances in an annual rotation and the use of competitive crop cultivars are appropriate procedures to counteract the build-up of resistant weed populations. To reduce the effect of herbicide treatments on the resistance evolution on adjacent fields, a sufficient wide buffer strip between these fields is necessary.

AB In two factorial field trials of several years using glufosinate resistant maize or glyphosate resistant sugar beet it was investigate how to control weeds in mulch systems and which possibilities are given to integrated winterhardy cover crops. The results showed, that older weeds could be controlled by post emergence treatments even if non-winterhardy cover crops are used. Consequently, possibilities of herbicide reduction are given. Due to integration of winterhardy cover crops sustainable weed suppression is possible. Easy control of cover crops by using complementary herbicides is guaranteed. Depending on the crop and the cover crops used, not every efficient weed suppression system assures high yield.

AB Modern agriculture is commercially and target-oriented and hence in order to achieve enhanced production large amounts of synthetic chemicals are being used to control noxious weeds. However, the sustainability of agricultural land is rapidly deteriorating because of the residual effect of synthetic chemicals coupled with shifting weed populations and increasing resistance to herbicides. Thus, in order to maintain the sustainability of the agro-ecosystems it is essential to explore eco-friendly means of alternative weed management. The phenomenon of allelopathy (which refers to the direct or indirect effect of one plant, including microbes, on another through the release of chemicals in the environment) is one of these promising alternatives. It can be manipulated for getting the benefits of weed management through various strategies. Use of allelopathic cover or smother rotational or companion crops is one such strategy. In this context, rye (Secale cereale L.), Sorghum spp., alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.), buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum Moench.), foxtail millet (Setaria italica (L.) P. Beauv.), sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) and cruciferous plants are important allelopathic crops commonly used as cover, smother, rotational or companion crops. These are not only useful in controlling weeds but also provide biomass. Another strategy is the use of wild accessions of modem cultivars that have lost their allelopathic traits because of the selection pressure. In this direction, allelopathic traits from wild accessions are being transferred to high yielding cultivars to achieve selective weed control. Finally, natural phytotoxic chemicals from allelopathic plants can be exploited as novel agrochemicals for controlling harmful weeds. Such chemicals not only provide the desired results but also pose no threat to environment and have different target sites in contrast to commercial herbicides. This paper discusses all these strategies and potentials of using allelopathy for weed management.

AB Worldwide large amounts of synthetic herbicides are being used to control harmful weeds on agricultural lands. However, due to their residual activity in the soil and the consequential threat to the sustainability, efforts are being made to explore eco-friendly ways of alternative weed management. In this context one such approach is to use natural plant products directly for the purpose of weed management. Such chemicals not only provide the desired results but also pose no threat to environment and have different target sites in contrast to synthetic herbicides. Among the natural products essential oils are known to possess greater toxicity owing to their lipophilicity and lesser solubility in water. The present study was planned to determine the effect of volatile essential oils extracted from leaves of Eucalyptus citriodora Hook. against four noxious weed species such as Cassia occidentalis L., Bidens pilosa L., Avena fatua L., and Ageratum conyzoides L. It was observed that volatile oils have a profound effect on the germination, growth, development and photosynthetic activity of the target weed species. Nearly three weeks after exposure to the volatile oils, the treated plants got wilted. Therefore it can be concluded that volatile oils from E. citriodora hold a good promise and could be used for the management of weeds.

AB The vision of ''sustainable development'' that is increasingly shaping the socio-political agenda is interpreted as reconciling ecological, social and economic needs for the benefit of existing and future generations. In view of the complex challenges involved, it is advisable to first resolve supposed contradictions of interest. This also applies to the relationship between raw materials extraction and aspects of sustainable devel- nature conservation. This paper uses the example of the cement industry in North Rhine Westphalia to examine this relationship, including the investment security needed for capital-intensive cement production. The paper considers various projects initiated and supported by the Raw Materials Commission of the BDZ (Federal German Association of the Cement Industry) and the VDZ (German Cement Works Association). This review suggests there is ample scope for resolving differences between industry and nature conservation. Nature conservation is for example a prime consideration when extraction sites are restored, whereas mining activity mainly displaces intensive agriculture.

AB Water, a limited finite resource, vital for the very existence of life on earth and a necessity for economic and social development and for environmental sustainability, is becoming a scarce commodity. This is caused by the population growth, the change of lifestyle, water pollution caused by human intervention, inefficient use of water and climatic changes with more frequent extreme events such as droughts and floods. Where the availability of water cannot be increased by using conventional resources or by recycling or cannot be made available by demand management methods, the desalination of sea or brackish water offers an alternative solution. The desalination of water has been practiced since ancient times but was not widely used due to technological limitations, the prohibitive high capital costs, high-energy consumption and finally very high unit cost when compared to conventional water. New technological advances in the last 30 years tremendously reduced the capital cost and the energy consumption so that desalination projects can be considered as alternative solutions to water development. However, desalination projects are still not very cheap to be easily accommodated by the economies of many countries, energy consumption is still comparatively high, and acceptance of such projects is questioned by environmentalist, politicians, engineers and other groups of the population on economic, social and environmental issues. The present paper outlines the growth of desalination worldwide, the reasons why it is growing, whether it is a solution to the water scarcity problem, and what are desalination and desalination and the environment. It also considers the social acceptance of the plant, steps for scientific, engineering, social and environmental acceptance and environmental mitigation measures and the energy demand and alternative sources of energy. Environmental effects on the sea environment, the air, land and on the region as well as on the regional development plans are to be minimized. Finally the costs are to be considered including the effects on the total economy of the country and the financing options.

AB We have developed an automated cross-correlation technique to detect 21cm emission in sample spectra obtained from the H I Parkes All Sky Survey. The initial sample selection was the nearest spectra to 2435 low-surface-brightness galaxies in the catalogue of Morshidi-Esslinger, Davies and Smith. The galaxies were originally selected to have properties similar to Fornax cluster dE galaxies. As dE galaxies are generally gas poor it is not surprising that there were only 26 secure detections. All of the detected galaxies have very high values of (M-H/L-B)(circle dot). Thus the H I selection of faint optical sources leads to the detection of predominately gas-rich galaxies. The gas-rich galaxies tend to reside on the outskirts of the large-scale structure delineated by optically-selected galaxies, but they do appear to be associated with it. These objects appear to have relative dark matter content similar to that of optically-selected galaxies. The H I-column densities are lower than the 'critical density' necessary for sustainable star formation and they appear, relatively, rather isolated from companion galaxies. These two factors may explain their high relative gas content. We have considered the H I mass function by looking at the distribution of velocities of H I detections in random spectra on the sky. The inferred H I mass function is steep, though confirmation of this result awaits a detailed study of the noise characteristics of the H I survey.

AB Almost all countries in the world are adopting industrialization as a main component in their sustainable development strategies. Many industries are generating hazardous wastes which pollute the environment and lead to health problems. This can be avoided by the development of industrial processes which reduce hazardous wastes and pollution. Recycling of wastes is essential to prevent hazardous wastes and to increase the efficiency of production. It is also necessary to manage the disposal of enormous quantities of hazardous wastes.
   The aim of this paper is to study hazardous waste and their source reduction in materials and processing technologies. A review of different definitions of hazardous wastes is mentioned. The study discusses the generation and classification of hazardous wastes. The effect of hazardous wastes on health is included. Emphasis is on hazardous wastes elimination and prevention. Thus is basically applied to source reduction in-plant during industrial operations. Case studies and examples are provided. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Desalination has become a major source of fresh water almost everywhere, The best choice for providing freshwater in the Middle East and North Africa, especially in the Arabian Gulf countries, was through seawater desalination with ground water as back up. Desalination in the Arabian Gulf countries is an example of the fast growth of the desalination industry. It is expected to show a steady growth in the coming years. Existing plants will experience expansions in their capacities. New plants will be constructed, The long experience of the Arabian Gulf countries in the desalination field together with massive desalting capacities represent a continued challenge in capacity building. More efforts in training for desalination technology are needed, together with human resources management, planning, academic education and research. A capacity-building program is necessary not only to improve the operation and maintenance of existing desalination plants but also to build an integrated adoption of this sustainable technology in the region. This paper will focus on discussing the need and necessity of research in desalination by reviewing possible improvement of the current desalination processes regarding lower water production cost better utilization of energy, environmental aspects, etc. A training program for desalination technology to enhance human resources and expertise via academic education and research is outlined.

AB Water sector capacity building is conceived as a strategic element in sustainable water development and management. Capacity building consists of three basic elements: (1) an enabling environment with appropriate policy and legal framework, (2) an institutional development along with community participation, and (3) human resources development. This paper aims to assess the level of capacity building in water desalination in Jordan. It addresses the existing legal, institutional, research, and technical status with respect to water desalination in Jordan. A conceptual framework for viewing the water issues in Jordan is presented. This model consists of three components, namely, needs, technology, and institutions. A comprehensive review of Jordan's needs in terms of research, information and training with respect to desalination are presented. Recommendations are outlined.

AB Desalination, along with wastewater reuse and water importation, can provide a means of increasing the available fresh water in regions of the world where water is scarce. If desalination is to be successfully implemented in developing countries to increase the supply of fresh water for municipal and industrial purposes, capacity building is urgently needed at both the undergraduate and postgraduate level. However, courses dealing with the technical aspects of desalination technology alone are not the solution to the problem. Undergraduate and postgraduate programmes involving an integrated approach to sustainable water management are needed; and desalination, wastewater reuse and irrigation management should be part of these programmes.

AB If we consider riparian areas as landscapes it means that we consider them as entities whose survival depends on ecological as well as on cultural sustainability. Ecological sustainability requires people's understanding of the role of both diversity and connectivity of riparian areas. Cultural sustainability requires people's attention and care towards diversity and connectivity. It is argued that interaction between ecological and cultural sustainabilities governs riparian management, and that we still have to promote such an interaction. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Landscapes are representations of a range of possible ways of life and people may interpret them in a variety of often conflicting ways, One expression of such tension occurs with respect to landscape tastes is illustrated in the paradox of New Zealand's organic farming landscapes. While organic practices are environmentally friendly, they do not have landscapes which are tidy and cultivated, and reflect New Zealand's legacy of a hardworking settler mentality. The landscapes on organic farms are, therefore. interpreted by some as being indicative of laziness and neglect and by others as responsible and environmentally healthy. In order to reveal the motives and values which engender this range of landscape tastes, an ethnographic approach was taken. Through in-depth interviews, this study explores the links between conventional and organic farmers' landscape tastes and associated values. This investigation is of particular relevance to landscape architecture, in the context of ongoing discussions of the "ecological aesthetic", a discussion which addresses a perceived dichotomy between aesthetics and ecology. The ways in which people relate to the form of ecologically sound farming practices, thus sheds light on the way form, function and meaning are constructed. This type of study constitutes a foundation for culturally sustainable landscape design. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

ID SMOKING BANS; QUALITY
AB As part of its participation in the international network of health promoting hospitals (HPH), South Tyneside Health Care NHS Trust has initiated a series of sub-projects that are informed by the contemporary evidence-base and the principles of the HPH programme. This paper concerns the first of these sub-projects, whose aim is to establish an equitable and effective Trust-wide system to address smoking in South Tyneside. The ambition is to build a framework for, and foster a culture within which, individuals will be treated considerately, whilst managing "unhealthy" behaviour in such a way as to have a long-term positive impact within the organisation and the surrounding community. This paper will briefly outline the key activities underway, and the manner in which it is hoped this approach to undertaking a HPH sub-project will contribute to sustainable local health improvement, while also supporting the Trust's broader transformation into a truly health promoting organisation.

TI Eurostrip - state of the art of strip casting
SO STAHL UND EISEN
LA German
DT Article
AB When Krupp Thyssen Nirosta started to operate their first European pre-industrial strip casting plant successfully in December 1999 in Krefeld, an exciting story in European research and development activity was conveyed into industrial realization. Since the end of the 80s various European steel makers, universities and research institutes - besides others worldwide - put substantial efforts into the development of the strip casting process by the twin roll principle. Halfway through 1999 the two strongest European projects - Myosotis in Isbergues, France, and Vastrip in Terni, Italy - merged their experiences and created Eurostrip technology. A strong team of specialists became networked in order to efficiently resolve the remaining challenges for the economical use of this technology. Krefeld was chosen as first industrial location, since Krefeld provided for a perfect incorporation in existing materials flow to utilize logistical synergies. All the advantages of this revolutionary technology - savings in costs and capital employed, gains in time and supply chain management, specific quality features and the impact on the consumption of energies and resources, thus sustainability - are dealt with in this paper. The latest achievements for carbon steel in Terni and for stainless steel in Krefeld are presented to describe the actual status and art of strip casting. Strip casting is stated to be the beginning of a new era in metallurgical technology.

AB In hypercompetitive environments, the established paradigms of sustainability of competitive advantage and stability of organizational form may have limited applicability. Using an in-depth case analysis of the firms Yahoo! and Excite, this study examines how the organizational form, function, and competitive advantage of these firms dynamically coevolved. The study introduces the concept of continuous morphing to describe the comprehensive ongoing transformations through which the focal firms sought to regenerate their transient competitive advantage on the Internet.

AB Nearly Twenty years after the first large-scale field survey on wild rice in China during 1978 1982, we have recently made an extensive survey on Chinese Oryza granulata (Nees et Am. Ex Watt.), including its current distribution, population characteristics and status of endangerment. Because of the change in the division of administrative areas, the number of counties or cities where the wild rice grows has reached up to 30. Oryza granulata grows normally under the coverage of 90% - 210% in the tropical forest with resistance to drought and moderate disturbance. The measurement of aggregation showed that it maintains a colony pattern in the community. Oryza granulata scatters seeds mainly by gravity and animals, causing limited scale of gene flow between local populations and attaining a typical metapopulation structure of the distributional pattern. Our survey revealed that 12.9% of the populations had been extinct, and 83.9% were endangered. The extent of disturbance varied in different areas. Up to date, the majority of the populations grow in the mountainous areas of southwestern Hainan and drainage area of Nanding river, Lancang river Of Yunnan, under the threat of human activity. A total DNA bank was established that consists of 1 109 individuals from 49 populations. In the practice of conservation, difficulties such as lacking immediate utility and scattered distribution impeded the conservation efficient. However, owing to its characteristics of population genetics, sustainable and ex situ conservation strategies are appropriate in some places to salvage this important rice germplasm.

AB The mountain-basin system(MBS) in the north of the Tianshan Mountains consists of mountain vegetation vertical belt system and concentric circular vegetation (geologic and geomorphic) system of desert basin. The MBS contains three "circles": montane, piedmont fan and alluvial plain, including nine belts, viz. alpine belt, montane forest-grassland belt, low-mountain desert belt, gravel gobi desert belt, agricultural oasis, marginal belt of diluvial fan, alluvial desert plain, sandy desert belt, and lake. The above-mentioned zonation is the most essential existence and functional pattern of those precious natural resources. It is the representation of an irresistible rule of the nature and, also, the guidance system of ecological conservation and land use. Basing on this foundation, a 44 mountain-oasis-oasis/desert ecotone-desert eco-productive paradigm" is proposed. The MBS is its basic frame. Its driving forces are the biogeochemical cycles, biogeophysic process, and biogeosocial interaction, which run through the whole system. Thus, the establishment of a sustainable agricultural system and an optimized land use and land cover structure and pattern, which aimed at ecological conservation, may be possible.

However, extending the access to mobility to mankind while curbing emissions, will require to complement and diversify the transportation and fuel resources. In the long term, hydrogen could become a major carrier to bring to the market a variety of primary energy sources, including renewables, depending on environmental and/or local constraints. Such a transition would underpin a move towards a sustainable energy system.

AB While contributing 17% of electricity generation world-wide, nuclear energy currently contributes only 7% to primary energy. Save a few exceptions, including electricity generation, the diverse applicability of nuclear energy which was envisioned at the start of the nuclear age has not yet been put into widespread practice, With emerging issues such as sustainable development of world economies, the capacity of nuclear energy to deliver heat that is free from greenhouse gas emissions offers a renewed incentive to consider a broadened, energy-intensive product mix. One possibility would be to use heat from nuclear power plants to produce hydrogen through water splitting, using thermo-chemical methods.

   productivity measures of sustainable agricultural systems
SO AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS

DE agricultural sustainability; total factor productivity; resource
   degradation; resource quality indicators
ID PAKISTAN; WHEAT; CHINA
AB Many economists have advocated and applied total social factor productivity (TSFP) (i.e., total factor productivity estimated with both market and non-market inputs and externalities, and with all factors valued at social prices) as a single all-embracing measure of agricultural sustainability. This paper reviews the conceptual and practical issues in measuring TSFP and shows that no one measure alone will be theoretically or empirically robust as an indicator of sustainability. TSFP is a conceptually flawed measure since inclusion of non-mark-et inputs and outputs and social price-based valuation, in most cases, violates the theoretical basis underlying those estimates. Trends in TSFP also have limited value in diagnosing the nature of sustainability problems, unless changes in productivity are related to underlying changes in technology, human and physical infrastructure, and indicators of resource quality.
   More attention needs to be given to defining key indicators of agro-ecosystem health and relating these measures to trends in productivity. This analysis must be sufficiently disaggregated and for a long enough time period to allow for spatial and temporal variability inherent in agricultural production. Secondary data at the district level on both conventional inputs and outputs and resource quality have recently allowed more quantitative estimates of sustainability and its causes. With limited data, yield growth decomposition analysis can often be used to provide valuable insights into sustainability problems. Meanwhile, there is a need to invest in long-term experimental and panel surveys of farmers and their fields for key production systems in order to provide long-term data that will allow full productivity accounting, using more formal statistical procedures. Regardless of the approach selected, the findings of this paper strongly suggest a need for economists, agronomists and soil scientists to collaborate in integrating approaches in order to provide more robust and informative measures of sustainability.

ID SWEDEN
AB The large lakes of Sweden, Malaren, Hjalmaren, Vattern and Vanern, have been subjected to water-quality monitoring for almost four decades. Physicochemical variables, plankton and benthic invertebrates have been regularly assessed. Hydrological and sediment conditions, macrophytes, fish, primary production, bacteria and attached algae have been periodically investigated. The human impact, including industrial activities, was reflected in excessive amounts of organic matter, nutrients, metals and persistent organic compounds. From the late 1960s all municipal sewage works in the catchments of the lakes were upgraded to the highest technical standard, including chemical precipitation of phosphorus, and phosphorus discharge from the sewage works was thereby reduced by 90-95%. In addition, industries were obliged to restrict discharge of harmful substances. The reactions of the lakes to the remedial measures are discussed as well as the value of various indicators. The studies were instrumental in designing a national lake monitoring program. Additionally, results from large lake monitoring have contributed to the establishment of national water-quality criteria including, physical, chemical, and biological indicators.

ID DIAGNOSIS
AB In areas of drug-resistant malaria, control programs may restrict chemotherapy until malaria has been confirmed via microscopy to contain costs and toxicity. In Brazil, patients travel to centralized laboratory posts (FNS) at great cost for diagnosis and treatment. A program was established through the bars of a mining town offering free dipstick diagnosis and mefloquine treatment on a 24-hr basis; falciparum malaria dipstick tests are accurate and easy to use. Outcomes were compared with historical data and results of a neighboring non-intervention village. Guidelines for dipstick use and treatment were followed for 98% of visits. The number of FNS visits was reduced from 2,316 (expected) to 1,097 (observed) with 626 dipstick tests applied. Ninety-five percent of those who visited the FNS experienced onset of malaria symptoms in the town where the FNS was located. There was an unexpected doubling of the malaria hospital admission rate. We demonstrate that dipstick testing can be used in a sustainable, community-based program that should be applicable in a wide variety of settings.

TI Multi-trait selection indexes for sustainable UK hill sheep production
SO ANIMAL SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
DE carcass composition; maternal effects; selection index; sheep
ID LAMB SURVIVAL; GROWTH; CATTLE
AB Three selection indexes for the UK hill sheep sector are derived to suit the extremes of hill production systems. These are: (i) intensive, where all surplus lambs not required for breeding are finished for slaughter, (ii) extensive, where all surplus 'store' lambs are sold to other farmers for finishing, and (iii) semi-intensive, which is intermediate between the two extremes, i.e. farms finish some lambs for slaughter and sell others as store lambs. Parameters for 12 breeding goal and index traits were estimated using a total of 3962 lamb records and 5944 ewe lambing records from Scottish Blackface sheep on two Scottish Agricultural College experimental hill farms. The breeding goal comprised carcass, maternal and survival traits. The evaluation of these indexes showed that improvements in maternal traits are possible, along with more modest improvements in carcass quality traits. Responses to selection are expected to be lower for the extensive farm in general, compared with the intensive farm. Evaluations of alternative indexes show that an index using measurements of fat and muscle on ewes rather than on lambs may be more cost-effective to implement in practice, compared with the original index, although this change results in a higher (i.e. undesirable) gain in mature size. Sensitivity analyses showed that in general, the indexes are robust to changes in economic values and to changes in heritability estimates.

AB Modernization, as well as the rapid socioeconomic and political changes that have taken place in Greenland in the 20th century, have altered the interests and concerns of Greenland's hunters. For example, these changes can be observed in the way hunters divide a catch of beluga whales. This article focuses specifically on how beluga hunters have negotiated new ways of dividing the catch in order to respond to new needs and demands. Today, Greenland is a heterogeneous society with a number of different socioeconomic groups: a situation that has intensified conflicts and strategies based on social compartmentalization, The chosen strategies lead us to question the emphasis that social scientists usually place on community integration. Apart from considering local problems, hunters must also relate to a number of elaborate Home Rule regulations that influence their rights and control their activity. The Home Rule government has strengthened the regulations because biologists and international/regional management commissions have concluded that the stock of beluga whales is substantially depleted. The regional management commission, NAMMCO, thus warns that the present harvests are several times the sustainable yield, and, if continued, will likely lead to stock extinction within 20 years. This new concern has made it even more necessary to redefine the rules for catch division and make them locally flexible. The Home Rule regulations are discussed and compared to local ways of dealing with new concerns and interests.

AB it is projected that the world demand for milk and meat will increase during the period 1993 to 2020 by more than 60%, and that satisfaction of this demand requires a 46% increase in world grain production. It is argued that it would be prudent not to depend only on crop-livestock and intensive systems of production to meet the increasing demand for animal products. Production from grazing systems is less dependent on grain supplies and opportunities and means for increasing it are discussed. There are underused opportunities for grazing in tree crops, such as rubber and oil palm, and as a component of agroforestry, but increased production must come mainly from improved management of existing grasslands. The management, including the choice of plant species, fertilizer use, and the type, numbers, and movement of animals amongst pastures must maintain sustainability of production and be benign to the environment. A number of features of a computer program that is a decision support system for grazing animal production are described. Use of the program gives reasonable assurance that pasture management and the nutritional management of the animals, including the use of supplementary feed, will be efficient, profitable and sustainable.

AB The main object of animal production is to supply constantly safety, tasty and nutritious products, such as meat, milk and egg. More energy and protein are required for production of livestock compared to direct human consumption of nutrients. The conversion ratio of energy and protein in feedstuffs to foods is estimated to be 15 and 30% in poultry, respectively. Livestock can utilize feedstuffs which a-re not edible as foods, but some feedstuffs are competing with foods and the amount of foods is deficient for total human consumption in the world. Therefore, feedstuffs and foods have to be utilized effectively. For effective utilization of feedstuffs, it is necessary to know exactly the requirements of nutrition of animals, and the contents and utilizing efficiency of nutrients in feedstuffs. Today intensive animal production has to put not only effective production of livestock, but also the animal waste pollution problem for sustainable animal production and the animal welfare in perspective. Under these circumstances, a role of amino acids is getting more important. The amount of commercial supply of crystalline amino acids is increasing to enough to meet any demands of feed formulators. By supplementing of limiting amino acids, the dietary crude protein levels are able to be reduced without affecting performance of poultry and the excretory nitrogen is reduced by reducing dietary CP levels. In this paper, following problems; analysis of amino acids in feedstuffs, availability of amino acids in feedstuffs, determination of amino acid requirements, plasma amino acid concentration as a parameter to determine amino acid requirements, reduction of excretory nitrogen and effects of dietary amino acids on quality of products, are discussed.

ID INFORMATION; INDUSTRY
AB The rapid development of information and communication technologies (ICTs), with the Internet being one of the most significant, is shaking the foundation of the banking industry. Simply deploying the Internet as a more efficient distribution channel win not bring sustainable strategic advantages. To compete effectively, banks may need to embrace a new set of strategic priorities, based on the 'unbundling' of banking services and processes, and the 'deconstruction' of the integrated banking model. Such a radical transformation threatens the profitability and survival of some existing incumbent banks, and at the same time, it brings a cohort of new opportunities and powerful new players to the market. This paper reviews existing studies on the use of the Internet in banking, and highlights two prevailing models and the strategic thinking behind them. Based upon recent empirical evidence gathered from in-depth case studies and other information sources in the UK, the paper discusses a number of emerging tendencies and explores possibilities to reconcile the discrepancies between the two prevailing models. The paper calls for a radical departure from existing strategies in the banking industry based on the concept of process integration and service bundling. A new framework is outlined for banks and other financial organizations in developing and evaluating their strategies. The latest evidence suggests that at least eight models of Internet banking, somewhere on the spectrum between the two prevailing models highlighted by previous studies, have emerged in the UK. These models are illustrated briefly in the paper. This is still a rapidly evolving area, and new research is clearly needed to understand the key dynamics of the banking industry in the networked economy. Finally, some themes for further research are highlighted.

AB Changing consumer preferences, technological advances, global agri-food markets and increasing regulation of food quality, and safety have created the need for identity-preserved production and marketing (IPPM) systems, which bridge the gap between differentiated consumers' wants and traditional commodity-based agri-food production and marketing systems. The international trading regime is ill equipped to deal with these changes. In the absence of an agreed set of trade rules to regulate trade in differentiated food products, relying on IPPM systems or barring imports of "low-quality" goods become domestic policy choices. The latter is shown to be an inferior policy option. The sustainability of an IPPM across national boundaries is dependent upon its ability, to credibly signal quality to consumers. Incentives to cheat erode this credibility. Horizontal and vertical cooperation through third-party certification are key to the long-run sustainability of IPPM systems.

AB Since the beginning of the 1990s, many researchers and several organizations concerned with development- and environment-related issues have devised methods to evaluate sustainable development at national and international scales. To that effect, they have identified sustainable development indicators. To date, however, very little work has focused on industrial activities. This paper presents a semi-quantitative method allowing evaluation of the environmental aspect to sustainable development, with an application on the environmental performance of the effluent treatment procedure of a paper mill. Eight environmental indicators for sustainable development are considered for evaluation. These indicators are linked to the strategic requirements for sustainable development as stated in the Bruntdland Commission. They are also acknowledged by many authors and organizations. The environmental performance evaluation on the effluent treatment procedure of the paper mill under study shows that this activity meets a relative degree of sustainability. This evaluation allows the identification of the strengths and weaknesses of the effluent treatment with respect to sustainable development.

AB Economic and sustainability arguments require carefully assessing the potentialities of indigenous resources for the production of mortar and concrete for the construction industry. In Vietnam, significant efforts should be bestowed on urban development, coastal protection and harbour construction works. In a joint Vietnamese-Dutch co-operation program, the practical use for this purpose of relevant resources in Northern Vietnam is assessed experimentally. This paper concentrates on kaolin. which is widely available in this region, The key issues this paper is dealing with are the effects of partial replacement of Portland cement by calcined kaolin in mortar and concrete on compressive strength as well as on durability characteristics of mortar and concrete mixes pertinent to the coastal environment. Workability measures are also mentioned. Data are therefore presented on compressive strength development over a maximum curing period of 180 days of mixes in which the water to binder ratio was varied between 0.40 and 0.53. Moreover, partial replacement was considered in the range from 0%. to 30% by weight. The results of this study render possible the assessment of optimum replacement percentages of Portland cement by calcined kaolin, and the associated strength gain. Additionally, this paper reports on the performance aspects of similarly blended mortar and concrete specimens stored for a period of one year in a low concentration of a sodium sulfate solution. It could be concluded that a strength gain due to blending will be accompanied by improved durability in this environment. (C) 2001 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB This paper surveys the problems of contemporary urban ecology through the lens of lawn chemical usage, exploring the difficulty of explaining and managing urban ecological dilemmas that, though built from the disaggregated choices of individuals, aggregate into large and serious issues. Introductory discussion surveys the seriousness of lawn chemicals as urban non-point pollution sources and suggests why the issue, and problems like it, is understudied. Analysis proceeds with a case study from the United States city of Columbus, Ohio, utilizing formal survey techniques and analysis of county assessor's data. The results suggest lawns and lawn care chemicals are expanding with urban sprawl and that users of high-input lawn chemical systems are more likely to be wealthy, well-educated, and knowledgeable about the negative environmental impacts of the actions than non-users. Further investigation demonstrates the instrumental logics of homeowners in pursuit of property values but also points to the moral and community-oriented institutions that enforce and propel high chemical use. The conclusions point to policy options for dealing with the lawn chemical dilemma but suggest the difficulties of circumventing the deeply structured roots of the problem.

DT Article
AB Sustainable development is the only hind of development possible for help in the third world. Due to various historical, political, geographic and climatic conditions the divergence between those countries providing and those receiving help is so vast that donations of labor an/or money is simply not enough. Rather, communities have to be taught to support and develop themselves during the receipt of aid and especially after the help pulls out. It is our goal in this article to summarize one such,sustainable development, project. As volunteers for AMREF (African Medical and Research Foundation), we worked with the remarkable Makueni Applied Nutrition Project in eastern Kenya in the summer of 2001. Our job was to visit the various locations in this semi-arid and arid environment and to write a report on the situation of the diverse parts of the project. The Applied Nutrition Project (ANP) started in 1984 and serves as an excellent example of the significant help that can be provided to needy areas of the world with a multifaceted approach.

DE hybrid dynamical systems; production systems; decision support systems;
   animal wastes treatment; agriculture
AB MAGMA is a hybrid dynamical system (HDS; i.e. with both continuous and discrete-valued variables) allowing the simulation of management of various kinds of animal manure or slurry production and utilization modes (waste spreading on cultivated crops and fallow land and compost making). It can support decision-making to help better manage such potentially hazardous organic matter (OM) at the farm level with the aims of environmental risk minimization, agricultural efficiency and farming sustainability. One can define several scenarios based on farm structural parameters in MAGMA, for example, animal and crop production characteristics, capacity of manure or slurry spreading equipment, and distances. Each scenario can be tailored according to several management strategies by using switch constants. This paper describes the core of the model, enabling the simulation and scheduling of actions (crop harvest, manure or slurry spreading, etc.) that consume those wastes according to various uses. The use of the model in simulation is explained and a detailed example is given on how it can contribute in choosing alternative management strategies. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Subsistence game bunting has profound negative effects on the species diversity, standing biomass, and size structure of vertebrate assemblages in Amazonian forests that otherwise remain largely undisturbed. These effects are likely to be considerably aggravated by forest fragmentation because fragments are more accessible to hunters, allow no (or very low rates of) recolonization from nonharvested source populations, and may provide a lower-quality resource base for the frugivore-granivore vertebrate fauna. I examined the likelihood of midsized to large-bodied bird and mammal populations persisting in Amazonian forest fragments of variable sizes whenever they continue to be harvested by subsistence hunters in the aftermath of isolation. I used data from a comprehensive compilation of game-harvest studies throughout Neotropical forests to estimate the degree to which different species and populations have been overharvested and then calculated the range of minimum forest areas required to maintain a sustainable harvest. The size distribution of 5564 Amazonian forest fragments-estimated from Landsat images of six regions of southern and eastern Brazilian Amazonia-clearly shows that these are predominantly small and rarely exceed 10 ha, suggesting that persistent overhunting is likely to drive most midsized to large vertebrate populations to local extinction in fragmented forest landscapes. Although experimental studies on this negative synergism remain largely unavailable, the prospect that increasingly fragmented Neotropical forest regions can retain their full assemblages of avian and mammalian species is unlikely.

TI Historic fire regime in Southern California shrublands
SO CONSERVATION BIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID NORTHERN BAJA-CALIFORNIA; MEXICO; FOREST
AB Historical variability in fire regime is a conservative indicator of ecosystem sustainability, and thus understanding the natural role of fire in chaparral ecosystems is necessary for proper fire management, It has been suggested that the "natural" fire regime was one of frequent small fires that fragmented the landscape into a fine-grained mixture of age classes that precluded large, catastrophic fires. Some researchers claim that this regime was lost because of highly effective fire suppression and conclude that if fire managers could "restore" a regime of frequent fires with widespread prescription burning, they could eliminate the hazard of catastrophic fires. The primary evidence in support of this model is a study that compared contemporary burning patterns in southern California, US.A., a region subject to fire suppression, with patterns in northern Baja California, Mexico, where there is less effective fire suppression. We found that differences ill fire regime between these two regions are inconclusive and could not be ascribed conclusively to differences in fire suppression. Historical records suggest that the natural fire regime in southern California shrublands was rather coarse-grained and not substantively different from the contemporary regime. There is no evidence that fire-management policies have created the contemporary fire regime dominated by massive Santa Ana wind-driven fires. Increased expenditures on fire suppression and increased loss of property and lives are the result of human demographic patterns that place increasing demand on fire-suppression forces.

TI A systematic test of an enterprise strategy for community-based
   biodiversity conservation
SO CONSERVATION BIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB A commonly held belief is that if people can benefit financially from enterprises that depend on nearby forests, reefs, and other natural habitats, then they will take action to conserve and sustainably use them. The Biodiversity Conservation Network brought together conservation and development organizations and local communities to systematically test this hypothesis across 39 conservation project sites in Asia and the Pac ftc. Each project implemented one or more community-based enterprises such as setting up an ecotourism lodge, distilling essential oils from wild plant roots, producing jams and jellies from forest fruits, harvesting timber, or collecting marine samples to test for pharmaceutical compounds. Each project team collected the biological, enterprise, and social data necessary to test the network's hypothesis. We present the results of this test. We found that a community-based enterprise strategy can lead to conservation, but only under limited conditions and never on its own. We summarize the specific conditions under which an enterprise strategy will and will not work in a decision chart that can be used by project managers to determine whether this strategy might make sense at their site. We also found that an enterprise strategy can be subsidized and still create a net gain that pays for conservation. Based on our experiences, we recommend developing "learning portfolios" that combine action and research to test other conservation strategies.

AB Ecological and economic data are essential to the identification of tropical nontimber forest products with The potential for sustainable and profitable extraction in a managed system. We studied the demographic effect and economic returns of harvesting aromatic gabaru wood from fungus-infected trees of Aquilaria malaccensis Lam. at Gunung Patting National Park, Indonesia, to evaluate the management potential of gaharu wood. Aquilaria malaccensis trees of >20 cm in diameter occurred at low preharvest densities (0.16-0.32 ha) but were distributed across five of six forest types surveyed. During a recent harvest, 75% of trees were felled, with harvest intensities ranging from 50% to 100% among forest types. Overall, 50% of trees contained gabaru wood, but trees at higher elevations contained gabaru wood more frequently (73%) than trees at lower elevation (27%,). The mean density of regeneration (juveniles >15 cm in height) near adult trees (3-7 m away) was 0.2/m(2), 200 times greater than at random in the forest (10/ha), but long-term data on growth and survivorship are needed to determine whether regeneration is sufficient for population recovery, Gabaru wood extraction from Gunung Patting was very profitable for collectors, generating an estimated gross financial return per day of US $8.80, triple the mean tillage wage. Yet, the estimated sustainable harvest of gabaru wood at natural tree densities generates a mean net present value of only $10.83/ha, much lower than that of commercial timber harvesting, the dominant forest use in Kalimantan. Returns per unit area could be improved substantially, however, by implementing known silvicultural methods to increase tree densities, increase the proportion of trees that produce gabaru wood, and shorten the time interval between successive harvests. The economic potential of gabaru wood is unusual among nontimber forest products and justifies experimental trials to develop small-scale cultivation methods.

TI Mitochondrial DNA sequence variation and phylogeographic patterns in
   harbour porpoises (Phocoena phocoena) from the North Atlantic
SO CONSERVATION GENETICS
LA English
DT Article
DE marine mammal conservation; mtDNA; phylogeography; population structure
AB The harbour porpoise (Phocoena phocoena) experiences high rates of incidental mortality in commercial fisheries, and in some areas these rates are sufficiently high to justify concern over population sustainability. Given the high incidental mortality, the resolution of population structure will be important to conservation and management, but in the North Atlantic the relationships among many of the putative populations remain unclear. A previous genetic study demonstrated substantial genetic differences between eastern and western North Atlantic populations, however the location of this break remained unresolved. In the present study, we addressed this issue by including new samples from Iceland. To investigate population structure, variation in the mitochondrial DNA of 370 porpoises was compared among six locations corresponding to several of the putative populations (Gulf of Maine, Gulf of St. Lawrence, Newfoundland, West Greenland, Iceland, Norway). The first 342 base pairs of the control region were sequenced and genetic variation investigated by analysis of molecular variance (F-ST and Phi(ST)) and chi(2) with permutation. Although some fine scale population structure was detected, porpoises from Iceland were found to be more similar to the western populations (W. Greenland, Gulf of St. Lawrence, Newfoundland, Gulf of Maine) than to Norway. Furthermore, porpoises from Norway were different from all other regions. These patterns suggest the existence of a discontinuity between Iceland and Norway, possibly the result of isolating events caused by repeated range contractions and expansions throughout Quaternary glaciation events within the North Atlantic. These results suggest that harbour porpoise populations within the North Atlantic are distinguishable, but patterns must be interpreted in light of their historical biogeography.

AB Objectives, First, to define the relationships between critical opening and closing pressures and oxygenating efficiency, and second, to address whether respiratory inductive plethysmography (RIP) could be used to monitor changes in thoracic volume that follow changes in mean airway pressure during high-frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV).
   Design: Prospective, interventional animal study.
   Setting: University research laboratory.
   Subjects. Five anesthetized, paralyzed, and ventilated pigs.
   Interventions. The animals were ventilated by using HFOV after lung injury. Pre- and post-HFOV pressure-volume curves were obtained by supersyringe. A pressure-volume curve was constructed during HFOV as mean airway pressure was increased from 10 to 40 cm H2O and then weaned back down to the minimum sustainable. Hemodynamic and oxygenation data were obtained at each data point.
   Measurements and Main Results: RIP-derived thoracic volumes correlated with known lung volumes during supersyringe (r(2) = .78, p < .00001). During HFOV, three of five animals had an identifiable critical opening pressure of the lung, and four of five had an identifiable critical closing pressure. No consistent relationship between critical opening and critical closing pressures was observed. During the weaning phase of HFOV, a relative decrease in RIP-measured volume of > 10% predicted the decrease in oxygenation associated with reaching the critical closing pressure,
   Conclusions. The ability of RIP to detect optimal lung volume during the weaning of mean airway pressure may allow clinicians to more directly monitor lung volume changes during HFOV and use the lowest possible airway pressures after lung recruitment.

AB Pest management practices among rice and rice-fish farmers and their perception of problems related to pests and pesticides were surveyed in the Mekong Delta. A total number of 64 different pesticides were identified during the survey. Approximately 50% were insecticides, 25% were fungicides and 25% were herbicides. The main insecticides used were pyrethroids (42%) carbamates (23%) and cartap (19%). Non-IPM farmers used twice as many pesticides as IPM farmers. Their application frequency and the amount of active ingredient used were 2-3 times higher per crop, as compared to IPM farmers. During the last three years IPM farmers estimated that they had decreased the amount of pesticides used by approximately 65%, while non-IPM farmers said that they had increased the amount of pesticide used by 40%. Also, farmers growing fish in their rice fields used less pesticide than farmers growing only rice, as pesticides adversely affect cultures of fish. Taking a long-term perspective integrated rice-fish farming with IPM practices provides a sustainable alternative to intensive rice mono-cropping, both from an economic as well as an ecological point of view.

AB Sustainable agroecosystem management generally entails increased management ability and input. Decision making for sustainable management could be enhanced by tools that provide integration and synthesis of soil test results, management priorities, and environmental concerns. Science-based soil quality indices (SQIs) may provide an ecologically based approach needed for land managers to make sustainable decisions. We developed a general approach for choosing the most representative indicators from large existing data sets. combining indicators into location-specific indices of soil quality, and using this index to assess agricultural management practices. We used a poultry-litter management case study to illustrate the design and use of this SQI. Site-specific indices were created using the SQI design framework for two sites with different soil types but similar climatic regimes. At each site we compared alternative poultry-litter management practices: land application of fresh vs. composted poultry litter. The data sets were composed of > 40 assays including total organic C, macro- and micronutrients, heavy metals, plant available water, water-stable aggregate, bulk density, and microbial biomass and activity. Multivariate statistical techniques were used to determine the smallest set of chemical, physical, and biological indicators that account for at least 85% of the variability in the total data set at each site. We defined this set as the minimum data set (MDS) for evaluating soil quality. We evaluated the efficacy of the chosen MDS to assess sustainable management by performing multiple regressions of each MDS against numerical estimates of environmental and agricultural management sustainability goals (i.e., net revenues, P runoff potential. metal contamination, and amount of litter disposed of). Coefficients of determination for these regressions ranged from 0.35 to 0.91, with an average R(2) = 0.71. We then transformed and combined each MDS into an additive SQI. Index values exhibited significant differences between management treatments. SQI values for composted litter applied at a low rate were consistently highly ranked, but the relative ranking of treatments changed slightly due to differences in inherent soil properties at the two sites. Using this generalized framework allowed indices to be tailored to local conditions. The resulting soil quality index appears to be an effective monitor of sustainable management.

AB Many federal and state management agencies have shifted from commodity-based management systems to multiple resource-based management systems that emphasize sustainable ecosystem management. Long-term sustainability of ecosystem functions and processes is at the core of ecosystem management, but a blueprint for assessing sustainability under different management strategies does not exist. Using the Missouri Ozark Forest Ecosystem Project (MOFEP) as a case study, we present one approach to evaluating the landscape-scale, short-term (one and two years posttreatment) consequences of even-aged and uneven-aged forest management treatments on community-level biological diversity. We chose changes in density of ecological species groups, representing groups of species with similar resource requirements, as our response variable. Changes in density are detectable before species completely disappear from an area, and these changes may be an early indicator of significant alterations to community structure and ecosystem function. Meta-analysis was used to statistically combine changes in densities across multiple species groups and assess the overall impacts of management treatments on the animal community. We also separately examined changes in density for each ecological species group. Our findings demonstrated that, in the short-term, even-aged and uneven-aged forest management treatments caused changes in animal community density in Missouri Ozark forests. Even-aged management sites showed greater changes than uneven-aged management sites after harvesting, and changes in species' densities were larger two years posttreatment (1998) than one year posttreatment (1997). Evaluation of treatment effects on individual ecological groups revealed that toads, forest interior birds, and edge/early successional birds were significantly affected by management treatments. We did not expect most species groups to exhibit treatment effects because relatively little forest biomass was removed per experimental site (only 10%), forest cover at the regional landscape level did not change and was generally high during the study, and the time scale was relatively short. The challenges facing ecosystem management evaluation parallel the challenges of ecological science in general: identifying appropriate variables, spatial and temporal scales, and experimental/management treatments. The integrative approach demonstrated in this paper is a first step toward the analysis of the effects of management treatments on multiple organisms within an ecosystem.

ID ECOLOGICAL FOOTPRINT
AB The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region is a highly developed modern city where technical and economic advances have made it possible to support 7 million people on 120 km(2) of built-up land, resulting in 58 000 people per km(2), one of the highest population densities in the world. This population depends on a continual supply of materials, energy and information to function, and these resources are mainly supplied from outside Hong Kong's own geographical boundaries. The ecological footprint (EF) of Hong Kong due to its direct and indirect consumption of renewable resources and waste generation is presented. Additionally, the paper traces the spatial patterns of Hong Kong's EF and examines the implications of this ecosystem appropriation. The study finds an EF for Hong Kong of about 6 ha per capita, with the largest appropriation occurring for marine ecosystems. If the impacts of fish farming are included, Hong Kong appropriates a marine area nearly 2000 times its own built-up city area, Current resource consumption and waste generation patterns in Guangdong, China - where much of Hong Kong's terrestrial ecosystem appropriation occurs - are also discussed.

TI Energy consumption patterns in the accommodation sector-the New Zealand
   case
SO ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS

DE energy consumption; tourism; accommodation; hotel; sustainability
ID PERFORMANCE
AB The concept of sustainability is more and more established as an integral component in modern economies. A major threat to sustainability is the escalating demand for energy resulting in the depiction of natural resources and a concomitant threat to the global climate from the emissions produced. Although tourism and its sub-sectors, such as transport, accommodation, and attractions, constitute an increasingly important part of many economies, their contribution to energy use is not well researched. Particularly, in popular tourist destinations, such as New Zealand, tourism could be a significant contributor to energy consumption. As every tourist relies on the provision of accommodation, this is considered a core sub-sector within tourism. Previous case studies have indicated that accommodation is an energy-intense sector, however, comprehensive research on energy use patterns is missing. This paper contributes to the understanding of energy use within the accommodation sector by analysing the New Zealand scenario. The main objectives are the exploration of differences in energy consumption between hotel, bed and breakfast, motel, backpacker, and campground accommodation categories, and the role of factors such as business size in this consumption. Based on this analysis benchmarks are established for each category for total annual energy use and energy intensities, such as energy use per visitor night. When aggregated the total energy use of the accommodation sector in New Zealand is also estimated. The results reveal that hotels are the largest (net and per capita) energy consumers in the accommodation sector, making up 67% of the total 1.74 PJ consumed in 1999 in the accommodation sector. This constitutes 4.4% of the commercial sector's energy use and 0.4% of the total energy use in New Zealand. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

ID MANAGEMENT; DAMAGE
AB Reduced-impact logging (RIL) techniques are designed to improve the efficiency of timber harvesting while mitigating its adverse effects on the forest ecosystem. Research on RIL in select tropical forest regions has demonstrated clear ecological benefits relative to conventional logging (CL) practices while the financial competitiveness of RIL is less conclusive. We conduct a comparative analysis of financial returns to one and two cutting-cycle logging entries for representative RIL and CL operations of the eastern Amazon. Observed variability in harvest efficiency and uncertainties of forest productivity are introduced in a stochastic simulation of future biological and financial returns to the alternative logging systems. Despite the perceived investment risks, RIL harvesting operations generate competitive or superior returns relative to CL for a wide range of discount rates due to gains in harvest efficiency and forest conservation.

AB Use of chemical inputs such as pesticides has increased agricultural production and productivity. However, negative externalities from such use have increased too. These externalities include damage to agricultural land, fisheries, fauna and flora. Another major externality is the unintentional destruction of beneficial predators of pests thereby increasing the virulence of many species of agricultural pests. Furthermore, increased mortality and morbidity of humans due to exposure to pesticides are recorded especially in developing countries. The costs from these externalities are large and affect farmers' returns. However, despite these high costs, farmers continue to use pesticides and in most countries in increasing quantities. In this paper, we examine this paradox and show why farmers continue to use pesticides despite the increasing costs. We also emphasize 'lock-in' aspects of pesticide use.

TI Constructing a farm level indicator of sustainable agricultural practice
SO ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
LA English
DT Article
DE sustainability; indicators; organic; agriculture
AB There has been a concerted effort since the Rio Earth Summit to construct indicators to monitor progress towards sustainable development. This has included indicators of sustainable land management, land quality indicators and indicators of sustainable agriculture. It is argued in this paper that the design and use of such indicators can be extremely useful in that they force those involved in the discussion of sustainability to identify the key aspects of sustainable agriculture and to assign weights to them. In this process the discussion of sustainability may be coaxed from the realms of general discussion and abstraction to a more operational context, and ultimately to the discussion and classification of actual practices and farms. To this end, a farm-level indicator of agricultural sustainability, based on patterns of input use, is constructed for a sample of 80 organic and 157 conventional producers in the UK. The paper serves to highlight some of the conceptual issues, examines some of the technical issues and choices associated with indicator construction, and informs discussion of the relationship between organic production and agricultural sustainability.

DE ecological engineering; ecological design; design principles
ID MANAGEMENT
AB The emerging discipline of ecological engineering is a response to the growing need for engineering practice to provide for human welfare while at the same time protecting the natural environment from which goods and services are drawn. It recognizes that humanity is inseparable from and dependent on natural systems, and that the growing worldwide population and consumption have damaged, and will increasingly stress, global ecosystems. Ecological engineering is the design of sustainable systems, consistent with ecological principles, which integrate human society with its natural environment for the benefit of both. It recognizes the relationship of organisms (including humans) with their environment and the constraints on design imposed by the complexity, variability and uncertainty inherent to natural systems. Successful ecological engineering will require a design methodology consistent with, if not based on, ecological principles. We identify five design principles to guide those practicing ecological engineering. The principles are: (1) design consistent with ecological principles, (2) design for site-specific context, (3) maintain the independence of design functional requirements, (4) design for efficiency in energy and information, and (5) acknowledge the values and purposes that motivate design.

AB Production of cannibalistic Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus (L.)) and their prey conspecifics were estimated in an allopatric population, situated in an alpine ultraoligotrophic lake in central Norway. Estimates of population abundance were obtained by mark recapture and successive removal experiments. Assuming stable age distribution, we estimated mean yearly biomass ( +/-95% CL) of char in sampled size groups vulnerable to predation (60 to 150 mm) to 7.93 (5.11-14.30) kg (.) ha(-1). Similarly, mean yearly biomass (+/-95% CL) of cannibalistic char (> 250 mm) was estimated to 0.62 (0.50-1.06) kg (.) ha(-1). Annual production ( +/-95% CL) of char in length groups 60 to 150 mm was estimated to be 4.31 (2.74-8.03) kg (.) ha(-1). year(-1), and production ( +/-95% CL) of cannibalistic char to 0.19 (0.15-0.33) kg (.) ha(-1) (.) year(-1). Depending on the food conversion factor (set to vary from 0.1 to 0.4), the cannibalistic char removed from 10% to 40% of the production of char in sampled size-classes vulnerable to predation yearly. The overall ecological efficiency in energy transfer between the prey and predator population was 4.4%.

DT Article
AB We live at a time when billions of people on this earth cannot achieve their full potential. Their lives are cut short or impoverished by malnutrition, pollution, and disease caused by failure of ecosystem and social services. in addition, if we were to project the quality of life enjoyed by those in advanced industrial countries to the world's poor, we would need about two planets to satisfy the demands for resources and waste assimilation services. Superimposed on the degradation of social systems, ecosystems worldwide are experiencing major threats to their integrity and health. Excessive human impacts are degrading ecosystem service provision, breaking and contracting food chains and making them less productive. Despite a growing understanding of social and ecosystem dysfunctionality, there remains little movement toward social sustainability and the restoration of the health of ecosystems worldwide. This paper presents an ethical foundation for those who seek sustainability. The key to such an applied ethic is the idea of directionality, where the natural tendency toward increasing complexity and diversity in complex adaptive systems provides guidance on what constitutes a sustainable society. The achievement of such a society can be facilitated by an ethic of potentiality that will assist humans to reintegrate ecosystem and human health.

AB This paper argues for a syntropic, multilevel conceptualization of ecotoxicology beyond the simple organism-level effects of poisons. Such a concept embraces complex systems, ecotoxicology, ecoepidemiology, and ecosystem health and integrity. One way of thinking about the relative stability of ecosystems and their biological and nonbiological components is the conditional (Bayesian) probability of their coherent versus incoherent response to perturbation. Anthropogenic and natural stress may change the structure, function and/or organization of dissipative systems at any level, compromising self-regulation and making unstable incoherent responses more probable. Syntropic ecotoxicology argues for increased understanding of how ecotoxic agents or events may be disrupting self-regulating mechanisms at the molecular, cellular, organismal, population, and/or community levels-their multilevel ecotoxicodynamics. In parallel, and adaptive to new knowledge, interdisciplinary teams of scientists, policy makers, and other stakeholders must collaborate effectively to mobilize and integrate financial, human, material, and information resources to prevent and control existing priority deterministic stressors.

TI The economic value of forest ecosystems

AB Forest ecosystems are being degraded and lost because of rapid population change and economic incentives that make forest conversion appear more profitable than forest conservation. All ecological functions of forests are also economic functions. Many important forest functions have no markets, and hence, no apparent economic value, justifying the use of forest land for other purposes. Imputing economic values to nonmarketed benefits has the potential to change radically the way we look at all forests and to make the pendulum swing back from a presumption in favor of forest conversion to more conservation and sustainable use. This paper surveys what we know about forest economic values and draws policy conclusions from the now substantial literature that values nonmarket benefits of forests. Estimating economic values is not enough. The subsequent stage of policy is to design markets that capture the values-'market creation'-ideally for the benefit of the many vulnerable communities that rely on the forests for their well-being. These conclusions support the wider argument for using effective economic instruments to promote conservation of the remaining forests. Forest loss involves: risks to human health; accelerated climate change; increased watershed disruption, adding to eutrophication in inland and coastal waters; loss of water quality; and loss of biodiversity.

AB The patterns of living, planning, and resource utilization as practiced in Western countries for decades are not sustainable; change of some sort is essential. But what changes are appropriate, and, perhaps more important, will people accept them? The small experiment framework provides a strategy for meeting the challenge of change. By encouraging participation, limiting the scale of initial change, and incorporating some aspects of the familiar, many of the difficulties that make change so problematic can be mitigated or even eliminated. An exploration, from a psychological perspective, of the characteristic difficulties surrounding potential change provides the context for a discussion of the components of the small experiment and an analysis of how these elements address these characteristic challenges. A comparison to adaptive management is drawn, and several concrete examples illustrate how the strategy has been used successfully to address a variety of environmental problems.

AB Macrophages can kill tumor cells by releasing high levels of nitric oxide (NO) and related reactive nitrogen species such as nitroxyl and peroxynitrite, after up-regulation of expression of the inducible nitric oxide synthase gene (iNOS). In this paper we describe two novel human cell lines that are capable of expressing high levels of iNOS under the control of analogues of either the insect hormone ecdysone or tetracycline. We have entrapped these iNOS-expressing cells within a semipermeable alginate-poly-L-lysine membrane as a means of delivery to tumor sites in a nude mouse model. These encapsulated cells can be induced to generate sustainable high concentrations NO and reactive nitrogen species at tumor sites after treatment either with ponasterone A or muristerone A or with doxycycline. Delivery of these iNOS-expressing cells to tumors formed from human ovarian cancer SKOV-3 cells results in 100% killing, whereas treatment of tumors formed from human colon cancer DLD-1 cells results in 54% killing. We show that in these iNOS-expressing cells, tumor killing is associated with concomitant upregulation of the Fas/FasL proteins.

AB Density-dependent processes such as growth, survival, reproduction and movement are compensatory if their rates change in response to variation in population density (or numbers) such that they result in a slowed population growth rate at high densities and promote a numerical increase of the population at low densities. Compensatory density dependence is important to fisheries management because it operates to offset the losses of individuals. While the concept of compensation is straightforward, it remains one of the most controversial issues in population dynamics. The difficulties arise when going from general concepts to specific populations. Compensation is usually quantified using some combination of spawner-recruit analysis, long-term field monitoring or manipulative studies, and computer modelling. Problems arise because there are limitations to each of these approaches, and these limitations generally originate from the high uncertainty associated with field measurements. We offer a hierarchical approach to predicting and understanding compensation that ranges from the very general, using basic life-history theory, to the highly site-specific, using detailed population models. We analyse a spawner-recruit database to test the predictions about compensation and compensatory reserve that derive from a three-endpoint life-history framework designed for fish. We then summarise field examples of density dependence in specific processes. Selected long-term field monitoring studies, manipulative studies and computer modelling examples are then highlighted that illustrate how density-dependent processes led to compensatory responses at the population level. Some theoretical and empirical advances that offer hope for progress in the future on the compensation issue are discussed. We advocate an approach to compensation that involves process-level understanding of the underlying mechanisms, life-history theory, careful analysis of field data, and matrix and individual-based modelling. There will always be debate if the quantification of compensation does not include some degree of understanding of the underlying mechanisms.

AB The life-history patterns of fish and invertebrate species are complex. But much of this complexity can be captured in simple diagrams of coastal transects, where juveniles usually occur in larger numbers in shallow waters, while adults generally inhabit deeper, offshore waters. Iconographic representations of generalized lie-history patterns and depth profiles, with specific key life-history parameters can capture much of these standardized patterns, including spawning areas, nursery/juvenile distributions, adult distributions and spawning migrations. Several examples presented here from a wide range of habitats and ecosystems (temperate and tropical waters, demersal, deep water, pelagic and coral reefs), including an example of different stocks of the same species, illustrate some general patterns with regard to water depth and distance from shore. The present approach should be viewed as a first step towards obtaining standardized patterns about key life-history parameters, and will hopefully lead to incorporation into management of life-history interconnectivity between different fishery sectors or gears. This may contribute to sustainable, ecosystem-based approaches to management by informing policy options when faced with decisions to rationalize overcapitalized fisheries.

AB With over half of the world's population living in urban areas, an ever growing number of consumers are relying on food markets to meet their daily need for safe and nutritious food. As part of its Healthy Cities Project, WHO has developed an approach to improve that the safety and nutritional quality of foods sold in urban markets. The Healthy Marketplaces approach is being used in several pilot projects in cities around the world to coordinate efforts of all stakeholders to achieve incremental, but sustainable improvements in food markets. In addition to improvements to the physical infrastructure and essential services, behavioural changes by various market participants, including primary producers, wholesalers, market vendors and consumers, are emphasized.

AB We examine the financial aspects of three silvicultural systems to encourage the sustainability of valuable hardwood species in mixed-dipterocarp forests of southwest Sri Lanka. We compare the net present value (NPV) of the current forest management approach (diameter limit harvests) with shelterwood harvests that promote light hardwood timber species. In this analysis, we also consider the potential of enrichment planting various precious timber (Diospyros quaesita - calamander), and non-timber forest product (NTFP) species (Caryota urens - fishtail palm; Elettaria cardamomum var. major cardamom; Calamus zeylanicus - rattan) in conjunction with timber harvests. Two real (inflation adjusted) discount rates were used, 4 and 6%, respectively. Results show that when real discount rates are low (4%), and advance regeneration is present, NPV is highest for the one-cut shelterwood US ($9983 ha(-1)). At a high discount rate (6%), reflecting the current short-term concession system and unstable rights to harvest, and where no advance regeneration was present, the diameter limit system (US $7173 ha(-1)) was the optimum. On sites with advanced regeneration, the one-cut shelterwood system is clearly preferable. For all but rattan, shelterwood treatments provide higher NPVs for NTFPs than diameter limit cuttings primarily because of the higher light regimes and more growing space made available early in the rotation. The value for tea cultivation (US $26,000 ha(-1)) far exceeds the value of managing these lands for timber alone, explaining the dramatic expansion in tea plantations on private lands. However, our results suggest that managing these lands for a combination of timber and enrichment plantings of NTFPs (US $23,000 ha(-1)) can be comparable to tea plantations. By managing for NTFPs and timber, forest managers have new opportunities to solve the old problems of high-grading and land-use conversion. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Domestic futures and sustainable residential development
SO FUTURES
LA English
DT Article
ID DESIGN
AB Domestic 'futures' have been a long time coming. This paper questions the extent to which futuristic *vision' linked to the rhetoric and sentiment of 'sustainable development' and the 'livable city' inform town and regional planning in England and Canada. Despite official commitment to 'environmental' objectives and media interest in 'ecotech' residential development, markets institutions and behaviour lag behind what is technically possible. Planning guidance encourages homes with less environmental impact. But this message has not reached most residential consumers. Is lack of mass markets in low impact housing a flaw in Government regulation, evidence of the cynical nature of official rhetoric, or proof of gradual product development as society redefines what is expected of living spaces? Or is it unwise to expect too much change in attitudes to property, or for innovation to come soon? (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This article critically engages with the recent diffusion of the orthodox development model in Oceania and highlights some evolving dilemmas. In particular, it explores the social, economic and ecological tensions arising from economic reforms that are exacerbating the fragility of already vulnerable nation-states and communities. In order to illustrate its arguments, a case study of the impacts of agro-export growth in Tonga is presented. Attention is drawn to the socially inequitable and ecologically unsustainable outcomes of rapid growth in this sector. In analyzing the political economy of the squash pumpkin sector, the authors point to the important role that culture plays in mediating and conditioning development outcomes. Reflecting on the Tongan case it is argued that to better understand the implications of orthodox developmental reform in the region, research must seek to more explicitly incorporate distributional and ethical analysis.

AB it is difficult to produce systems, for judging sustainability, despite general enthusiasm for the concept. Here we evaluate the 'capitals' formulation for sustainability which attempts to bring together the social and the environmental dimensions of the issue, and which has gained wide currency. We concentrate our attention on the 'natural capital' element in-this framework, which has apparently been seen as its least problematical component. We use data on soil erosion from a Sahelian agricultural community in Niger. Despite apparently high rates of erosion, we find it difficult to decide whether the system is, sustainable (using the capitals or any other framework). It is even dubious whether sustainability is an urgent concern. We caution against imposing yet another poorly formulated set of concepts on this and similar systems.

AB Common understanding of the causes of land-use and land-cover change is dominated by simplifications which, in turn, underlie many environment-development policies. This article tracks some of the major myths on driving forces of land-cover change and proposes alternative pathways of change that are better supported by case study evidence. Cases reviewed support the conclusion that neither population nor poverty alone constitute the sole and major underlying causes of land-cover change worldwide. Rather, peoples' responses to economic opportunities, as mediated by institutional factors, drive land-cover changes. Opportunities andconstraints for new land uses are created by local as well as national markets and policies. Global forces become the main determinants of land-use change, as they amplify or attenuate local factors. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Urban growth is inevitable over the next two decades. The bulk of this growth will take place in less developed countries. This presents a formidable challenge for urban planners and managers. With this in mind, this paper considers some of the ways urban planners can make use of recent developments in remote sensing and geographic information systems technology to respond to this challenge. The discussion is divided into four sections. The first of these considers the nature of the tasks involved. The second examines the potential of remote sensing and geographic information systems to assist in these tasks in general terms. The third section presents some of the findings of three case studies of contrasting application areas in the urban planning field which give some insights as to how these tools can be used to respond to this challenge. The final section rounds off the discussion with a vision of sustainable urban development and its implementation at the local level. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The process of achieving urban sustainable development is uncharted. We only know that plans should address the economic, environmental and social health of the city and this task can only be accomplished by approaching each of these issues at different scales. For rapidly developing world cities, "sustainability" is becoming an increasingly elusive objective, in part, because of impacts by forces beyond their borders. Using the Asia-Pacific region as a case study, a framework relates regional transnational flows to the state of the urban environment and the social conditions of linked rapidly developing cities. The "functional city system" within the Asia-Pacific increasingly is both the engine of urban growth and the force behind differentiating urban environmental and social issues. At the same time, while globalization forces have been particularly strong within cities in the Asia-Pacific, local factors also play a crucial role in urban development. Globalization driven growth has not translated into a single path of development, rather localities have demonstrated contextually specific paths. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Bolivia is one of the poorest countries in Latin America. Health indicators are very poor, communicable diseases are prevalent and, coupled with malnutrition, remain the major killers of children under 5 years old. The Integrated Primary Health Care Project (PROISS) was a US$39 million project executed by the Ministry of Health (MOH), 50% financed by the World Bank and aimed at improving primary health care in the four largest Bolivian municipalities. The implementation of the project started in 1990 and ended in 1997. During implementation it went through three distinct phases: Phase 1 (1990-94) was a period characterized by conflict and confusion; Phase 2 (1995-mid-1996) documented major improvements in coverage and service quality; and Phase 3 (mid-1996-97) witnessed the decline of the project. This paper explores the factors that contributed to the success and the decline of the project, draws lessons for project managers and international agencies involved in the definition and implementation of social sector projects, and discusses the unlikelihood that externally financed projects can have a sustainable impact on the development of the health sector of recipient countries.

TI Setting standards in the evaluation of community-based health promotion

AB Community-based health promotion often emphasizes elements of empowerment, participation, multidisciplinary collaboration, capacity building, equity and sustainable development. Such an emphasis may be viewed as being in opposition to equally powerful notions of evidence-based decision making and accountability, and with funders' and government decision-makers' preoccupation with measuring outcomes. These tensions may be fuelled when community practitioners and lay participants feel evaluations are imposed upon them in a manner that fails to appreciate the uniqueness of their community, its programme, and practitioners' skills and experience. This paper attempts to provide an approach that depicts evaluation as being mutually beneficial to both funders/government and practitioners. First, a values stance for health promotion, termed a 'salutogenic' orientation, is proposed as a foundation for the evaluation of community-based health promotion. Secondly, we discuss possible objects of interest, the first component of an evaluation. We then discuss the spirit of the times and its implications for community-based health promotion. Finally, we address the key question of setting standards. A typology of standards is presented. Arbitrary, experiential and utility standards are based on perceived needs and priorities of practitioners, lay participants or professional decision-makers. Historical, scientific and normative standards are driven by empirical, objective data. Propriety and feasibility standards are those wherein the primary concern is for consideration of resources, policies, legislation and administrative factors. The 'model' standards approach is presented as an exemplar of a combined approach that incorporates elements of each of the other standards. We argue that the 'optimal' standard for community-based health promotion depends on the setting and the circumstances. There is no 'magic bullet', 'one-size-fits-all' or 'best' standard. Further, we argue that standards should be set from an inclusive, salutogenic orientation. This approach offers a means of creating a situation in which policy-makers and funders are more supportive of evaluation designs that fit with community realities, and community stakeholders are more capable and consistent in rigorously evaluating community-based health promotion programmes and policies.

ID RENDILLE PASTORALISTS
AB As East African pastoralists settle around market centers, women often adopt new town-based activities to generate income. While settling in or near towns presents women with new opportunities, household poverty may prevent them from exploiting these opportunities or lead them to adopt environmentally unsustainable survival strategies that contribute to the localized degradation of the natural resource base. A survey of 102 Rendille women in and around Korr town in Marsabit District of northern Kenya was undertaken to understand their income-generating strategies, Strategies analyzed in this study are the sale of milk, based on pastoral production; the collection and sale of firewood, which may be environmentally unsustainable; and income generation through small-scale trading, which has become increasingly important as market integration increases in northern Kenya. The results show that Korr women are by no means all pursuing the same income-generating activities. Potential poverty-alleviation strategies include emphasis on research and investments aim ed at improvements in milk marketing opportunities and efficiencies, increasing regional employment opportunities, strengthening collective action by pastoral women, and increasing their level of participation in decision making aimed at sustainable use of natural resources.

AB This paper explores the ecological promise and peril of Mexico's rich and diverse indigenous arts and crafts. In the quest for authentic sustainable development, the increased commercialization of folk art presents both opportunities and risks. Many indigenous art forms demonstrate characteristics associated with triumphs in agroecology, social forestry, and other rural initiatives-community revitalization, resource stewardship, traditional ecological knowledge, identity, biological and cultural diversity, and grassroots participation. However, field research in rural Michoacan and Oaxaca presents a sobering counterpoint, finding most peasant artisans entangled, both as agents and victims, in worrisome patterns of degradation, depletion, and exploitation. Global and domestic market failures, predatory bossism, embedded inequities, lack of cooperative success, and political exclusion largely undermine in practice the ecological potential of indigenous art. Still, in the face of forbidding barriers, there are encouraging signs of innovation and a fledgling national movement for a more ecological folk art.

AB A new field for the study of saline lakes called 'salinology' is proposed. Salinology is a branch of applied science focused on the study of the chemistry, physics and biology of saline lake systems. The basic task of salinology is to study and explore the features of saline lakes, to provide a scientific and technological basis for the coordination between mankind and saline lakes, to promote the scientific management and rational utilization of saline lake, and to contribute to the sustainable development of saline lake agriculture, mining and tourism.

AB There are six main species of shellfish of commercial importance within the UK (mussels, flat oysters, cockles, king scallops, Manila clams and lobsters) which can be thought of as ranched to varying degrees. A seventh (Pacific oysters) can be included, since a very small proportion of the production may undergo a period of growth on natural habitats in some areas. An eighth species (Palourdes or native clams) appeared in the statistics for the first time in a number of years in 1998. Seafish, as part of its role in promoting the sustainable management of resources, has examined the current state of the shellfish aquaculture industry in the UK.

AB Landings from the whelk fishery in the southwest Irish Sea rose from 63 t in 1990 to 6587 t in 1996 although landings declined to 2919 tonnes in 1998. Whelk are caught in pots baited with a combination of dogfish Scyliorhinus spp and brown crab Cancer pagurus. The input of bait crab is estimated at 7.2% of whelk landed. Most of the crab comes from southeast Ireland where some of it is a by-product of the claw fishery; some is targeted as bait crab, and this includes sub-size or recently moulted individuals. Fishing effort has been increasing on brown crab for human consumption also and there is concern about the sustainability of the crab fishery. Alternative bait trials examined a number of readily available fish species, some of them offals, whose attractiveness was evaluated by reference to crab and dogfish: whitefish (whiting and cod), pelagic species (mackerel and scad) and blue mussel. An artificial bait ration which included some crab meat, but 60% less than its natural equivalent, proved as effective as natural bait crab. A bait which consisted of a single species was less successful than two species fished together and some of the combinations (notably of whitefish) performed very effectively. Pelagic species performed poorly. The trade in brown crab for human consumption will always produce some form of discards which should be used; extending its use in an artificial bait is desirable.

ID SEA-URCHIN; PATTERNS; IRELAND
AB Analysis of population structure and behaviour of a semi-enclosed and theoretically non-fished population of the echinoid Paracentrotus lividus at Lough Hyne marine nature reserve, Co. Cork, Ireland, showed distinct variability. Aspects of the behavioural variability in this species have significant consequences for the natural fishery harvest potential of this species. Whether or not, when and where individuals migrate to the upper surfaces of rocks varies on a local and regional scale as well as seasonally. The effect of this is apparent changes in (a) the population structure, (b) the population size and (c) the population centres of abundance. The population structure and size of the Lough Hyne population has changed substantially, as have those on a larger spatial scale, although the causative agents are debatable. Such changes are the result of large-scale mortality of adults and failure of cohort recruitment. Despite the undeniable pressures of overfishing at many localities, it seems likely there is a strong 'natural' and possibly predictable element to the variability in P. lividus population size and structure. For the restoration and sustainable harvest of Irish P. lividus aspects of its behavioural ecology need to be taken more closely into consideration.

AB A review of water problems occurring in central and eastern Europe (CEE) is presented. The region consists of countries in transition from a centrally planned economy and single-party political system towards a market economy and democracy. Recent examples are discussed of dramatic droughts and floods. Water pollution in the region is a ubiquitous problem as a heritage of several decades of neglect of environmental costs. The essential challenges for water management are considered, based on sustainable development principles. The dominant driver in several CEE countries is the prospect of integration with the European Union (EU). Compliance with the existing EU water-related legislation in the CEE region will be a difficult, costly and lengthy process. The necessary expenditures related to compliance with the existing EU legislation in the water and wastewater sectors are in the range of 2-10% of GDP for 15 years. The regional water vision document foresees that "in two to three decades there will be sufficient, safe, clean and healthy water for nature and people living in stable societies" in the region.

AB This paper first summarizes the characteristics and distribution of water resources in China and then addresses the three major types of water problems from both historical and geographical perspectives, Major water problems, i.e. floods, droughts and water shortages, and water pollution, have tremendous impacts on the economic development and social well being in China. Analyses of water problems in the context of natural causes and human influences lead to the discussion of the role of the hydrological sciences in sustainable management of water resources, with an example of the preliminary findings of a study of water resources renewability in the Yellow River basin. Finally, challenges and opportunities for hydrologists are highlighted to present a brief summary and prospect on the development of the hydrological sciences in China.

It includes the tropical forests of the Amazon basin, the rich wetlands of the Pantanal, La Plata basin where human influences are predominant, the semiarid regions of Brazil, Argentina and Peru, as well as the high-altitude lakes of Bolivia. It is difficult to deal in depth with all aspects related to such a diversified environment. Consequently, a few selected topics concerned with water resources, economic development and scientific challenges are discussed. They are: (a) climatic variability and its effects on hydropower production and land use; (b) environmental management of the urban environment; and (c) sustainable water management in semiarid regions.

AB Africa's water problems are many and varied. A number of socio-econontic factors such as poverty, the population explosion band the Jack of hydrological and ancillary data, are at the root of these problems. Droughts and climatic variability aggravate the vulnerability of the continent and make sustainable water resources development a real challenge. Inadequate levels and coverage of water services plague both urban and rural communities, with attendant health risks. The major problems are examined, including diminishing per capita freshwater resources, poor management and inefficient utilization, and lasting solutions are proffered. The conclusion is that the hydrological, engineering and social sciences have important roles to play in enabling African economies to overcome the acute and often devastating water problems confronting them now and in future decades.

TI The HYDROMED model and its application to semi-arid Mediterranean
   catchments with hill reservoirs 1: The rainfall-runoff model using a
   genetic algorithm for optimisation

ID HYDROLOGY
AB The semi-arid region of the Mediterranean basin has climatic conditions characterised by a very erratic pattern of rainfall with respect to time, duration, intensity and amount. Subsequently, the hydrology of semi-arid regions is different from that of humid and sub-humid regions. As a result, one would expect that models developed for humid regions are not necessarily applicable to the semi-arid Mediterranean region. Mediterranean countries could increase their water resources by constructing small hill reservoirs. Gaining more understanding of the dominant hydrological processes operating in such an environment will help in the design as well as in sustainable water use of these reservoirs. Field measurements and modelling studies can achieve these goals. After being validated, models can be used as a management tool. The HYDROMED model has been developed for semi-arid regions in general and for Mediterranean conditions in particular. The model has two sub-models, the Rainfall-Runoff and The Reservoir Storage Capacity and Probability of Failure. In Part 1, the hydrological processes contributing to runoff are described and their mathematical formulations given while the results of model application on three Mediterranean catchments are given in Part 2. In Part 3 the model deals with the storage capacity of a reservoir required to maintain a yield with a given probability of failure. The HYDROMED model is menu driven, easy and friendly to use. The model uses the Genetic Algorithm for optimisation and has default values that can be selected in the absence of measured parameter values. There are different options to calculate the flows, options for the time steps ranging from less than one hour to one month and there is the facility to import text data files and import data directly from data loggers and to output results into data files and graphs. An example of calibration for the El-Gouazine catchment in Tunisia is given. The model successfully showed its ability to simulate Rainfall-Runoff events.

SO IEEE-ASME TRANSACTIONS ON MECHATRONICS

ID PRODUCT; DESIGN
AB This paper presents for the first time a mathematically sound model for design and optimization of supply chains in terms of such important performance indexes as product cost, cycle time, quality, energy and environmental impact in the context of global and Internet-based manufacturing. The two layer model is a hyper-network of material flows overlaid with an e-business information network. It extends from a traditional supply chain having suppliers, distributors, and users to include end-of-life product collectors and demanufacturers. Furthermore, it extends the performance considerations from cost and productivity to include environmental performance. Such extensions allow one to develop Internet-based manufacturing systems that are agile and can produce desired products with the minimum environmental impact over their life cycles. The research results can help manufacturers enhance their competitiveness balanced with environmental responsibility, thereby resulting in sustainable economy. Since the optimization goals are not easily quantified and exact numbers may not mean much to managers and designers, fuzzy logic-based optimization goals are used in the proposed multi-objective optimization model. It can attack typical problems in configuring Internet-based manufacturing systems, such as partner selection and transportation mode selection based on the above-mentioned characteristic of individual partners and links in a model. A personal computer (PC) containing such mechatronic components as hard disk driver, keyboard, and mouse is used as an example to illustrate the application of the proposed integrated e-supply chain model.

AB This paper describes a high-speed six-port router component with a sustainable I/O bandwidth in excess of 30 GB/s. The device uses three distinct clock domains to connect low-speed processor and I/O nodes to a high-speed switch fabric capable of data rates of up to 6.4 Gb/s per wire on copper system interconnects. The router component is fabricated in 0.18-mum bulk CMOS technology. The 100-mm(2) device contains approximately 6.6 million transistors and consumes 21 W at a link transfer rate of 3.2 Gb/s and a supply voltage of 1.75 V. Integrated on a single component, the router core and the simultaneous bidirectional links form a building block useful in the realization of large high-bandwidth multiprocessor systems.

AB As telecommunication networks become more common, there is an increasing interest in the factors underlying the development of online social structures. It has been proposed that these structures are new forms of organizing which are not subject to the same constraints as traditional social structures. However, from anecdotal evidence and case studies it is difficult to evaluate whether online social structures are subject to the same problems as traditional social structures. Drawing from prior studies of traditional social structures and empirical analyses of longitudinal data from a sample of Internet-based groups, this exploratory work considers the role of size and communication activity in sustainable online social structures.
   A resource-based theory of sustainable social structures is presented. Members contribute time, energy, and other resources, enabling a social structure to provide benefits for individuals. These benefits, which include information, influence, and social support, are the basis for a social structure's ability to attract and retain members. This model focuses on the system of opposing forces that link membership size as a component of resource availability and communication activity as an aspect of benefit provision to the sustainability of an online social structure. Analyses of data from a random sample of e-mail-based Internet social structures (listservs) indicate that communication activity and size have both positive and negative effects on a structure's sustainability. These results suggest that while the use of networked communication technologies may alter the form of communication, balancing the opposing impacts of membership size and communication activity in order to maintain resource availability and provide benefits for current members remains a fundamental problem underlying the development of sustainable online social structures.

AB Seeds of blue pine, Pinus maximartinezii, have long been used,for human consumption. However, no chemical analysis of its nutrient components has been carried out. In this paper the Content of kernel proteins, amino acids and fatty acids is reported and compared with some pinyon pines and other nut species. Proximate analysis showed that blue pine contains about 31% crude protein, 66% defatted protein, 42% crude fat, 276 carbohydrates, 9% crude fibre, 4% ash, and 4% moisture. It contains 18 different amino acids, including all the essential ones, and six different fatty acids; of these about 84% are Unsaturated. Nuts of blue pine are of outstanding dietary value and appear to be a promising resource, but the impact of seed harvesting size on the population stability needs to be thoroughly evaluated in order to insure its sustainable use, A conservation strategy for P. maximartinezii, should urgently focus on protecting the specific, habitat where this endemic rarity occurs.

TI The science of global warming
SO INTERDISCIPLINARY SCIENCE REVIEWS
LA English
DT Article
AB There is strong scientific evidence that the average temperature of the earth's surface is rising as a result of the increased concentration of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere owing to human activities, especially the burning of fossil fuels, coal, oil, and gas. This global warming will lead to substantial changes of climate, many of which will impact human communities in deleterious ways. In terms of the likely global pattern of climate change over the twenty-first century, in the absence of any mitigating action the global average temperature is likely to rise by between about 1-5 and 5-5degreesC and sea level by about half a metre (range 0(.)1-0(.)9 m). The hydrological cycle is likely to be more intense (leading in some places to more frequent and more intense floods and droughts) and the rate of climate change is likely to be substantially greater than the earth has experienced over at least the last ten thousand years. It is particularly to this rapid rate of change that it will be difficult for many ecosystems and for humans to adapt. Action has been taken by the world's scientists through the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change to assess as thoroughly as possible knowledge regarding the basic science and the impacts, including an assessment of the uncertainties. The world's governments have also taken action in setting up the Framework Convention on Climate Change (FCCC) at the Earth Summit in 1992 and at subsequent meetings of the parties to that convention, especially that at Kyoto in 1997. In order to mitigate climate change the FCCC in its article 2 has set the objective of stabilisation of the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere at a level and on a timescale consistent with the needs both of the environment and of sustainable development. Such stabilisation will eventually demand severe cuts in global emissions, for instance of carbon dioxide, to levels well below today's by the second half of the twenty-first century. To achieve the required reductions in the emissions of carbon dioxide, three possibilities are available, to sequester carbon dioxide resulting from the burning of fossil fuels rather than releasing it to the atmosphere, to become much more efficient in the generation and use of energy, and to provide for energy supply from non-fossiI fuel sources. This article will summarise the science of climate change including the evidence for it and will describe the main impacts, the actions taken so far, and the further actions that are likely to be necessary to mitigate climate change.

TI The pebble bed modular reactor: a new reactor for the twenty-first
   century
SO INTERDISCIPLINARY SCIENCE REVIEWS
LA English
DT Article
AB The ready availability of cheap energy has been a dominant driver for the economic growth and prosperity we have seen in the twentieth century, particularly in the industrially developed countries of the world. But as we head into the twenty-first century the continuing inexorable growth in demand for energy raises fundamental problems of environmental damage and resource limitation. It is clear therefore that energy market requirements for the twenty-first century must undergo a fundamental shift towards sustainability as their main priority. A major component of primary energy supply is in the form of electricity, predominantly based on fossil fuel generation. Thus, a major element of the challenge is to replace fossil generation, and this raises the question of the role to be played by nuclear power. The USA and UK appear to be addressing the question of new nuclear stations as part of an overall review of energy policy. However in many industrialised countries there is major public and political opposition to its increased use, and this is focused on the four main issues of safety, economics, nuclear waste management, and the risk of nuclear weapons proliferation. This paper describes an important new South African led development based on the pebble bed high temperature reactor concept and known as the pebble bed modular reactor. We consider in particular how this reactor meets the changing energy market requirements and addresses the above concerns.

TI The persistence of a service delivery 'culture': Findings from a
   qualitative study in Bangladesh
SO INTERNATIONAL FAMILY PLANNING PERSPECTIVES
LA English
DT Article
ID BRAZIL
AB Context: A new initiative in Bangladesh has shifted the emphasis in service delivery from door-to-door contraceptive distribution to delivery of a broader package of essential services, primarily through clinics. If the revised approaches are to result in more cost-effective services and better reproductive health, clients will need to take more initiative and bear more costs, and providers will have to become more responsive to clients' priorities.
   Methods: In-depth, semistructured interviews, group interviews and observations in service delivery settings were conducted in three rural and two urban sites, to examine how clients, communities and program staff were adapting to the new service delivery norms. The analyses in this article draw from about 125 interview transcripts.
   Results: Community reactions to the service delivery changes generally have been favorable, and suggest that family planning clients and their families are willing to adapt to the new approaches. However, responses to the policy changes on the part of clients and communities appear to be shaped by norms that developed under the previous family planning program modal. Increased charges for services appear to have exacerbated people's confusion and resentment overpayment for services and the right of clients to receive free care. Moreover, providers and clients seem to find it difficult to shed habits and assumptions surrounding the provision of specific methods, with some providers still feeling that women need to be "motivated" to practice family planning and with some clients fearing that providers will try to induce them to use certain methods. Clients also often feel that since service providers furnished them with a method, these providers should bear some responsibility for treating their health problems or side effects free of charge. And some have come to expect not only discounted or free services, but also compensation for adopting clinical methods. Fear and suspicion of clinical methods-and of providers' reasons for offering them-persist, although perhaps to a lesser extent than was the case before the service delivery model was changed.
   Conclusions: Lingering ideas about entitlements, the role of government and the agenda of the national family planning program create obstacles for nongovernmental organizations as they try to build a sustainable network of family health services in Bangladesh that is both client-focused and effective in terms of its public health impact, The new policies need to be persistently reinforced throughout the service delivery system. In addition, providers need to translate and communicate policy changes to make them more comprehensible in the communities affected by them.

AB Despite a shift in care delivery from inpatient to ambulatory care, performance measurement efforts for the different levels in ambulatory care settings such as individual physicians, individual clinics and physician organizations have not been widely instituted in the United States (U.S.). The Health Plan Employer Data and Information Set (HEDIS (R)), the most widely used performance measurement set in the U.S., includes a number of measures that evaluate preventive and chronic care provided in ambulatory care facilities. While HEDIS (R) has made important contributions to the tracking of ambulatory care quality, it is becoming increasingly apparent that the measurement set could be improved by providing quality of care information at the levels of greatest interest to consumers and purchasers of care, namely for individual physicians, clinics and physician organizations. This article focuses on the improvement opportunities for quality performance measurement systems in ambulatory care. Specific challenges to creating a sustainable performance measurement system at the level of physician organizations, such as defining the purpose of the system, the accountability logic, information and reporting needs and mechanisms for sustainable implementation, are discussed.

AB In this article, I argue that agriculture and food production processes are subject to what I refer to as 'dilemmatic situations'. These dilemmatic situations are rather new, and require a new orientation in ethics to account for them. Ethics has to give up long-cherished ideals, such as: (a) the identification of ethics with a set of obligations that require people to do certain actions; (b) the idea that there is only one good solution to an ethical problem; (c) the idea that compromises are only second best solutions; and finally (d) the dogma that solutions to ethical problems should exclude considerations of technology. Instead, I maintain that ethics must be more flexible. In the case of dilemmas facing agriculture, this means that ethics must respect consumer decisions in a substantial sense: indeed, we must look for ways to enhance the influence of consumers on the food chain and to help consumers to make up their minds with respect to new developments. Ethics must also reorient itself toward technology as a producer of values, and embrace pluralism in agriculture and food. Finally, ethics must look for compromises in such cases as the dilemmatic situation of agricultural sustainability vs.,animal well being.

DE Afghanistan; environment; degradation; environmental policy; ecosystem
AB Currently, only 6% of the 15% of land in Afghanistan is usable and, if all the refugees were to return, problems of land ownership and adequacy of available land are inevitable. Natural forests have been severely degraded. Due to the nature of the topography and the and climate, vast areas are subject to soil erosion. Loss of vegetation and soil humus have created ever more and conditions. Abandoning the lands, poor reclamation schemes, overgrazing and destruction of vegetation for fuelwood have all caused desertification. The biological productivity of pastures has also deteriorated. This reduced productivity has affected livestock and has caused dramatic changes to the patterns of wildlife populations. Soil salinization and waterlogged lands are common. Farmland and pastures have been contaminated by landmines. Heavy concentrations of air-borne particulates and considerable amounts of transboundary pollutants from the Aral Sea have been found. Use of chemicals and the machinery of war have damaged the ecosystems.
   Collection of plants and animals is unregulated and has resulted in excessive removal or extermination of some species endemic to the Hindu Kush. Uprooting of some plants and dynamite fishing are increasing and a disturbing number of fauna and flora are endangered. Agriculture is traditional, and natural resources are not being used in a sustainable way. A sound environmental strategy needs to be formulated and adopted.

AB The notion of sustainable development in the context of water resources is discussed. Facing the increasing pressures - population growth with consequences for settlements and production of food and fibre, and human aspirations to better living standards - the business-as-usual approach to water development and management cannot he globally sustainable. The need for curbing water demands and for 'doing more with less' are gaining growing recognition in our increasingly thirsty planet. An integrated approach to freshwater resources is needed, based on the perception of water as a natural resource, part of the ecosystem, and an economic and social good. It is discussed how hydrological extremes jeopardize sustainable development. Sustainability-related properties of drought and flood preparedness and mitigation measures are reviewed. Even if the term 'sustainable development' has been typically used in a qualitative sense, in order to compare how different options (e.g. flood protection alternatives) fare with regard to sustainable development, one needs at least rough quantitative measures. A sample of relevant indices is reviewed. It is advocated that hydrological observations should be recognized as an essential component of sustainable development and management of water resources.

AB In this present work, the authors, after a brief survey of current economic theories of non-renewable resources, propose an alternative mechanism for ore pricing that is consistent with sustainable development. Technological change, technological pluralism, costs and environmental issues are the main benchmarks of the present discussion. The ore pricing mechanism proposed here try to encompass all of these aspects, and reconsider the role of technology and its various options.
   In fact, technology is strictly linked to its limits (above all those of productivity, efficiency and its resulting environmental effects) and can no longer be considered just in terms of the classical principles of the minimum cost without evaluating those aspects related to the goals of sustainable development, widely shared at the international level. Without making any claims to being an exhaustive treatment of this topic, the present work tries to apply these principles to price ores.

AB Whilst the world economy is developed, the life and development of human beings have been threatened by the imbalance between environmental and ecological aspects. Thus, sustainability is becoming increasingly the focus of various social fields. For most developing countries, a strategy with good sustainability for social development is of long-term significance to keep the economy in expansion. This paper first reviews the conceptual framework and up-to-date development of sustainability. Second, it reviews the current transport situation of China and its future demands. Third, the paper analyses transport policy from the viewpoints of energy consumption and environment pollution caused by transportation. It finally summarises suggestions for transport policy that China should consider in the future.

It contributes substantially to improvement of the local economic situation and partially replaces traditional slash-and-burn agriculture in the uplands, but it also results in biodiversity loss and environmental degradation and disturbs the peaceful life of the indigenous people. We discuss the traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) preserved in daily practices and the present types of rubber plantations and suggest the application of TEK, in particular, the indigenous land-use experience to rubber cultivation, in order to promote sustainability in local economic development and ecological well-being.

AB This paper evaluates the impact of plantation monocultures of fast-growing exotic species and indigenous tree species on nutrient cycling in West Africa. The rates of nutrient uptake and recycling to the soil vary with tree species and ecological zones. In general, single species tree plantations immobilise soil nutrients faster and return less nutrients to the soil than native forest and savanna vegetation. Hence, they deplete soil nutrients. Plantations of an indigenous species, Terminalia ivorensis, exert less deleterious effects on soil nutrient status than exotics such as teak and gmelina. Owing to their effects in destabilising the nutrient cycle in forest and savanna ecosystems, the plantation monocultures of fast-growing tree species are not likely to be sustainable in the long term. The widespread adoption of plantation forestry as an alternative to the natural regeneration of native forests as a strategy for increasing the wood resources of humid tropics is, therefore, indicative of an uncritical acceptance of the view that monocultural tree plantations are sustainable. There is need for caution in the rush to convert native ecosystems, especially rain forests, into plantations of fast-growing exotic trees.

   agroforestry; conservation; biodiversity capital
AB Despite the declining volumes of biotic resources flowing from natural ecosystems, no sustainable rural-based programmes have been put in place to stabilize habitats and diversify products to meet the needs and livelihoods of forest-dependent communities. Nevertheless, there is increasing evidence that agricultural expansion and rising demands for forest resources are increasingly depleting the forests. Within these extremes, daily used wild plants that sustain rural communities are under threat of over-exploitation.
   This study identified major daily used wild plants in rural environments, examined their use categories, and suggested suitable ways to conserve these plants in order to improve the biodiversity capital and stabilize rural livelihoods. Results of data analysis showed that: (i) about 96 species of wild plants were in daily use for food, energy, medicine, shelter and cultural festivals; (ii) the management and utilization of daily used wild plants were based on traditional knowledge that had become inefficient as a result of resource scarcity and loss of habitats. In these circumstances, resource utilisation is leading to the loss of species; (iii) the resource users were willing to conserve wild plants on private lands to meet their ways of life. The success of wild plant conservation however, hinges on the provision of infrastructures for smallholder farmers who are willing to plant trees on their lands. There is urgent need for those responsible for conserving the forests and the environment (Federal Ministry of Environment) to design and implement suitable programmes that will accommodate the needs of the rural people in conserving wild plants in daily use in the country.

DT Article
DE stakeholder management; stakeholder strategy; stakeholder map;
   stakeholder coalition; conservation; forest; deforestation; Cambodia
AB Although widely used in the development area, the stakeholder concept has its origins in the field of management. Stakeholder management consists of understanding the actions of stakeholders, and devising strategies to ethically and effectively deal with them. The paper presents a stakeholder management framework for conservation and illustrates it with a study of deforestation in Cambodia. The framework comprises three steps: stakeholder analysis, stakeholder mapping, and development of stakeholder management strategies. The exercise shows the existence of a strong coalition of stakeholders whose main goal is to exploit the forest resources of Cambodia without any regard for sustainability. The efforts of the international community to control deforestation have focused on a reform of forest concessions. Consequently, several primary stakeholders have been ignored. These include local communities, the Royal Cambodian Armed Forces, the Ministry of Environment and Cambodia's neighbours. The paper concludes with strategic management guidance for donor intervention. Unless a comprehensive stakeholder management framework is adopted, the forests of Cambodia will rapidly succumb to destruction.

AB Water-based development is a catalyst for economic, social and environmental changes. Currently, this development is framed in the discourse of sustainability, based on such concepts as participation, gender equity and the containment of environmental and social impacts. Policies concerning these changes are implemented via state institutions, often in tandem with private institutions, both commercial (banks and businesses) and non-profit (universities and non-governmental organizations). The success of sustainable integrated development depends on the ability ( these institutions to incorporate the concepts of sustainability, to adapt to changing environments and to optimize co-operation with other institutions. However, these institutions may vary greatly in their interpretation of the sustainability, discourse, as well as in their capacity to implement those concepts consistently. This paper presents some of the current issues related to the need for capacity building and multisectoral co-ordination in order to ensure ongoing sustainable development (SD) where most, if not all, actors have a critical understanding of development discourse and are able to apply the concepts of sustainability in their normal operations. These issues are then discussed in the context of the experience of the South-eastern Anatolia Project Regional Development Administration in introducing SD to south-eastern Turkey.

AB The world is moving towards a dangerous situation of societal instability due to our failing ability to manage the life support, system on the human-dominated planet. Contributing to this problem are inherited and biased ways of thinking, originating from the 17th century and based on fragmentation and sectorization. A fundamental shift in thinking is therefore needed urgently, to better bridge, the partial realities addressed tip until now. Awareness has to be built up around the need for societal adaptation to hydroclimatic constraints, and strong enough institutions must be developed, capable of supporting unpopular decisions. A proper conceptualization is badly needed of the life support system in a science of 'environmentology', in which water is acknowledged as the bloodstream of the biosphere. Both land/water linkages and water/ecosystem linkages will have to be properly entered into an integrated and catchment-based land/water/ecosystem approach. The goal has to meet both societal needs and environmental sustainabhity conditions. Attention will have to be paid to all water, both liquid blue water, supporting humanity and aquatic ecosystems, and vapour-form green water, supporting terrestrial ecosystems, agriculture and forestry. The economic resource will have to be seen as the precipitation over the basin. Both water-dependent and water-impacting activities and ecosystems in the basin have to be analysed. Joint attention will have to be paid to environmental security, water security and food security. Methods for compromise building between incompatible water-related interests and ecosystems will have to be developed. Societal acceptance will depend on awareness campaigns-make water everybody's business-and has to be secured by participation. A new ethics of hydrosolidarity will have to be developed between those living upstream and those living downstream in a river basin.

AB Along with being a basic human need, water is also a basic constituent for the survival of eco-systems of which people and their cultures are important components. The water resources distribution in India, predominantly an agrarian economy, is highly asymmetric and has been accompanied by severe decline in per-capita water availability during the past 50 years, with agriculture being the maximum water user, leading to over-exploitation of ground water and steadily depleting water tables along with a heavy energy bill. Gujarat State falls in a water stressed zone of the country and is also the victim of intra-state asymmetric water availability leading to an unwanted socio-economic disparity, with the following results: a poor literacy rate in water-deficit districts; concentration of industry and housing in regions with better water resources endowment; and demographic change, e.g. the shift of the prime workforce from drought-prone districts to water-surplus districts. This in turn denies the right to life, development, health, food, education and work for these migrant communities. To ensure a balanced development when there is less than one acre per capita of cultivable landholding and over 14 000 villages out of 18563 are suffering from water scarcity, there alternative but to transfer water from surplus to scarce areas of the state. This paper aims to raise some critical questions on water issues, food security, energy viability, rights of people, and most importantly, water security in the context of sustainable development.

TI Securing ownership in aquaculture development by alternative technology:
   A case-study of the Saguling reservoir, West Java
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WATER RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB Development projects requiring displacement of people often result in their impoverishment; however, sustainable resettlement programmes can be devised with the introduction of alternative technologies that will enable the resettlers to exploit new productive opportunities. The majority of resettlers in the Saguling reservoir lacked the capital to invest in fisheries development and subsequently alternative technologies were introduced, enabling them to engage in aquaculture, but without success. This paper aims to examine the reasons why the introduction of alternative technology failed to establish in the Saguling reservoir, using data obtained through a literature review, interviews and afield survey. The analysis emphasizes seven factors that are crucial in the evaluation of the success of technology transfer and diffusion efforts in general.

AB The development and management of irrigation, drainage and flood protection schemes are confronted with rapidly changing conditions, especially in the least and emerging developing countries. Issues at stake are the need to increase food production significantly, the development of water shortages, pollution of water resources, the increased requirement for flood management and flood protection schemes, the need for sustainable development and possible impacts of climate changes.
   In this paper focus is on how these issues may play a role in the development of irrigation, drainage and flood protection measures and schemes under different climatological and socio-economic conditions. In line with this the Strategy for Action of the International Commission on Irrigation and Drainage (ICID) is presented, showing the contributions the ICID is making in answer to these challenges.

AB This paper is based on the results of a one-year study and analysis of irrigated agriculture in Indonesia (1997-98). The overall purpose of the study was to review past policy approaches to irrigation development and management, evaluate their effectiveness, and recommend options for the future. The results show that in spite of large government expenditures in irrigation development, crop productivity (cropping intensity and yields) has remained stagnant through the 1990s. The financial and political crises of 1998 have further led to mass poverty, especially in rural Indonesia. The paper concludes that the Indonesian policy makers must once again restore high-quality rural growth by promoting sustainable uses of land and water resources. It suggests appropriate policy reforms and programs that can promote the desired productivity of irrigated agriculture in Indonesia. Copyright (C) 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI Exploring basin-scale salinity problems using a simplified water
   accounting model: The example Zayandeh Rud basin, Iran
SO IRRIGATION AND DRAINAGE
LA English
DT Article
DE irrigation; salinity; spatial scale; simulation model
AB Water scarcity and salinization are major threats to sustainable irrigation in Iran as well as other parts of the world. Irrigation schemes are part of a basin and as such, irrigation research must be conducted in a basin context. For the Zayandeh Rud basin in central Iran, a simplified water and salinity basin model (WSBM) was developed for a quick analysis of river basin processes. First the model was calibrated and used for current and past water resources analyses. Despite the simplicity of the model, observed and simulated streamflows were similar, proving that the model could be used for scenario analyses. The first scenario was set up to analyze the effect of more efficient irrigation techniques on the basin water resources, where it was assumed that farmers would never accept lower water allocations if they invest in these more efficient techniques. As a consequence of this, return flows will decrease, resulting in less water available for downstream users. It was concluded that the effect on the downstream irrigation schemes was dramatic, with a 22% decrease in yield. Obviously, upstream yields will increase. A second scenario was defined where the effect of an increase of water extraction for the town of Esfahan was evaluated. In terms of basin-scale water quantity aspects this increased extraction is negligible as extractions are relatively low and return flows are high. The last scenario was developed to study the additional releases required from the reservoir to provide sufficient water for expansion of the tail-end Rudasht irrigation scheme. If no restriction is imposed on water quality, additional releases from the reservoir are limited. However, if salinity levels are not to exceed 2 dS m(-1), mean annual water release requirements from the reservoir will increase from 52 to 64 m(3) s(-1), and peak requirements during the irrigation season will increase from 85 to 112 m(3) s(-1). Finally, it was concluded that the methodology and the model developed were useful for a swift and transparent analysis of past, current and future water and salt resources, and to perform scenario analyses.

TI Subsurface drainage design and management in irrigated areas of
   Australia
SO IRRIGATION SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
AB Subsurface drainage to protect irrigated cropping has been practised in some areas of Australia since the 1920s. and most irrigation districts have large land areas protected by some form of subsurface drainage. Across the irrigated areas, a broad spectrum of practices were developed that suited the conditions at the time of development. This paper assesses the performance of these subsurface drainage systems in terms of long-term sustainability of irrigated agriculture, based on the results of a detailed review of all the subsurface drainage systems in use in Australian irrigation areas. The long-term sustainability of irrigated agriculture depends upon controlling the salinity levels in the crop root zone and maintaining the ability to dispose of drainage water. This requires that subsurface drainage systems are efficient in terms of removing the minimum amount of water with the lowest salinity possible, given the existing conditions, while still maintaining crop productivity. Analysis of the current drainage system operation showed that many systems were draining greater volumes of water than designed for, leading to excessively high leaching fractions, and reduced irrigation water-use efficiency. The salt load removed by these systems was also often found to be far greater than the salt applied by irrigation, indicating a mining of stored salt. This is necessary from a salinised root zone but not if the salt is from below the root zone. The extra salt load above that required to maintain a salt balance in the root zone leads to increased difficulties in the disposal of the drainage water due to downstream impacts. Suggestions are discussed for adaptive management and new design considerations that may help make subsurface drainage more efficient, leading to reduced negative downstream effects and reduced costs of disposal.

AB The effects of five stake weights (50, 63, 75, 88 and 100 g) of three cassava cultivars (TMS 30572, TMS 91934 and NR 8083) on the growth and yield of cassava were studied for 2 years (1992/93 and 1993/94) in Nigeria. The leaf area index (LAI), crop growth rate (CGR), net assimilation rate (NAR), leaf area duration (LAD), harvest yield and harvest index (HI) were dependent on the weight of stake planted and were greatest at the stake weight of 88 g (875 kg/ha) irrespective of cassava cultivar. Variations in LAI, LAD and HI of stake weights between 75 and 100 g were non-significant. The profusely branching cassava cultivars, TMS 30572 and NR 8083, achieved greater LAI, CGR, NAR and LAD relative to the sparsely branching cultivar, TMS 91934. The significant growth and yield differences among the stake weights with the optimum at a stake weight of 88 g (875 kg/ha) indicates the need to adopt this stake weight for sustainable and improved growth and yield in cassava production.

AB 1. Several albatross species, including the wandering albatross Diomedea exulans, have shown marked declines in abundance throughout their range. These seabirds are frequently taken as by-catch in longline fisheries and this mortality has been implicated in the population declines.
   2. We developed a deterministic, density-dependent, age-structured model for assessing the effects of longlining on wandering albatross populations. We used demographic data from field studies at South Georgia and the Crozet Islands, data on albatross abundance from 1960 to 1995, and reported effort data from the tuna longline fisheries south of 30 degrees S. to model estimated by-catch levels and other population parameters in the model.
   3. The model used two alternative assumptions about patterns of at-sea distribution of wandering albatross (uniform between 30 degrees S-60 degrees S; proportional to the distribution of longline fishing effort between these latitudes).
   4. Our model was able to predict reasonably closely the observed data from the Crozet Islands wandering albatross population, but the fit to the South Georgia population was substantially poorer. This probably reflects: (i) greater overlap in the Indian Ocean than in the Atlantic Ocean between the main areas of tuna longline fishing and the foraging ranges of wandering albatrosses from the Crozet Islands and South Georgia, respectively; and (ii) greater impact of poorly documented longline fisheries, especially the tuna fisheries in the south Atlantic and the Patagonian toothfish Dissostichus eleginoides fishery. within the foraging range of wandering albatrosses from South Georgia.
   5. The model results suggest that the marked decline in both populations, and subsequent recovery of the Crozet Islands population (but not the continued decline of the South Georgia population), can be explained by the tuna longline by-catch. They further indicate that populations may be able to sustain some level of incidental take. However., the likely under-reporting of fishing effort (especially in non-tuna longline fisheries) and the delicate balance between a sustainable and unsustainable level of by-catch for these long-lived populations suggest great caution in any application of such findings.

AB Plant allelopathy offers hope as an additional means of weed control in modern agriculture. Its mechanisms and molecular basis are not yet well understood. Research on the chemical basis for allelopathy has often been hindered by the complexity of plant and soil matrices, making it difficult to track active compounds. Recent improvements in the cost and capabilities of bench-top chromatography-mass spectrometry instruments make these tools more powerful and more widely available to assist with molecular studies conducted in today's expanding field. Such instrumental techniques are herein recommended as economically efficient means of advancing the rigor of allelopathy research and assisting the development of a better understanding of the chemical basis for the allelopathy phenomenon.

AB 1 Efforts to understand and forecast tong-term forest dynamics are often hindered by limited data on mortality rates and longevity of trees in older stands. In this study, mortality data were analysed from 11-year permanent plot records in 10 tracts of hemlock-hardwood forest with little past human disturbance in the upper Great Lakes region, USA.
   2 We compared tree size-mortality trends in mature stands (canopy trees mostly 100-170 years old) with those in true old-growth stands (canopy trees mostly 200-350 years old). Stem sections were also cut from 71 recently fallen trees to determine average and maximum longevity for canopy trees of each species.
   3 All five mature stands had descending monotonic size-mortality trends for shade-tolerant species, with low rates of mortality (generally much less than 1% per year) for trees > 18 cm d.b.h. In contrast, all five old-growth stands had U-shaped mortality functions, with annual mortality rates of 1.5-2.9% for trees > 66 cm d.b.h. These size-mortality trends are biologically consistent with 'rotated sigmoid' size distributions observed for major species, although mortality rates were nearly size-invariant for trees between 18 and 66 cm d.b.h.
   4 Both late-successional and gap-phase species had fairly high mortality rates for saplings (2-10 cm d.b.h.) of 25-34% over the 11-year period, which suggests that size distributions with moderately steep negative slopes are needed to compensate for mortality and ensure population sustainability.
   5 Average age at time of death for canopy trees was 216 years for sugar maple (Acer saccharum) and 301 years for hemlock (Tsuga canadensis), suggesting that the biological transition from mature to old-growth forest probably doesn't occur on these sites until a stand age of about 180-250 years.

AB Our intention is to present a growth model with an environmental resource which has its own regeneration process. The stock of this resource serves as a source of utility and an input to production. We also intend to introduce a negative externality caused by a pollution flow which we assume to be proportional to production. In the context of this model, it is shown that, by using the utility level of the Green Golden Rule as a generalization of the Ramsey's bliss point for solving an optimal growth problems with a zero discount rate, an optimal path converges to the Green Golden Rule configuration.

SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT

AB Adopting a new paradigm for natural resource and environmental policy that emphasises continuous change, adaptation and learning demands a new approach to evaluation to enable improvements in the way these initiatives contribute to sustainable resource use. Evaluation is fundamental to identifying change, supporting an adaptive approach that is flexible enough to meet the challenge of change, and enabling learning at individual, community, institutional and policy levels. Based on a consideration of changing approaches to natural resource management (NRM) policy and observations and experiences in the practical assessment of on-the-ground initiatives, the authors develop a set of principles for evaluation in NRM that. (a) addresses evaluation from a systems perspective, (b) links objective to consequence, (c) considers the fundamental assumptions and hypotheses that underpin core policy or program objectives, (d) is grounded in the natural resource, policy/institutional, economic, socio-cultural and technological contexts of implementation in practice, (e) establishes practical and valid evaluation criteria by which change can be monitored and assessed, (f) involves methodological pluralism including both quantitative and qualitative, methods to ensure rigour and comprehensiveness in assessment, and (g) integrates different disciplinary perspectives (i.e. social, economic, environmental, policy and technological). The paper develops a systems-based evaluation framework that incorporates these principles and also recognises the multiple levels and nested nature of NRM policy, namely. problem characterisation, policy formulation and intent, program logic, and on-ground implementation. Finally, we demonstrate its utility through application to three contrasting Australian case studies: a community-based Integrated Catchment Management policy implementation; a resource information delivery system; and the development of a Decision Support System.

AB This paper applies a floating-point genetic algorithm to an insurance model in which the principals who underwrite insurance contracts cannot observe the risk characteristics of the agents who sign those contracts. Under perfect rationality, the equilibria of this model are analogous to those in Rothschild and Stiglitz (1976). The learning version of the model exhibits interesting transition dynamics as well as novel outcomes. When the learning model converges to the equilibrium from the model with perfect rationality, pooling contracts break down over time and the set of contracts bifurcates, with one group of principals serving high-risk agents and another group serving low-risk agents. When there are relatively few low-risk agents in the market, the economy converges to contracts that provide full insurance for high-risk agents, while low-risk agents are not served at all. When there are relatively few high-risk agents in the market, some types of pooling contracts are sustainable. These last two results are at odds with the outcomes under models of perfect rationality.

AB The effective application of genetic information in fisheries management strategies implies political goal setting taking both conservation and fisheries management into account. The concept of sustainable use as set out by the Convention on Biological Diversity offers a valuable starting point in this respect, since the criterion for it is defined as the maintenance of genetic diversity within each species. However, strategic decisions are also needed on the practical level, where the actual genetic information can be taken into account. Genetic factors, such as glacial differentiation, the postglacial genetic structure of populations, gene flow levels and the probability of the existence of adaptive differences, have an effect on the formation of conservation and management units and on the long-term strategy for the sustainable use of a species. The Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) in the Baltic Sea area is treated here as an example of a complicated management problem with a highly hierarchical genetic structure associated with marked loss of naturally reproductive stocks, extensive hatchery production and an effective international offshore fishery. The implications of genetic factors for the conservation and management strategy of the Baltic salmon is discussed in the light of the goals set by the Convention on Biological Diversity, the Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks Agreement, the Habitats Directive of the European Union and the International Baltic Sea Fishery Commission.

TI Plantation certification and genetic engineering: FSC's ban on research
   is counterproductive
SO JOURNAL OF FORESTRY
LA English
DT Article
DE biotechnology; entomology and pathology; ethics; genetics; silviculture
AB Genetic engineering, also called genetic modification (GM), is the isolation, recombinant modification, and asexual transfer of genes. It has been banned in forest plantations certified by the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) regardless of the source of genes, traits imparted, or whether for research or commercial use. We review the methods and goa Is of tree genetic engineering research and argue that FSC's ban on research is counterproductive because it makes it difficult for certified companies to participate in the field research needed to assess the value and biosafety of GM trees. Genetic modification could be important for translating new discoveries about tree genomes into improved growth, quality, sustainability, and pest resistance.

TI Engineered lumber products - Taking their place in the global market
SO JOURNAL OF FORESTRY
LA English
DT Article
DE composites; economics; industry; international forestry
AB World demand for engineered lumber products is driven by a shift to performance-based building codes; the changing nature of the softwood fiber supply; worldwide demand for affordable housing; and advances in resin technology and wood conversion systems. From structural composite lumber to prefabricated wood l-joists and glulam, these products extend the forest resource by allowing higher product recoveries and using conversion technology that facilitates broader use of underutilized species and sizes. They also enable higher stumpage prices as markets are created for a wider range of species, grades, and sizes of timber. And sustainable forestry objectives are enhanced as markets for small-diameter, low-grade fiber are developed throughout the world.

AB Mid-century requirements for carbon free energy are daunting. Perhaps fusion could play a vital role. One of rather few possible solutions for sustainable development might be the fission fusion hybrid coupled with transmutation of the long lived actinide wastes. This paper suggests such an alternate development path for fusion, one that could lead to the production of multi-terawatts of carbon free power by 2050.

ID CONTROLLED TRIAL; YOUNG-CHILDREN
AB This report summarizes the current knowledge on the effects of zinc supplementation on the management of acute diarrhoea. All published and unpublished studies on this topic, conducted in hospitals and in the community, were reviewed. Based on the results of this review, it is concluded that there is now enough evidence demonstrating the efficacy of zinc supplementation on the clinical course of diarrhoea, with regard to the severity and duration of the episode. However, the meeting also concluded that effectiveness studies to assess the feasibility, sustainability, and cost-effectiveness of different strategies for delivering zinc supplementation should be undertaken.

TI Use of terrestrial invertebrates as indicators of the ecological
   sustainability of forest management under the Montreal Process
SO JOURNAL OF INSECT CONSERVATION
LA English
DT Article
DE indicators; ecological sustainability; Montreal Process; forest
   management; invertebrates; conservation; coarse woody debris; dead
   standing trees
AB Twelve nations involved in boreal or temperate forest management are committed to reporting on indicators under the Montreal Process as a mechanism for assessing progress towards sustainable forest management. For fauna, invertebrates are often considered too poorly known and diverse to include in sustainability indicator reporting. The alternative view, that no monitoring of sustainability can be considered adequate without inclusion of some invertebrate species, is espoused in this paper. The microhabitats of soil and litter, foliage and canopy, bark and branch, dead standing trees and coarse woody debris are highlighted as relevant in the context of determining the impacts of forest management on invertebrates and for selecting 'representative' species. It is argued that a selection of those species from each of the key microhabitats that are restricted to later stages of succession should be monitored. This could be complemented by a selection of easily monitored species from a range of functional groups as a means of endeavouring to pick up adverse impacts not foreseen on the basis of present knowledge. In the longer term, habitat indices (developed from predictive models of fauna habitat) should be used to monitor the occurrence of indicator species across the broader landscape, rather than at specific sites where monitoring of species takes place. Most countries would be in a position to select indicator species and commence monitoring for some key microhabitats (e. g. soil and litter). However, further research is needed in many countries before indicator species can be selected for other key microhabitats (e. g. coarse woody debris).

AB The terms "soil health" or "soil quality" as applied to agroecosystems refer to the ability of soil to support and sustain crop growth while maintaining environmental quality. High-quality soils have the following characteristics: (i) a sufficient, but not excess, supply of nutrients; (ii) good structure (tilth); (iii) sufficient depth for rooting and drainage; (iv) good internal drainage; (v) low populations of plant disease and parasitic organisms; (vi) high populations of organisms that promote plant growth; (vii) low weed pressure; (viii) no chemicals that might harm the plant; (ix) resistance to being degraded; and (x) resilience following an episode of degradation. Management intended to improve soil health involves creatively combining a number of practices that enhance the soil's biological, chemical, and physical suitability for crop production. The most important general strategy is to add plentiful quantities of organic matter-including crop and cover crop residues, manures, and composts. Other important strategies include better crop rotations, reducing tillage and keeping the soil surface covered with living and dead residue, reducing compaction by decreasing heavy equipment traffic, and using best nutrient management practices. Practices that enhance soil quality frequently reduce plant pest pressures.

AB During 1998, we initiated an on-board observer program to gain a better understanding of spatial and temporal patterns of catch and effort in the blacklip abalone fishery of Victoria, Australia. Although average catch per unit effort (CPUE) for this fishery has been increasing, there has also been significant spatial contraction of the fishing grounds away from reefs of low productivity as a consequence of quota introduction during 1988 to 1989. It is this shift away from reefs of low productivity rather than an increase in abalone abundance that is responsible for the trend in CPUE. From our on-board observations, divers do not operate in an area if they believe that they will not meet their daily catch expectations; they have a relatively high catch rate threshold for deciding when to shift to another reef. Catch rates per bag of abalone are several times higher than the daily reported CPUE rates, but vary substantially. We conclude that the incentive to maintain high catch rate thresholds for cessation of fishing has led to patterns of rotation of effort at the reef scale that tend to mitigate against high rates of exploitation. This has provided an effective tier of fine-scale self-governance below that controlled by management regulations. However, contemporary changes in the fishery, such as reductions in the number of divers who own access entitlements and their levels of experience, may lead to reduced catch rate thresholds and unfavorable patterns of fishing behavior. There is also a tendency for divers who have recently entered the fishery to concentrate their effort on shallower reefs for reasons of health and safety. Although there is no evidence to date that the over-all status of Victorian abalone stocks has been compromised by these changes, manager, need to be aware that regulations affect diver behavior and that it is the divers not the resource that is managed. Our studies reinforce the importance of identifying and promoting behaviors among divers that are desirable in terms of sustainable production within the context of contemporary management strategies.

DE quotas; management; weight loss; air exposure; abalone
AB Regulations forming part of the abalone quota management system in Victoria, Australia require that abalone processors notify fisheries authorities of quantities of abalone consigned from commercial divers within 25 h of landing. The regulations also require that the abalone are to be landed whole in the shell, and transported and stored in sealed bins until confirmation of official notification. Although the bins cannot be opened before notification, the 25-h limit for notification provides a window of opportunity to make potential gains through weight loss in those abalone destined for canning. This arises because notified weights, rather than weights estimated upon landing, are used to decrement the quota allocations of individual divers, I investigated the potential for post-harvest weight loss by subjecting abalone to three experimental treatments selected to simulate a range of possible transport and regimes. My results demonstrate that substantial weight loss can occur in whole abalone during both ambient and refrigerated storage. Loss of weight in abalone during storage results from the release of water and body fluid associated with physiological responses to hypoxic stress caused by exposure to air. In Victoria, about 60% of the landed catch is used to produce canned product. Because of the observed weight losses during storage, divers supplying abalone for canning have to harvest more abalone to achieve their quotas than those supplying abalone for live export. Losses in weight of 10-20% observed during this study equate to a harvest of 6-12% (350,000-700,000 abalone) more than the total allowable catches. Harvesting these additional quantities of abalone may exceed desired fishing mortalities for long-term population sustainability. If beach weights were deducted from quotas, then this problem could be resolved.

ID HALIOTIS-RUBRA; BLACKLIP ABALONE; MANAGEMENT; ABUNDANCE; RECRUITMENT
AB A variety of quantitative measures have been applied as reference points in the management of Australian abalone fisheries. In New South Wales changes in legal-sized and mature biomass will trigger management responses, in South Australia catch rates, size composition, and abundance indices provide target reference points, and in Tasmania, catch rates and catches have been used to provide triggers for Management decisions. However, Victoria and Western Australia have yet to determine their reference points for abalone stock assessment. Victoria has been developing length-based fisheries models similar to those applied in New South Wales and is now confronted with the necessity of converting model outputs into decision-making criteria. A Victorian fishery management plan is also under development in which reference points will be specified within a risk-based matrix of catch control rules for quota adjustments, Recent biodiversity conservation legislation, compelling fisheries management agencies in Australia to demonstrate that export fisheries managed under their jurisdictions are ecologically sustainable, has increased the urgency to establish these reference points. The application of this legislation draws upon the "Principles and Criteria for Sustainable Fishing" of the Marine Stewardship Council in London, We considered a range of alternative measures for reference points that may be useful as triggers and targets applied in a stochastic framework for management decisions. Although not a modeling output, one of the more consistent nonbiological signals of localized depletion in the Victorian fishery relates to spatial allocation of effort at the scale of reef complexes. Reductions in annual effort applied to a particular reef system invariably precede significant decreases in abundance indices with typically large coefficients of variation and in catch rates characterized by hyperstability. Victorian abalone divers have high daily catch expectations and allocate their effort accordingly. Empirical reference points, such as effort allocations, provide utility for Fishery management and can be readily assimilated and adopted by industry. Consequently, we conclude that in addition to modeling outputs, maintenance of reef-scale effort allocation and daily catch expectations should form part of a suite of fishery performance indicators and target criteria for the Victorian blacklip abalone fishery.

   model
AB A deterministic age-structured model is developed for use in estimating resource dynamics parameters and projecting biomass trends for the South African abalone Halliotis midae, This constitutes the first quantitative approach applied to the management of this commercially valuable resource. The model focuses on one of seven commercial fishing zones, zone C, because particular concerns have been expressed about the status of the resource in this region, inter alia because of the considerable catches taken by the illegal fishing sector. The modeling approach is summarized, and some preliminary results from a single application of the model are given. Model parameters including the pre-exploitation spawning biomass B-o(sp), the present annual poaching take CPmax and the natural mortality M, are estimated by fitting the model to CPUE data for the period 1980 to 1998, Fishery-Independent Abalone Survey (FIAS) abundance data as well as several years of catch-ut-age data for each of various components of the fishery. The CPUE data are standardized using a general linear model, and zone C is split into two "linked" areas, a "poached" and "nonpoached" subarea with common resource dynamics parameters but separate fishing histories, This was necessary because of substantial differences in both the relative abundance trends and catch-at-age information for these two areas. Model results suggest that the resource in the "poached" and "nonpoached" areas of zone C is presently at ca. 1% and 85%, respectively of its pre-exploitation level (B-o(sp) = 3,360 and 1,580 tons, respectively). The model-estimated annual poaching catch for zone C from 1995 to 1998 (240 tons) exceeds the annual commercial catch in zone C over this period. The model indicates that the maximum sustainable yield (MSY) is reduced by more than one-third if catches include the proportion of animals substantially smaller than the minimum legal-size limit thought to be taken by poachers. Model predictions should be interpreted with caution, because more work needs to be done to improve and evaluate the confidence that can be attached to model predictions and to refine the structure and assumptions of the model. A number of associated suggestion are presented.

AB The greenlip (Haliotis laevigata) abalone fishery in the Western and Central Zones of South Australia comprises about 74 distinct metapopulations, Although the total catch has been maintained since 1979, analysis of catch and effort data for the two zones at a fine scale in 49 map code areas shows that 39 areas are in decline; of these, 28 areas, with declines exceeding 50%, are considered serious. In the Western Zone, the proportional catch from 23 inshore reefs has declined from similar to69 to similar to34% of the total catch over 20 y of fishing whereas, that of 10 distant reefs has increased from similar to26 to similar to50% of the total over the same period. Fishing mortality is 0.4-0.6 on inshore reefs and 0.2-0.4 on distant ones, indicating serious maldistribution of effort. The frequency of declining populations reaching the 50% decline point peaked in the years 1989 to 1990 a subset of the same group of populations reaching the 80% decline point peaked in 1995 to 1996, indicating a continuing decline trajectory, despite quota imposition and reduction. Multiple regression analysis of the proportional rate of decline of 38 populations in the Western Zone showed that the rate of decline was inversely correlated with distance from port and with a closure index that measures the extent to which the population is bounded by land. The closure index is considered to estimate crudely the extent to which coastal topography retains larvae within the population. Comparison of the spatial extent of fishing areas in eight populations mapped in 1978 to 1979 and again in 1996 to 1999 showed strong spatial contraction matching the decline in catch, Spatial contraction occurred from deeper to shallow water leaving relict subpopulations around headlands and in bays, consistent with inferences on the effect of coastal topography on abalone larval retention, In the Central Zone, with six divers and 12 reefs fully fished over a shorter time period, the declines are less certain and less severe. The catches of five reefs have declined by >50% and increased substantially on one remaining productive reef. An overfishing hypothesis best explains the long-term decline in the catch of many reefs and the transfer of fishing to distant or remaining reefs.
   The history of management is reviewed and shows that, over the lifetime of the fishery, management has moved from control by,government with little consultation with industry in 1967 toward self-management with endorsement by government from about 1995. Since 1995, management has been unresponsive to declines in the fishery, and possible reasons are explored. We advocate application of the precautionary approach by management at the scale of the metapopulation to arrest the declines and the establishment of recovery plans for areas in serious decline.

AB Background. Effect of nasal breathing without and with nostril dilatation on sustainability of moderate exercise (75% (V) over dot O-2max) and selected respiratory variables were examined. Methods. Experimental design: nine healthy male subjects completed three randomly assigned exhaustive treadmill runnings under three breathing conditions: (i) oronasal breathing (CON), (ii) nasal breathing with external nasal dilator strip (NBENDS), and (iii) nasal breathing with fake nasal strip (NBFNS).
   Results. Pre-exercise peak nasal inspiratory flow was increased with NBENDS but not with NBFNS. Pre-exercise nasal 12-sec maximum voluntary ventilation with NBENDS was greater than that with NBFNS while both were less than oronasal value. Exercise time to exhaustion in NBFNS trial, which was 23.6 +/-6.7 % less than the CON value, increased 31.9 +/- 12.3 % under NBENDS condition. During exercise at exhaustion, although the difference in ventilation among all trials was not significant, lower breathing frequency in NBFNS and NBENDS exercises and higher end-tidal CO2 tension in NBFNS trial were found in comparison to CON values. Ratings of perceived magnitude of breathing effort (RPMBE) and exertion (RPE) at exhaustion were similar among all trials. However, RPMBE at exhaustion during NBFNS exercise was higher than that at the iso-time point during CON and NBENDS exercises. Similar result in RPE was found between NBFNS and CON exercises. After exercise, maximum inspiratory and expiratory pressures reduced. The reduction of each variable was similar among the three trials.
   Conclusions. Nasal breathing reduces the sustainability of moderate exercise measured under oronasal breathing condition. Nostril dilatation increases the capacity to sustain moderate exercise under nasal breathing condition.

AB The existence of the Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area (WHA) is not only a testimony to its undoubted outstanding universal natural and cultural significance, but also a reflection of a national feeling that its wild places and wild rivers should be maintained for future generations, rather than expended in hydroelectric, forestry, and pastoral development. The issue in the establishment and expansion of the WHA was economic development or none. In the cases of power, wood, and wool production the nays succeeded convincingly, The coalition that promoted the WHA consisted largely of wilderness recreationalists and natural scientists, leading to a feeling, and partial actuality, of dispossession on the part of those recreationalists, such as shooters, anglers, off-road vehicle enthusiasts, and horse riders, who defined themselves as traditional users. Recreationalists who were within the coalition, mainly bushwalkers, climbers, cavers, and rafters, have had increasing effects on the natural values of the WHA, to the degree to which limitation of some of their activities seems necessary to maintain WHA values. Yet, any such controls have been strongly resisted. Tourism developers, traditional recreationalists, and many coalition recreationalists all wish to maintain or increase activities that are in conflict with the maintenance of the values of the WHA and/or with each other. The current management plan attempted to resolve these conflicts through compromises that do not substantially affect the values, but which lack any effective mechanisms for accountability on the part of the management agency and its minister. Despite a prolonged and complicated developmental approval process, there is no means whereby the public may appeal a ministerial decision on the grounds that it is in conflict with the general objectives of the plan. This is particularly alarming given progressive commercialisation of activities in the WHA. The WHA will continue to effectively conserve and present its values if the general public sympathy for its maintenance is expressed through an effective appeals process. There is also no reason why the minority of developers and the public who are not sympathetic to all aspects of the maintenance of its values, should not gain some benefits from the area, within the constraints of ecological sustainability.

ID CONSERVATION
AB Ecosystem conservation in southern Africa (in particular South Africa, Zimbabwe, Botswana, and Namibia) is characterised by high levels of past and present conflicts. During the apartheid and colonial periods indigenous people lost their rights to use land and natural resources. Protected areas were seldom established in consultation with local communities, and, between 1900 and 1990, millions of citizens were forcibly removed from areas proclaimed as nature reserves, national parks, or game reserves. Conservation conflicts in southern Africa escalated because of: i) the many and complicated issues at stake; ii) the large investment by communities and conservationists in the main causes of the conflict - land and natural resources; iii) communities and conservationists harming each other, rather than striving towards common goals; iv) negative perceptions on both sides; v) weak and infrequent communication between role players; vi) the hostile relations between them; and vii) the use of violent and coercive tactics on both sides.
   In the late 1980s and early 1990s a wave of democracy swept across southern Africa, and with it came new policies that allowed communities better access to natural resources, called for their participation in protected area management, and facilitated the restitution of land from which they had been forcibly removed. This resulted in a number of tangible and intangible gains for conservation and communities, respectively. The short-term effect on the underlying causes of conflict was positive. Relations and communication improved, communities and conservationists identified common goals, and tactics became less hostile than before.
   There are still, however, a number of causes for concern. Both parties now have even more invested in the new agreements than before, and the number of complicating issues has increased rather than decreased. New conflicts and power struggles are emerging, this time between different factions in communities and conservation agencies, respectively. The high expectations on both sides that the new approach will yield significant tangible short-term benefits are a further cause for concern. Experience and provisional research have shown that the financial benefits from wildlife, forestry, and tourism are mostly overestimated.
   The conventional assumption, that devolution of power to the smallest local group will inevitably result in good governance and sustainable resource management, could be flawed. It is essential for government to recognise this problem and identify appropriate strategies such as mediation services at the local level, the creation of new, locally made rules and their enforcement, engaging in collaborative research with local communities, and adopting adaptive management approaches, characterised by regular monitoring and flexibility. Relying on the simplistic and romantic principle that traditional knowledge is pure and intrinsically valid, and creating unrealistic expectations about the benefits of co-management, could invite new conflicts that may be more difficult to manage than the tensions of the colonial and apartheid eras.

AB HOW DO WE MAKE a good library building? It all begins with an understanding of the library's mission. From there, we generate ideas through needs assessments, focus groups, and interviews with current and potential users. It also helps if the design process involves peer institutions such as schools, museums, and community centers. And all designs must be presented to the public at community forums and similar gatherings. To this familiar process we would add a new, equally important factor: a commitment to creating sustainable libraries.

AB Applied macroeconomists have tested for the government intertemporal solvency condition by either testing for linear stationarity in the total government deficit series or testing for linear cointegration between total government spending and total tax revenues. A number of authors have focused, in particular, on structural breaks in the government deficit process. In this paper, we use a smooth transition error correction model to test and estimate a shift in the adjustment toward a linear cointegration relationship between the government spending to output ratio and the total tax revenues to output ratio. Estimation results show that government authorities react only to large (in absolute value) changes in the government spending to output ratio. Residual diagnostic tests are provided and they show that the model is not misspecified.

AB The building of a sustainable material circulating system is imminent for the threatened waste disposal landfills in Japan. Now, man-aided recycling is active for the purpose of lessening waste. Al-though recycling originally aimed at saving resources and alleviating environmental problems simultaneously, it is nevertheless a current issue that problem of cost and environmental damages have occurred. Also, other problems include the generation of toxic substances due to the mixing of dissimilar materials in the recycling process in each industrial production field, and its progression in the future is feared. This indicates that there is a need to build a purging or purification system in recycling similar to the one originally equipped in the ecosystem. In this report, the category of the poison and the recycling process in the circulating material will be defined and the influence on the material will be examined.

Within these are: sludge of the Blast Furnace; coke fines: fine and coarse fractions from oxygen converters; sludge from water treatment at rolling mill unit: and others. In this paper the above dusts and sludges were physically and chemically characterized. The obtained results allowed defining self-reducing pellets using these materials. The high temperature behaviors, of the pellets were evaluated. Good results, with no decrepitation and swelling, and high yield of reduction, show that it is feasible to recycle them, as self-reducing pellets, in oxygen steelmaking converter, with a net benefit of US$ 20 per ton of these dusts.

TI Innovating our way to the next industrial revolution
SO MIT SLOAN MANAGEMENT REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
AB In many ways, the industrial age has been an era of harvesting natural and social capital in order to create financial and productive capital. So far, the New Economy looks more like the next wave of the industrial era than a truly postindustrial one. Why should we care? Because, say the authors, the basic development patterns of the industrial era are not sustainable.
   In the face of this challenge, organizational learning expert Peter Senge and former Volvo and IKEA senior executive Goran Carstedt hail the emergence of a new environmentalism driven by innovation, not regulation - radical new technologies, products, processes and business models. They describe how more and more companies are recognizing the business opportunities that a focus on sustainability creates.
   Such a shift in thinking is already evident in many companies and industries. Xerox employed "zerowaste-to-landfill" engineering to develop its 90% remanufacturable Document Centre 265 copier. Interface Inc. is no longer just a maker of commercial carpet tiles, but now - as a provider of "floor-covering services"- leases products and later recycles them completely. Such companies are applying learning-organization principles to create sustainable business models. Simultaneously, they become inspirational, energetic places to work, where even relationships with customers and suppliers improve.
   Nonetheless, ecoefficiency alone will not create a truly postindustrial age. Ecoefficiency gains are laudable but dangerously incomplete, say the authors, as is any strategy that fails to consider how the economic system affects the larger ecological and social systems within which it resides. Only a more integrated view will enable companies to innovate for long-term profitability and sustainability. Industrial-age systems follow a linear flow of extract, produce, sell, use, discard: the "take-make-waste" approach to economic growth. A systemic approach would reduce all sources of waste: from production, use and disposal.
   How can managers adapt? In stark contrast to industrial-age, command-and-control management methods are the three core competencies that learning organizations must master to profit from sustainability. First, they must encourage systemic thinking so that they can sense the emerging future. Second, they must convene strategic conversations with investors, customers, suppliers and even competitors to build the trust needed to change outmoded mental models about what business success is. Finally, they must take the lead in reshaping economic, political and societal forces that stymie change. True learning organizations stand out by championing business models that foster sustainable growth. According to Senge and Carstedt, no time in history has afforded greater possibilities for a collective change in direction.

ID NITROGEN; SYSTEM
AB Peat and heavy clay soils in the Netherlands are mainly used for permanent grassland to support dairy farming. As a result of intensification in dairy farming during the last decades, environmental quality is threatened by high emissions of N and P. Increased drainage of the wet soils has induced high mineralization rates, with associated losses of organic matter and nutrients. Improved utilization of N and P sources and new grazing and feeding strategies are proposed to reach environmental targets without loss of production. A sustainable prototype-system is designed by stepwise theoretical improvements of the current dairy farm, Although groundwater levels are kept high to limit breakdown of soil organic matter, the high availability of N and P from unavoidable peat mineralization offers the possibility to drastically reduce fertilizer inputs, which will directly reduce nutrient losses to the environment. Reduction of protein content in the ration reduces ammonia emission by approximately 20%, while milk production levels of 14,000 kg ha(-1) per year can be maintained. The change from full to restricted grazing effectively reduces N losses from soil, but ammonia emission reductions are only significant with an improved slurry-application technique. A reduction in young stock reduces the roughage requirements but contributes little to the reduction of the nutrient surplus. Reduction of N imports trades off with the restoration of the soil-N stock, which is depleted by mineralization and unavoidable losses. Optimization of the utilization of nutrient resources is an effective first step to realize a sustainable farming system.

AB In the Netherlands there is a remarkable difference in environmental performance between the average commercial dairy farm and some experimental dairy farms. Despite 15 years of policies and measures to decrease nutrient losses, experimental dairy farms based on careful nutrient management, like 'De Marke', realize much higher resource use efficiencies and much lower nutrient surpluses than the average commercial dairy farm.
   This paper discusses the transitions that are needed to bridge the gap between experimental dairy farms and commercial pilot farms. In the project 'Cows & Opportunities', 17 farms were selected representing the full range of conditions for dairy farming, with emphasis on dry sandy soils because of their environmental constraints. There are intensive discussions and communications between farmers, extension services, advisers from the industry, researchers and policy makers, Firstly, all farms were thoroughly analysed in terms of agronomic and environmental performance in the original situation. Secondly, opportunities for improving their performance were analysed using sustainability criteria like nutrient losses, energy and water use, emission of greenhouse gases, crop protection, accumulation of heavy metals, and nature development. Thirdly, an outline for a farm development plan was formulated to meet the nitrogen and phosphorus surplus targets set by the Dutch government. These first outlines (designs) were thoroughly discussed between farmers and researchers. After modelling the farm design to calculate the environmental and economic effects, the farm development plan was adjusted wherever needed, approved and implemented. The performance of the farm will be monitored and evaluated over the next few years. In the original situation, the MINAS nitrogen surplus on the farms ranged from 47 to 349 kg ha(-1), with an average of 207 kg. The modelling results indicated an average N surplus of 131 kg ha(-1) after implementation of the farm development plans, i.e., 19 kg ha(-1) less than the target surplus. The project 'Cows & Opportunities' demonstrates that it is possible to meet the nitrogen and phosphorus surplus targets by taking simple measures. The project yields useful information on the relations between management measures, constraints, nutrient balances and environmental performance.

AB Grassland animal husbandry is an important component of the regional economy in Naqu Prefecture of Tibet. A grassland survey was initiated to specify biological and socio-economic characteristics of animal husbandry. The information from the survey was used to classify grassland resources and to evaluate grazing capacity. Based on the China Grassland Classification System, the grasslands in Naqu Prefecture were classified into 4 classes, 10 group,., and 32 types. The assessment of grazing capacity indicated that the grasslands in the eastern counties of the temperate wet zone and some counties in the central and western parts are severely overgrazed, which has resulted in serious grassland deterioration. Clarifying the ownership of the grazing lands should be the top priority for the government if a policy of sustainable development of grassland animal husbandry in Naqu Prefecture is to be adopted.

AB The influence of density stratification on sedimentation, suspension, and resuspension in Tasman Bay and Beatrix Bay, New Zealand, two contrasting coastal environments, was studied with specific reference to the implications for modelling aquaculture sustainability. Tasman Bay, an enhanced scallop (Pecten novaezelandiae Reeve) fishery, is a very large coastal indentation gently shelving to c. 20 m deep c. 10 km from shore and open to the Tasman Sea, whereas Beatrix Bay, an area of intense Greenshell(TM) mussel (Perna canaliculus Gmelin) aquaculture, is a small (22 km(2) x 30-40 m deep) enclosed embayment off the side of the nearby Pelorus Sound. Sediment trap arrays were used to determine the vertical fluxes of suspended solids and the associated chlorophyll component. Benthic chambers were used to investigate sediment nutrient regeneration. In summer, salinity gradients in both bays are minimal or non-existent because of low inputs of fresh water and density stratification is mainly controlled by water temperature. The data from mid summer exhibited different spatial distribution patterns for detritus and phytoplankton biomass (as indicated by chlorophyll) in these two very different bays, although they had similar turbulent environments. The density discontinuity at the thermocline had a strong influence on settling of phytoplankton. There was evidence of upwards entrainment of suspended particulate matter into the upper water column from the thermocline in Beatrix Bay. Benthic resuspension was estimated to contribute up to 90% of the suspended solids caught in sediment traps near the sea floor in both bays. The trapping rate of phytoplankton was thought to be dependent on species dominance. Possible mechanisms of resuspension included turbulence in the benthic boundary layer, and high velocities below the thermocline associated with internal seiches. The presence of a mid water column chlorophyll maximum in Beatrix Bay is discussed in terms of nutrient and light regimes at the thermocline, and species composition. In Tasman Bay, the chlorophyll maximum was thought to be caused by resuspension of benthic microphytes and their subsequent confinement in a thin layer (2-4 m thick) of high turbulence between the thermocline and the seabed.

TI An assessment of headwater isolation as a conservation strategy for
   cutthroat trout in the Absaroka Mountains of Wyoming
SO NORTHWEST SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
ID BULL TROUT; STREAM; FRAGMENTATION; EXTINCTION
AB Isolation of native cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarki) populations in headwater tributaries (by means of human-made barriers that prevent upstream movement of exotic Salmonidae) has been used (as an approach) to preserve extant populations from hybridization and competition. We evaluated this conservation strategy for Yellowstone cutthroat trout (O. c. bouvieri) in the Absaroka Mountains of northwestern Wyoming. We surveyed four existing populations to assess the potential for isolating Yellowstone cutthroat trout populations in 23 individual headwater tributary streams. It appeared that 21 of the populations would be large enough to minimize demographic risks of extinction, but only seven populations may be large enough (effective population size > 500) to lower the risk of extinction due to genetic limitations. Additionally, there is high potential for unpredictable environmental events to cause severe reductions in population size or local extinctions of Yellowstone cutthroat trout populations above barriers due to the unstable flow and habitat conditions. Isolation of Yellowstone cutthroat trout populations in headwater tributaries upstream from barriers appears to have a low probability of preserving sustainable populations of Yellowstone cut-throat trout in the Absaroka Mountains in the long term.

TI Enhancing sustainable production and genetic resource conservation of
   bambara groundnut: a survey of indigenous agricultural knowledge systems
SO OUTLOOK ON AGRICULTURE
LA English
DT Article
AB Bambara groundnut (Vigna subterranea) is so important in most of Africa, and potentially so in other tropical regions, that improvement of its production - especially on a commercial scale - and of its germplasm both deserve renewed and intensive scientific study. Yet, compared with other legumes (such as groundnuts, beans and cowpeas), bambara groundnut has received almost no research or extension attention, although in Ghana and other parts of Africa, it has a higher market value (on a per unit weight basis) than these other legumes. Improving indigenous farm management systems and methods that have resulted from age-old experience and tradition will be difficult for local farmers if they are completely entrenched in their habits. Thus, a survey was conducted to identify and document the traditional farm management practices and key considerations used in bambara groundnut production, along with indigenous knowledge systems linked to the conservation of bambara groundnut germplasm. The study was conducted in the Upper West region of Ghana, which is an area with considerable bambara groundnut genetic diversity. Valuable information on its production and genetic resources exists within the indigenous knowledge systems studied, and ranges from economic and agronomic criteria for peasant farmer selection of particular varieties and traditional uses of the crop, to strategies for the management and conservation of locally adapted varieties, pest and disease management, and environmental and ecological monitoring systems. Research and extension requirements for improving crop production were identified. In addition, germplasm was collected and characterized for conservation.

TI IRRIGATION SYSTEM ANALYSIS FOR SALT FLUX AND SALINITY BUILDUP IN PUNJAB:
   RISK ASSESSMENT AND CROP SUSTAINABILITY CONCERNS
SO PAKISTAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY
LA English
DT Article
AB The Punjab Irrigation System (PIS) has brought a great prosperity to the province but the induction of salinity and water logging on the other hand, due to salt imbalance, higher seepage losses and low canals delivery efficiency (40%) from canal head to the crop root zone is becoming a great threat to the agricultural sustainability. Irrigation intensity has increased to 122 percent against the overall designed annual intensity of 63 percent. Statistics show that more than 4.5 lac tube wells have been recorded during 1996-97 in contrast to 2.6 lac in 1988-89. More than 70 percent of the tubewells installed to make up the canal water deficit, pump groundwater of marginal to unfit quality and add about 129.06 million tonns (mt) salts. The shallow water table recycling salts further adds 0.14 mt salt load through capillary rise phenomena. The canal and river water, no doubt is excellent in quality but due to restricted drainage contributes about 20.99 mt salts every year (assuming 276 g m(-3) average salts) through 55.94 million acre foot (MAF) water allocated to the Punjab province. The total salt load to the irrigated soils estimates to the tune of 150.19 mt. The tubewells alone share 85.93%. Consequential to the conjunctive irrigation use after massive deployment of tubewells, the salt balance is no more maintained. Secondary salinity is now becoming a threat and moving towards a dominating position aver genetic salinity due to weathering of parent material. Presently about 12.38 percent of the gross canal commanded area is salt-affected and weterlogging has affected another 0.22 percent of the irrigated lands. Salinity has surfaced up as a water short, water excess dilemma. Need is to control the menace. Otherwise it will make our soils unproductive within 80 years or so. Sensing the future course of the agriculture, we must harness our water resources by strengthening the irrigation and drainage capability of the system. Additional water supplies to each down salts, effective water management endeavors and restricting water rights of the farmer over ground water exploitation may be some interventions to keep a fare salt balance in the Punjab Irrigation Basin.

AB A Geographic Information System (GIS)-assisted simulation model of the dynamic processes of soil erosion and hydrology of a watershed has been developed, called Predicting Catchment Runoff and Soil Erosion for Sustainability (PCARES). PCARES is a physical model that can simulate runoff and soil erosion of a catchment area during a rainfall event. The basic inputs to run the model include raster maps of the elevation, soil, and land use pattern of the catchment, and a time series on the amount of rainfall. Important outputs include a map of source erosion and runoff discharge and sediment yield at the outlet of a catchment area.
   For validation of the model, the Mapawa catchment area in Bukidnon, Southern Philippines was parameterized in terms of the PCARES' input requirements to assess the impact of land surface-cover treatments on water quantity and quality. The treatments were: (T) bare surface, (2) current vegetation with minimal soil conservation measures and (3) forest cover. The bare surface gave the highest water and sediment discharge rates while the forest cover gave the least runoff with almost no sediment load. The results demonstrate both the power of the simulation model and the enormous positive effect of surface cover in managing soil erosion and runoff in a watershed. The model may also be useful in predicting the impacts on conservation of research and development projects even before they are carried out in the watershed.

AB The effects of Al on red spruce (Picea rubens Sarg.) cell suspension cultures were examined using biochemical, stereological and microscopic methods. Exposure to: Al for 24-48 h resulted in a loss of cell viability, inhibition of growth! and a significant decrease in mitochondrial activity. Soluble protein content increased in cells treated with Al. Using energy-dispersive X-ray microanalysis on sections of freeze-substituted cells that had no obvious disruption in cytoplasmic or cell wall structure, Al (always in the presence of P) was detected in dense regions in cell walls, cytoplasm, plastids and vacuoles after 48 h exposure to Al. Stereological quantification of spruce cell structure showed that, after 24 h of Al treatment, intact cells had increased vacuolar and total cell volume, but the nuclear volume did not change. In addition, Al treatment resulted in increased surface area of Golgi membranes and endoplasmic reticulum. The biochemical and ultrastructural alterations in red spruce cells, in combination with the presence of Al in cellular organelles of visually intact cells, suggest that Al movement occurred across the plasma membrane without major cellular disruption. Detailed short-term time course studies are needed to determine if intracellular Al in these cells results from its passage into cells through submicroscopic lesions in the plasma membrane or it is taken up into the symplast through the intact membrane by an active, but slow, process.

AB Blue light was found to induce shrinkage of the protoplasts isolated from first-leaf lamina pulvini of 18-day-old Phaseolus vulgaris. The response was transient following pulse stimulation, while it was sustainable during continuous stimulation. No apparent difference was found between flexor and extensor protoplasts. Protoplasts of the petiolar segment located close to the pulvinus showed no detectable response. In the plants used, the pulvinus was fully matured and the petiole was ceasing its elongation growth. When younger, 12-day-old, plants were used, however, the petiolar protoplasts did respond to blue light. The pulse-induced response was similar to that in pulvinar protoplasts, although the response to continuous stimulation was transient and differed from that in pulvinar protoplasts. No shrinkage was induced in pulvinar protoplasts when the far-red-light-absorbing form of phytochrome was absent for a period before blue-light stimulation, indicating that the blue-light responsiveness is strictly controlled by phytochrome. Inhibitors of anion channels and H+-ATPase abolished the shrinking response, supporting the view that protoplasts shrink by extruding ions. The response of pulvinar protoplasts is probably involved in the blue-light-induced, turgor-based movement of pulvini. The blue-light responding system in pulvini is suggested to have evolved from that functioning in other growing organs.

AB Acquisition of soil and fertiliser phosphorus (P) by crops depends on soil and plant properties. Soil processes determining P availability to plants are P solubility/sorption, P transport, root/soil contact and mineralisation/immobilisation. Plants have evolved properties contributing to a more efficient use of plant-available soil P and to mobilise P from less available soil P fractions. Agronomic measures may affect P availability to crops through the modification of soil properties or through direct quantitative and qualitative crop impact on soil P dynamics. Among the agronomic measures, the application of organic matter such as green manure and crop residues to maintain or increase soil organic matter content and to enhance soil biological activity, and the incorporation into the cropping system of P-mobilising plant species are particularly beneficial.
   Our experimental activities have concentrated on the characterisation of the P mobilising capacity of different leguminous grain and cover crops, and their effect on P availability to less P-efficient cereals grown in mixed culture and in rotation. Fractionation of P in the rhizosphere soil revealed the capacity of some legumes to better use P from sparingly soluble soil P fractions than maize. Field experiments conducted on 2 sites in the Northern Guinea Savannah of Nigeria and accompanying green-house pot experiments revealed a positive rotational effect of P-efficient cover crops on maize growth and grain yield with and without the return of crop residues. This could unequivocally be attributed to a better P supply to maize, especially on strongly P-fixing soil. However, the residual effect was small compared to the application of water-soluble P fertiliser. This clearly indicates the need for a maintenance application of fertiliser P in addition to the agronomic measures for sustainable crop production.

AB On five farms that have been managed organically for several years, all cultivated soils were sampled on two occasions. The time span between the first and second soil sampling varied from 6 to 12 years. At the first sampling the farms had been managed organically for 3, 4, 6, 11 or 53 years. The average phosphorus (P) concentrations in topsoil (0-20 cm) extracted by ammonium-acetate lactate solution (P-AL) decreased from the first to the second sampling on all farms. At the second soil sampling, the average topsoil P-AL concentrations on the five farms were 50, 64, 65, 75 and 119 mg P kg(-1), which is characterised as medium (26-65 mg P kg(-1)) or high (66-150 mg P kg(-1)). The decrease occurred mostly in soils with high and very high (> 150 mg P kg(-1)) P-AL concentrations at the first sampling. In these samples, the average value decreased from 100 to 87 and from 188 to 151 mg P kg(-1), respectively. In subsoil (20-40 cm), an increase from 15 to 27 mg P kg(-1) (P <0.01) in P-AL concentration was found in subsoil samples with low P-AL concentrations (0-25 mg P kg(-1)) at the first sampling. This indicates P transfer from topsoil to subsoil. The pattern of decrease in topsoil was fairly well explained by farm level P balances. The average topsoil concentrations of P-AL were well below values for comparable conventional farms, but still at a level acceptable for crop production. Crop yields were acceptable, but the general pattern of decrease shows that in the future, some P should be supplied from external sources to avoid a further decrease, especially on the fields with lowest P-AL concentrations.

AB Technology transfer mechanisms are assuming increasing importance as the structure of agricultural research provision changes and as environmental and sustainability objectives become important to [he farm business. In less developed countries, if is widely acknowledged that technology transfer is difficult to accomplish, hence market failure is a key issue. This study proposes a 3-component model of technology transfer based on brand strength, social distance and intrinsic product value. Using market research methods if has been possible to demonstrate differences in brand strength between companies involved in technology transfer. For target groups of farmers, high social distance, equated with failure to access information sources, was generally associated with less willingness to innovate, These methodologies could be used to design strategies for improving technology transfer in crop-based agriculture.

TI Property rights and property wrongs: Why context matters in fisheries

SO POLICY SCIENCES

ID PRIVATE PROPERTY; RESOURCES; CAPTURE; POLICY
AB Like most wild living resources, fish present a complex management challenge. Given the failure of command and control regulatory regimes to protect fisheries, scholars and practitioners have advocated the use of property rights to rectify the fisheries crisis. This meta analysis argues that property rights can be used constructively as a regulatory measure in the sustainable management of fisheries, and perhaps in other areas of resource management. However, the use of property rights to resolve resource problems is context dependent, and no single regulatory option or policy is appropriate for the multi-faceted and highly variable world of fisheries management. This paper characterizes and contrasts three regulatory regimes in fisheries management in the United States, while drawing from lessons learned worldwide about fisheries regulation. The paper defines the conditions where property rights might be used appropriately-property 'rights' - as well as where property rights might be used inappropriately - property 'wrongs.'

AB The main objective of the so-called green power marketing is to provide selective customers of electric energy with choices to purchase electric energy from sustainable, environmentally friendly sources. This paper presents a rationale for marketing of green power, provides a brief overview of some of the existing efforts in the United States and abroad, and attempts to identify the conditions and future trends for survival of renewable energy in the energy marketplace. Our goal is primarily to provide a representative sample of the current technology status, rather than a comprehensive coverage of worldwide initiatives in this area.

AB In 1999, 8 GW(e) of electrical generating plant worldwide was powered by geothermal heat. Geothermal sources generated 49 terawatt hours of virtually pollution free power that year Coal- or oilfired plants generating this amount would discharge similar to40 million tons per year of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Geothermal capacity has doubled in the past 20 years, and increased 17% in the past five years. The United States and the Philippines account for 50% of that installed capacity worldwide.
   The thermal energy stored in the upper 10 kin of the earth's crust is vast, For example, below the land surface of the U.S., it is estimated to be 10 times annual energy demand for tire country, but most of it is not economically accessible. The only, thermal energy currently economic to extract is from sites where temperatures above 200 C are easily accessible by conventional drilling, and reservoirs of hot water or steam exist in the subsurface.
   To unlock a significant fraction of this vast energy source major technological advances are needed. These include improvements in drilling technology to lower the cost of wells, in fracture stimulation technology to create and control permeability in tight rocks, and in geophysical and chemical tracer technology to characterize thermal and hydraulic regimes in the subsurface. This will take a coordinated effort by government and industry over one or two decades.

TI Water policy and environmental sustainability the case of post colonial

SO PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION AND DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB In semi-arid countries, particularly in Africa, governments have evolved water policies oriented toward `techno-giantist,' grandscale schemes that have generally accelerated the depletion of national water tables. In Namibia, such a techno-giantist water management strategy was utilized to reinforce the privileges of white minority farmers prior to independence, and was subsequently expanded to provide modern water facilities to the black African majority in the post-independence period. The government has pursued not only the construction of a massive new system of pipelines and boreholes, but also the development of giant dam-building and river canal schemes that are likely to result in watershed depletion over the long term. This reflects state leaders' belief in the imagery of political potency projected by the government's ability to build macro-scale water systems. However, a water supply approach focused on more micro-level extraction techniques through which aquifer recharge is prioritized is more likely to assure both local-level water access and water table sustainability.

TI Politico-economic determinants of public debt growth: A case study for

SO PUBLIC CHOICE
LA English
DT Article
ID BUDGET DEFICITS
AB Based on a number of economic and particularly politico-economic arguments, we examine the reasons for the growth of the central government's debt in Austria using time series data for the period 1960 to 1999. Starting with an empirical test of Bohn's theory of sustainability of fiscal policy, which is based on Barro's tax-smoothing model, we extend the model to account for several politico-economic variables suggested by public choice theories. Keynesian stabilization policy objectives, influences of ideology and political parties, the form of government and the political business cycle are tested regarding their ability to explain the growth of public debt in Austria. There is some empirical evidence for systematic influence of government behavior in accordance with recent public choice theories. However, it seems that the most important influence on Austrian fiscal policy is the unemployment rate, which has a significant influence on the decisions made by policy-makers. Concluding, we briefly discuss the implications of these results for the prospects of reducing public debt in Austria in the near future.

   practices
AB The weight of scientific evidence suggests that human activities are noticeably influencing the world's climate. However, the effects of global climate change will be unevenly spread, due to local variations in vulnerability and adaptive capacity. Using downscaled projections of future UK climates over the next 50 years, this paper investigates the impacts of, and possible responses to, climate change in one small area in eastern England, selected as a test-bed for sustainable agriculture. It shows that local agricultural systems are vulnerable to changes in the climate. At present, however, these considerations have a limited effect on agricultural operations, which are mainly driven by short-term events and 'non-climate' policies, such as agricultural price support. The capacity of agricultural systems to adapt successfully to climate change will be determined by the ability of producers to integrate climate change into their planning strategies with a view to ultimately ensuring sustainable agricultural practices in the long term.

AB Both consultants and scientists would agree that even if their own work provided a solution to a landuser's problem, then that solution is unlikely to be adopted if the landuser is unwilling to pay for it Financial incentives, while enabling factors in technology transfer and adoption, are usually not the only limiting factors. In reality, adoption is more complex. This complexity resides within the interrelationship between human endeavours, economics and the environment. Although there is a global consensus on the need for sustainability, the means of achieving the core values and principles of sustainable development, on the ground, remains a challenge. This paper discusses some of the fundamental reasons why sustainable land use practices and innovations are not always adopted, providing a perspective from industry. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

TI Economic analysis of reform policies for small coal mines in China
SO RESOURCES POLICY
LA English
DT Article
DE reform policies; Small Coal Mines (SCMs); China
AB Over the last three decades, China's coal industry has achieved dramatic increases in coal production, both in absolute terms and relative to the world as a whole. This achievement is due largely to its coal policies. Yet facing increasing pressures of environmental sustainability and market transition, the Chinese government was forced to make deep reforms and adjustments to regulate the coal industry effectively. This paper presents an historical overview of China's coal economic policies, paying particular attention to the current reform policy of closing mines and restricting the yield for the small coal mines (SCMs) in the context of economic theories and methods. We argue that the SCM closure policy would not likely be efficiently enforced if a feasible market mechanism were not built up. The failure of closure policy is due largely to problems of property rights, coal pricing, ownership, and objectives. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper examines the effect of multimarket contact in a first price sealed bid government procurement auction market. It investigates whether bid prices in the highway construction industry are related to conditions that favor the formation of a cartel. Repeated contacts among firms are found to have a significantly positive effect on the winning low bid which leads to higher profit. Further, rivalry among few firms tends to exacerbate the multimarket effect. The results in this study additionally support the recent theoretical predictions that collusion is better sustainable during economic downturns.

AB This article attempts to construct a new temporal framework for social policy. It draws upon a theory of intergenerational justice that has been elaborated by the author elsewhere and uses that theory to elaborate upon the principles of "sustainable justice". The article addresses some of the difficult philosophical dilemmas that those principles generate and argues that reconciling the interests of present and future generations of the least well-off requires the design of a new property regime. An ecosocial regime is defined and discussed, especially in terms of substitutable goods. The article concludes by debating the prescriptive implications of the above for social policy and future welfare reform.

DE domestic energy; water; social and environmental sustainability; equity;
   social development; public and private provision
AB The need to reconcile social and environmental goals for sustainable development still poses problems for policy makers in the richer parts of the world. Using the examples of domestic water and energy, this paper argues that the problems are reflected, and often magnified, in developing countries. They arise largely from conflicts between the short-term need to alleviate poverty and longer-term objectives for environmental sustainability. The dual nature of water and energy as both social and economic goods raises questions about the most appropriate forms of provision and allocation of the utilities. It is in no one's long-term interest for developing countries to repeat the environmentally damaging mistakes of the industrialized world. But an equitable distribution of the short-term costs attached to a more environmentally responsible use of resources demands new ways of thinking about global social justice.

AB zCommunity gardens vary enormously in what they offer, according to local needs and circumstance. This article reports on research and experience from the USA. The context in which these findings are discussed is the implementation of Local Agenda 21 and sustainable development policies. In particular, emphasis is given to exploring the social dimension of sustainable development policies by linking issues of health, education, community development and food security with the use of green space in towns and cities. The article concludes that the use of urban open spaces for parks and gardens is closely associated with environmental justice and equity.

AB The central aim of this paper is to show how different types of green movement respond to questions of social policy. An important factor in this is a difference in attitudes to the state between more anarchistic greens and those greens that are prepared to accept a permanent and/or strategic role for the state. The paper is divided into two parts. In part one, after defining the green movement, it outlines how different green social movements from local groups, direct action protestors, established environmental groups and green political parties, have developed analyses, responses and alternatives to social policy issues. Part two of the paper looks at some of the ideological/theoretical debates within green politics with regard to social policy, with particular regard to the role of the state. It goes on to look at some of the ways in which European green parties have viewed social policy, and at proposals they have advanced for moving the aim of social policy from "welfare" to "well-being". It concludes with suggesting that the "post-materialist" characterization of green politics is very wide of the mark in terms of the range of analyses and policy alternatives greens have put forward, from health, education and drugs to transport. The central and long-standing green concern with lessening socioeconomic inequalities (but without relying on indiscriminate and unsustainable "economic growth") means that in terms of social policy, green politics can be seen as an "environmentalism of the poor", concerned with "materialist" issues.

AB This article examines the possible unifying effect of climate change on leaders of green groups. The main goal is to identify ideological or North/South differences in attitudes on key aspects of climate change among them. Attitudinal data obtained with a standardized questionnaire administered to leaders from Quebec and Costa Rica are used to generate a typology. Three types of green orientations emerge: "ecologism,'' "mainstream environmentalism," and "market environmentalism.'' General perceptions toward climate change and specific opinions about policy options related to global warming are compared on the basis of these orientations and of national origin. Results show that green leaders are divided on all measured attitudes concerning climate change. Most differences are explained by diversity in ideological orientation, mainly by divergent viewpoints held by ecologists. The differences based on national origin are mainly explained by contrasted contextual features between Quebec and Costa Rica. The results do not provide convincing evidence of cognitive solidarity in the green movement concerning climate change.

AB Creating a fair and effective decision-making process in forest management planning is more than a lofty public policy goal; it is increasingly becoming a legal requirement. An integral component of a fair and effective decision-making process is an effective public involvement process. By increasing public involvement, both the process and outcomes from the process should be perceived as fairer and, consequently, more effective. This study examines the utility of applying the social psychology paradigm of procedural fairness to decision-making processes in forest management planning. Specifically, we examine whether the involvement level that resource-based tourism operators have with Ontario's forest management planning process influences their evaluations of the process and outcomes from the process. The study also contributes toward identifying effective and measurable indicators to assess fair and effective decision making in forest management planning, which could serve in a criteria and indicator framework of forest sustainability.

ID INVENTORY
AB The community Landcare program represents an important element of Australia's approach to sustainable development. However, there is increased concern about burnout in volunteer Landcare participants. Until now, investigations of burnout in Landcare had largely failed to draw on international literature relating to the burnout concept. This article reviews findings from a regional case study of Landcare participants that used a modified version of the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI). Survey findings demonstrated that the modified version of the MBI was valid and reliable. A small proportion of individuals were experiencing high levels of burnout, and results indicate considerable potential for burnout to increase.

AB Soil microbial properties. such as microbial biomass and microbial activity, are suitable indicators to predict soil biological status as a part of soil fertility after transition from high-input agricultural systems to low-input systems. These criteria were applied to evaluate how agricultural de-intensification as practiced by the integrated farming system (IFS) of Germany differ from the conventional agricultural system (CFS) over long-term investigation. The study was multi-factorial, covering agricultural management, spatial as well as temporal variability. Therefore, the research included nine different locations with a wide range of soil types, soil textures of the top horizons, parent materials, climatic conditions, along with the individual impact of farmers over a ten year period. In sum, the mean pH values, the mean amounts of microbial biomass (estimated from maximal initial responses) and soil organic matter, mean C-mic-to-C-org ratio, and mean dehydrogenase activity of the nine locations were almost identical in both systems. The amounts of soil organic matter, microbial biomass and C-mic-to-C-org ratio increased 10-15% in the integrated management treatment compared with the conventional management system starting from the fifth year of investigation. Conversely, during the first 4 years of the investigation the examined parameters were slightly increased in the conventional management system. The differences in dehydrogenase activity between both systems changed from year to year. No differences between both systems were found for the pH values of the investigated soils. Beyond that, the factor soil texture of the top horizon (expressed as the clay content) was highly significant for the amounts of the investigated parameters, During the 10 year investigation period, differences between both management systems in particular years were related to the cultivation of intermediate crops and conservation tillage practices.

AB Potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) farming systems generally use excess tillage and produce low levels of crop residue in the potato year, both of which are detrimental to soil quality. In eastern Canada the major form of primary tillage is autumn (September-October) mouldboard ploughing (20 cm depth). which leaves the soil bare and unprotected over the winter period prior to planting potato in the following spring (May). A study (split-plot randomized block with six replicates) was initiated in 1994 on a fine sandy loam (Orthic Podzol) in Prince Edward Island to evaluate the use of conservation tillage in both 2-year [barley (Hordeum vulgare L.)-potato] and 3-year [barley-red clover (Trifolium pratense L.)-potato] potato rotations. The main conservation tillage strategy was to shift the primary tillage event from the autumn to spring, by replacing the autumn e mouldboard ploughing with a herbicide treatment, and use of a relatively shallow (15 cm depth) one-pass reduced tillage (chisel plough) just prior to potato planting. Mulches were used on all plots after potato harvest to provide soil cover over the cool season. Potato Yield and quality, incidence of tuber disease, surface residue levels after potato planting, soil organic carbon and carbon fractions, and soil structure were evaluated from 1994 to 1999, over three and two cycles of the 2- and 3-year rotation, respectively. Results for the 2-year rotation indicated that neither conventional nor conservation tillage were sustainable, due to Rhizoctonia disease pressure and decline in tuber quality, in comparison to the 3-year rotation. Potato yields and tuber quality were similar between tillage systems in the 3-year rotation. Conservation tillage significantly increased the concentration of organic carbon and macro-organic carbon at the soil 0-8 cm depth, compared to conventional tillage, and significantly improved soil structural stability. Use of conservation tillage in 3-year potato systems has the potential to maintain crop productivity, protect the soil resource, and improve soil quality. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB By comparing field measurements from 1989, 1997, and 1998, the differences between farmland (sloping farmland, sloping farmland with contour cultivation, terraced farmland) and orchard (terraced orchard, unterraced orchard), in the Three Gorges Reservoir Area, were significant for runoff (P<0.01), erosion (P<0.05) and nutrient loss (P<0.05). Taking into account economic costs and environmental influences, reasonable and sustainable land use on slopes of 25<degrees> in the Three Gorges Reservoir Area should be unterraced orchard.

AB Although models of high-quality family planning services for men exist in Latin America, few if any have been organized within the complex and resource-constrained national public health systems, This study provides evidence from the Santa Barbara project in southern Brazil showing how vasectomy was introduced into the municipal health system. It demonstrates that once the necessary operational and quality-of-care improvements were in place, and sufficient political and technical support existed to proceed, it was possible to establish low-cost, well-used, and sustainable vasectomy services free of charge. The findings show that careful attention to the development of strong technical competence and an informed choice process resulted in high user satisfaction. Focus-group discussions with men who underwent vasectomy indicate that they had no objection to being served in the context of a women's health center and that they act as opinion leaders who draw an increasing clientele to the service.

We use a conceptual operations strategy framework consisting of four elements: mission, distinctive competence, objective and policies to discuss the managerial implications of new technologies employed by various banks. It is concluded that operations must be recognized as a strategic function in banking institutions and investment in new technologies should be strategically directed to strengthen various operations decisions such as quality, process, capacity and facility.

TI Emerging elements of a world view for sustainable quality
SO TOTAL QUALITY MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB The ongoing economic globalization is seen by many to inflict serious undesirable impacts. These are forcing governments, scientists and a number of businesses to question the validity of the assumptions of the way economic growth is created and its long-term effects on a sustainable quality of life. Increasing inequalities of wealth among and within developed and less developed societies, rising levels of discontent and international crime, increasing pollution of the natural environment and more intense and frequent climate-related natural disasters all combine to raise questions about how sustainable are our ways of improving our standards of living and the world view of aiming for a single global economy amidst violent conflicts related to control of natural resources, religious, ethnic and cultural differences that threaten our very existence on planet Earth. In this context, attempting to improve quality for specific products and services to make any single company more profitable might be a futile exercise, unless such efforts are placed in a new framework designed to create conditions more supportive of a sustainable quality of life on a broader scale. The key elements shaping the new paradigm for sustainable quality, which are described briefly in this paper, must be incorporated in an expanded framework for total quality management to maintain it as a relevant approach in a larger but vitally important context.

TI Measuring the relationship between total quality management and
   sustainable competitive advantage: A resource-based view
SO TOTAL QUALITY MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB Does a total quality management (TOM) initiative have any effect on the firm's performance? What are the variables that exert this influence? Which elements have the greatest effects? All these issues are discussed widely in the literature on strategy and quality. The objective of this paper is to approach the study of these problems from a resource-based perspective. From this viewpoint, the effects of TM on performance are explained through the resources and competencies that the implementation of this strategy generates. The adoption of this perspective implies guiding the research towards the identification of strategic resources and core competencies that are generated by a TQM initiative. This issue has hardly been touched by previous research in the quality literature. We propose an investigation design and methodology based on the elaboration of a structural equation model. This model will allow us to contrast the extent to which these TQM-linked resources and competencies are sources of sustainable competitive advantage and better performance. This paper presents wide empirical research on industrial and service firms, which confirms our causal model. To develop this research, a TQM measurement instrument and a competencies measurement instrument were elaborated.

TI Total quality management in the West, East and Russia: Are we different?
SO TOTAL QUALITY MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB The article is devoted to an analysis of the main differences and similarities in total quality management (TQM) practice in Western, Russian and Asian companies. Analytical results are based on comparative studies of data collected in 12 countries, Russia, Taiwan, Japan, Korea, Finland, Estonia, Denmark, Australia, India, Sweden, England and New Zealand, in the 1990s. It is shown in the study that Western and Asian companies have more in common between them than with Russian companies. Russia is standing a bit aside in terms of state-of-the-art leadership style, presenting to some extent double standard ways of running business, inherited from the soviet era. Russian TQM clearly reflects the current transition economy status, but not necessarily inherent national characteristics. Thus, particular emphasis is given in the study to the TQM experience in transitional economies as such, the purpose of this being to point to practical implication in order to help Russian producers and distributors to obtain improved market acceptance and sustainable development.

AB This paper represents part of a programme of research into the development of indicators that can be used to monitor movement of the tourism industry with reference to more sustainable positions. In order to determine the potential for implementing such indicators this paper asked senior representatives of the UK tourism industry what factors influenced the degree of responsibility shown by their organisation. The research also asked what factors respondents felt would trigger any change in the actions of tour operators in the future. The research reveals that while many in the industry see industry structure as the constraining force, the potential for market advantage or the fear of negative PR also determines company actions. The research utilised elite interviewing for 35 senior representatives of the UK tourism industry. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID IVERMECTIN; PROGRAM
AB Lymphatic filariasis (LF) is targeted for global elimination, Repeated annual single-dose mass treatment with antifilarials has been recommended as the principal strategy to achieve LF elimination. This requires an effective and sustainable strategy to deliver the drug, diethylcarbamazitic (DEC), to communities. In this study, a new drug delivery strategy - community-directed treatment (comDT) - was developed and implemented and its effectiveness compared with that of the traditional health services-organized drug delivery, in rural areas of Tamil Nadu, India. Qualitative and quantitative data showed that the communities and health services were able to distribute the drug in almost all villages. The drug distribution rate and treatment compliance rate of comDT and health services treatment were statistically compared after adjusting them for clustering. Under the comDT 68%, (n = 20 villages; range: 0-97%) of the population received DEC, compared with 74% (n = 20 villages; range: 48-95%) with the health services treatment strategy (P > 0.05). However, only about 53%, (range: 0-91%) of comDT recipients and 59% (range: 32-79%) of those who received DEC from the health services consumed the drug (P > 0.05). Although statistically not significant, the distribution and compliance rates were lower under the comDT strategy. Also, the strategy's operationalization appears to be difficult because of some social factors, and the tradition of communities' dependence oil health services for treatment, whereas health services-organized distribution was much less Cumbersome and found to he more acceptable to people. However, the distribution (74%) and compliance rates (59%) achieved by health services were also only moderate and may not be adequate to eliminate LF in a reasonable time frame. Health services manpower alone may not be sufficient to distribute the drug. We conclude that drug distribution by health services is the best option for India and participation of the community volunteers and village level government staffs in the programme is necessary to effectively distribute the drug and attain the desirable levels of treatment compliance to eliminate LF.

AB Water quality monitoring in the Russian Federation faces political, technical, institutional, and financial problems. The current Russian model for gathering and production of water quality data is unreliable, out-of-date, and disconnected with current water management issues. While insufficient financing and ineffective legislation are the most obvious limitations, more importantly there is a need for a major overhaul of the program that would begin with a national framework for water quality management. This framework would provide for legal, institutional, and technical modernization of the program within a clearly-defined set of national goals for water quality management. The monitoring program in use in Russia is the legacy of the former USSR, The current growth of national priorities in terms of control and improvement of surface water quality is in contrast to the nation's decreasing ability to provide appropriate information within sustainable technical and institutional environments and that is affordable. This situation requires a new model based on the development of a flexible monitoring system focusing on water quality management. Ensuring financial stability of the monitoring system requires having a transparent and consistent program meeting the specific demands of water management. This, in turn, requires resource-saving methods and innovative relationships between agencies and with the private sector allowing cost reductions for the government.

AB Water management steers a middle course between control and chaos. The concept of control in water management is the topic of this paper. Conditions for control in water management are: a consistent policy, gaining support and an adequate information supply. It is demonstrated that the balance between these three conditions of control depends on the type of water management considered. In this paper four different types of water management are distinguished based on the conditions for control. The concept presented in this paper is validated on basis of three case studies. The paper concludes with a presentation of an approach which is interactive and aims at an integral and sustainable development.

AB Managing ungulate populations in a sustainable way requires monitoring plans to provide useful information about population status and trend. Our aim is to evaluate the use of hunters to collect information about the status of caribou Rangifer tarandus groenlandicus in Greenland. Caribou have been harvested under a quota system since 1995 in four regions of west Greenland. In each year, hunters were asked to return information on the sex, approximate age and body condition of animals harvested, and lower jawbones were collected from animals shot in 1995. The harvest is strongly sex-biased (90:10) towards males. Jawbone length did not vary among regions. Age-specific tooth wear was, however, most pronounced in the northern region (Sisimiut-Kangerlussuaq), probably due to the nature of the substrate in the area. The condition of animals, based on a rump-fat index, appears to be good over all west Greenland, with some slight but consistent differences between regions. We conclude that information provided by hunters will be useful in monitoring the caribou populations, but validation of their information is required.

AB Lubricants based on renewable raw materials and their derivatives are drawing increased attraction in various applications. Here, the environmental awareness is the key factor of success. The use of such rapidly biodegradable materials is especially favourable in loss-lubrication and hydraulic systems with increased risk of damage. Environmentally friendly, biodegradable alternatives are available for a large variety of mineral oil based lubricants. The substitution of mineral oil with biodegradable base oils is a primary objective. Vegetable oils are the major source of these base fluids. Compared to conventional mineral oil based fluids most of such substances exhibit lower thermal and oxidation stability and even worse low-temperature behaviour. These physical and chemical properties can be improved by chemical modification. This review covers chemical reactions performed on fatty compounds on both laboratory and industrial scale. Economic processes are presented as well as new reactions with potential market value. Alternative routes to improved rapidly biodegradable base fluids are mentioned too, e.g. breeding successes with high oleic sunflower oil. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

   global energy statistics; renewable energy; sustainability
AB The quality of life today is dependent upon access to a bountiful supply of cheap energy. For a sustainable future, the energy should be derived from non-fossil sources; ideally, it should also be reliable and safe, flexible in use, affordable, and limitless. This paper examines the present global use of energy in its various forms, and considers projections for the year 2020 with particular attention to the harnessing of 'clean' and renewable forms of energy for electricity generation and road transportation. The incorporation of renewables is constrained in many instances by the variable and intermittent nature of their output. This calls for the practical application of energy-storage systems. An evaluation is made of the prospects of the candidate storage technologies - pumped-hydro, flywheels, hydrogen (for use in fuel cells), batteries - for application in centralized and distributed electricity supplies, and in electric and hybrid electric vehicles. The discussion concludes with the developments foreseen over the next 20 years. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Sustainable energy is becoming of increasing concern world-wide. The rapid growth of global climate changes along with the fear of energy supply shortage is creating a large consensus about the potential benefits of a hydrogen economy coming from renewable energy sources. The interesting perspectives are over-shadowed by uncertainties about the development of key technologies, such as renewable energy sources, advanced production processes, fuel cells, metal hydrides, nanostructures, standards and codes, and so on. The availability of critical technologies can create a base for the start of the hydrogen economy, as a fuel and energy carrier alternative, to the current fossil resources. This paper will explore the rationale for such a revolution in the energy sector, will describe the state-of-the-art of major related technologies (fuel cell, storage systems, fuel cell vehicles) and current niche applications, and will sketch scientific and technological challenges and recommendations for research and development (R&D) initiatives to accelerate the pace for the widespread introduction of a hydrogen economy.

DE car-sharing; deviance; environment; hitch-hiking; marginality; risk;
   sustainability; transport; trust
AB This article explores the sociologically neglected practice of hitch-hiking. It demonstrates the paucity of research on what is potentially a fascinating instance of social interaction and it argues that hitch-hiking provides an interesting test case for the applicability of recent social theories of risk and trust. The reasons for the relative decline in hitch-hiking in Britain are discussed and comparisons are made with continental Europe and the U.S.. The article suggests that despite the increasingly risk-averse nature of public bodies, attention to this subject could provide interesting possibilities for policy makers concerned with the development of sustainable modes of transport, as well as for those concerned with the re-vitalisation of civil society.

AB Many glass-forming substances display heat capacities for their supercooled liquids that substantially exceed those of the corresponding crystals. Reasonable extrapolation below the kinetic glass transition temperature indicates that the molar entropies of the supercooled liquid and crystal phases would become equal at a "Kauzmann temperature" T-K > 0. Furthermore, continuing such extrapolation below T-K to absolute zero suggests that the disordered liquid attains lower entropy than the crystal, in conflict with the third law of thermodynamics (hence the "Kauzmann paradox"). The present study cites data for real substances and results from numerical simulation and theoretical modeling in the temperature-pressure plane to demonstrate that a Kauzmann locus T-K(p) can indeed occur, though not necessarily for all materials. No third-law conflict arises. Also, the analysis provides no support for the concept of an "ideal glass transition" at positive temperature, often mentioned in connection with glass formers. In the event that classical statistical mechanics is applicable to a substance of interest, the low-temperature endpoint of the Kauzmann locus involves the maximum isotropic tension sustainable by spatially uniform amorphous deposits, a state which coincides in pressure and density with the minimum of the T = 0 liquid spinodal.

AB A simple model was developed for evaluation of the effects of double-crested cormorant (Phalacrocorax auritus) predation on stocked walleye (Stizostedion vitreum) in the Great Lakes. The model was applied to obtain general relations for stocking and for cormorant predation. If there is no stocking, maintenance of a sizable walleye population is necessary for reproduction, but when the walleye population is maintained by stocking, yield can be increased by fishing the population blow the level which produces the maximum sustainable yield without stocking, and the loss in reproduction is made up by stocking. If there is no predation on the stocked walleye, stocking can greatly increase yield. If there is cormorant predation, in the long run the number of cormorants increases with stocking but the number of walleye does not, and stocked walleye are feeding the cormorants.

AB An important aspect of the sustainable management of tropical rain forests is the maintenance of genetic diversity within populations of commercial tree species. Logging may reduce genetic variation directly and may also affect genetic processes, leading possibly to genetic erosion and ultimately even species extinction. It is, however, impractical for the forest manager to make meaningful measurements of genetic variation and they are therefore inappropriate for use as indicators of sustainable forest management. We propose that the application of well-known silvicultural principles is the most practical way of preventing rapid loss of genetic diversity.
   Most tropical rain forest tree species have many more individuals below the minimum size for commercial exploitation than above. The genetic diversity of these species will be little affected by logging, as the steins removed form only a small fraction of the total population. Similarly, for most species, disruption of normal mating patterns will either not occur or be transient, because reproduction commences at sizes well below felling limits, or because, after logging, juveniles will be recruited to the sexually mature size classes.
   Strongly light-demanding species with a commercial value are most likely to suffer loss of genetic diversity from logging. Characteristically, these have populations in which only a small proportion of the total population lies in small size classes. In order to conserve genetic diversity, pre-felling silvicultural treatments will be required to increase the survival and growth of juveniles. Ecological and genetic research needs to focus on these light-demanding species. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper discusses power analysis in the context of sustainable forest management. It is suggested that a priori power analysis should be formally incorporated into the planning stage of all experiments designed to test whether forestry practices are sustainable. A priori power analysis enables researchers to estimate the probability of making a Type II error (i.e., finding no significant difference when one in fact exists). This information is critical in the statistical assessment of sustainable forestry, as unwittingly accepting a Type II error could result in poor management decisions. In addition, it is proposed that statistical assessments of sustainable forestry objectives can be more relevant if alpha (alpha) is liberated from its traditional value of 0.05. It is argued that in the context of sustainable forestry, making a Type II error can be more costly than making a Type I error. Consequently, it often makes sense for beta (fl) to be small (say 0.05) and alpha to take on a larger value. In other situations the cost of making a Type I error may be more important, thus a procedure which enables researchers to determine a locally relevant alpha:beta ratio is recommended.

AB We studied the influence of anthropogenic disturbance on forest structure and composition in the highly populated Montane Rain Forests of northern Chiapas, Mexico. We evaluated species richness, basal area and stem density on 81 circular plots (0.1 ha each) along a categorical disturbance gradient due to forest extraction, livestock grazing, and fires. A total of 116 tree species (>5 cm DBH) were recorded in three major forest types recognized by TWINSPAN. The three forest types were: Quercus-Podocarpus Forest (QPF), Pinus-Quercus-Liquidambar Forest (PQLF), and Pinus Forest (PF). The number of canopy and understory trees species, absolute density, and basal area decreased with disturbance intensity. Mean basal area of Pinus spp. was high at intermediate and severe disturbed sites (27 and 19 m(2) ha(-1), respectively), and low (0.2 m(2) ha(-1)) in well preserved old-growth stands. Distribution of life forms was heterogeneous among forest types, with a high number of understory trees species in QPF, and an impoverished composition in PF. A first axis obtained by factor analysis, represented a combination of anthropogenic disturbance along with environmental and structural variables. Scores of the first factor explained almost 50% of variation, and was positively correlated with livestock grazing, firewood extraction, basal area of Pinus spp. and soil pH, and negatively associated with elevation, plant cover and basal area of Quercus spp. A second factor explained an additional 12% of variation and was associated with forest fires and timber extraction. Distribution of size classes in the QPF was significantly different (p < 0.05) than in the other two forest types, including the largest individuals in all inventories. Our results suggest that small scale, but frequent anthropogenic disturbance, increases the dominance of Pinus and drastically decreases floristic richness, mostly understory trees. This points to the need of developing restoration practices aimed to attain highly diverse mixed forests from induced depauperate pinelands. On the other hand. the remnant MRF stands are currently under risk of deforestation in a highly populated Mayan territory, and their conservation under criteria of sustainable use may require finding alternative high value uses not included in conventional commercial forestry.

AB The minimum operating temperature for sustainable oxydehydrogenation of butene to butadiene over Fe2O3 can be reduced from ca. 300 degrees to less than or equal to 150 degreesC by including Pd in the catalyst formulation. This effect would not be predicted on the basis of the widely accepted redox mechanism for selective oxidation, in which transport of the essential oxide ions can become limiting at low temperatures. Temperature-programmed desorption and temporal analysis reveal that the selective oxygen within the Pd-Fe-O catalyst is localised near the surface, and can be replenished easily from the gas phase. The ability of Pd to activate oxygen at low temperatures is critical to the process of oxygen replenishment, but just as important, it promotes the removal of site-blocking species from the surface of the catalyst. We show that whereas unmodified alpha -Fe2O3 is in fact capable of converting 1-butene to 1,3-butadiene at temperatures as low as 150 degreesC, the activity is extremely short-lived because of the buildup of site-blocking carbonaceous species at this temperature. The addition of Pd enables the removal of these undesirable species at low temperatures. (C) 2001 Academic Press.

TI The importance of metallurgical coke for crude steel production
SO STAHL UND EISEN
LA English
DT Article
AB The blast furnace/oxygen converter route is and will remain dominant for crude steel production. Blast furnaces depend on a certain amount of coke for physical reasons. Steel companies tend to avoid the construction of new coking plants and coke has become an internationally traded product with 25 million t exported in 2000 seaborne or cross-boarder. China holds a share of 60% at total coke exports. China also will decline its coke production by 25 million t/a until 2005 due to the shut down and only partly replacement of "simple" cokemaking plants, On the long term a worldwide demand of 290 million t blast furnace coke and sinter plant coke breeze is anticipated for the steel industry in the world. To counteract possible coke shortfalls a further decrease of worldwide coke consumption in blast furnaces is one suitable way, but there is also need for modernization of overaged cokemaking capacities or the construction of new ones. Alternative coke-free iron ore reduction technologies do not exist today which could succeed in replacing modern, high performance blast furnaces for integrated steel works. It is recommendable that coking plants are integrated into the ideology of the steel industries' sustainable development on the one hand and on the other hand to critically observe the international coke market to realize and avoid monopols of individual coke suppliers.

AB The enzymatic transformation of poly(epsilon -caprolactone) (PCL) into repolymerizable oligomers in supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO(2)) using an enzyme was carried out in order to establish a sustainable chemical recycling system for PCL, which is a typical biodegradable synthetic plastic. The enzymatic conversion of PCL beads having an (M) over bar (n) of 110 000 using Candida antarctica lipase (lipase CA) in scCO(2) containing small amounts of water quantitatively afforded CL oligomers at 40 degreesC. The CL oligomers were readily repolymerized using the same enzyme to produce high-molecular weight PCL.

AB The complexity of agricultural systems and the need to fulfil multiple objectives in sustainable agro-ecosystems call for interdisciplinary analyzes and input from a wide variety of disciplines in order to better understand the complete agronomic production system. Systems approaches have been developed to support these interdisciplinary studies; their development and use have increased strongly in the past decades. Agronomic systems have pronounced spatial and temporal dimensions. Spatial aspects can be distinguished at crop, field, farm, regional and higher levels while processes at each spatial level have characteristic temporal components. Systems analysis in agronomic systems implies the use of various types of knowledge, such as expert knowledge including stakeholder expertise and knowledge derived from scientific measurements and model-simulations. The latter two can be derived from different types of studies: simple, rapid and cheap procedures, which are often relatively unreliable, at one end of the scale and complex, cumbersome and expensive data-intensive procedures at the other end. Selection of proper procedures for specific issues, both in terms of measurements and in applying simulation models, needs attention. Each problem requires its own research approach. Based on the output requirements and data availability, the proper systems approach has to be selected. Examples of these different procedures are given in this paper. Considering the type of problems to be studied in agronomic systems, different procedures can be followed to address the issues raised at a specific scale. These procedures start with a proper analysis of the system followed by studies that are projectory, exploratory, predictive, or are focused on decision support. Examples will be provided. Increasingly, systems approaches include stakeholders to fine-tune problem definition, the research itself, and the implementation of results. Stakeholders are farmers and citizens on farm and community levels and policy makers and planners at higher levels of aggregation. A comprehensive interdisciplinary analysis of agricultural production systems is seen as a necessary condition for the development of innovative, sustainable systems for the future. Systems for improving crop production systems are presented in this paper as well as applications of systems approaches at the farm and regional levels with emphasis on selecting the right approach.

AB Since environmental conservation has provoked much interest globally, indicators have been proposed for a wide range of different projects. The distinction between indicators is unclear. A project to clarify indicator issues was established by the European Union to link partners working with real data at a local level to highlight problems and discuss possibilities for rationalisation across systems. The major issues relate to indicator structure. They can have single or multiple components and be measured at different scales: local, community, regional, national and international. Many different frameworks exist and which may not be compatible. The quality of indicators across different systems, sectors and themes is reflected in the degree of difference in their definitions and calculation. Finally, the papers in this Special Issue are described. Appendix A gives a definition of an indicator. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

ID FISHERIES
AB Scientific programmes whose objectives are to provide pertinent knowledge and information for sustainable use of a natural resource always include data collection operations. Functions of the data collected axe obtained from surveys. These functions (estimators) are formulae constructed according to the survey's model defined by the design of the survey and the sample selection procedures. In complex designs, a 'superpopulation model' is always present. This model, accounting for available knowledge on the observed system, is defined by assumptions on the distribution of the collected data.
   Users consider not only the quality of the estimates (outputs of the survey) but also, and possibly primarily, the quality of these estimates as input (information) to their own decision frameworks, which also constitute a superpopulation model. Hence, a survey combines at least two models; a survey model and a user's model.
   These different models are discussed in this paper with the help of three examples that differ in the types of system under study, in the objectives of the surveys, and in the nature of the collected information, Specific functions of the collected survey data may be considered as estimators when considered as output of the survey model and as indicators when considered as input to the user's model.
   A user may build indicators from many sources of information and, as several different users may use the estimates, a survey is an element of an information system. Analysis of data leads to improved knowledge of the system under study and to the better identification of the various associated models. Therefore, surveys are elements of dynamic systems in which theory and practice are complementary. Although classical sampling theory often appears not to be sufficient in this global context, it remains necessary. The use of information from different sources to be used from different points of view implies an increased level of rigour with many models, all of which must be explicitly defined.

DE biodiversity; indicators; ecosystems sustainability
AB Indicators used by the "Harmony with Nature" chapter of the "4th State of the Nation Report" (SOTNR) for monitoring biodiversity in Costa Rica were reviewed in order to assess its value as a monitoring tool. They were compared with the framework and indicators proposed by the Subsidiary Body on Scientific, Technical and Technological Advice (SBSTTA) of the Convention on Biological Diversity of which Costa Rica is a party. The SOTNR included state, pressure and use-response indicators for four different types of ecosystems: forest, marine-coastal, freshwater and agricultural systems. However, very few indicators related to species and genetic level were available. More information and indicators for forest and agricultural systems existed than for other types of ecosystems. Some indicators-ecosystems quantity, population density or infrastructure-were not desegregated by type of ecosystem. A main limitation of the report was the non-availability of ecosystem quality indicators. Suggestions are made for the inclusion of a fuller set of indicators to ensure that impact and sustainability can be monitored comprehensively at different levels of scale.

DE degraded ecosystems; livestock; Tanzania; environmental indicators;
   socio-economic indicators
AB This paper documents the events leading to the imminent collapse of an attempt to rehabilitate a degraded ecosystem in central Tanzania, focusing on the consequences of the failure to systematically monitor socio-economic and environmental indicators. A decision was taken in 1979 to evict all grazing livestock from a 1200 km(2) semi-arid area, the so-called Kondoa Closed Area, in central Tanzania due to their destructive effect on contour ridges and bunds that had been constructed in an attempt to arrest land degradation. Although the closure was successful in that the vegetation quickly regenerated and soil erosion was arrested, the evictions resulted in severe hardship for the agro-pastoralists in the area. As a result, it was decided a decade later to allow the reintroduction of cattle on condition that they were totally confined and were of improved dairy breeds. Although performance and economic data have generally been positive, the top-down approach to the introduction of the cows, the lack of baseline data, followed by the withdrawal of external funding, have resulted in increased illegal free-grazing and the near collapse of the attempt to convert a degraded ecosystem to sustainable use. It is concluded that the probable collapse of the ecosystem in the Kondoa Closed Area is a result of the initial top-down approach to the introduction and implementation of the project, inadequate monitoring of socio-economic and environmental indicators, and ultimately to the withdrawal of donor funding.

AB This paper examines indicators and methods currently used in intercropping research. A review of papers in Experimental Agriculture and Journal of Agricultural Science (Cambridge) in the years 1990-1999 gave 50 papers on intercropping from which 72 experiments were examined. The objectives of experiments, apart from virtually all being concerned with crop yield under intercropping, were dominated by interest in management methods affecting intercropping benefit, with concerns about the economic analysis of intercropping benefits and of the sustainability of tested systems and in the mechanisms underlying intercropping effects. Concerns about stability and sustainability were not as central as might have been expected. Few experiments were mainly concerned with exploring the way in which species interact in mixture as an explanation of intercropping effects (e.g. through manipulation of the timing of planting or examination of root and shoot competition). Close to half the studies used the additive series design with pairwise, replacement series and response model designs each accounting for about 17% of cases. Only two studies measured at the level of the individual plant and only two studies included initial indicators of plant size or other biological starting point. Analysis of the combination of experimental design used, the measurements taken and the statistical analysis performed showed that while most experiments could provide some valid indicators and thus inferences on crop yields few of them could be used to address questions on the inter- and intraspecific interactions leading to the intercropping outcomes. The duration of experiments was 1 year for about half of experiments involving annual species only and about one-third of experiments involving at least one perennial species. The overall conclusion is that considerable care needs to taken to ensure that the indicators and experimental methods used are appropriate to the development and testing of sustainable systems based on intercropping.

AB Agricultural sustainability depends to a great extent upon the maintenance of soil health. There is no single measurement that can be made for its quantification although certain soil biophysical and chemical characteristics are found to be key potential indicators of soil health. An agricultural sustainability index (ASI) is proposed to measure agricultural sustainability as a function of biophysical, chemical, economic and social indicators.
   It was tested on a regional dataset from China. It showed marked changes in sustainability over a 9-year period and between regions within the coastal zone. This index appears promising for assessing agricultural sustainability. It permits the comparison of relative sustainability of different agroecosystems and can be used to compare agricultural sustainability across regions, although care must be taken in the choice of rating scale for the component indicators and further research in this is needed.

AB The paper deals with the necessity of the further development of forest management in Germany towards strategic management. Firstly, relevant elements of the instruments of strategic management are stated and it is analysed in which way traditional forest management, the classical combined method, implies strategic components and which importance these components lastly had in the practical application of forest management. It is obvious that forest management has been widely reduced to operative, single-stand oriented planning and that the strategic components have been completely neglected. Mainly the overall planning (sustainability control) that is still relying on inherited sustainability control indices is thereby degenerated to a ritual. This general insufficiency in the strategic area cannot be compensated by planning on strata level that has recently been introduced in some parts of Germany. Central part of the paper is the presentation of a new concept of forest management as a strategic management tool. Within this new concept strata-planning, co-ordination of utilization and simulation replace the classical elements (single-stand planning, domain-planning and overall planning). Within the co-ordination of utilization the technical progress in the field of GIS-planning and 3-D-visualization should be used to develop an integrated planning system for participatory planning. Methods of multi-criteria decision making should be used to take into account and weight arguments and preferences of different stakeholders within a participatory planning approach.

AB Urban metabolism measures quantitatively a city's load on the natural environment. We update the Newcombe et al. (3) pioneering study of Hong Kong's urban metabolism in 1971, highlighting trends in resource consumption and waste generation. Per capita food, water and materials consumption have surged since the early 1970s by 20%, 40%, and 149%, respectively. Tremendous pollution has accompanied this growing affluence and materialism, and total air emissions, CO2 Outputs, municipal solid wastes, and sewage discharges have risen by 30%, 250%, 245%, and 153%. As a result, systemic overload of land, atmospheric and water systems has occurred. While some strategies to tackle deteriorating environmental quality have succeeded, greater and more far-reaching changes in consumer behavior and government policy are needed if Hong Kong is to achieve its stated goal of becoming "a truly sustainable city" in the 21(st) century.

TI Local labour markets and the reconfiguration of the sugar industry in
   Northeast Brazil
SO ANTIPODE
LA English
DT Article
ID UNSUSTAINABILITY; CONTRACTS
AB This paper focuses on a set of debates surrounding the working of local labour markets in the depressed sugarcane sector of Pernambuco, which faces strong competition from the Centre-South of Brazil. Millowner, planter, labour and union perspectives on current problems in the sugar industry and their solution are reviewed, with particular reference to issues of low productivity, access to land and the potential for diversification out of sugar. Historical antagonisms between (white) landowner classes and (black) labour, and their reworking in recent years, complicated by competing economic rationalities between these groups, make progress towards viable, sustainable socioeconomic improvement difficult. Employer attempts at reconfiguration of the labour market by relocating sites of labour reproduction (thereby breaking old social attachments) while retaining control over tabour at sites of production bring continued conflict with the unions.

TI Feasibility of hoop structures for market swine in Iowa: Pig
   performance, pig environment, and budget analysis
SO APPLIED ENGINEERING IN AGRICULTURE
LA English
DT Article
DE alternative swine production; bedded swine housing; hoop structure;
   animal housing
AB Hoop structures are large simple, tent-like shelters that can be used for pigs. The pigs are kept inside the hoop structure and large bales, e.g. straw or cornstalks, are used for bedding. A typical hoop structure (10 x 30 m) holds about 200 market pigs. Bedding is added every two to six weeks as needed until the pigs are marketed at which time clean out occurs. Three demonstrational trials were conducted in Iowa. The pigs were fed from 26 to 117 kg. Pig performance in hoops was acceptable (ADG = .83 kg/d, FE = 3.42 kg feed/kg gain) with 9% poorer feed efficiency in winter. Growth rate was equal to or slightly more than typical for pigs in conventional confinement. Pig mortality was less than 3%. Average bedding use was 100 kg per pig in winter and 55 kg per pig in summer. The hoop manure can be composted readily. The bedding pack was variable with some areas actively composting on site in the hoop, generating temperatures zip to 62 degreesC. An economic analysis showed similar total costs of production with the hoops having lower fixed costs and higher variable costs than in conventional confinement. The higher variable costs are due to bedding and extra feed and labor Hoop structures offer a feasible alternative production system for sustainable swine production in Iowa and surrounding areas.

AB In the general context of the search of a quality index for soil as an indicator of sustainable management, we analyzed a soil recently subjected to agriculture from the "El Salado" river basin (Buenos Aires, Argentina) under no-till or conventional tillage (CT). We sought to detect whether a pattern of interactions among microbial, biochemical and physico-chemical variables in soil exists that may be distinguished and characterized. Several microbial groups, enzymatic activities and O-2 and CO2 exchange rates were monitored before planting (T-0) and during the growth cycle of soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) (T-1: flowering stage; T-2: pre-harvest period). Strong relationships were evidenced by correlation r (r(2)) matrices performed with several specific groups of bacteria and fungi, and soil enzymatic activities representative of main nutrient cycles (C, N, P). A burst of biological activity was registered at T, as could be judged through: (i) a remarkable increase in the numbers of microorganisms measured at both depths tested (D-1: 5-10 cm; D-2: 15-20 cm); (ii) a peak of O-2 consumption; (iii) a maximal gradient of activity exhibited by all enzymes tested (acid and alkaline phosphatases, dehydrogenase, FDA hydrolysis, beta-glucosidase, urease). Microorganisms stratified as a function of depth particularly at T-0 and T-2, whereas at T-1 they appeared to transiently redistribute in the 5-20 cm profile unlike all enzymatic activities that showed a maximal stratification. Low respiratory quotients, RQ (congruent to0.2; RQ, defined as the ratio of q(CO2) over q(O2)), were found, following an experimental method for quantifying rates of O-2 consumption, q(O2), and CO2 production, q(CO2), by soil, and a mathematical model developed by ourselves to interpret the data [Soil Sci. 166 (2001) 68]. The biodiversity of fungi increased 16% at T-2 with respect to T-0 along with a 37% increment in species richness. The fact that several of the variables measured were strongly linked despite season and crop presence, points to the existence of a core of highly interrelated processes in soil.

ID UK; TRENDS
AB Air pollution in England and Wales is reviewed to identify priorities for management and research. The main human drivers of emissions are the production and consumption of energy and materials, disposal of waste, transport and land use. Pollutants are assigned to seven types: (i) nuisance (e.g. odour, noise), (ii) toxic, (iii) acidifying/eutrophying, (iv) photochemical oxidant precursors, (v) radionuclides, (vi) stratospheric ozone depleting substances and (vii) greenhouse gases. Dominant trends in activity and emissions are highlighted. New technologies and fuels are partially decoupling emissions from activity in power generation, industry and transport, but the gains are being offset by growth in demand and output in all major sectors. The evidence for impacts on human health, the atmosphere and other environmental systems is discussed. Priorities for management are climate change, ground-level ozone, acidification and eutrophication by nitrogen, urban air quality and nuisance pollution. Management responses require greater foresight, technological improvements and new instruments to control polluting activities. More scientific information is needed on the impacts on human health, quality or life and ecosystems, and on the links between different types of pollution. The policy challenges include generating energy sustainably, reducing transport impacts, devising effective economic instruments, improving societal awareness and contributing to cleaner global development.

AB Creeping thistle or Canada thistle, Cirsium arvense (L.) Scop., is considered one of the world's worst weeds and the third most important weed in Europe. Biological control of this indigenous weed in Europe by use of native agents may provide a low-cost alternative to use of chemical or mechanical control measures and contribute to a more sustainable weed management. We investigated the potential of a shoot-base boring weevil, Apion onopordi Kirby (Coleoptera: Apionidae), for biological weed control, in the presence or absence of plant competition by three grass species. Infestation of thistle shoots by A onopordi at natural infestation levels reduced above- and belowground plant performance after 2 years. Plant competition at natural levels had an overall greater effect than that of herbivory, significantly reducing both above- and belowground thistle performance in both years, thereby slowing the propagation of the weed. Weevil infestation and grass competition had a synergistic effect on C. arvense growth; the combined effects of the two factors was greater than the sum of both single-factor effects. The experiment revealed that A. onopordi promotes systemic infections of the rust fungus Puccinia punctiformis (Str.) Rohl in the year following weevil infestation. Systemically infected thistle shoots died before the end of the growing season. Although the direct effect of A. onopordi may not be sufficient to control creeping thistle, the synergistic interaction with plant competition and the indirect effect via promotion of systemic rust infections makes A. onopordi a promising agent for the biological control of this weed.

AB Crop residues are a vital organic resource and their extensive use in soil management for sustainable agriculture is widely advocated. The effects of soybean residue (SR) and wheat residue (WR) applied alone or in combination with fertilizer P (FP) on dynamics of labile P, distribution of P fractions and P sorption in a Vertisol (Typic Haplustert) were assessed in a 16 week long incubation study. The amount of P added through crop residues, FP or their combination was kept constant at 10 mg P kg(-1) soil. Addition of SR or WR resulted in net increase of labile inorganic (P-i) and organic (P-o) P, and microbial P throughout the incubation period, except that the WR decreased labile P-i during the first two weeks due to P-i immobilization. Integration of FP with SR had no added benefit compared to SR alone. while use of FP + WR proved better in ensuring short-term P availability by offsetting initial P immobilization associated with WR alone. Sequential fractionation of soil P at the end of 16 weeks showed that addition of SR and WR alone or in combination with FP favoured a build-up in labile P-i and P-o (NaHCO3-P-i and -P-o), and moderately labile P-o (NaOH-P-o) fractions at the expense of recalcitrant P (HCl-P). The P sorption capacity of soil and P required to maintain optimum solution P concentration of 0.2 mg P l(-1) also decreased with addition of these crop residues. The implication of the results of this study is that soybean and wheat residues can potentially improve soil P fertility by increasing labile P-i and P-o, and moderately labile P-o fractions, decreasing P sorption and concomitantly causing dissolution of recalcitrant P in soil.

AB The viability of vermireactors fed with different proportions of water hyacinth (WH) and cowdung (CD) was assessed over six-month trials. All reactors performed sustainably with a steadily rising vermicast output, worm zoomass, and number of offspring. There was no mortality in any of the reactors. A change in the WH:CD ratios from 4:1 to 6:1 had no discernable impact on the reactor performances. Attempts were also made to improve the efficiency of the reactors in terms of vermicast production per unit time and per unit digester volume. These attempts led to the 'high-rate' vermireactor in which 5.6 times greater vermicast was produced per litre of digester volume per day than in the 'low-rate' reactors. The high-rate vermireactors also performed sustainably, with steady vermicast output, animal growth, and reproduction. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB We present a Bayesian approach of a Ricker stock-recruitment (S/R) analysis accounting for measurement errors on S/R data. We assess the sensitivity of posterior inferences to (i) the choice of Ricker model parameterizations, with special regards to management-related ones, and (ii) prior parameter distributions. Closed forms for Ricker parameter posterior distributions exist given S/R data known without error. We use this property to develop a procedure based on the Rao-Blackwell formula. This procedure achieves integration of measurement errors by averaging these closed forms over possible S/R data sets sampled from distributions derived from a stochastic model relating field data to the S and R variables. High-quality Bayesian estimates are obtained. The analysis of the influence of different parameterizations and of the priors is made easier. We illustrate our methodological approach by a case study of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar). Posterior distributions for S and R are computed from a mark-recapture stochastic model. Ignoring measurement errors underestimates parameter uncertainty and overestimates both stock productivity and density dependence. We warn against using management-related parameterizations because it makes the strong prior assumption of long-term sustainability of stocks. Posterior inferences are sensitive to the choice of prior. The use of informative priors as a remedy is discussed.

AB Most studies on investment evaluation mainly focus on enterprise economic benefits only, without process operability and sustainability considered. In this paper, we suggest that investment evaluation in process industries should be executed under three strategic objectives enterprise benefits, social benefits and customer benefits. A systematic investment evaluation and decision-making method with a four-step procedure based on the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) is proposed to evaluate various qualitative and quantitative elements with various criteria. At the first step, the decision hierarchy is constructed under the three strategic objectives. Second, pair-wise comparison is utilized to evaluate the weights of elements and criteria. Third, qualitative elements are quantified by pair-wise comparison and quantitative elements axe re-scaled by a uniform criterion. At the last, the best choice is made through synthesizing values upward in the hierarchy. An investment decision support system (DSS) is developed based on Microsoft Excel, and applied to a retrofit investment of united fluid catalytic cracking(FCC) and liquefied gas separation process in a refinery plant.

TI The mineral processor and the environment: Waste to resources
SO CIM BULLETIN
LA English
DT Article
AB In the past, we have paid more attention to product than to waste. Unfortunately, the nature of our industry is such that we must extract small amounts of values locked in huge quantities of waste rock. This paper presents an overview of how today, the mineral processor is collaborating with engineers in the mines, smelters, and refineries to generate products of value and treat waste as a secondary resource, The solid wastes, and liquid and gaseous effluents can be processed and utilized as value-added products while significantly reducing the harmful discharges, This leads to a sustainable harnessing of our mineral resources in using novel technologies to protect the environment and human health.
   The topics of interests and issues presented in this paper are as follows: sources of wastes; disposal options; recycling of automobiles and electronic scrap using mineral processing techniques; the role of the mineral processor in the 502 abatement program in the minerals industry; the application of mineral processing techniques in other industries; tailings to resources (two major Canadian examples); environment backfill research at Laurentian University (the author's own research and specific field of expertise).

DT Article
AB Within the framework of the Zel'dovich-Frank-Kamenetskii theory of thermal propagation of flame, thermodynamic properties of an open nonlinear system are considered, and nonequilibrium entropy of a steady combustion wave is constructed. The nonequilibrium dynamic system is analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively, and the distribution functions of local entropy production in terms of the spatial variable are constructed. It is shown that total entropy production in the system is a functional on integral curves that possess extreme properties, and its minimum corresponds to a unique physically sustainable solution of the problem. The procedure of "cutting" (vanishing) of the reaction rate is justified by methods of nonequilibrium thermodynamics. A variational formulation of the problem is presented for calculation of a steady combustion wave.

AB The whitefly Bemisia tabaci Genn. is a pervasive pest and vector of plant viruses. The existence of B. tabaci biotypes and numerous whitefly-transmitted geminiviruses (begomoviruses) affecting food and industrial crops has become a major constraint to agricultural development in tropical and subtropical regions of the world. The predominant whitefly and begomovirus method of control has been the application of insecticides. The excessive use of agrochemicals over the past decades. has contributed to an exponential increase in B. tabaci populations and incidence of begomoviruses transmitted by this whitefly vector. Under these conditions, biological and integrated whitefly/geminivirus control practices have not met expectations. Incorporating begomovirus resistance in a relatively small number of crops improved by conventional plant breeding methods has been a sustainable and efficient disease control strategy. This review discusses some of the conventional intra- and interspecific hybridization strategies followed to incorporate genetic resistance to begomoviruses in three major crops: cassava, common bean and tomato.

AB Significant advances in the role of gastric surgery in the management of disease in the past year have focused on three broad areas: morbid obesity, gastric cancer, and peptic ulcer disease. Although vertical banded gastroplasty and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass are the two procedures most commonly used in the United States to induce weight loss in the morbidly obese patient, long-term follow-up continues to support the durability of the gastric bypass in maintaining a sustainable outcome with a minimum of complications. It is not surprising, therefore, that increasing interest has accrued in simplifying this operation and decreasing potential complications even further by employing laparoscopic technology. In the area of gastric cancer, several reports have provided important new information regarding its pathogenesis, factors influencing long-term survival, and strategies for management when diagnosed early. Finally, in patients developing the complications of peptic ulcer disease (eg, obstruction and perforation), conservative management has been emphasized over more radical traditional approaches. This review highlights these advances. Curr Opin Gastroenterol 2001, 17:533-539 (C) 2001 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.

AB Given the expanding HIV epidemic among injecting drug users (IDUs) in Eastern Europe, there is a greater focus on harm reduction activities among IDUs. The aim of this study was to undertake an economic analysis of a harm reduction intervention in Belarus. The paper examines the nature and implementation of project activities, measures the costs of these activities, and then highlights key factors influencing the replication of these activities elsewhere. The cost analysis was performed to assess the resources required to implement the project and its unit costs. The main activities were: promotion of safe use of syringes; collection of dirty needles; promotion of safe sex; medical assistance in case of sexually transmitted diseases; psychological and legal support; and outreach services by volunteers. Total financial and economic costs were $28, 524 and $32,768, respectively. When donated mass media services were included, economic costs total $148,617. The financial and economic (with mass media) unit costs ranged from $0.32 to 1.68 per disposable syringe distributed and $0.98 to 5.10 per contact. Total costs were sensitive to the valuation of mass media services. However, it is unclear to what extent mass media would have been used if the project had borne the costs. This issue is crucial when considering the sustainability and replication of similar projects elsewhere.

SO EASTERN EUROPEAN ECONOMICS

DT Article
AB We address the question of the exchange rate regime for the Czech Republic before it enters the EU and the EMU. We classify the macroeconomic impacts of a single currency regime according to the traditional OCA theory. Using quantitative measures, we find the degree of macroeconomic convergence between the Czech and German (EU) economies high enough not to form a major obstacle to a fixed currency regime.
   In addition, we look at the transitional specificities of the Czech economy. We analyze the real appreciation of the Czech currency and its relationship to competitiveness and find that the development of cost factors exercises downward pressures on the exchange rate. Conversely, a fixed regime may alleviate the problem of foreign capital inflows and the ensuing nominal appreciation-another idiosyncrasy of the Czech economy. However, once labor market rigidities are removed, a fixed regime may become the source of a sustainable competitive advantage, growth, and convergence.

ID CARBON; ACCUMULATION
AB The sustainability argument that more peat grows in Finland than is used does not hold. On designated peatlands, growth is about 85 times slower than peat use; growth elsewhere in Finland does not add to available resources. Claiming undisturbed peatlands as carbon sinks for sustainable peat use is also misleading as anthropogenic carbon sources require additional sinks, not natural ones. Undisturbed peatlands usually emit significant quantities of methane. About 57 000 km(2) of forestry drained peatlands now have effectively stopped emitting methane, and temporarily accumulate more carbon annually than earlier. These greenhouse reducing aspects are only modestly compensated or 'used' by emissions from peat used for energy. However, as forests mature and the peat underneath continues to oxidise, the new carbon sink will eventually turn into a carbon source. Multiple claims of this very same anthropogenic carbon sink (perhaps by the peat, paper and timber industry), i.e. double counting, may be avoided by certifying these sinks. After peat harvesting (liberating in the order of 375 kg atmospheric carbon per m(2)), wood in a production/harvest cycle may be grown (at 0.1 kgC/m(2) per a) on the now available area, as a renewable energy source. These numbers indicate the slow rate at which these cycles, that are in principle carbon neutral in themselves, help compensate for the carbon emissions from the earlier use of peat by avoiding the emissions of fossil fuels otherwise used.

ID MERCURY; EXPOSURE; AMAZON; SECTOR; GROWTH
AB Natural resource booms have been central to conservation and development in resource-rich Latin American countries, yet the origin of these events remains poorly understood. Understanding the socioeconomic drivers of resource booms is important because such sudden increases in natural resources extraction are usually ecologically and economically unsustainable. This paper analyzes the socioeconomic drivers of small-scale gold mining, which is degrading ecological resources and the health of people in the Amazon region. Two conventional hypotheses are tested: (1) International prices of gold drive the Amazon gold rush, and (2) National economic recession encourages small-scale gold mining. A simple empirical model is presented to link the gold mining histories of local miners to international and national trends. The analysis indicates that theories that explain corporately-driven resource extraction may not apply to the behavior of small-scale producers. It appears that extractive booms that are driven by local resource users can occur independently of global price markets. The Suriname case further suggests that inhibited national economic development can be the cause of a natural resource boom, and not only a consequence as some researchers propose. The author concludes that conservation policies for Suriname should act to stabilize the national economy and to promote more sustainable mining methods. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB The information-hierarchical approach is used to analyze the evolutionary developed organization of biosphere. Hierarchical levels of this entire organization as well as information relationships of biosphere cyclic development have been elucidated. These levels exhibit an increasing integration, and the lower ones therewith represent the information-hierarchical organization of cell metabolism. The concept of `biosphere clock' in particular cases known as biological clocks has been proposed. Biosphere clock cyclically counts off the biospheric (biological) time at each hierarchical level from molecular to ecosystem ones. Time cycles of each level operation are included into a greater cycle of the next level according to the specific schemes defined by the formerly established information principle of natural system development. As a consequence, the duration of such incorporated cycles is fixed and equals 1, 6, 40 seconds, 24 hours, 3, 100 days, 33, 1000 years, etc. of biological time, respectively; the case is similar to 1 s, 1 min, 1 h, 1 day and other periods used in traditional counting of physical time. New fields of scientific investigations such as informative biochemistry, ecology and biology are defined. All relationships of information-hierarchical organization should be sustained for biosphere functioning. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper presents a full characterization of the equilibrium value set of a Ramsey tax model. More generally, it develops a dynamic programming method for a class of policy games between the government and a continuum of households. By selectively incorporating Euler conditions into a strategic dynamic programming framework, we wed two technologies that are usually considered competing alternatives, resulting in a substantial simplification of the problem.

AB Ecosystem nutrient use efficiency-the ratio of net primary productivity to soil nutrient supply-is an integrative measure of ecosystem functioning. High productivity and nutrient retention in natural systems are frequently attributed to high species diversity, even though some single-species systems can be highly productive and effective at resource capture. We investigated the effects of both individual species and life-form diversity on ecosystem nutrient use efficiency using model tropical ecosystems comprised of monocultures of three tree species and polycultures in which each of the tree species was coplanted with species of two additional life forms. Tree species significantly influenced nutrient use efficiency by whole ecosystems in monocultures; however, in polycultures, the additional life forms interacted with the influence exerted by the dominant tree. Furthermore, the presence of the additional life forms significantly increased nutrient uptake and uptake efficiency, but in only two of the three systems and 2 of the 4 years of the study period. These results indicate that the effect of life-form diversity on ecosystem functioning is not constant and that there may be temporal shifts in the influence exerted by different components of the community. Furthermore, although species (and life forms) exerted considerable influence on ecosystem nutrient use efficiency, this efficiency was most closely related to soil nutrient availability. These findings demonstrate that ecosystem nutrient use efficiency is an outcome not only of the characteristics of the species or tife forms that comprise the system but also of factors that affect soil nutrient supply. The results argue against the simple upward scaling of nutrient use efficiency from leaves and plants to ecosystems.

DT Article
AB Recent US traffic growth is summarized and its causes discussed, emphasizing the complex causal linkages between automobile travel and the underlying land use patterns that shape it. This causal framework is used to frame a discussion of how the demands for vehicle travel might be reduced through suitable land use impacting policy instruments. This includes instruments that alter the location, mix and intensity of traffic generating and attracting land use, as well as instruments that affect land development through the supply of added transportation capacity. The existing scientific evidence for the effects of land development patterns on aggregate vehicle miles of travel is found to be of limited use at the present time. For the most part this results from past data limitations and because of the variety of both spatial and temporal scales across which such data needs to be collected and analyzed. It is also concluded that successful travel reduction policies are likely to evolve as part of a broader public policy debate over quality of life issues, notably those involving "urban sprawl" and the balance of economic development against environmental sustainability. The full costs of expanding while also maintaining the current automobile dominated transportation infrastructure may also provide an economic rationale for change. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

TI Learning through visual systems to enhance the urban planning process
SO ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING B-PLANNING & DESIGN
LA English
DT Article
AB The number of web-based systems for urban planning using virtual reality (VR) and/or geographical information systems (GIS) is increasing rapidly. With increasing Internet access, a majority of the urban population will be potential users of urban planning systems in the near future. In this paper, we describe a methodology for analysing these systems. Our particular interest is the potential for such systems to be agents for change in attitudes and decisionmaking in urban lifestyles and urban policy. Our premise is that such change will come about only through widely held consensus. The building of this consensus is seen as a learning process. Thus, the construction of our methodology relies on well-established theories of learning. We also relate aspects of learning systems to the features of Internet, VR, and GIS technologies used to build models. We assess these models as virtual city models and models for public participation. We reflect on the potential of future models to build up a 'learning society' equipped to understand and act on complex urban problems such as sustainable development.

AB The Drama basin is a typical intermontane basin (2,300 km(2)) in northern Greece filled with detrital and lacustrine sediments containing peat/lignite seams. In the southwestern part of the basin (Philippi sub-basin) peat accumulated practically until the present. Specific conductivity and pH, as well as contents of major ions and trace elements have been determined in 20 surface and shallow groundwater samples collected across the basin. Water composition reflects the dominance of carbonate rocks in the whole basin. Peat oxidation an mineralization contribute to poor element enrichment of the Philippi sub-basin surface water derived from both the organic and inorganic peat fractions. Anthropogenic activities (waste water effluents and rubbish dumps) increase Mn, P, B, and Br concentrations. Only Mn exceeds EC recommendations (50 mug/l) in some places. There is also a slight increase in Na+ and Cl- contents. Improving measures in the management of point pollution sources should be a priority to warrant the sustainable exploitation of water resources in the Drama basin.

AB Increases in water resources development and utilization over the last 30 years have led to significant environmental and hydrological degradation of the Tarim River basin. Water discharge in the lower reaches has been seriously compromised. A total of 300 km of the lower reach has been drained between the 1950s and 1970s. The water table fell from 2-3 to 4-10 m between the years 1960 and 1980, and the annual rate of fall of the water table was 20 cm from 1980 to the present. The area populated by Populus euphtatica has declined by two thirds and the biomass has decreased by half between the years 1958 and 1978 in the Tarim River basin. From the 1950s to the 1990s, the area of P. euphratica/E. angustifolia forest, the main tree species of the region, declined by 3,820 km(2) in the lower reaches of the Tarim River basin, while the shrub and meadow area declined by 200 km(2). Such hydrological changes have resulted in a marked degradation of aquatic habitats and have caused substantial land desertification. A total of 12,300 km(2) of desertified lands formed between the 1960s and 1990s. During the past 30 years, the salt content of the Tarim River has increased gradually according to observational data from the Alar Hydrological Station. The maximum salt content in 1960 was 1.28 g L-1, but in 1981-1984 it reached 4.0 g L-1, and in 1998 was 7.8 g L-1. Based on the present organic carbon content in desertified lands, total emissions of C into the atmosphere in the last 30 years have been 112.2 Tg, representing 28.3% of organic carbon in the 0-1.0 m soil layer due to the hydrological degradation. Among factors contributing to these problems, human activities are foremost. Solving these problems will require raising the level of scientific and technological expertise in the monitoring, conservation, protection, and rehabilitation of water resources and associated habitats. Presently the greatest priority is to expand and improve water conservation studies.

AB An energy analysis was used to estimate nonmarket values under various land cover scenarios in the Mississippi Delta. Land loss since 1900 has led to a decline in nonmarket values from $3.1 billion/year in 1900 to $2.5 billion in 1990, resulting in a total loss of $29.4 billion, This loss is concentrated in the Barataria-Terrebonne basins, where nonmarket value has dropped from $1.6 billion/year in 1956 to $1.3 billion/year in 1988. Although values are projected to increase in the Atchafalaya basin (from $723 million/year in 1988 to $756 million/year in 2058), total nonmarket value for the Louisiana coast is projected to decrease to $2.1 billion/year under currently approved levels of restoration.

ID CAPACITY
AB Suggestions for transforming ecological sustainability into operative social choice mechanisms can be viewed through the bifocal lens of limits on, and opportunities for, the ecological state. Using lines of reasoning brought in from the comparative study of environmental policy, this article tries to stake out how far the ecological state can go in pursuing objectives of sustainable development without intruding on values and objectives fundamental to democracy. The article discusses social choice mechanisms in terms of the ecological state's authority, management capacities, effectiveness, and legitimacy, drawing up the image of the ecological state as a 'green fist in a velvet glove' with the ultimate objective of integrating 'ecological' evaluations into the public mind so that they become as 'natural' as those 'economic' criteria presently applied. Concluding that such 'ecological' consciousness involves a great leap in ecological information processing and dissemination within and throughout societies, the article invokes the sustainability and success of democratic social welfare states which base authoritative command on enlightened debate and deliberation as evidence that such a leap can be successfully made through processes of informed consensus.

AB The trend in environmental management toward more adaptive, community-based, and holistic approaches will require new approaches to environmental valuation. In this paper, we offer a new valuation approach, one that embodies the core principles of adaptive management, which is experimental, multiscalar, and place-based. In addition, we use hierarchy theory to incorporate spatial and temporal variability of natural systems into a multi-scalar management model. Our approach results in the consideration of multiple values within community-based ecosystem management, rather than an attempt to maximise a single variable such as economic efficiency. We then offer two heuristics - one procedural and one evaluative - to guide a community toward shared goals, and to develop indicators to measure progress toward these goals. We illustrate our approach by application to environmental and developmental decisions in the Southern Appalachians.

AB There has been an increasing plea for a participatory approach to development programs. It is argued that for programs to be sustainable, they need to be conceptualized, negotiated and run by all stakeholders jointly. Concurrent with this trend, there has been an increasing demand for program evaluation strategies, which encompass an evaluation of the nature and level of participation of the different stakeholders in the program. This paper proposes a theoretical framework for such evaluation and subsequently provides a practical illustration. Engestrom's notions of 'activity system' and 'learning by expanding', are proposed as a framework for the evaluation of participation and an action evaluation methodology is suggested as the practical tool within such framework. The paper presents a case study of a conservation education program in Africa, which operationalizes the proposed theoretical framework. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The adoption of ecosystem-based management strategies focuses attention on the need for broad scale estimates of ecological conditions; this poses two challenges for the science community: estimating broad scale ecosystem conditions from highly disparate data, often observed at different spatial scales, and interpreting these conditions relative to goals such as sustainability. The Interior Columbia Basin Ecosystem Management Project (ICBEMP), estimated relative composite ecological integrity by clustering conditions among proxy variables representing three component integrity ratings (forestland, rangeland, and aquatic integrity). Composite ecological integrity provides an estimate of relative system condition within the interior Columbia River basin assessment area that is responsive to changes in broad scale land management practices. Broad-scale measures can be used to assess progress toward land management goals or as an aide for managers in selecting or prioritizing areas (watersheds) for treatment. Currently, federal land managers are using estimates of current composite ecological integrity and trends in ecological integrity to prioritize management activities and understand effects of management actions.

AB Integrating management actions to consistently achieve broad ecological and socioeconomic goals is a challenge largely unmet. The presumed or real conflict between these goals establishes a forum for debate. Broad measures are needed to describe tradeoffs, trends in conditions under varying management scenarios, and a transparent science underpinning. The Interior Columbia Basin Ecosystem Management Project in the northwestern United States provides a useful example where scientists, managers, and the public have explored these issues in depth. From a science perspective we conclude that a successful strategy for broad-scale land management will need the ability to do the following: maintain long-term sustainability of resources and ecosystems; maintain socioeconomic resiliency; continually assess results of management activities; manage risks and opportunities through consistent approaches at multiple scales; expand our knowledge base; and adaptively manage for new knowledge and assessments of resource conditions/capabilities.

ID FUTURE
AB In Europe, forest policy discussions are moving towards a European Union-wide strategy. This will further intensify the relations between European countries in the field of forests and forest management. European-wide forest planning and decision-making require that policy makers have insight into the long-term development of European forests under alternative regimes. The European Forest Information Scenario Model (EFISCEN) was used to make projections of the development of the European forests under four scenarios: (1) business as usual; (2) EFISCEN European timber trend studies (ETTS); (3) maximum sustainable production; and (4) multifunctional management. The simulations were carried out for 30 countries individually, i.e. harmonized scenarios were run, but the special circumstances and demands that play a role in each country were taken into account. The simulations covered 139.2 million ha increasing to 143 million ha in 2050. The initial year varied per country, but was mostly in the region of 1990. The average age of European forests was 57 years in 1990 with a mean growing stock of 142 m(3) ha(-1). The results showed that the future European total fellings may vary between a stable amount of 400 million m(3) year(-1) in the 'business as usual' scenario to 647 million m(3) year(-1) in the 'maximum sustainable production' scenario. The other two scenarios incorporated a 9% gradual increase in fellings over the first 30 years of the simulation period (i.e. 0.3% year(-1)). The average growing stock will rise to approximately 250 m(3) ha(-1) in 2050,with the exception being the 'maximum sustainable production' scenario, in which the growing remains at approximately 137 m(3) ha(-1). The average net annual increment remains at approximately 5 m(3) ha(-1) year(-1) throughout the simulation period, almost irrespective of the scenario. In the multifunctional scenario, special attention was paid to nature values by increasing the area of strict reserves from 4 million ha in 1990 to 12.3 million ha in 2050 (8.6% of the total forest area). The assumed increase in fellings of 0.3% year(-1) appeared possible in combination with this area of reserves. The simulations showed that growing stock development and increment development differed very much for each country separately per scenario. Therefore, the results show a strong need for maintaining the national diversity that constitutes European forestry within harmonized European-wide forest management strategies. In this article, we address what the consequences of each scenario are for wood production, biodiversity, and environmental functions of the forest. The results provide policy makers with a challenge on whether to intervene in the ongoing trend of build-up of growing stock and whether to choose for biodiversity, for increased use of domestically produced wood products, or a combination of these, but spatially separated.

AB This article explores the effects of tenure insecurity on the migrant's decision to convert tropical frontier forestland to unsustainable agriculture. We develop and extend a Faustmann model to explore the effects of insecure property rights and unsustainability on the migrant's decision to convert tropical forestland to crop production, to maintain it for long-term timber production, or to mine the forest for timber and then abandon the land. We then provide a numerical simulation of the migrant's land-use decision based on data from the Amazon to compare the returns to mahogany plantation as opposed to agricultural conversion or timber mining. Increasing insecurity of land tenure leads to a decline in the value of timber relative to agricultural production land, thus creating an incentive for forest conversion. However, when land is easily degraded and tenure insecurity is high, timber mining and land abandonment may be a particular problem. Finally, we examine the role of private and government investment in establishing and maintaining secure land tenure. Once government "arrives" at the frontier, it can encourage sustainable timber production through providing secure harvesting rights and setting an optimal concession fee.

AB We examined a hybrid method, referred to here as the A'WOT [Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) in SWOT analysis], for improving the usability of SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats) analysis. A commonly used decision analysis method, the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), and its eigenvalue calculation framework are integrated with SWOT analysis. The connection of AHP with SWOT yields analytically determined and quantifiable priorities for the factors included in SWOT analysis. The aim in applying the hybrid method is to improve the quantitative basis of strategic planning processes. After applying the A'WOT method, decision-makers have information at their disposal about how alternative strategies are congruent with internal and external environmental factors. In a decision-making process, this information can be utilized in concert with other produced decision-support elements. The A'WOT was used in connection with the strategic planning of natural resource management at the Finnish Forest and Park Service (FFPS). Four alternative strategies were produced during the planning process. The alternatives produced were Forestry Strategy (emphasis on sustainable economic use of forests); Recreation Strategy (emphasis on recreational use of forests and social and economic sustainability); Protection Strategy (emphasis on nature protection and ecological sustainability); and the Basic Strategy (current land allocation and forestry practice principles). Opportunities determined by the priorities of the scaling factors had the greatest weight in all the business units of the FFPS. The most important internal factors included both strengths (know-how, land, and water property) along with a couple of weaknesses (lack of information concerning biodiversity due to insufficient planning resources, age, and development class structures of forests).

ID ECOSYSTEM MANAGEMENT
AB From the very start of our profession, the goal of forestry has been sustained yield, which implies sustainable environment. Although ecosystem management shares this goal, its philosophy and methods are different. A crucial difference is that, unlike traditional forestry, ecosystem management does not know where to manage (we cannot delineate the ecosystem), how to manage (approaches and techniques designed for a highly coordinated whole may be irrelevant to a patchwork of plants and animals), what to manage (since biodiversity remains undefined), and why to manage (ecocentrism is suicidal; our ethics have to be anthropocentric).

DE Canadian forest industry at the crossroads; productivity;

AB The Canadian wood products industry continues to have an overwhelming reliance on commodity sales to the United States housing market. The industry has extracted attractive profits from this approach in the past, first by taking advantage of abundant, inexpensive old-growth fibre and then by investing in cost-minimizing technologies. But like all investments on inputs for production, diminishing returns have been reached and new solutions must be sought to recapture competitiveness and profitability into the future.

AB In keeping with international efforts to encourage sustainable forest management, new legislation, regulations. and certification criteria have been brought into effect across boreal regions of the world in the past decade or less. These initiatives have established hierarchical systems of forest management planning that consider multiple uses of the forest and various aspects of sustainable forest management at different scales. We describe the systems established in Quebec, Ontario, Saskatchewan, Alberta, and British Columbia, Russia, Finland, and Sweden. Most jurisdictions employ some form of three-level planning framework. in which strategic, tactical, and operational plans and considerations are presented with successively greater detail and spatial explicitness, However. planning scales and time horizons vary considerably, as does the level of consideration given to biodiversity and social concerns. We examine these systems in the context of sustainable forest management, raising a number of questions to be addressed in future research, adaptive management, and policy reform. In particular, we note (1) a need of new landscape and regional planning tools to evaluate the long-term and large-scale impacts of various land uses and (2) a general lack of responsiveness to global carbon and climate change concerns.

ID NUCLEAR-FUSION; ENERGY-SOURCE
AB At the present state of our information, we can affirm that fusion research, as far as the necessary financial expenditures and their political justification are concerned, is a matter of politically controversial debate. In the political arenas, projects like controlled nuclear fusion are discussed primarily with regard to the controllability of complex technical systems and the sustainability of our future supply of electric power. The attempt to discuss this problem will have to consider: (i) on the one hand. already established concepts of sustainability, (ii) and on the other, the-according to the present state of our knowledge-foreseeable characteristics of a system of power generation and supply based on fusion reactors. Not only do the goals of global technology projects have to be embedded in patterns of universally accepted legitimisation (sustainability), but the organisation of research and development is also changing into networks acting globally. In this sense, globalisation means not only the worldwide linking of financial markets and the permanent availability of information and communication networks, but above all the creation of global organisations of research and innovation processes. The globalisation of research and development of technology has several dimensions: (i) the recognition and treatment of global problems; (iii) the transformation and evolution of new forms of organisation and cooperation in a global community of researchers; (iii) the constitution of Global Change Research. Fusion is playing a 'pathfinder role' for these processes and is at the same time itself an expression of the globalisation of the production of technology. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

   sensitive regions in Brazil
SO GEOFORUM
LA English
DT Article
DE sustainable livelihoods; protected areas; environmental conservation;
   environmentally sensitive regions
AB More than a strategy for environmental conservation, protected area paradigm has represented a specific conception of nature-society relationship. Originated in a context of capitalist consolidation, rapid urbanisation and frontier development in the US, this paradigm has given rise to a 'politically viable rationale' in which utilitarian use of natural resources by tourism development would ensure nature preservation. This political rationality has deeply influenced environmental policies in developing countries, fostering a paradoxical model in the history of nature preservation. It also has brought into play diverse interests that have shifted patterns of local nature-society interaction, configuring a complex politicised environment. Established in 'isolated' regions, protected areas have been implemented often by top-down approaches, disrupting resident peoples' livelihoods strategies through conflicts over the control of natural resources. Understanding the implications of development and conservation policies on resident peoples' livelihoods may represent a starting point for an integrated developmental conservation policy towards the promotion of sustainable livelihoods in environmentally sensitive regions in developing countries. These issues are analysed in the region of the Lencois Maranhenses National Park in Brazil. This paper argues that the context facing the region reveals a standardised conservationist paradigm marked by the absence of wider ecological criteria informing nature protection and a disregard for the strengthening of sustainability in existent socio-economic dynamics. The regional development and conservation policies have not only promoted tensions between resident peoples' livelihoods and the protected area paradigm, but also reinforced the legitimisation of social exclusion and environmental disruption under the prevalent rhetoric of nature protection and tourism development.

AB The general draft "Health for All" for the European region of the World Health Organization (WHO) describes 21 objectives for a new global health policy in the 21(st) century. This policy aims at promoting and protecting public health from the cradle to the grave. The public health services, responsible for the control and co-ordination of the entire system, have their own scope of procedures. Objective 10 - A healthy and safe natural environment specifies how environment-related health hazards are to be reduced considerably by improving the quality of air and water and minimising waste production, noise pollution and exposure to radiation, and by sustainable protection of the soil as the source of wholesome and plentiful nutrition.
   The work of the public health service is based on the laws on health care adopted by the German Federal states, the law on protection against infections, Federal laws and decrees clearly related to health as well as the resolutions of the conferences of health ministers. The public health departments, acting as a public authority, should make available the expert medical knowledge and experience of their staff and contribute comprehensively to regional and development planning procedures. In addition, they should focus on health compatibility testing of projects to ensure efficient preventive health protection.
   Implementing the EC Directive on Environmental Compatibility Inspection should engender a revision of the pertinent German law. The German National Association of NHS Physicians stipulated that health compatibility testing should be included in the text of the law, and public health departments should be involved on principle in the process of health compatibility testing. This should ensure that health-related issues are given more attention in the future when decisions are made on potential locations for urban building projects, industrial production facilities, large-scale animal husbandry projects, shopping centres or wind farms. The legal situation is exemplified in Saxony-Anhalt, where public health departments are involved in health compatibility testing procedures.

TI 'A risk' or 'at risk'? Reconceptualising housing debt in a risk welfare
   society
SO HOUSING STUDIES
LA English

DE housing; risk; debt; blame
ID STRATEGIES; CONTRACT
AB In England, the economic circumstances of housing, employment and social change have served to create problems of housing affordability and sustainability which leave some within the clefts of social divisions. At the same time, the individualisation trend within housing and other areas of social policy is increasingly driven by notions of self-responsibility and risk which can contribute to such divisions. This paper suggests that social policy could be well served by reconceptualising the constitution of risk to recognise its multiple and situated identity and to question, rather than utilise, its associations with mechanisms of individual culpability. It is also suggested that, for housing policy, this requires a re-examination of the legal basis of housing contracts.

DE energy optimization; low-power; multimedia systems; real-time systems
AB In this paper, we describe a software-controlled approach for adaptively minimizing energy in embedded systems for real-time multimedia processing. Energy is optimized by clock speed setting: the software controller dynamically adjusts processor clock speed to the frame rate (FR) requirements of the incoming multimedia stream. The speed-setting policy is based on a system model that correlates clock speed with best case, average case, and worst case sustainable FRs, accounting for data dependency in multimedia streams. The technique has been implemented in a energy-efficient MPEG3 real-time decoder algorithm designed for wearable devices as a case study. The target system is the Hewlett-Packard SmartBadgeIII prototype system based on the StrongARM1100 processor. Hardware measurements show that computational energy can be drastically reduced (up to 40%) with respect to fixed-frequency operation.

DE collusion; entropy; member deletion; multicast security
AB Recent literature presents several seemingly different approaches to rooted-tree-based multicast key distribution schemes [6]-[8], [28], [29] that try to minimize the user key storage while providing efficient member deletion. In this paper, we show that the user key storage on rooted trees can be systematically studied using basic concepts from information theory. We show that the rooted-tree-based multicast key distribution problem can be posed as an optimization problem that is abstractly identical to the optimal codeword length selection problem in information theory. In particular, we show that the entropy of member deletion statistics quantifies the optimal value of the average number of keys to be assigned to a member. We relate the sustainable key length to statistics of member deletion event and the hardware bit generation rate. We then demonstrate the difference between the key distribution on rooted trees and the optimal codeword-length selection problem with an example of a key distribution scheme that attains optimality but fails to prevent user collusion [7], [8].

AB Recycling in the European Union (EU) has benefited from R&D efforts and strict environmental regulations of the EU's members. Thanks to the adoption of sustainable development policies by the EU's European Institutions, economic incentives are expected to further strengthen the recycling industry. Moreover, the historical accumulation of non-ferrous metals in Europe will likely enhance secondary metal production. Also contributing to EU recycling is mining in East European countries and the resulting industrial waste. The rate of growth of the recycling industry is expected to approach double digits for at least this decade.

AB Land resource development programmes are applied generally on a watershed basis. Delineation of watersheds within a large drainage basin and their prioritization is required for proper planning and management of natural resources for sustainable crop production. An integral part of Guhiya basin (with an area of 1614 km(2)) was studied for priority watershed delineation with the objective of selecting watersheds to under take soil and water conservation measures using remote sensing and Geographical Information System (GIS) techniques. Using the terrain information derived from geocoded satellite data and 1:50,000 topographic maps, 68 watersheds were assessed on the basis of their erosivity and sediment-yield index values. Thematic maps of landform, landuse and land-cover, and slope were digitised using ARC/INFO. On the basis of sediment yield index values the watersheds were grouped into very high, high, moderate and low priorities. High priority watersheds with very high SYI value (> 150) need immediate attention for soil and water conservation whereas, low priority watershed having good vegetative cover and low SYI value (< 50) may not need immediate attention for such treatments.

AB In the context of over-consumption of natural resources in the name of development and rapid industrialization by a small section of the human population that is rapidly growing, the world is currently faced with a variety of environmental uncertainties. 'Global change' covering a whole variety of ecological issues, and 'globalization' in an economic sense, are two major phenomena that are responsible for these uncertainties. There is increasing evidence to suggest that the developing countries more than the developed, particularly the marginalized traditional (those living close to nature and natural resources) societies would be the worst sufferers. In order to cope with this problem in a situation where the traditional societies have to cope with rapidly depleting biodiversity on which they are dependant for their livelihood, there is an urgent need to explore additional pathways for sustainable management of natural resources and societal development. Such pathways should be based on a landscape management strategy, that takes into consideration the rich traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) that these societies have. This is critical because TEK is the connecting link between conservation and sustainable development. This paper explores the possibilities in this direction through a balanced approach to development, that links the 'traditional' with the 'modern', in a location-specific way.

AB Participation represents a very important strategy for the sustainable development of cities and many governments have implemented a number of initiatives with this objective in mind. Of all the forms of children's involvement in changing the city, the present work takes into account two models of children's participation: Children's Councils and Participation in Planning. Special emphasis has been put on the description of the methods followed by a number of Italian cities in carrying out these initiatives. A description is given of the positive effects on the child's personal and social development and factors are seen to be relevant to success are discussed. It is argued that it is necessary to extend the cultural debate on the political and social significance of these experiences and to put in place additional procedures guaranteeing a functional collaborative relationship among all the parties concerned.

ID CREDIT; MARKETS; MICROCREDIT; IRELAND
AB Ireland's loan funds were a long-lived, self-sustaining, large-scale microfinance organization that made millions of loans, without collateral, to the poor. During the first 100 years of their life-cycle, a period of growth ending in the 1840s, they adapted constantly and obtained improvements to their legal structure because they were complementary to the banking system and seen as effective in relieving poverty. In their 2nd century, they became ossified, in part because of competition with commercial banks. The loan funds provide an example of sustainable microfinance under harsh economic conditions and illustrate how organizations change incrementally and, when successful, alter their institutional framework.

SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT

   environmental management; mitigation; environmental reporting
AB There are three main theoretical difficulties involved in relating sustainability to aviation, and which a research agenda for sustainable aviation needs to address. The first is uncertainty regarding the critical thresholds of global environmental systems. The second is a lack of protocols for allocating permissible environmental consumption shares to, and hence targets for, individual enterprises or sectors. The third is differing value judgements of what natural features should be sustained. For the time being, these difficulties preclude determination of the degree of sustainability or unsustainability of any individual airport with respect to global environmental systems. Nevertheless, at this stage it can at least be said that since most economic activity has an adverse environmental impact, airports with higher throughputs of material and people will tend to be less sustainable than smaller-scale airports given similar technologies and regulatory compliance. This is theoretically supported and illustrated with waste arising as an indicator at reviewed airports. Despite governmental policies of sustainable mobility, there is a disjunction between EU and UK policy on airports and individual airport practice, and environmental sustainability theory. In the UK and EU, airport practice and governmental policy is to mitigate the impacts of aviation, but not at the expense of its aviation growth. This mitigation practice is summarised for the reviewed airports and presented in a framework that accounts for the suggested, interim approach to sustainability assessment. (C) 2001 Academic Press.

AB Mass flux balancing provides essential information for preventive strategies against heavy-metal accumulation in agricultural soils that may result from atmospheric deposition and application of fertilizers and pesticides. In this paper we present the empirical stochastic balance model, PROTERRA-S, that estimates heavy-metal and phosphorus accumulation in agricultural soils on the regional level. The basic units of these balances are land use systems defined by livestock production and cultivated crops. The model is designed to use available databases, such as regional agricultural statistics and soil information systems. In a case study, we assessed the phosphorus, cadmium, and zinc balances for the Sundgau region, Switzerland. The regional P requirements of crops were mainly supplied by animal manure (56%) and commercial fertilizers (40%). Net cadmium fluxes of the land use systems ranged from 1.0 g ha (t) yr(-1) (dairy and mixed farm types) to 17.8 g ha(-1) yr(-1) (animal husbandry systems), whereas the regional net cadmium flux was only 1.4 g ha(-1) yr(-1). The regional net zinc flux was 605 g ha(-1) yr(-1). The smallest net zinc flux of 101 g ha (-1) yr(-1) was found for an arable farm type, whereas for animal husbandry systems fluxes up to 39.8 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) were estimated. Comparison of model results with reported metal balances of experimental farms shows that identification of agricultural land with high risks of heavy-metal accumulation benefits from stratification of heavy-metal balances according to land use systems while accounting for their P fertilization plans. Consequently, the model may support sustainable management of heavy-metal cycles in agricultural soils.

AB Repeated applications of municipal wastewater biosolids is cost effective for biosolids managers, but may lead to undesirable accumulations of nutrients or contaminants. We evaluated the effects of seven years of biosolids applications on tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.) production and nutrient availability. We compared two types of Class A biosolids applied to tall fescue on a sandy loam in western Washington. Mean annual biosolids rates of 290,580, and 870 kg total N ha(-1) yr(-1) were compared with inorganic N and zero-N controls using a randomized complete block design. We measured yield and N uptake for each forage harvest, plant tissue metals at selected harvests, soil nitrate each fall, diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA)-extractable metals after five years of applications, and soil pH, available P, and organic C after seven years. Forage yields increased with biosolids rate. Apparent nitrogen recovery (ANR) for biosolids averaged 18% in 1993 (Year 1), 35% in 1994, and 46% in 1999. The ANR for inorganic N averaged 62% from 1994-199% Residual soil nitrate was less than 25 kg ha(-1) for all treatments through 1995, but increased beginning in 1996 for the high biosolids rate. Biosolids increased soil organic C levels by 2 to 5 g kg(-1) and Bray-1 P levels by 300 to 600 mg kg(-1) (0-15 cm depth). Plant tissue Zn increased from 24 to 66 mg kg(-1) at the highest application rate. Nearly all of the DTPA-extractable metals remained in the 0- to 8-cm soil depth.

AB This paper compares old-age pension policy trajectories in the Netherlands and Germany. These two advanced welfare states have developed different financial arrangements despite similarities in policy legacies, political institutions and party systems. Both countries established and extended comprehensive pay-as-you-go financed public pension schemes in the 1950s and 1960s. However, the Netherlands achieved a fully fledged multi-tiered pension system with a strong funded component, while until recently the German system relied almost exclusively on pay-as-you-go financing. The Netherlands has, therefore, a financially more viable and sustainable set of pension arrangements than Germany, at least under the current and foreseeable economic and demographic conditions. The paper reconstructs the pension trajectories in the two countries in order to explore the role of path dependency, political choice and contingency in explaining this divergence. It is argued that divergence is essentially unrelated to different strategic choices or variations in institutional capacities for reform. Instead, divergence is the largely unintended consequence of a series of incremental decisions in combination with contingent events and developments.

SO JOURNAL OF PETROLEUM SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING

DE litho-seismic data; hydrocarbon reservoirs; fuzzy system modelling
AB Fuzzy system modelling provides a strict mathematical environment in which vague conceptual phenomena can be rigorously studied. For hydrocarbon reservoir, its data model consists of parameters such as location identifier, time as well as attributes such as porosity, saturation, hydrocarbon and formation volume factor. These are usually developed from the litho-seismic data of an oilfield. In particular, fuzzy descriptions are obtained for the main parameters that define the structure and model of the hydrocarbon formation. From these, the membership grade functions of the fuzzy subsets are determined using an interval [0,1]. To simplify the model formulation of the ill-defined problem of oilfield services, the results of core analysis are expressed with linguistic quantifiers such as minimum, maximum or most likely porosity, saturation hydrocarbon, etc. Our model provides a new approach for tackling the sustainable development and management of hydrocarbon reservoir on stream and enhanced recovery, In this example, the potential acreage is mapped and the reservoir estimate is obtained easily using defuzzifier such as mean of maxima.

AB There has been increasing concern that training on military lands results in excessive soil erosion, ecosystem degradation, and loss of sustainable training resources. Vegetation structure has been shown to play a role in soil surface stabilization by reducing shear stress caused by wind force. A study at the Idaho Army National Guard training facility at Orchard Training Area (OTA), Ida. assessed the effect of simulated M1A2 Abrams battletank maneuvers on grassland plant canopies and soil erodibility. The point-intercept method was used to estimate vertical vegetation structure before and after tracking. A portable wind tunnel was used to measure threshold wind speeds (TWS) associated with different numbers of tank passes and soil mass removed by wind. Results indicated that significant damage occurred to vertical vegetation structure as the number of passes increased. Threshold wind speed, an indicator of soil surface stability, significantly decreased with tracking and eroded soil mass significantly increased. Positive correlations existed between vegetation parameters and threshold wind speed. Soil loss was negatively correlated with vegetation parameters. Results indicated that the decrease of vertical vegetation structure led to a decrease in threshold wind speed. This decrease in threshold wind speed was the result of reduced soil surface protection by vegetation. Decreased surface protection also resulted in increased soil loss. Results from this work confirmed that vegetation plays a major role in reducing shear stress on the soil surface. Predictions for soil loss at Orchard Training Area resulting from the number of M1A2 passes are made using linear models. A critical tracking threshold of 4 passes was estimated based upon model output and average local wind speeds for Orchard Training Area.

AB A key challenge for managers of water utilities in developing countries is to provide services to the rising urban population in a financially sustainable manner : The paper examines the management of water services in an African city which piloted service differentiation and pricing. Among the key findings was that substantial improvement in the provision of water services to the urban poor was attained. Cost recovery was achieved through innovative structuring of public/private partnerships, an appropriate pricing policy, and flexible payment systems. The project demonstrates that (a) by structuring service delivery with appropriate pricing, utilities could serve more customers (including people living in informal settlements) at affordable cost and achieve financial sustainability, and (b) service differentiation and appropriate pricing has the potential to improve urban water services in low-income countries.

The farmers' perceptions were identified using rapid and participatory rural appraisal (RRA/PRA) tools. The study catchment, having a semiarid continental climate and located on the Loess Plateau in northern China, covered an area of 3.5 km(2). Most of the land users were dependent on subsistence agriculture. There were important topographic variations in the catchment and arable cropping on steep slopes brought about degradation of land due to water erosion. The biophysical monitoring, soil survey and RRA/PRA survey, carried out one year prior to the present investigation, supplied the data needed for identification of preliminary limiting land properties and land evaluation units. The land properties that needed further investigation in the present study were slope aspect, soil workability, flooding hazard and farmers' criteria on choice of land-use type. The farmers were able to give a comprehensive picture of the spatial and temporal variation and the importance for land-use options of the land properties concerned, and thereby complement the information gained from empirical results (measurements). In order to guarantee good production for dry as well as wet years, both south- and north-facing sites were chosen for most crops, and the slope aspect did not need to be differentiated in the final land suitability evaluation for arable crops. Grassland, however, was considered to be more suitable than woodland on south-facing sites. Hard soil layers were found to be important, since they affected soil workability and erosion negatively, giving slightly reduced suitability for the land units in which they occurred. Flooding events affecting crops on alluvial soils negatively were considered to occur once every 5 to 10 years, which is considered to be a low rate, so this property was therefore not included in the final suitability evaluation.

AB The measurement of farm animal well-being has evolved through several stages to return to the most agreed-upon system of evaluation that uses a multidisciplinary approach. The multidisciplinary approach includes measures of animal behavior, physiology. anatomy and health and immunity. However, the multidisciplinary approach must be used in the context of other important society issues including: food safety, environmental protection, worker health and safety, economics, international trade, domestic protection, public perception and consumer economics. Only by taking into account all society issues, can the multidisciplinary approach yield useful information to the modem consumer in a manner that can develop sustainable animal production systems.

AB Professional services firms (e.g., consultants, accounting firms, or advertising agencies) generate and sell business solutions to their customers. In doing so, they can leverage the cumulative experience gained from serving their customer base to either reduce their variable costs or increase the quality of their products/services. In other words, their "production technology" exhibits some form of increasing returns to scale. Growth and globalization, coupled with recent advances in information technology, have led many of these firms to introduce sophisticated knowledge management (KM) systems in order to create sustainable competitive advantage. In this paper, the authors analyze how KM is likely to affect competition among such professional services firms. In particular, they first explore what type (supply-side versus demand-side) of economies of scale are likely to be exploited in KM systems. In the former case, KM's role is to reduce the operating costs of the firm, while in the latter case, its role is to create added value to customers by significantly increasing product quality. Second, the authors analyze the competitive dynamics and market structure that emerge as a result of firms competing with KM systems. The results shed light on the current literature exploring the deployment of KM systems by suggesting that in a competitive setting, when firms' ability to leverage their customer base is high, KM should lead to quality improvement rather than cost reductions. In a dynamic setting, it is also shown that when firms use their KM system to improve product quality, higher ability to leverage the customer base may actually hurt profits and lead to industry shakeout. Beyond normative insights, the results also support a number of recent market trends in management consulting, including the increased emphasis on knowledge-creating activities in modern KM systems, the wave of mergers between consulting firms, and the recent emergence of "retail consulting" services.

ID MANAGEMENT
AB Capacity building in the marine sector is a priority for Pacific Island nations, which face major challenges in the sustainable management of their marine resources under UNCLOS III and the various Conventions and Agreements stemming from UNCED. The University of the South Pacific (USP), with its 12 Pacific Island members (Cook Islands, Fiji, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Nauru, Niue, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tokelau, Tonga, Tuvalu, Vanuatu) has taken up this challenge through the establishment of its Marine Studies Programme (MSP) in 1993. The MSP is one of the four focal areas identified in USP's 1998 Strategic Plan. The breadth of MSP's activities is substantial, ranging from awareness raising at the village level to sophisticated post-graduate research in marine science. The substantial regional and international cooperation, research and training involved in these endeavours require USP to respond to education, training and research needs at many levels. As USP services more than 23 million square kilometres of ocean space and less than 1.7 million people, only a small percentage of this population have access to face-to-face teaching. USP's success to date is a measure of staff dedication, innovation and the confidence of the university, its members, and its donor partners. Capacity building in the marine sector will remain a high priority for many years to come, and MSP must continue to play a leading role., (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Pinus oocarpa is the most widely distributed pine species of Mexico and Central America. The natural populations of Nicaragua have been affected by extensive human activities. As a consequence, their size has been reduced, and there is a serious threat to the development of mature woodland. Knowledge of population structures and the genetic diversity of the species is required for the design of sustainable use and conservation strategies. Random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers were used to assess the genetic variation among 10 populations from three geographical regions of Nicaragua. Both markers revealed high levels of diversity in these populations. G(ST) values and analyses of molecular variance (AMOVA) found that most variation was within populations but there is still a significant differentiation between populations indicating that the populations sampled cannot be considered a single panmictic unit. The partitions created by AMOVA also showed that there was little differentiation between populations of different regions, although cluster analyses based on RAPDs and AFLPs indicated a closer relationship among most of the populations from a same geographical region. Management of P. oocarpa in Nicaragua should be aimed to maintain the high degree of genetic variation within individual populations that is still observed even in some of these highly degraded populations.

AB In this paper an overview is given of the most important aspects of the research activities organised by the European Union (EU) in the area of reactor safety under both the past 4th and the current 5th Euratom Framework Programmes (FP). This research consists of the following four areas: reactor safety; waste management; future systems; and radiation protection. Under FP-4 ('94-'98), the particular area of reactor safety focused on was 'Severe Accident Analysis', whereas under FP-5 ('98-'02) it focused on 'Operational Safety of Existing Installations'. In Section 1, a short description is given of the 'nuclear needs' in the EU and the main stakeholders of nuclear fission research (i.e. regulatory and industry organisations), faced with new targets (e.g. minimisation of operating and environmental costs in a deregulated market) and new feedbacks (e.g. public perception of reactor safety and acceptance of the waste issue). In Section 2, a brief description is given of the main facts of FP-4 and FP-5 with emphasis on the clustering approach of research projects in the same field. In Sections 3-9, attention is drawn to a series of technical and socio-economical facts of interest to regulatory and industry organisations (i.e. mainly utilities and vendors). They are the main end-users of the results of international nuclear fission research, financed by either governments, industries or Euratom. The following 'nuclear needs' have been identified at EU level and are proposed for discussion: to ensure flexibility in energy supply by keeping the nuclear option open; to contribute to health and safety as well as to non-proliferation by better co-ordination of European research and training activities; to maintain industrial competitiveness by preparing the next generation of reactors; to maintain broad nuclear expertise for non-energetic applications; to develop sustainable solutions for fuel cycle management and waste disposal (emphasis on front-end issues); to share the same nuclear safety culture amongst the EU and the applicant Central and Eastern European Countries (CEECs); and finally, to improve the impact of Euratom research actions by enhancing their public benefit and their added European value. In Section 1, a brief overview is given of the European response offered under FP-4 and FP-5-in terms of co-operative research in reactor safety-as a response to some of the,nuclear needs'. As far as the future beyond 2002 is concerned, the challenge to Euratom research is to reorganise itself in line with the European Research Area concept (ERA), using the proposed tools, for example, by developing networks of excellence, bringing together private and public resources. Finally conclusions are drawn on the main achievements of framework programme research hitherto and on new stakeholders in European research in the 'changing world'. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science BN.

AB This summary paper deals with the strategy, the organisation and main achievements of the 67 multi-partner projects cosponsored by the European Union (EU) as 'indirect actions' (shared-cost and concerted actions) and co-ordinated under seven clusters, each devoted to one key safety issue in nuclear reactor safety, as they were presented at FISA-99. The fundamental safety objective for nuclear power plants (NPPs) consists in protecting the public and the environment from the harmful effects resulting from ionising radiations. The 4th Euratom framework programme 1994-1998 (FP-4) has been carrying out research with this objective both through 'indirect actions' and through 'direct actions' in co-operation with the Joint Research Centre of the European Commission (EC). The total cost of this research programme was 62.8 million, out of which 34.2 million was contributed by the EU budget. Besides technological safety requirements, socio-economic aspects are becoming increasingly important due to the level of public and political acceptance and to the economic pressure of deregulated electricity markets. It is shown that research conducted in the Euratom framework may contribute to meet these requirements, thereby maintaining nuclear power as a competitive and sustainable option for the energy policy of the European Union.

DE perennial crops; smallholders
AB In sub-Saharan Africa, perennial crops have been introduced by the colonial governments. Their expansion led to dramatic changes in the organisation of land and areas, the structure of production relations, and the social-political construction. The perennial crops were at the root of a global, social, political economical, and geographical system, which had it own internal contradictions. Since the 80s, this system has been facing a severe crisis which poses many obstacles to its reproduction as investment for replanting and renewing plantations is required. Discussing the outlook for the future of the perennial crops means to redefine the whole condition which could allow smallholders not only to survive but to get a new status and new ways for social and economic promotion too. Market and crop chain liberalization, political and ethnic struggles, land shortage, urban employment crisis, etc., are the main constraints for securing a better and sustainable future for the producers.

AB Despite their name, "perennial crops " are not really perennial. Tree crop systems are rarely sustainable. Massive migrations, which usually accompany commodity booms, make them especially fragile, Replanting is also more difficult, and more costly, than planting. This is an investment issue, which is neither purely technical nor specific to tree crops. Any social and economic entity, one day or another, faces a major problem in renewing its capital and ideas. Nevertheless, the loss of the forest rent, and the complexity of rural societies built through massive migrations, certainly lead to aggravoted risks of non-sustainability and political errors. The local determinants of the replanting decision, and the environment that enables farmers to try to overcome replanting difficulties, are evaluated here through two village case studies in Cote d'Ivoire. Farmers' initiatives show promise, but are insufficient. There is a need for a strong replanting policy. Instead, as happened in the post in other household rural economies, the country is running a high risk of serious conflicts over land.

AB For several years now, most policies hove tended to speak of "clean" and "sustainable" development. Of all the international agreements, only the Internation Convention on Climate Change, with its Kyoto Protocol, attempts to bring in original financial mechanisms based on market dynamics allowing the additional costs of such an approach to be covered. On the eve of COP 7, this paper describes the current state of the negotiations relative to procedures for implementing the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM); then, taking an example from tree crops, it goes on to analyse the application of eligibility criteria to natural rubber cultivation, taking into account the carbon balance of the natural rubber commodity chain in relation to synthetic rubber production. The potential impact of utilizing carbon (be it sequestrated or not emitted) in the economic strategy of the natural rubber commodity chain is then discussed, Lastly, lessons are also drawn for the other tree crops.

AB The use of permanganate as an effective oxidant in organic chemistry has a long and extensive history. Industrial applications have recently become more attractive environmentally by the introduction of a process for recycling manganese dioxide, a coproduct of these reactions. This recycling approach has reduced the environmental impact of permanganate technology and made it sustainable as defined by the Brundtland Commission. Several current and potential industrial applications of permanganate oxidations are discussed along with a description of some emerging technologies.

AB It is difficult for the firm competing through information technology resources to gain a sustainable advantage because systems are easy to imitate and substitute resources are often available to competitors. The innovator may be unable to appropriate all of the benefits from information technology investments. Airlines have installed computerized reservations systems in travel agencies to appropriate the returns from their investments in information technology. The airlines expected to obtain a number of benefits from this strategy, including increased efficiency, possible bias in favor of the computerized reservations systems owner on the part of the travel agent, and fees from other airlines for making reservations for them. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the appropriation of value by computerized reservations systems owners from deploying systems in travel agencies. These benefits, beyond fees from travel agents, should be seen in the vendor airline's market share between cities and in the overall performance of the airline at an industry level. This paper models airline performance as a function of computerized reservations systems ownership at two levels: for selected city-pairs and at the overall level of the firm. The city-pair analysis employs a multinomial logit market share model that analyzes five years of data on 72 city-pair routes. The industry model uses longitudinal data for a panel of 10 airlines for 12 years. The results of both analyses support hypotheses that computerized reservations systems ownership is positively related to airline performance. It appears that strong airlines have appropriated the benefits of their computerized reservations systems, turning them into highly specialized assets for further travel-related innovation. This work offers useful theoretical extensions and methodological approaches for the study of similar kinds of network technology innovations that are currently being deployed in association with electronic commerce on the Internet.

AB Regional planning of agroecosystems is a key component in the sustainability of agriculture and it should consider the biophysical and socio-economic reality. Agriculture plays an important role in the region of Sao Carlos, SP, Brazil, but it is located in an area of environmental conservation. This work aimed to delimit the Agroecological Zone of this region and to diagnose agroecosystems through soil, climate and socio-economic data. ne delimitation was based on climate, geomorphology and administrative division of the counties. The soils, land use, distribution of land ownership and the management were studied. The Zone delimited occupies 286,824.08 ha, and is composed by the Analandia, Itirapina, Santa Maria da Serra, Sao Carlos, Sao Pedro and Torrinha counties. There is potential for agriculture, existing mainly sandy and low fertility soils. Pastures and sugar cane are the main land use, the distribution of the ownership is unequal and there is risk of environmental degradation because the farmers do not use practices compatible with the natural features. It is recommended to adopt practices that emphasize soil conservation and correction and nutrient uptake. Species adapted to sandy soils with low demand for nutrients and resistant to water stress should be cultivated.

AB The best performance superconductor should have the highest J(c), and H-irr and the lowest surface resistance R-s at 77 K. Our original superconductor CuBa2Ca3CU4O12-y (Cu-1234) has a high T-c > 117 K (= one and a half times of 77 K) even in over-doping state, a low superconducting anisotropy (y = 1.6), a long coherence length along c-axis (, = I nm) and a small penetration depth (lambda (c) = 220 nm). Therefore, it is capable of becoming the best performance superconductor with a high J(c) {50 MA/cm(2) (77 K, 0 T), 0.5 MA/cm(2) (77 K, 0 T)}, a high H-irr {30 T (77 K)}and a low R-s {30 mu Omega (77 K, 10 GHz)}. These superconducting properties are derived from its unique composition, lattice structure and electronic structure. The prediction is going to be proved with the experimental data of T-c, J(c), H-irr and hole concentration, NMR, specific heat and photoemission measurements and band calculation. Sustainable high T-c (> 117 K) in over-doped Cu-1234 were achieved by the selective over-doping effect, and high T-c's of 126 K in Cu1-xTlx-1234 and 132 K in Cu1-xTlx-1223 were achieved by homogeneous optimum-doping effect by band structure engineering. The results show the effectiveness of band theory and Fermi liquid theory for approaching to the best performance superconductor from over-doping side, The two kinds of superconducting transitions at T-c = 117 K and T-c2 = 60 K have been observed for over-doped Cu-1234 by NMR and specific heat measurements indicating the weak coupling of two superconducting-order- parameters (d + is or d + id). These weak-coupling two order parameters in Cu-1234 are expected to contribute to the enhancement of superconducting performance. A new self-assembling epitaxy (SAE) techniques for the preparation of Cu(Tl)-1234 and -1223 thin films has been developed by combining Tl-1234 self-assembling effect and amorphous phase epitaxy (APE) effect. The thin films of Cu1-xTlx-1223 (x similar to 0.5) have achieved a high J(c) = 20 MA/cm(2) (77 K. 0 T) and J(c) = 0.4 MA/cm(2) (77 K, 10 T), and its data extrapolate a high (H-irr)(ab) similar to 30 T at 77 K.

AB Hydrogen gas is thought to be the ideal fuel for a world in which air pollution has been alleviated, global warming has been arrested, and the environment has been protected in an economically sustainable manner. Hydrogen and electricity could team to provide attractive options in transportation and power generation. Interconversion between these two forms of energy suggests on-site utilization of hydrogen to generate electricity, with the electrical power arid serving in energy transportation, distribution utilization, and hydrogen regeneration as needed. A challenging problem in establishing H-2 as a source of energy for the future is the renewable and environmentally friendly generation of large quantities of H-2 gas. Thus, processes that are presently conceptual in nature, or at a developmental stage in the laboratory, need to be encouraged, tested for feasibility, and otherwise applied toward commercialization.

AB Due to the increasing environmental problems, conventional environmental policy will not suffice to secure a development path that can be sustainable on a global scale. This article establishes a conceptual framework for general strategies to reach the goals of ecological sustainability and individual well-being. Environmental impact, material input, income/production, the amount of services utilised, and wellbeing are the fundamental elements of this framework and their linkages are highlighted as possible targets of ecological economic policy. It is clear that current environmental policies, based on a rather narrow, reductionist view of the man-nature relationship, will not suffice. We investigate under which conditions a de-linking of individual well-being from environmental impacts can be achieved; a dramatic dematerialisation of the industrialised economies turns out to be a crucial element. This dematerialisation, we argue, can be achieved only putting a limit to quantitative economic growth, but nevertheless without decreasing the individual well-being, by concentrating the attention on highly valuable eco-efficient services rather than on the production/acquisition of material goods.

AB In this article a macro-oriented conceptual framework of the conditions necessary for the advancement of sustainability within an economy arid society is formulated and analysed. The theoretical framework presented is a set of logical identities, which define relationships between the total environmental stress (TES) and the basic indicators of economic, technological and social development. The framework, called the Total Environmental Stress Approach, provides necessary but not sufficient conditions for advancing sustainability. Scenario alternatives utilizing the TES approach with data from Finland are presented to evaluate the theoretical framework.

AB This study analyses the Environmental Kuznets Curve Hypothesis (EKC) with direct material flow data from the USA, Germany, Japan, the Netherlands and Finland in the years 1975 to 1994. Recently, there has been a discussion concerning the relevance of the EKC hypothesis suggesting that also the intensity of material use should decline with income growth. The EKC hypothesis has not been widely tested with direct material flow data, and this paper presents one of the first attempts to do such tests. The results of the empirical hypothesis tests indicate that the EKC hypothesis does not hold in the case of aggregated direct material flows among industrialised countries like Germany, Japan, the USA, the Netherlands and Finland.

DT Article
AB There have been unparalleled advances during the latter half of the last century, to the scientific, engineering and social face of the world, but in that process, the world has also been plunged into several interrelated crises. In the context of the construction industry, these crises can be broadly classified in terms of environment, durability and sustainability. The crises have risen from a number of factors such as technological industrialisation, population growth, worldwide urbanisation, and uncontrolled pollution and creation of waste. There is now the real danger that the massive, indiscriminate and wasteful consumption of the world's material and energy resources may result in extensive global warming that is hard to reverse. The price for this environmental abuse is the rapid deterioration and destruction of the world's infrastructure, water shortages, environmental disasters, and material/structural deterioration by the forces of nature. Every crisis experienced in the world has a direct impact on the construction industry, and since the construction Industry is closely interlinked with energy, resources and environment, irredeemable environmental degradation can only be prevented by sustainable development of the industry which alone can give hope for a better world and better quality of life. This paper advocates a holistic approach to design and construction integrating all aspects from conceptual design to completion and maintenance during service life.

AB The modem dairy cow has been selectively bred to produce large amounts of milk. Partly as a result, food consumption is considerably less than milk energy output in early lactation. It is only at 2 months or more postpartum that intake increases to the point where positive energy balance is regained, the initial production being achieved by a substantial mobilisation of body reserves. These reserves are laid down before parturition, but it is certainly not the case that the pregnant cow will accumulate adipose tissue recklessly; in the last third of pregnancy well-fed cows in good body condition exhibit reduced, not increased, appetite. There is a fine balancing act to per-form. Excessive body condition at parturition quickly leads to metabolic problems such as ketosis, but cows who subsequently become too thin have increased risk of metabolic diseases such as mastitis and lameness. ne biological mechanisms regulating output of milk are reasonably well understood, those controlling appetite less well so, and there has been little attempt at systematic integration of the two. The transition from pregnancy to lactation represents a major challenge to homeostasis, made more complicated in multiparous cows by the fact that much of gestation is concurrent with lactation. Herein lies the potential for nutritionally-entrained flexibility. In the wild, concurrent pregnancy and lactation only occur when nutritional conditions are favourable. If conditions are poor, rebreeding will be delayed and lactation will continue, at an energetically-sustainable level, for much longer than its 'normal' duration. In this way the twin energetic burdens of pregnancy and lactation are separated, and extremes are avoided. Given the increasing public concern about stresses suffered by intensively-managed dairy cows, this case may be one where commercial dairying could learn useful lessons from nature.

AB The question of what is the good life has been discussed by philosophers since antiquity. The good of an individual and of a community is complicated. Communities influence an individual's experiences and world views, which are always individual. Public health nurses promoting the good life need multidisciplinary knowledge, as well as other skills such as personal competence and qualifications. The focus of the theoretical framework of promotion of the good life is based on models of health promotion and sustainable development. Working with different clients requires nursing theories, other theories, and multidisciplinary models in practice. Continual quality improvement is needed in order to increase customer satisfaction. This article discusses a doctoral thesis that consists of three empirical studies. The theoretical framework for promotion of the good life as the work of public health nurses is outlined, and the outcomes of the first study, the qualifications concerning health, and the environment are described. In the other parts of the study, curriculum building using future methodology and evaluation with concept maps is reported.

AB This paper explores the relevance of sustainable development to physical education and argues that it is a vitally important concept that presents the opportunity for considerable theoretical and practical development. The implications of sustainability development for our understandings of physical activity are examined with recognition of the significance of activity behaviors within sustainable living. In the context of education, the development of critical curriculum theory is advocated since the potential environmental crisis necessitates profound social change. Possible avenues for the development of critical theory in physical education are identified, and physical education's possible use as a vehicle for the promotion of sustainable active living is considered. It is argued that such a focus would improve the subject's contribution toward both the promotion of active living and social transformation for sustainability.

AB A brief analysis is made on the far-sighted target set by the late Chairman Deng Xiaoping that China should reach the standard of medium developed countries by the middle of the 21st century. To achieve this goal, we should keep on our economic progress with a relatively fast pace and at the same time to face the challenges from population growth, energy and resources and the impact on eco-environment so that we may find a way to march ahead on a sustainable development track. Materials are the mainstay of nation's social economic development and are also closely associated with these challenges. In this context, we have chosen a few important material areas that may have significant impact on the advancement in the 21st century to give some preliminary analysis and assessment. A brief discussion is also given to the development of materials science and engineering in the years ahead.

AB Contrary to the widespread belief that indigenous peoples are adept managers of their natural environments, preliminary research from the Machiguenga of the Peruvian Amazon indicates that this may not be the case. In an attempt to identify whether the Machiguenga in the village of Camisea conserve natural resources, the group was studied in relation to resource use, perceptions of the environment, and their understanding of population biology. Cultural characteristics were examined as well, such as social sanctioning and awareness of the behaviors of others in the group, both of which may be necessary for group-level conservation. It was found that the Machiguenga lack the social structure and cognitive models needed for sustainable resource use - although, given the particular cultural and economic history of the group, these elements made good adaptive sense.

DT Article
DE Indicators; Water management; Integrated assessment
AB This paper addresses the issue of indicators for water management by considering why we need them, what the characteristics of a good indicator should be, how they can add value to policy and decision-making, and what are their imitations. There are a vast quantity of data available on water in Europe from which a range of basic trend indicators has been derived. Most of these indicators address "what is happening?"-type questions. Some indicators go further and address does it matter?" questions by assessing trends against prescribed standards and targets. There have been some interesting developments in indicators which help to understand the demand side of water management and to assess the relative efficiencies of resource usage in different socioeconomic sectors. More effort is needed to bring together relevant social, economic and environmental information interactively to define indicators that address questions about the sustainability of water use and the contribution of the water environment to our overall quality of life. The development of indicators to date has concentrated on making the best use of available information. However, we now need to move from a position of "best available information" towards "best needed information". This will require better communication between information users and providers. It will also require a rethinking of exactly what our priority knowledge needs are to support policy-making and environmental man agement. Thi s essential if we are to obtain the best value from limited monitoring resources by eliminating the current redundancy in reporting requirements and refocusing programmess to deliver priority information needs.

AB Current approaches to energy are unsustainable and non-renewable. Implementing sustainable energy strategies is one of the most important levers humankind has for creating a sustainable world. Future energy policies should put more emphasis on developing the potential of energy sources, which should form the foundation of future global energy structure. The FAG, in support of the Sustainable Rural Environment and Energy Network (SREN), is developing a concept for the optimisation, evaluation and implementation of integrated renewable energy sources for rural communities.

AB Government policy objectives and their implications for the development of new and renewable energy resources are examined. Renewable energy resources of major importance in Botswana are biomass, solar, and wind. Government policy and programmes, and the effects of regional and international developments in these aspects of renewable energy are considered in detail. Woody biomass exploitation and issues of sustainability of harvesting rates and the environment are also discussed. The place of renewable energy within the long established and well developed rural electrification programme is also examined, and a case for a comprehensive and separate rural energy policy is made. Research and Development as well as Demonstration, Dissemination, and Diffusion of renewable energy technologies are discussed, particularly in relation to energy technology acquisition, adaptation, education and job creation.

AB Sustainability has acquired great importance due to the negative impact of various developments on the environment. The rapid growth during the last decade has been accompanied by active construction which, in some instances, neglected the impact on the environment and human activities. The impact of developments on the traditional heritage has not been taken into consideration although the latter represents a rich resource for sustainable building practices. The study aims at examining these developments in the UAE using an assessment tool that measures the performance of buildings in terms of their sustainability. This study attempts to: (a) develop a comprehensive definition of sustainability to suit UAE needs; (b) classify sustainable building practices at international and regional levels; (c) assess building performance in the UAE; and (d) establish guidelines for future sustainable architecture. T-Sol software was used to predict the CO2 emission level in selected buildings in the UAE. Results illustrate that average energy use/area in domestic buildings is high (213 kWh/m(2)) and public buildings showed less sustainable measures in terms of energy features, energy performance and environmental features. Issues considered in the assessment of buildings such as energy use per square metre and CO2 emission are alarming. Traditional buildings in the UAE were more sustainable than contemporary buildings, however. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The Caribbean region is endowed with renewable energy resources which remain largely untapped. With an average insolation of 15-20 MJ m(-2) day(-1), investment in some renewable energy technologies is feasible. The major problem confronting the region is lack of financial resources. Petroleum imports continue to dominate the energy scenario except for Trinidad and Tobago and Barbados. However, increased awareness of sustainable development issues throughout the region is a major factor in support of renewable energy implementation and is a driving force for energy policy decision-making. With the necessary joint-venture partnerships and government fiscal incentives, photovoltaic technologies, wind energy and solar energy industries are poised to expand thus reducing the dependency on fossil fuel imports while preserving the environment.

AB Globalisation is manifested in the Mekong Region both through processes and discourses that reflect the ideology of a borderless world allowing easy passage of capital and commodities, and through resistance to such processes in an increasingly transnationalised civil society movement. However, more immediately significant supranational integrative agendas take the form of regionalisation, a process that has received less attention but which raises analogous concerns of re-scaled governance. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has been a catalysing force. for regionalisation amidst a host of regional processes and initiatives; as such it has found itself the object of critique as an institution and through the specific projects it has supported that have impacted on local communities and ecosystems. Meanwhile, local and NGO voices associated with the emergence of a vibrant civil society in Thailand and nascent civil society responses in neighbouring countries have challenged claims on resources made in the name of national development and regional integration.
   This paper considers some key issues of re-scaling resource and environmental politics in the Mekong Region, and the extent to which challenges have been recast from national to regional development agendas. Politics of environment are shown to exist as a general rather than exceptional response to the region's development direction, and it is suggested that equitable and sustainable development increasingly needs to address simultaneously the re-scaling and reconfigurations of power in both environmental politics and the "infrapolitics" of environment. The paper is illustrated with case studies of dams in Laos and Thailand.

AB The mechanical effects of two etching treatments commonly applied on silicon wafers for the PV industry, are considered. The failure characteristics of this material under concentrated load are shown. In both cases, the maximum elongation and sustainable load of the etched wafers were measured to be higher than those of the original sample. The employed experimental procedure and results are presented here and a statistical data analysis substantiates the results observed. An attempt of explanation for this effect is offered based on the removal of a shallow highly defective layer induced by the etching of the material. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

LA English
DT Article
ID COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE; FIRM
AB In the first two papers of this trilogy we explored the history of the Royal Dutch/Shell group both internationally and locally in Nigeria. We described a catastrophic failure in relations with the Ogoni and the consequent fall-out with NGOs and opinion formers more globally. In response to these events Shell embarked on a revision of its business principles and initiated a multi-million dollar exercise in stakeholder outreach and communication. We also explored the limitations of a purely instrumental approach to 'stakeholder management' in Nigeria and suggested that a rights-based approach might provide a more useful framework for managing relationships and achieving reconciliation between Shell and the Ogoni. In this third paper of the trilogy we explore Shell's current approach to strategy formulation and implementation in the context of what this means for Shell's ability to pursue the ideal of sustainable development. We apply two models for testing the level of integration of business strategy with sustainability and we observe that, whilst Shell's business principles and corporate strategy now embrace notions of market sensitivity and internal and external accountability to an unprecedented degree, the company has yet to maximize opportunities arising from its approach to sustainability and stakeholder responsiveness at the business unit level in Nigeria.

TI Contradictions between WTO and sustainable development? The case of
   environmental dumping
SO SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
ID EXPORT SUBSIDIES; TARIFFS; TRADE; POLLUTION; POLICY
AB This paper discusses how the WTO agreement deals with the environmental and competitiveness concerns linked to trade and environmental policies. As the use of traditional export subsidies and other protectionist trade policies are now strongly restricted in the WTO, many countries will try to find other ways to increase competitiveness. One way of doing this is to use lax environmental taxation or regulation as indirect subsidies (i.e. 'environmental dumping'). If this is done, the reduced possibilities of using traditional protectionist trade policies could harm the environment, thus reducing the overall welfare gain from trade liberalization. Environmental countervailing tariffs have been suggested as a way of reducing incentives for environmental dumping. The WTO rules are examined in order to analyse the feasibility of the uses of environmental countervailing tariffs in the current and future framework of WTO, and the incentives and welfare consequences are analysed under different market scenarios.

AB There is, a widespread belief that the WTO has made virtually no concessions to environmentalists about their concerns arising from free trade and the process of globalization. There are concerns that these processes may undermine prospects for sustainable development. Following, the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development held in Rio de Janeiro in 1992, the International Institute for Sustainable Development was established to advocate policies to support sustainable development within Canada and globally. In 1994, it proposed the Winnipeg Principles as. a means for reconciling international trade and development so as to: achieve sustainable development (ISD, 1994a,b). These seven principles are outlined in this article and assessed:. Although the International Institute for Sustainable Development had hoped: through these principles to influence the work programme of the Environment and Trade Committee of WTO, it seems to have little effect. Probably if these principles had been seriously considered by WTO, the serious social conflicts which emerged globally at the beginning of this century would have been avoided, and we would be in a better position to understand the complex links between trade, environment and sustainable development and adopt relevant policies.

TI Gaining legitimacy? Sustainable development in business school curricula
SO SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB Exploring reasons why sustainable development remains largely at the margins of business school curricula and seeking to develop courses of action to embed its ethos more firmly in the institutions in which they work, the authors review international evidence and reflect on their experiences.
   A number of related factors appear to contribute to the marginalization of sustainable development in business school curricula. There is the tendency for the tertiary sector to follow the corporate world in market-driven values and goals, with concomitant reluctance on the part of many business school academics to step outside mainstream orthodoxy. A degree of resistance to interdisciplinary and non-traditional pedagogical approaches and evaluative methods required by sustainable development is also manifest within many business schools. Encouraging signs are seen, however, in a burgeoning academic literature and growing opportunities for collegial support internationally.
   Means by which business studies curricula can incorporate the concept of sustainable development are considered in conjunction with their implications for traditional conceptions of organizational theory, and for tertiary institutions more generally. A modus operandi for a national programme for environmental responsibility in New Zealand tertiary institutions is outlined as an example of a possible way forward.

TI Taiwan's environment resource sustainability and green consumerism:
   Preceptions of university students
SO SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB It is argued that university students. are the future elite members and decision-makers of a society, therefore the attitudes and behaviour of Taiwanese students will have a significant effect upon the future course of development of Taiwan. This article discusses university students' perceptions of the environment, resource sustainability, and green consumerism in Taiwan. A total of 345 students studying at the National Taiwan University completed the survey questionnaire in October 1996. It is encouraging to find that most students appear to be concerned with, and aware of, the environmental and resource sustainability issues of Taiwan. Furthermore, the paper reveals students' attitude toward priority of development options, their consumption patterns and their participation in environmental protection campaigns. Students advocate a fundamental change of the prevalent wasteful lifestyle to achieve the long-term sustainability of Taiwan. Copyright (C) 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.

TI Sustainability and institutional perspectives on natural resource
   planning and management at the Ukwimi resettlement scheme, Zambia
SO THIRD WORLD PLANNING REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
AB The Ukwimi refugee settlement was established in 1986 to cater for Mozambican refugees, and was praised by many as successfully establishing food self-sufficiency (see, for example, Billard, 1989). However, it received considerable criticism, particularly for its natural resource management, top-down planning and short-term perspective, in an article published in this journal nine years ago (Black and Mabwe, 1992). After the repatriation of refugees in 1994, because its infrastructure was already in place, Ukwimi was designated a resettlement scheme. This paper explores the suitability of resettlement schemes as a post-repatriation land use, by critically tracing the changes in approach to the management of the settlement since repatriation. Attention is given to understanding the role of natural resources (particularly those that are not privately owned) in the livelihood strategies of the settlers, and the extent to which the authorities have addressed some of the land and natural resource problems identified by Black and Mabwe. Data were collected through extensive interviews with settlers and key informants. It was found that, while greater efforts are being made to secure a sustainable future for the area, a top-down approach still prevails. A range of renewable natural resources plays a central role in the livelihoods of settlers, and the foundations of spontaneously emerging self-governing institutions are evident in some areas of natural resource management. Emphasis needs to be placed on nurturing their growth, to foster a greater degree of self-reliance and local investment in resources. It is concluded that resettlement schemes can be a valuable post-repatriation land use for refugee settlements, if settled at appropriate population densities with the aim of devolving power and responsibility to the settlers.

AB Forestry practices intended to ensure ecological sustainability have been developed rapidly during the past decade and now are widely deployed and promoted. In a recent special issue of the Scandinavian Journal of Forest Research, forest ecologists and biodiversity experts consider how this new management responds to Fennoscandian concerns about biodiversity. The authors conclude that the new forestry practices are largely untested scientific hypotheses, and explore a sound research framework aimed at improving management of boreal forests.

AB Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT) is a re-emerging disease whose usual treatments are becoming less efficient because of the increasing parasite resistance. Availability of HAT drugs is poor and their production in danger because of technical, ecological and economic constraints. In view of this dramatic situation, a network involving experts from NGOs, WHO and pharmaceutical producers was commissioned with updating estimates of need for each HAT drug for the coming years; negotiations with potential producers of new drugs such as eflornithine; securing sustainable manufacturing of existing drugs; clinical research into new combinations of these drugs for first and second-line treatments; centralizing drug purchases and their distribution through a unique non-profit entity; and addressing regulatory and legal issues concerning new drugs.

AB Effective medicines exist to treat or alleviate many diseases which predominate in the developing world and cause high mortality and morbidity rates. Price should not be an obstacle preventing access to these medicines. Increasingly, drug donations have been established by drug companies, but these are often limited in time, place or use. Measures exist which are more sustainable and will have a greater positive impact on people's health. Principally, these are encouraging generic competition; adopting into national legislation and implementing TRIPS safeguards to gain access to cheaper sources of drugs; differential pricing; creating high volume or high demand through global and regional procurement; and supporting the production of quality generic drugs by developing countries through voluntary licenses if needed, and facilitating technology transfer.

AB This paper focuses on the question of whether it is worse to be poor in a poor area or in an area which is more socially mixed; in short, does living in a deprived area compound the disadvantage experienced by its residents, and do area effects contribute to social exclusion? The idea of social areas having direct or mediated effects on the lives of their residents continues to interest and challenge academic and policy debates on the effect of concentrated poverty and on the creation of more mixed and, thereby, more sustainable neighbourhood forms. However, area effects remain contentious and British research evidence is scant. Following a review of the theoretical and empirical understandings of the relationship between households and neighbourhoods, the paper presents survey data from a comparative study of deprived and socially mixed neighbourhoods in Glasgow and Edinburgh. These data provide evidence that supports the area effects thesis, in particular in relation to area reputation and employment. The paper concludes that, with certain caveats, living in areas of geographically concentrated poverty creates additional problems for residents.

AB At many airports, aircraft deicing fluid and precipitation mix, becoming aircraft deicing runoff having a 5-day biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5) of 10(2) to 10(6) mg/L. Publicly owned treatment works can be used for aerobic biological treatment; however, it may be more economical to use anaerobic digesters to codigest a mixture of aircraft deicing fluid and sludge. The objectives of this investigation were to determine benefits and appropriate propylene glycol aircraft deicing fluid loadings to anaerobic codigesters. Results demonstrate aircraft deicing fluid can be successfully codigested to produce methane; supernatant BOD5 and Kjeldahl nitrogen concentration were not higher in codigesters compared to a conventional digester. Aircraft deicing fluid loadings as high as 1.6 g chemical oxygen demand (COD)/L(.)d were sustainable in codigesters, whereas system fed only aircraft deicing fluid with nutrients and alkalinity achieved a loading of 0.65 g COD/L(.)d. The sludge used increased digester alkalinity and provided nitrogen, iron, nickel, cobalt, and biomass required for methanogenesis. The deicer provides organics for increased methane production.

TI Poverty alleviation and tropical forests - What scope for synergies?
SO WORLD DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
DE poverty; forestry; conservation; environment
ID DEFORESTATION; CAMEROON; ECONOMY
AB This paper explores the "state-of-the-art" of the two-way causal links between poverty alleviation and natural tropical forests. Microimpacts of rising poverty can increase or slow forest loss. At the macrolevel, poverty also has an ambiguous effect, but it is probable that higher income stimulates forest loss by raising demand for agricultural land. The second question is what potential forest-led development has to alleviate a country's poverty, in terms of producer benefits, consumer benefits and economy-wide employment. Natural forests widely serve as "safety nets" for the rural poor, but it proves difficult to raise producer benefits significantly. Urban consumer benefits from forest, an important target for pro-poor agricultural innovation, are limited and seldom favor the poor. Absorption of (poor) unskilled labor is low in forestry, which tends to be capital-intensive. Natural forests may thus lack comparative advantage for poverty alleviation. There are few "win-win" synergies between natural forests and national poverty reduction, which may help to explain why the loss of tropical forests is ongoing. This may have important implications for our understanding of "sustainable forest development" and for the design of both conservation and poverty-alleviation strategies.

ID SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
AB Countries are becoming increasingly aware of the importance of science and technology in relation to national development and the necessity of formulating a concise science and technology policy. The need to strengthen and orient the scientific and technological infrastructure in line with national development goals, through more effective use of an available qualified work force and the higher education system, is becoming widely recognized. Consequently, appropriate methods of assessing the impact of science and technology on national development are needed so that efforts are concentrated on areas potentially having substantial impacts. Numerous planning studies have been undertaken to this end, particularly by international organizations such as UNESCO, UNIDO, OECD and IEA. This study examines the inter-relationships of the disciplines of science and technology with energy and environment research and development (R&D) activities, particularly for developing countries. The connections between these topics are discussed along with some basic methods that can be used to exploit the relations. Some illustrative examples are presented. It is anticipated that the present study will serve as a preliminary step for more comprehensive work by providing an example of the utilization of formal methods in formulating science and technology policy for energy and environment R&D.

AB Perfusion cultures of CHO cells producing t-PA were performed using acoustic filter cell retention. A robust off-line glucose analysis and predictive control protocol was developed to maintain the process within approximately 0.5 mM of the glucose set point, without the need for a more fallible on-line sensor. Glucose usage (the difference between the inlet and reactor glucose concentrations) provided an easily measured indicator of overall medium utilization for mapping acceptable ranges of operation, including the edge of failure. Earlier onset of perfusion with a ramping glucose set point (1.5 mM/d) resulted in improved growth and consistency during the perfusion culture start-up. At steady state, the t-PA concentration variability increased gradually with increasing glucose usage up to approximately 22 mM, then up to 24 mM the variability increased threefold. Peak t-PA concentrations of over 90 mg/L were obtained by controlling at a glucose usage of approximately 24 mM, but these t-PA levels were not sustainable for more than 3 days. A consistent t-PA concentration of 40 mg/L was obtained at a glucose usage of 21.5 mM. (C) 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

AB Understanding natural fire regimes is crucial to developing harvesting scenarios and conducting sustainable resource management in the boreal forest. To gain this understanding, resource professionals need efficient and cost-effective data collection methods that can operate over vast and isolated landscapes. We compared three Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR)/Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) methods of fire detection and mapping for a case study in northern Ontario, Canada, of the 1992, 1993, and 1995 fire seasons. Fire mapping accuracy was assessed by the spatial coincidence between mapped fires and ground-truthed information using a decision-tree approach and by testing the hypothesis that various calculated accuracy components were equal within an ANOVA design. Ground-truthed fire sizes and shapes were correlated with the AVHRR/NDVI-mapped areas; however, light cloud contamination increased false detection of fires due to NDVI suppression. The multiple threshold technique of change detection provided better estimates of fire areas than did single threshold methods. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

ID PAST
AB Few topics in the last few years have received such widespread attention in politics and the media as climate - climate change climate catastrophes. Usually anthropogenic perturbations of the climate system which result from the combustion of fossil fuels (i.e. carbon dioxide emissions) are held to be responsible for the observed changes. However, in the present climate debate the dynamic and magnitude of natural climate changes are usually overseen. In this regard, the task of the geoscientists is to obtain reliable data on the climate of the past. Studies of the rocks deposited in the past and of the ice of large glaciers provide information about the past climate to geologists. Sea surface temperatures of past oceans, droughts on the continents or atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations of ancient times are climate facts that can be reconstructed. It should be highlighted that carbon dioxide is not the driving force of the climate system unlike the usually quoted opinion. Reconstructions of past climate rather apparently suggest that the sun is the motor which drives our climate system. However, we must not conclude that this finding gives us the liberty to exploit and burn our fossil energy resources without scrupulosity. Our fossil sources of energy are a gift of nature and cannot be recycled. If we combust fossil fuels to generate energy they will be no longer available in the future. Although, coal will be no scarce commodity during the next 200 years, our conventional oil resources will incline to an end during the 21 st century. Hence, sustainable development requires to save energy.

AB The Kosi estuarine system, located in northern KwaZulu-Natal, is becoming an increasingly popular angling venue. Recreational catch card data from the National Marine Linefish System for the years 1986 to 1999 were analysed to determine total catch, catch composition, catch per unit effort (CPUE), seasonality of catches and annual trends in catch composition. A total of 17 families, comprising 34 species, was reported in catches of recreational anglers. Pomadasys spp., predominantly Pomadasys commersonni was the most prominent taxon caught in terms of both numbers and mass. Seasonal trends in catch rates were observed, with more fish caught in the summer and autumn months. The catch rate fluctuated annually. Fluctuations in CPUE were closely correlated to the number of cards collected, which reflects bias in the data. Despite annual fluctuations in CPUE, regression analysis revealed a slight increase in overall CPUE with time. However, CPUE for Acanthopagrus berda and Lutjanus argentimaculatus decreased steadily since 1986. The decline of these two estuarine-dependent species may indicate that the total fishing levels are not sustainable.

AB The quantification of nutrient fluxes is an important step in the development of sustainable land use systems, especially on low-fertility soils of the humid tropics. Nutrient concentrations in rainfall (RF), throughfall (TF) and stemflow (SF) were measured for ten rainfall events in a polyculture (multi-strata agroforestry system) composed of five tree crops, three tree crop monocultures, spontaneous tree fallow and two rainforest tree species in central Amazonia and nutrient fluxes were calculated for a 1 year period. Nutrient inputs in wet deposition during 1 year were 5.5 kg ha(-1) of total N, of which 42% were in the organic form, 0.07 kg ha(-1) of total P, of which 71% were in the organic form, 2.6 kg ha(-1) of K, 0.8 ka ha(-1) of Ca and 0.3 kg ha(-1) of Mg. The nutrient concentrations in TF and SF were influenced by tree species, land use system, nutrient status of the trees and size of the rain events. The rainforest species had high N but low P concentrations in their TF and SR The highest P concentrations were measured in SF of annatto (Bixa orellana), which was 115 times richer in total P and 400 times richer in phosphate-P than RF for small rain events. Higher fertilizer application increased the concentrations of P and Mg in TF and SF. On the plot level, the nutrient fluxes in TF and SF were greatest in the systems with the highest plant density and crown cover (fallows and palm monocultures). On the species level, strong increases of the nutrient fluxes in TF and SF were observed close to the stem of certain trees compared with the plot average (more than 10 fold for P, K and Mg under peach palm Bactris gasipaes). In the polycultures and the fallow, the recycling of N, P, Ca and Mg in TF and SF was about 5-10% of the total recycling including Litterfall, but was 50-53% for K (77% in the peach palm monocultures). Throughfall and SF are most relevant for K cycling and by influencing small-scale patterns of nutrient inputs into the soil. Stemflow is especially important in vegetation with high stem density, such as certain fallows and in systems dominated by palms. These results can help to devise measurement programs for nutrient cycling in tree-dominated land use systems and spontaneous vegetation in the humid tropics. Possible effects of concentrated nutrient solutions on microbial processes in soil and litter merit further investigation. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Knowledge about fossil energy use in agricultural systems is needed, because it can improve the understanding of how to reduce the unsustainable use of limited energy resources and the following greenhouse gas emissions. This study describes and validates a model to assess fossil energy use in Danish agriculture; gives an example of how the model can be used to compare organic and conventional farming; and discusses the implications and potentials of using the model to simulate energy use in scenarios of agricultural production. The model is a development of an existing model, which was too coarse to predict measured energy use on Danish farms. The model was validated at the field operational, the crop type, and the national level, and can supplement the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change manual to quantify fossil energy use and subsequent carbon dioxide emissions from agriculture. The model can be used to model energy use as one indicator in a multi-criteria evaluation of sustainability, also including other agroecological and socio-economic indicators.
   As an example, energy use for eight conventional and organic crop types on loamy, sandy, and irrigated sandy soil was compared. The energy use was generally lower in the organic than in the conventional system, but yields were also lower. Consequently, conventional crop production had the highest energy production, whereas organic crop production had the highest energy efficiency. Generally, grain cereals such as wheat have a lower energy use per area than roughage crops such as beets. However, because of higher roughage crop yields per area, energy use per feed unit was higher in the roughage crops. Energy use for both conventional cattle and pig production was found to be higher than that for organic production. With respect to fossil energy use per produced livestock unit, agro-ecosystems producing pigs were in both cases less energy effective than those producing cattle.
   Fossil energy use for three scenarios of conversion to organic farming with increasing fodder import was compared to current conventional farming in Denmark. The scenario with the highest fodder import showed the highest energy use per livestock unit produced. In all scenarios, the energy use per unit produced was lower than in the present situation. However, the total Danish crop production was also lower. In conclusion, the model can be used to simulate scenarios, which can add new information to the discussion of future, sustainable agricultural production. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

TI Influence of soil protection techniques on runoff, erosion and plant

SO AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT

DE Cabo Verde; erosion; water balance; biomass production; hedges; mulch
AB A combination of human, climatic, geomorphological and pedological factors has led to extensive degradation of the soils of the Cabo Verde Islands. To survive in fragile conditions, the stabilisation of the farming systems and the maintenance of high and sustainable yields have become absolute priorities for farmers. The project described here is part of a programme of water resource optimisation on the island of Santiago in a semi-arid mountainous area near Godim. The objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of two conservation techniques (light mulching with maize (Zea mays L.) haulms and hedging with bushes and grass) on runoff, erosion and phytomass production under natural rainfall. The main data were collected on five runoff plots of 100 m(2) and 10 pairs of 4 m2 plots scattered over the hillslope. Although, rainfall erosivity was higher than in Sahelian areas, runoff occurred only for rainfall higher than 40 mm and intensities over 40 mm/h. Soil losses reached 12 mm/year on bare plots, 48 min with traditional crops, 3.1 mm, with hedges and less than 0.03 mm under mulching on 50% slopes. This study confirmed that mulching alone, or associated with the plantation of hedges, reduces runoff and erosion on the steep slopes of the Cabo Verde mountains. However, the ability to improve the use of the water resources by grain-producing crops in semi-arid regions was questionable. Plant material for mulching was only available and efficient during the wet years. The efficiency was therefore irregular and depended on the abundance of rainfall, weed production and the degree of satisfaction of plant water and nutrient requirements at the critical moment when the crops are in flower. Hedges of Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) De Wit or Cajanus cajan (L.) Huth (Congo pea), without ditches or banks, planted on the flat and mulched could contribute to the supply of fodder in the dry season as well as blocking rivulet runoff and erosion in the Sahelian area.

TI Impact of the safe water system on water quality in cyclone-affected
   communities in Madagascar
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH
LA English
DT Article
AB Cyclone Hudah struck the northeastern coast of Madagascar in the spring of 2000. Over a 5-month period, 11700 relief kits consisting of bottles of water disinfectant and foldable jerry cans were distributed to the affected population. Five months after the cyclone, a survey was conducted in 12 villages to determine the impact of these relief kits on water quality.
   Seventy-six percent of the surveyed households reported using jerry cans, and 65% reported using the disinfectant. Stored water in households using both products had significantly less microbiological contamination than stored water in other households. To improve the prospects for a sustainable intervention, the response plan for future disasters should incorporate a transition to recovery and development, including formative research into local customs, beliefs, and water handling habits, and funding support to initiate social marketing.

AB The cost-effectiveness of lambdacyhalothrin-treated nets in comparison with conventional DDT spraying for malaria control among migrant populations was evaluated in a malaria hyperendemic area along the Thai-Myanmar border. Ten hamlets of 243 houses with 948 inhabitants were given only treated nets. Twelve hamlets of 294 houses and 1,315 population were in the DDT area, and another 6 hamlets with 171 houses and 695 inhabitants were in the non-DDT-treated area. The impregnated net program was most cost-effective (US$1.54 per 1 case of prevented malaria). Spraying with DDT was more cost-effective than malaria surveillance alone ($1.87 versus $2.50 per 1 case of prevented malaria). These data suggest that personal protection measures with insecticide-impregnated mosquito net are justified in their use to control malaria in highly malaria-endemic areas in western Thailand.

AB This study investigated the relationship between measured environmental impact and tourists' perception of it, at ten sites in Central Australia. A positive relationship between annual visitation to a site and measurable impact was found, despite the small amount of tourism impact in the area. Tourists' perception of impact varied in degree. A majority identified relevant environmental threats (tourism or introduced species), while a smaller proportion suggested management options to address track spreading, the major impact identified by this study. Overall, environmental conditions were rated lower at sites with a higher intensity of impacts, reflecting some tourists' ability to distinguish impacts.

AB This paper contributes to the continuing discussion concerning the paradox that tourism destroys the object of its desire An analysis is made Of tourism relations and hospitality in a Turkish village, and it is argued that in their close interactions with tourists traveling independently of organized tour groups, local people are in a position to negotiate both their own "traditional" identity in the presence of tourists and the latter's quests and experiences in themselves. A dynamic notion of sustainability in Cultural tourism is developed, by challenging the assumptions that tourist localities must remain authentically "traditional" to meet with the expectations of tourists.

TI An assessment of soil nitrogen testing considering the carry-over effect
SO APPLIED MATHEMATICAL MODELLING
LA English
DT Article
AB In order to evaluate the economic and environmental consequences of soil nitrogen tests, this paper combines a dynamic fertilizer use decision model with a crop production model. The pre-side-dress soil N-test is evaluated for a hypothetical farmer growing corn at the ARS Sustainable Agriculture Demonstration Farm site in southern Maryland. For a farmer not currently using a soil N-test, adoption of this technology can lead to the enhancement of net farm income and the reduction in nitrogen loss to the environment. This will transpire only if the farmer is currently underestimating nitrogen carry-over by more than 25% or applying nitrogen fertilizer based solely on an expected plateau-yield goal.

TI Forecasting of freshwater demand in Kuwait
SO ARABIAN JOURNAL FOR SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING

DT Article
DE econometric model; linear regression model; population growth
AB One of the major tasks of a government is to ensure a reliable supply of fresh water to the population for sustainable living and growth in living standard. This is all the more important in an and country like Kuwait, where usable water is in short supply. The decision to expand the existing capacity of fresh water production is determined by the projected future demand. A good understanding of the factors influencing demand and reliable estimates of the parameters describing demand behavior and consumption patterns are prerequisites. An analysis of historical data on water consumption and other relevant parameters has been carried out and an econometric model of freshwater consumption in Kuwait has been developed in this context. Based on various assumptions on the growth of population, per capita consumption, economic growth, and immigration policy, projections of freshwater demand till the year 2025 have been made with the help of this model. For the year 2025, this figure varies in the range of 1027 to 3036 Mm(3)/year. The government tariff and immigration policies are expected to have major influence on the future demand growth.

AB We model cosmic dust grains as aggregates (clusters) of spheres of appropriate geometry, whose optical properties we calculate in the framework of the transition matrix method. The calculation is performed without resorting to any approximation and with a computational effort that is noticeably lighter than the one required by other methods. Whatever the geometry chosen to model the cosmic grains, the orientational averages that are necessary to describe the propagation of the electromagnetic radiation through a dispersion of clusters are easily handled by exploiting the transformation properties of the transition matrix elements under rotation of the coordinate frame. In this paper we focus on the potentialities of the cluster model by comparing the extinction spectrum of a sphere of astronomical silicates with those of aggregates containing the same mass of silicates and composed of up to 12 spheres. Our main result is that, when a given mass of silicates is subdivided into clustering spheres, the extinction increases in regions of the spectrum determined by the degree of subdivision. We also show to what extent the substitution of the material of some of the clustering spheres with the same volume of carbon changes the extinction signature of the clusters. Finally we show to what extent modification of the geometry of the clusters produces detectable changes in their optical signatures. Detailed analysis of our results leads us to the conclusion that modeling the dust grains as clusters of a single morphology is not sufficient to describe the extinction in the whole wavelength range of astrophysical interest. The cluster model may help emphasize the decisive role of morphology in the identification of sustainable structures for dust grains in the typical physical and chemical conditions of the diffuse interstellar medium.

AB Bipolar disorder remains a high morbidity and costly illness in general clinical practice, despite the availability of efficacious medications. This 'efficacy-effectiveness gap' (1, 2) may be addressed by better organizing systems of care. One type of intervention is the 'collaborative practice model' which can be defined as an organization of care that a) emphasizes development in the patient of illness management skills, and b) supports provider capability and availability in order to c) engage patients in timely, joint decision-making regarding their illness.
   This article describes such a collaborative practice model for bipolar disorder, designed to be widely adoptable and sustainable in general clinical practice. The first part of the article describes the theoretical background from which the collaborative practice approach developed, emphasizing its origins in the lithium clinics of the 1970s, in nursing theory and practice, and more recently in the management of chronic medical diseases. The second part describes the structure of one such intervention, the Bipolar Disorders Program (BDP) developed in the Veterans Affairs health care system. The third part summarizes results from single-site studies of the intervention. The fourth part describes several key issues in its implementation in an ongoing multi-site randomized controlled trial, VA Cooperative Study Program (CSP) # 430.
   Data to date indicate that such collaborative practice interventions may improve important process and intermediate outcome variables for bipolar disorder. The BDP provides an example of a multi-faceted collaborative practice model that can be manualized and implemented across multiple sites in a randomized controlled trial.

AB A large number of propagules and a broad spectrum of species are two important components of ecosystem (including agroecosystem) sustainability. Previous studies carried out in temperate areas showed that repeated monoculture leads to a decrease in the species abundance of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF). This study evaluated the influence of maize monoculture and its agricultural practices on AMF during three consecutive cropping years in a Brazilian field. At the end of each cycle, soil and root samples were evaluated for species composition, spore populations and root colonization by AMF. The AMF community present during this period was scored according to the Spearman rank correlation and Principal Components Analysis. The mean percent root colonization values for the three cultivation periods were: 66.9, 60.7 and 70.5, respectively. Seven species were detected in the first year, Scutellospora persica being the most abundant (24.1% of spores) and Glomus macrocarpum the most observed (100% of samples). In the second year, Glomus etunicatum was the species with the greatest number of spores (24.7%) and, like G. macrocarpum, the most frequently observed (90%) in a community of thirteen. In the third year, twenty-three AMF species were identified, Scutellospora sp. I being the most abundant (17.4%), and Gigaspora decipiens and Glomus claroideum the most frequent (both with a relative frequency of 70%). The main soil factors influencing root colonization and sporulation by AMF were pH (and related properties), phosphorus and organic matter contents.

TI Implementing ecosystem-based management of fisheries in the context of
   US regional fisheries management: Recommendations of the NMFS ecosystem
   principles advisory panel
SO CALIFORNIA COOPERATIVE OCEANIC FISHERIES INVESTIGATIONS REPORTS
LA English
DT Article
AB The Sustainable Fisheries Act of 1996 requires the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) to convene an expert panel to assess the current application of ecosystem principles in U.S. fisheries conservation, management, and research and to make recommendations for increasing their application. The panel identified eight ecosystem principles and six associated policies for ecosystem-based fisheries management, with the goal of maintaining ecosystem health and sustainability. These principles, policies, and goals were used to evaluate current fisheries management practices in the United States. The panel concluded that there are some encouraging examples of ecosystem approaches, but they are limited in scope and not comprehensive. Similarly, U.S. fisheries research tends to parallel traditional single-species fisheries management, although notable ecosystem research is being conducted.
   To increase the application of ecosystem-based management, the panel recommends developing fishery ecosystem plans (FEPs) for each major ecosystem in the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). These plans will coordinate actions taken under existing single-species or species-complex fishery management plans (FMPs). The panel also proposes enhanced research on (1) the ecosystem effects of fishing, (2) ecosystem trends and dynamics, and (3) institutional and governance aspects of ecosystem-based fishery management. To implement these recommendations, a practical. iterative approach is envisioned which would generate a rapid increase in the use of existing ecosystem knowledge in fisheries management and prioritization of research.

AB The Huizache-Caimanero coastal lagoon system supports all economically important artisanal shrimp fishery and a less valuable finfish fishery. We analyze the response Of the fisheries and the ecosystem to changes in fishing effort. To do this we use Ecosim-a dynamic version of Ecopath, which is a steady-state model emphasizing natural rates of growth and consumption of marine populations. we examine changes, in each group's biomass and determine which fishing strategies optimize yields oil the basis of economic, social, and ecological criteria. We find that two of the four exploited fish groups. centropomids and gerreids, are underutilized: the other two. ariids and mugilids, are near the maximum sustainable yield. We find that the shrimp resource is overexploited. Our simulations suggest that the optimal management strategy occurs with a small increase in effort in the finfish fishery (1.24 times) combined with a small reduction of effort (0.8 times) in the shrimp fishery. This strategy enhances fishery yields of centropomids and gerreids, thereby decreasing the biomass of finfish and resulting in fewer (lower biomass of) shrimp predators. Simulations suggest that applying the optimal fishing strategy increases economic profits by ten percent.

TI Exploitation trajectory of a declining fauna: a century of freshwater
   mussel fisheries in North America
SO CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES
LA English
DT Article
ID UNITED-STATES; BIVALVIA; CONSERVATION
AB Freshwater mussels (Bivalvia: Unionidae) have been an economically valuable biological resource in North America since the mid-1800s. Although the industries based upon mussel harvest are quite distinct from one another, the trends apparent in harvest statistics are remarkably similar among each successive harvest era. Whether fished for freshwater pearls, button production, or cultured pearl production, market factors have driven commercial harvests while the life history and ecology of mussels have been largely ignored. Annual yields of freshwater mussels are declining throughout the United States and catch per unit effort (CPUE) has declined dramatically in some of the most important American mussel fisheries. Harvest statistics indicate that mussel populations are dangerously depleted due to the erosion of the latest industry based upon their harvest. It seems likely that the exhaustive harvests of both the distant and recent past, coupled with habitat loss and degradation, have left North American unionid mussel populations at levels insufficient to support the substantial harvests consistently demanded by industry. This century-long exploitation trajectory provides valuable lessons about the mechanisms of fisheries collapse that are necessary to ensure the sustainable management of aquatic resources.

TI An industrial scale dehydration process for natural gas involving
   membranes
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING & TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB An industrial scale dehydration process based on hollow fiber membranes for lowering the dew point of natural gas is described in this paper. A pilot test with the feed flux scale of 12x10(4) Nm(3)/d was carried out. Dew points of -8 degreesC-13 degreesC at a gas transport pressure in the pipeline of 4.6M Pa and methane recovery of more than 98% were attained. The water vapor content of the product gas could be maintained around 0.01 vol% during a continuous run of about 700 hours. The effects of feed flux and operation pressure on methane recovery and water vapor content were also investigated. Additionally, some auxiliary technologies, such as a full-time engine using natural gas as fuel and the utilization of vent gas in the process, are also discussed. A small amount of the vent gas from the system was used as a fuel for an engine to drive vacuum pumps, and the heat expelled from the engine was used to warm up the natural gas feed. The whole system can be operated in a self-sustainable manner from an energy point of view, and has a relatively high efficiency in the utilization of natural gas.

AB The once-extensive tallgrass prairie community of North America has been reduced to small remnants, many of which are surrounded by intensive corn (Zea mays) agriculture. We investigated adult corn-rootworm beetles (Cbrysomelidae: Diabrotica spp.), important pests of corn, on sunflowers (Asteraceae: Helianthus spp.) in prairie remnants In southeast Minnesota. Large numbers of beetles invaded the prairie from surrounding cornfields in late summer. D. barberi and D. virgifera were captured on sticky traps in all locations in the prairie, but abundance was much greater near the edge adjacent to corn. We observed D. barberi (but not D. virgifera) feeding extensively on sunflower pollen and occasionally on other flower parts, such as petals. Sunflowers located nearer cornfields sustained more floral damage than those farther from corn. To determine the effect of beetle damage on seed set, we enclosed sunflower heads in bags with either zero, two, or four D. barberi adults. Seed set was reduced in heads enclosed with D. barberi. Thus, this agricultural pest may interfere with the successful reproduction of sunflowers and possibly other prairie composites that flower in late summer. Given the small size of most prairie remnants and the abundance of this flower feeding beetle in landscapes dominated by corn agriculture, D. barberi may affect the sustainability of prairie plant populations.

AB The establishment and spread of invasive plants could be enhanced by plant-soil feedbacks that alter the cycling of biologically important elements. In New Zealand. overgrazing of tussock grasslands in the South Island has led to land degradation and simultaneous invasion of exotic weeds (primarily Hieracium spp.) over large areas. While Hieracium continues to spread rapidly, little is known about variation in the impact of Hieracium across landscapes characterized by a range of environmental conditions. We examined the impact of Hieracium invasion on soil and ecosystem processes first at the scale of individual patches under one disturbance regime and uniform "environment" (i.e.. one aspect and elevation), and then under different environmental conditions (aspects) and disturbance regimes (long-term grazing, no grazing since 1978). Around individual plants on heavily grazed north-facing slopes with significant bare ground, Hieracium invasion increased total soil C and N and lowered soil pH and mineral N relative to the adjacent herb-field vegetation. Soil C mineralization was higher, and net N mineralization was lower under Hieracium than under the adjacent herb-field vegetation. Litter quality differences did not explain differences in net N mineralization. However, results from (13)C NMR spectroscopy suggest qualitative differences in organic-matter inputs under Hieracium compared to native vegetation. These results suggest that Hieracium may lower N availability by outcompeting native plants for mineral N, making it difficult for native species to reestablish and promoting the spread of Hieracium. Our results differed on cooler, wetter, less heavily grazed south-facing slopes, where soil C and N pools and cycling rates were lower under Hieracium than under the native herb-field vegetation (which differed across aspects). Whether the (longer term) impact of Hieracium on the south aspect resembles that on the north aspect may depend on management. Our results suggest that Hieracium invasion can alter ecosystem processes, but the impact of invasion may depend on the ecological context (aspect and disturbance) prior to invasion.

AB Achieving sustainable prey fish assemblages that support sport fish predator populations is a fundamental challenge to fisheries managers. Among Midwestern and Southeastern (USA) reservoirs, gizzard shad, Dorosoma cepedianum, have been widely stocked to improve predator growth. However, these stockings have yielded highly variable effects on sport fish, due in part to highly variable recruitment of gizzard shad. To determine whether reservoir productivity can be used to classify reservoirs according to recruitment of gizzard shad, we quantified gizzard shad recruitment along a mesotrophic to hypereutrophic productivity gradient, We sampled 12 reservoirs during May through June 1993, to evaluate the hypothesis that larval gizzard shad foraging success and survival increase with reservoir productivity. Both hatch abundance and survival of larval gizzard shad correlated positively with total phosphorus concentrations (TP), an indicator of reservoir productivity. Abundance of 15-mm (total length) larval gizzard shad survivors, an indicator of age-0 year class strength, increased by two orders of magnitude across TP concentrations. Larval gizzard shad foraging success increased with availability of preferred, small zooplankton prey. However, abundance of small zooplankton did not increase with reservoir TP concentrations, and larval survival did not increase with foraging success. These results provide mechanistic understanding for the relative lack of gizzard shad in mesotrophic reservoirs, and the dominance of gizzard shad in hypereutrophic reservoirs. In hypereutrophic reservoirs, negative effects of gizzard shad on sport fish may be alleviated by reducing phosphorus loading from the watershed, suggesting a watershed approach to this fishery and water quality problem.

AB This paper proposes to qualify a country's human development as potentially unsustainable if the net depreciation of its manufactured and natural capital stock is bigger than its investment. Linking the Human Development Index with sustainability in this way would allow the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) to check whether a country is 'mortgaging the choices of future generations'. An analysis for 155 countries leads to the conclusion that the indicated human development of 42 countries is potentially unsustainable. Most of these countries have a low HDI, which means that even this low achievement is not sustainable into the future. The results make a case for both a policy reform within these countries and for external assistance to help maintain at least this low level of human development. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB In this case study of the Yale agro-pastoral zone in southern Burkina Faso, the sustainability of tsetse control as a local public good was shown to depend upon farmers' contributions to establish and maintain the traps and targets that attract and kill tsetse flies. Contingent valuation (CV) techniques were used to generate estimates of farmers' willingness to pay for tsetse control in money, labour, or both forms of payment. Of the 261 households that participated in the CV survey, these proportions were 23, 37 and 40%. respectively, indicating differentiation among the population and an overall preference for labour contribution. A comparison of predicted versus actual contribution of labour indicated that only 56% of households that said they would contribute actually contributed; 3% of households that said they would not contribute actually contributed. Major factors affecting contingent contributions of labour in discrete choice models were identified as well as those to account for in any successful scheme for actual labour contribution. These factors include the age of household head, offtake of cattle, involvement in secondary activities, membership in rural organizations, current expenditure on drug therapy, and cash-on-hand. The results also indicate that full cost-recovery of the investment in targets-about US$8000-could not be achieved in the short run with the proposed contribution of US$0.90-1.00 per month per household. Contingent contributions of money were interpreted as maximum donations to expect of beneficiaries as part of the total cost of providing tsetse control. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Agroforestry can help prevent land degradation while allowing continuing use of land to produce crops and livestock on a sustainable basis. Despite the recognition that trees may have a high environmental value at the local level and the attention agroforestry has received as a tool for sustainable agricultural development, there is a lack of formal economic analyses on the role of agroforestry; this need is addressed in this study. A general economic analysis of an agroforestry operation on land prone to degradation and in the presence of positive forest externalities is developed. A numerical application is presented, based on a biophysical model of a watershed. The model is used to assess the value of forest externalities and the marginal cost of land degradation. The potential cost of incentives required to achieve a given target level of land productivity is estimated. The technique illustrated in this paper could be used to provide cost estimates that would serve as a basis for initial negotiations between stakeholders in a watershed wishing to establish a common-property approach to land management.

AB There is an increasing awareness of ecosystem services and use of ecological engineering in today's search for more sustainable wastewater treatment systems, but there is still great uncertainty about how to compare and evaluate the ecological sustainability of different systems. The aim of this study was to analyze the use of resources in three different wastewater treatment systems: (i) conventional three-step treatment (WWTP), (ii) conventional mechanical and chemical treatment complemented with a constructed wetland (TP + CW), and (c) treatment in a natural wetland (NW), and to investigate to what extent increased space, time, and dependence of ecosystem services could substitute for purchased input in wastewater treatment. In order to compare resources of different quality we used emergy analysis, assessing the amount of solar energy required, directly and indirectly, for a certain production. Emergy use due to purchased inputs and to local renewable inputs differed substantially between the three treatment system studies, with emergy ratios of purchased to local renewable inputs of 9:1, 141:1, and 3056:1 for NW, TP + CW, and WWTP, respectively. Total use of emergy per person equivalent (p.e.) and kg phosphorus was similar in all three systems, strengthening our hypothesis of unchanged total emergy use in systems of different purchased input and land use. However, in the present study, purchased input was not fully substituted, while the natural wetland, apart from requiring a large land area, also needed a lot of purchased resources to fulfil the strict rules for wastewater treatment prescribed by society.

AB Engineering of land use systems for policy-oriented future studies and the development of new farming systems requires various information sources. Often, both process knowledge and data are subject to uncertainty that affects quantification of land use systems in their inputs and outputs. This paper analyzes the effects of uncertainty in three important N-relationships relevant for quantification of future-oriented cropping systems: (i) N-leaching as function of crop characteristics, (ii) N-concentration as function of yield level, and (iii) the recovery of crop residue-N. Based on verifiable assumptions, uncertainty in these three N-relationships is specified in terms of N-loss and production costs of cropping systems. Data and process knowledge as applied in LUCTOR, a summary model to design and quantify inputs and outputs of cropping systems for the northern Atlantic zone of Costa Rica, are used as a case study. All three relationships and their uncertainty have a major impact on N-loss of cropping systems, while effects on costs are limited and depend on the share of costs for fertilizer management in total production costs. Analyses as presented explicitly specify uncertainty of process knowledge and data used in future-oriented studies. Therefore, such analyses enable a better management or reduction of uncertainty through the identification of cropping systems with smaller uncertainty margins, and identification of research aimed at a more complete understanding of involved processes.

AB The effects of logging on ecosystem sustainability are controversial. Surprisingly, existing data are inadequate to allow a comprehensive evaluation of logging effects on biodiversity, composition, and productivity since appropriate comparisons of stands of similar ages and differing disturbance histories are rare. We addressed this issue using a study of 2000 plots in 80 southern boreal forest stands in northern Minnesota, USA, wherein we contrasted naturally regenerated aspen (Populus tremuloides), jack pine (Pinus banksiana), and black spruce (Picea mariana) stands established following logging or the dominant natural disturbance, wildfire, for stands of two age classes (25-40 and 70-100 yr old). For young stands, those established postlogging had higher vascular plant diversity than those postwildfire. Otherwise, we found no evidence of differing species diversity (including canopy tree, shrub, herbaceous, and bryophyte species), composition, productivity, or nitrogen cycling, in forest stands of comparable age and forest type that originated after logging compared to after wildfire. These variables, however, differed significantly among forest types, with aboveground net primary productivity and plant species diversity generally higher in aspen than jack pine stands, even when growing on comparable soils, and lowest in black spruce. Although there is evidence that logging has increased the proportional landscape dominance by aspen, a forest type with higher diversity, nutrient cycling, and productivity than other types, our evidence refutes the idea that disturbance by logging has diminished stand-scale productivity or plant diversity in comparison to the common natural disturbance, wildfire.

AB We investigated the long-term effects of shifting cultivation on soil phosphorus pools to understand the effects of repeated intense disturbance on nutrient cycling in rain forests and to assess the sustainability of a widespread tropical agricultural system. We studied 24 sites that formed a gradient of cultivation history near a village in West Kalimantan, Indonesia, where long-fallow shifting cultivation has been practiced for at least 200 yr. The sites, including primary forest, had undergone 0-10 prior cycles (each similar to 20 yr) of cultivation and forest regrowth. The number of swidden-fallow cycles experienced at a given site was determined through interviews. Using sequential chemical extraction of surface soils, we inferred changes in the distribution and availability of soil phosphorus during 200 yr of shifting cultivation. We examined the relative importance of fire vs. secondary forest biota in mediating the changes observed by heating soils in the laboratory to simulate the conditions of a slash fire and assessing data on root presence by depth.
   Over the first four cycles (similar to 80 yr), total phosphorus in the top 30 cm of soil increased by a mean of 73 kg(.)ha(-1)-cycle(-1) (3.7 kg(.)ha(-1.)yr(-1)), much of it in the organic NaOH-extractable and the inorganic, concentrated HCl-extractable, fractions. Accounting for differences in original site fertility, total P did not change significantly over 2-10 cycles (similar to 200 yr), but the distribution shifted from both available and highly recalcitrant inorganic forms to available organic and occluded inorganic forms. NaOH-P-i decreased from 28% to 13%, and residual P decreased from 30% to 10% of total P. In contrast, NaOH-P-o increased from 13% to 26%, and cHCI-P-i increased from 15% to 40%.
   The significant increase in soil organic phosphorus in combination with greater concentrations of fine roots deep in the soil profile suggest that deep-rooting fallow vegetation, rather than fire, is responsible for increasing, and maintaining, total phosphorus. The magnitude of changes induced by the fire are not great enough to account for the increases observed over several cycles, especially considering coincidental losses. Despite losses of nonoccluded P-i, we believe the availability of phosphorus may have been enhanced over 200 yr due to an increase in the stable organic phosphorus fraction. Long-fallow shifting cultivation, as practiced in West Kalimantan, can continue to support rural populations for some time.

AB Weaving hats with jipi, Carludovica palmata (Cyclanthaceae) has built the local economy and cultural identity for the people of Becal, in the Yucatan peninsula, Mexico. They obtain most material front cultivated sources, it-cave in man-made caves, and market the goods to commercial centers. Because Jipi does not appear to deplete the soil, they do not need to clear more land for sustainable production. Although weaving traditionally served as the main source of income and social activity in Becal, interest in weaving is declining as the town modernizes. Although profits gained from weaving add to family earnings, because of the many hands through which the hat passes, this income remains low compared to the final selling prices. Thus, many who have the opportunity to pursue other careers are doing so. However, for rural communities, without other carning options, weaving may provide an economically, and environmentally advantageous way to use the land.

AB Contemporary globalization in the Andes challenges the sustainability and quality of rural livelihoods. However, it is also the case that rural people have often addressed these destructive dimensions of economic globalization through a progressively deeper engagement in other types of globalized relationship. They have done this by organizing, through engagements with networks linking them to international actors, and through participation in new product and labor markets. While such global entanglements do not guarantee local development and empowerment, they offer one of the few ways to confront the demise of rural localities.
   This paper discusses such sets of globalized relationships in four localities in Bolivia, Ecuador and Peru. Particular attention is paid to the ways in which the emergence and activities of local organizations and social movements have been affected by the nature of their relationships with wider transnational development networks, and the constraints and possibilities that come with these relationships. The cases demonstrate how forms of global entanglement vary greatly across sites, and so suggest that the effects of globalization on livelihoods and landscapes are not easy to judge normatively or ex ante. Instead they imply that rather than speaking of globalization generically, it is important to consider the types and sequences of globalized relationships in which people and places have been enmeshed. This suggests the need for historically situated studies of 'glocalization' in order to understand both the actual processes of livelihood change under conditions of globalization, and the conditions under which more sustainable and locally governed rural livelihoods and landscapes might be built.

AB Global economic change and the discourses, models and practice of international sustainable development are major forces of ecological construction and restructuring. The paper illustrates how the social and ecological co-construction of forests in the Zambrana-Chacuey region in the Dominican Republic has material consequences for distinct groups of people and for other species in rural landscapes. The introduction of the Acacia mangium - a fast growing tree - as a timber cash crop for smallholder farmers in the region between 1984 and 1994 had major social, economic and ecological consequences. A rural federation collaborated with ENDA-Caribe, an international non-government organization, in a ten-year social forestry experiment to develop and promote economically and environmentally viable timber cash cropping systems for smallholder farmers. The experience of the federation members provides a window on the workings of gender, class and popular organization in the making of forest ecologies, and demonstrates the influence of transnational sustainable development models and organizations in the social and biological transformation of rural life. The encounter between the complex social and ecological context with an apparently simple project yields insights into the social, political and material construction, destruction and transformation of biotic assemblages in forests, fields, pastures and gardens in this forest/farm matrix. The research findings also illuminate the distinct effects of the resulting restructured ecologies on the diverse interest groups and plant communities within the regional agroforest.

AB Lighting control integrated with daylighting is recognised as an important and useful strategy in energy-efficient building designs and operations. It is believed that proper daylighting schemes can help reduce the electrical demand and contribute to achieving environmentally sustainable building development. This paper presents field measurements on daylighting for a fully air-conditioned office building in Hong Kong. Electricity consumption by the fluorescent luminaires, indoor illuminance levels and the room parameters affecting daylighting designs were recorded and analysed. The measurements covered several cellular offices facing opposite orientations with and without daylighting controls. The findings suggest that daylighting schemes can result in substantial energy savings in air-conditioned office buildings in Hong Kong. Results are presented and the design implications are discussed. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB While the international community has yet to achieve a consensus on the operational details of implementing the Kyoto Protocol, the rapidly increasing consumption of fossil fuels and the CO, emissions produced in the industrializing developing countries further obscure the prospects for combating global warming. This study analyzes the problems of energy utilization in Taiwan as an illustrative example, and explores the strategies for increasing the market penetration of wind power in the traditional energy structure dominated by fossil fuels and nuclear energy. Decentrally produced wind power would contribute to establishing an autonomous and disaster-resilient power supply system. Replacing partial coal-based power generation with the full exploitation of wind energy would result in annual reductions of 9.8 million tons of CO, in Taiwan. The key barrier to utilizing wind energy lies mainly in the lack of political impetus and a framework for promoting renewable energy in Taiwan. Priority tasks to allow wind power to penetrate the energy market include establishing legislative prioritization for renewable energy, setting premium prices for power from wind turbines, providing direct support of investment costs, raising awareness, etc. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB When talking about renewable energy sources today, the most important and economical energy sources for Turkey are hydropower and biomass. The present study gives a review of production, consumption, and economics of hydropower and biomass as renewable energy sources in Turkey. Turkey has a total gross hydropower potential of 433 GW, but only 125 GW of the total hydroelectric potential of Turkey can be economically used. By the commissioning of new hydropower plants, which are under construction, 36% of the economically usable potential of the country would be tapped. On the other hand, biomass (wood and wastes) energy is the second most important renewable energy source for Turkey. However, the biomass energy sources of Turkey are limited. In 1998, the biomass share of the total energy consumption of the country is 10%. In this study, the potential of important biomass energy sources and animal solid wastes of the country were determined. The effects of hydropower and biomass usage on the environment were also discussed. Considering total cereal products and fatty seed plants, approximately 50-60 million tons per year of biomass and 8-10 million tons of solid matter animal waste are produced, and 70% of total biomass is seen as being usable for energy. Some useful suggestions and recommendations are also presented. The present study shows that there is an important potential for hydropower and biomass energy sources in Turkey.

AB The increasing economic importance of biological resources and, in particular, knowledge related to these resources, has made the allocation of property rights one of the most contentious issues in the debate concerning biodiversity management at the international level. The author surveys the different property-rights regimes developed to regulate access to and control over biological resources, and the relevant international instruments and institutions. He argues that the overemphasis on private property rights regimes, in particular monopoly intellectual property rights such as patents, has been inimical to the sustainable management of biological resources at local and international levels. He suggests ways to allocate property rights so as to promote forms of biodiversity management that are both socially equitable and environmentally sustainable, and analyses some of the recent developments concerning alternative forms of intellectual-property protection.

AB This paper describes the difficulties that the South African Homeless People's Federation has had to face, as the government housing subsidies to which its members are entitled have not been forthcoming. The Federation's members are entitled to a housing subsidy of around US$ 1,500 - and there are housing developments all over South Africa built by Federation savings and loan groups that have demonstrated their capacity to build good quality homes with this. Because of the time taken to obtain housing subsidies, a special fund (the uTshani Fund) was set up to provide bridging loans so that members could start building their own homes. The Fund was to be sustained, as members obtained housing subsidies and repaid the loan thus making more funds available for other bridging loans. But most members who took out loans never received the subsidy and many now face difficulties in repaying these loans. This paper describes how the problem arose and how the Federation and its support NGO, People's Dialogue on Land and Shelter, are seeking to address it. In doing so, it discusses the difficulties that movements of the urban poor face in reconciling the immediate needs of members (including access to housing) with strategies to obtain the long-term political changes that would allow such needs to be met sustainably.

DE environmental indices; multicriterion evaluation; decision-making;

AB Irrigation management calls for objective criteria capable of representing the economy, reliability, and productivity of irrigation systems, These criteria must be compatible with long-term sustainability and conservation goals. The criteria representing the above goals are the economic effect of management on yield reduction, economic effect, and reliability referring to plant growth and operation of the network. In this study environmental indices are introduced to express the above criteria in quantitative terms. The inclusion of these indices at the farm and network level create a multicriteria framework for decision-making based on composite programming. An experimental study was conducted during the irrigation periods of 1989 and 1990 in Chania, Greece, concerning water delivered to 40 experimental plots, soil moisture content at the rootzone, and irrigation system operational failures. The data collected in real time were used for the calculation of the corresponding environmental indices. The variation in time and space is high and resulted in up to 62% of yield loss and low system performance (up to 7% of system temporal reliability). The study indicated that environmental indices could be incorporated to select alternatives and also to develop policies on water delivery. The final decision involves a trade-off analysis between cost of application and desired system performance. Measures of both primary, objectives can be obtained using environmental indices that re present system operation aggregation at its basic levels (on farm and network).

TI A comparison of conservation perspectives between scientists, managers,

SO FISHERIES
LA English
DT Article
AB There are several assumptions regarding the behavior and motivations of participants in fishery management that may hinder the effectiveness of the management process. In this research, we examine whether the commercial fishing industry is a homogeneous group whose decision-making is dominated by short-term economic considerations to the detriment of long-term resource conservation. Mail surveys were sent to scientists, managers, and industry members in the West Coast groundfish fishery to examine attitudes on conservation, resource abundance, and biological risk. Results demonstrate that although scientists and industry considered themselves conservation-minded, scientists were relatively critical of industry's conservation ethic. Scientists and industry differed strongly in their perception of resource abundance, but found common ground in their assessments of acceptable levels of biological and economic risks. In general, industry demonstrated considerable diversity in their responses, contradicting assumptions that industry is a monolithic group with little regard for resource conservation. Results indicate a disjuncture between industry's stated concerns and their observed participation in discarding, over-harvesting, or habitat destruction. However, this disjuncture may be the result of misaligned institutional incentives, rather than myopic values and beliefs. This evidence suggests a need to redesign institutions and property rights in order to align the interests of industry, scientists, and managers in conducting effective science and sustainably managing the West Coast groundfish fishery.

AB This study aims to test whether exploitation affects tunas and tuna-like species displaying contrasting life history traits similarly. We first collected information on life history of 10 commercial Atlantic species and then compared this information using multivariate analysis. On one hand, tropical tunas are characterised by small to medium size, rapid growth, early age-at-maturity, long spawning duration and short life span. These species, therefore, display a rapid turnover, characteristic of r-selected species. On the other hand, temperate tunas display differing life history traits, i.e., large size, slow growth, late age-at-maturity, short spawning duration and long life span. The turnover of these species is slow and present characteristics similar to 'K-selected' species (with a conservative strategy adapted to a colder and more variable environment). We, then, selected the two tuna species displaying the most contrasting life histories, i.e., skipjack (SKJ) and bluefin tuna (BFT), and investigated their respective responses to various levels of exploitation, using simulation modelling. If fishing activity starts at age I (a situation which is close to the actual exploitation pattern), differences in life history traits make the BFT population much more fragile to exploitation and less productive than SKJ. However, if the fisheries only target adults, both SKJ and BFT populations are able to sustain high F. Spawning stocks and yields of BFT also display conspicuous long-term fluctuations, resulting from the combination of year-to-year variations in the recruitment and a long life span. This variability makes it difficult to detect overfishing or depletion risks in the BFT population. Because of its short life span, SKI does not display such long-term variations in its SSB. Our simulations also showed that current management measures based on a minimum size limit are much more critical for BFT than SKJ. This difference stresses the importance of taking account of differences in life history traits into management measures. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

DE Bangladesh; growth decomposition sustainable growth; rice production
AB This paper identifies the sources of growth in rice production in Bangladesh over the 1973-99 period. The main contributor was found to be the conversion of rice growing areas from local to modem varieties. The most important conclusion, based on simulations, is that the current level of per capita production can be sustained only through increased yields of modem rice varieties. Population control is found to have significant long-run benefits, while faster conversion of remaining area to modem varieties has important short-run payoffs. The latter two actions, however, can only complement but not substitute efforts to increase the yields of modem varieties. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID MATRIX GROWTH-MODEL; ECONOMIC RETURNS; TREE DIVERSITY; MANAGEMENT
AB Transformation requires, in part, the setting of goals for the stand structure that should be ultimately achieved. This structure can be described by the number of trees per unit area of different sizes, and their species, before and after the harvest. The structure should be sustainable under the prescribed intensity of harvest and cutting cycle. In addition, the harvest and residual growing stock should be such as to meet management goals in the best possible way. These goals usually involve economic and ecological dimensions that can be quantified with financial criteria such as net present value, and with ecological criteria such as diversity indices. The core of quantification is a growth model suitable for the specific forest type under consideration. The growth model allows the determination of feasible, sustainable regimes, which are rarely unique. The choice of a specific regime can be guided by optimization methods, for example, to maximize economic returns, subject to ecological constraints. Once the desired state is decided upon, the conversion to this state can be achieved by harvesting only the trees in excess of the desired distribution. Alternatively, the conversion can also. be optimized, for example, by calculating the regime that brings the stand as close as possible to the desired state, within a specific amount of time.

AB Transformation into seminatural managed forests and sustained use of wood is a major goal to maintain nature-oriented forest ecosystems in the tropics and subtropics. In the present study a transition matrix was used to model the development of an uneven-aged subtropical humid forest of Rio Grande do Sul (Brazil) which was remeasured three times. The approach consists of an estimation of the probability matrix of diameter classes and the incorporation of recruitment and mortality from this forest. Different harvest strategies are elaborated within a sustainable management approach with the objective of sawtimber production (,goal-diameters of 60 and 80 cm. of the valuable species, respectively). The application of a 15-year cutting cycle with a basal area removal of 7 m(2) (or similar to 14 m(2) in a 30-year cutting cycle) could be proven to be a sustainable intervention strategy.

DT Article
AB Bangladesh experienced the worst floods of the twentieth century in 1998. The deluge quite starkly brought to the fore the incapacity and unpreparedness of the government to deal with flood and post-flood management issues. Ad hocism, partisanship and more importantly dependence upon donors marked its policies. These had the affect of disempowering and further distressing the affected population. In order to create a sustainable and effective flood management mechanism it is absolutely imperative to come out of the groove of governmentality - both on the part of the government and the governed - and to empower the civil society through degovernmentalizing the structures of governance.

SO GEOGRAPHY

DT Article
AB Launched in 1983, the Common Fisheries Polio, (CFP) has failed in its most important task of stemming the decline in key commercial fish stocks in EU waters. Several factors have contributed to this failure, including the nature of fisheries advice, the behaviour of fishermen and weaknesses in the EU's system of governance. As a result the CFP has become an unstable, reactive and short-term system of crisis management, culminating in emergency recovery plans for certain key species. With the CFP review in 2002 providing an opportunity for fundamental changes, the article outlines three possible lines of development: an ecosystem approach based on the premise that the only, guarantee for the sustainability of fish stocks lies in maintaining a robust marine ecosystem; decentralisation of policy, making through the creation of regional advisory committees; and stakeholder participation whereby fishing and marine conservation interests are incorporated in the policy process.

AB Although the need for a pro-poor health reform agenda in low and middle income countries is increasingly clear, implementing such policy change is always difficult. This paper seeks to contribute to thinking about how to take forward such an agenda by reflection on the community financing activities of the UNICEF/WHO Bamako Initiative. It presents findings from a three-country study, undertaken in Benin, Kenya and Zambia in 1994/95, which was initiated in order to better understand the nature of the equity impact of community financing activities as well as the factors underlying this impact. The sustained relative affordability gains achieved in Benin emphasise the importance of ensuring that financing change is used as a policy lever for strengthening health service management in support of quality of care improvements. All countries, however, failed in protecting the most poor from the burden of payment, benefiting this group preferentially and ensuring that their views were heard in decision-making. Tackling these problems requires, amongst other things, an appropriate balance between central and local-level decision-making as well as the creation of local decision-making structures which have representation from civil society groups that can voice the needs of the most poor. Leadership, strategy and tactics are also always important in securing any kind of equity gain-such as establishing equity goals to drive implementation. In the experiences examined, the dominance of the goal of financial sustainability contributed to their equity failures. Further research is required to understand what equity goals communities themselves would prefer to guide financing policy. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The Forest Health Monitoring (FHM) and Forest Inventory and Analyses (FIA) programs are integrated biological monitoring systems that use nationally standardized methods to evaluate and report on the health and sustainability of forest ecosystems in the United States. Many of the anticipated changes in forest ecosystems from climate change were also issues addressed in sections of FHM's National Technical Report 1991 to 1998. The integrated FHM and FIA monitoring systems are currently establishing baseline conditions (status and change) in most States for many of the expected effects, and are projected to have full implementation for all States and Territories in 2003. These monitoring systems utilize a broad suite of indicators of key ecosystem components and processes that are responsive to many biotic and abiotic stressors, including those anticipated from climate change. These programs will contribute essential information for many decades for many of the anticipated changes in forest ecosystem from increasing carbon dioxide concentrations, changing climatic scenarios, and extreme weather events that are probable in the next 30 to 100 years.

AB Changes in development and use of water resources over the last 30 years have led to significant environmental and hydrological degradation of the River Heihe basin in the People's Republic of China. Water discharge of the lower reaches has been seriously compromised and more than 30 tributaries and terminal lakes have dried up. The water output of springs has dropped significantly. Also water quality problems have been observed, in both surface waters and groundwater. Hydrological changes have resulted in a marked degradation of aquatic habitats, and have caused substantial, and expanding, land salinization and desertification. Solving these problems, which have been largely caused by human activities, requires massive and long-lasting concerted efforts.

AB The soil and climatic conditions characteristic of tropical arid and semiarid lands make there very fragile ecosystems sensitive to degradation processes which lead to desertification. They are largely affected by human settlements and global climatic changes. They are affected, above till, by traditional agricultural practices that apply techniques developed for other areas of the world, with different requirements and conditions. It is necessary to incorporate ecological studies of natural ecosystems, experimental ecology and ecological principles into developmental planning, in order to attain et sustainable development. The results of ecophysiological studies performed in northwestern Venezuela, reveal that plant productivity and phenology depends on ephemeral rains rather them seasons and that there is high compatibility of trees and alternative crops, especially with succulents, whose productivity is enhanced by the association with native trees. These findings are reviewed and agroforestry systems are proposed which include alternative succulent crops (Aloe sera and Agave cocui among others), anti the preservation of native trees as one of the possible solutions for agricultural production and the amelioration of degradation processes in tropical arid lands.

TI Conservation of the lastfrontier forests of the Venezuelan Guayana:
   Guidelines proposal for the Caura River watershed
SO INTERCIENCIA
LA Spanish
DT Article
AB Venezuela includes an important proportion of the world's threatened ecosystems and an extensive surface of natural areas in primary, conditions. Many of these areas correspond to forest ecosystems considered as the last frontier forests of the tropical region. Social and environmental conflicts occur in these areas, as result of their value for natural resources use, their potential for extractive activities and the proposal of large scale environmental projects. The Caura watershed, in the Venezuelan Guayana Region, is one of the most important frontier forests in the world, due to its extension (45336km(2)), high level of biodiversity, and the presence of a significant proportion of the Venezuelan indigenous population. The highest proportion of its territory is included in geographic units corresponding to the Areas Under Special Administrative Regime (ABRAE). Among them, the Caura Forest Reserve (with wood production objectives) and the Natural Monument Sierra of Maigualida (with restrictive protection objectives) embrace the largest surface. These units show a high level of overlapping, in addition to opposite objectives. Furthermore, management plans and other conservation tools are lacking in the ABRAE from the Caura region and many of their boundaries correspond to traditional indigenous territories. Land use is mainly associate with shifting cultivation, extensive cattle raising, small forestry plantations, the development of towns, and the presence of indigenous communities. In addition, several large scale projects have been proposed for this area. Among the opportunities for the conservation of the region are: its territory extension, the pristine condition of its ecosystems, the availability of basic information, the social acceptance and the presence of institutional webs. Any strategy focused to the long-term conservation of this region must be conducted taking into account: 1) the protection and management of natural resources; 2) the inventories and evaluations of biodiversity, and the sustainable use of its components; 3) the restoration of habitats and ecosystems; 4) the promotion of leaderships and politic incentives with the interaction and participation of different stakeholders; 5) the education and training of local people: and 6) the identification of the balance between conservation and development, based on the ecological realities of the region.

AB For preventive strategies to be efficient, it is essential to have information on the pattern of disease and exposure to major risk factors that predict future diseases in the population. Basic epidemiological data such as mortality rates are reported for less than one-third of the world's population and are almost exclusively from developed countries. However, it is the developing countries, particularly those in rapid economic and demographic transition, which will experience a major rise in ageing-related diseases.
   The World Health Organization is intensifying the development and implementation of simple, sustainable surveillance systems that can be used in many different settings around the world. Unlike heart disease and cancer, stroke is a clinically defined disease, which makes it possible to identify trends in different countries irrespective of access to technological equipment. A stepwise approach to increasing detail in the data to be collected for surveillance of stroke is suggested. This will allow countries with different levels of resources and capacity in their health systems to collect useful information for policy.

AB We define "sustainable development" simply by the preservation of the productive capacity of the economy which can be expressed by the setting-up of a free capital shock-wave. Using the soliton theory the stability characteristics of such a wave can be derived. With reference to this non-linear mathematics the presently electic concept of sustainability could be reduced to its core, namely, the maintenance of inter-generational equity via a stable capital wave.

AB A new family of antioxidants has been obtained from a residual fraction of polymeric polyphenols of grape origin. The integral exploitation of resources is important in any sustainable production scheme. Many byproducts and residues generated by the agroindustries. contain polyphenols with potential application as preventative agents against cancer and cardiovascular diseases. Among these polyphenols. oligomeric proanthocyanidins. are particularly significant. The polymeric forms, considered of less interest because of their astringent properties, constitute the largest portion of the biologically active plant proanthocyanidins. The new compounds described here result from the breakdown of polymeric flavanols in the presence of cysteamine and bear an amino function, which facilitates their isolation from complex mixtures by cation-exchange gels or resins. In this way, valuable antioxidant molecules can be efficiently obtained from otherwise wasted polymers. The new molecules appear to be as effective as their underivatized counterparts (flavan-3-ols) as antioxidants.

TI Potential and limitations of green manure technology in lowland rice

AB The growing popular concern about the sustainability of agricultural systems and an increasing awareness about environmentally-friendly agricultural production and healthy nutrition stands in striking contrast to a worldwide decline in the use of green manures. It is timely to assess the future role that soil-improving legumes may play in agricultural systems. This paper reviews potential and limitations of green manure technology, using lowland rice cropping systems as the example. A review of more than 250 published references indicates that the average amounts of N accumulated by green manures can entirely substitute for mineral fertilizer N at current average application rates. With similar N use efficiencies, green manure N is less prone to loss mechanisms than mineral N fertilizers and may therefore contribute to long-term residual effects on soil productivity. The considerable genetic variability in the available legume germplasm allows the selection of appropriate legumes to most conditions with positive effects on soil physical and chemical parameters. However, the use of green manure legumes for lowland rice production has declined dramatically world-wide over the last 30 years. Socio-economic factors like the cost of land, labor, and mineral N fertilizer are seen to determine the cost-effectiveness and thereby farmers' adoption of green manure technology. Hydrology and soil texture determine the agronomic competitiveness of a green manure with N fertilizers and with alternative cash crops. With a rapidly-growing demand for rice and growing land and labor scarcity, green manure use is not seen to become a relevant feature of favorable irrigated rice-growing environments in the foreseeable future. On the other hand, in environments where soil properties and hydrology are marginal for food crop production (flood-prone rainfed lowlands with coarse-textured soils), but which farmers may be compelled to cultivate in order to meet their subsistence food requirements, green manures may have a realistic and applicable potential.

TI Coffee-Ensete-livestock interaction for sustainable livelihood in the
   Sidama area of southern Ethiopia
SO JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURE IN THE TROPICS AND SUBTROPICS
LA English
DT Article
AB The coffee growing areas of Sidama, the midlands, are one of the densely populated areas in Ethiopia, with a population density of 500 persons per arable land. Coffee serves as the major cash source to the farm household, which expends the cash to its different uses one of which is asset formation through the purchase of livestock. Livestock of different type are reared with small herd size in the area. The population pressure brought land to be the most limiting production constraint. Due to its limitation the available land is mainly allocated to the major staple food of the area, Ensete (Ensete ventricosum). This plant is everything to the farmer: food, feed, construction material etc. The food use of Ensete is very significant, because it supports large population size, however it is deficient in fat, protein and energy. Ensete covers the larger share of the feed use and it is a good feed sources because the feed part is rich in protein. This paper tried to address how the major enterprises of the system coffee, ensete and livestock can be intensified so as to ensure sustainable livelihood in the fanning system.

AB 1. Increasing concern over the sustainable management of forested landscapes and the extent of forest clearance world-wide has led to a growing interest in the impacts of logging and associated habitat disturbance on biodiversity.
   2. We conducted an experimental study of the impact of clearfelling on birds of the karri Eucalyptus diversicolor forest in south-west Western Australia over a 17-year period, and a retrospective study of both clearfelled and naturally regenerated karri stands aged from 0 to 146 years.
   3. One-third of species still had significantly reduced abundance 14 years after disturbance ceased, although all affected species made limited use of regenerating forest.
   4. Multivariate analysis of changes in bird community structure showed that the effects of disturbance were still evident 14 years after clearfelling. Clearfelling may also have produced some temporary changes in community structure in adjacent unlogged forest.
   5. Species richness and total abundance of birds declined by 58% and 96%, respectively, in the first year after clearfelling, and 14 years after logging were still 17% and 55% below levels in adjacent undisturbed forest. During this early successional phase both measures increased as a simple function of stand age. Species richness of regrowth reach-od that of old-growth at 30-50, years and total abundance of all bird species in regrowth was similar to that of old-growth after approximately 70 years.
   6. Several bird species offer potential as indicators of the ecological sustainability of karri forest management. These species nest in large hollows in standing live trees (two cockatoo species) or have been slow to recolonize immature regrowth karri forests (six species).
   7. Post-hoc power analysis showed that even the long-term and intensive sampling employed in this study failed to detect declines in abundance of less than 80-90% for most bird species. For many uncommon species, trying to estimate changes in abundance is problematic and likely to require replication which is difficult to achieve in field situations where logged and unlogged forests are compared. Despite this, the present study identified some key impacts of forest clearfelling on bird communities, with implications both for the consequences of clearfelling of forests and the criteria for sustainable forest management.

AB Background. There is renewed interest in the use of immunotherapy as an adjunct to antiretrovirals (ART) in the treatment of HIV disease. Most work has been performed on interleukin-2 (IL-2). There is considerable evidence from numerous phase II studies that intermittent dosing of subcutaneous IL-2 plus antiretroviral therapy (ART) produces a sustainable rise in the CD4(+) T-lymphocyte count which exceeds that which can be achieved using ART alone, without any adverse effect on plasma HIV RNA. However, the immunological competency and therefore clinical impact of this expanded CD4(+) T cell pool is yet to be established; this question is the focus of two large clinical end-point studies, ESPRIT and SILCAAT. Objective: Prior to the establishment of ESPRIT, four 'Vanguard' studies were undertaken; the UK Vanguard examined the safety and virological/immunological aspects of intermittent subcutaneous IL-2 without the use of ART in HIV-1 ART naive patients with a baseline CD4(+) T cell count of greater than or equal to 350cells/mm(3). Design: The UK Vanguard was an open-label, randomised study comparing subcutaneous (s/c) IL-2 at either 4.5MIU or 7.5MIU q12h for 5 days every 8 weeks versus no therapy in HIV-1-infected individuals. Primary endpoints included mean area under the curve change from baseline CD4(+) T cell count and plasma log HIV-RNA. Results: Thirty six subjects were enrolled into the three arms of the UK Vanguard study. Results showed significant differences in the area under the curve (AUC) change from baseline CD4(+) T cell count (P = 0.001) and changes in mean absolute CD4(+) T cell count (P = 0.04) and no significant difference in mean AUC change from baseline plasma HIV-RNA (P = 0.48) at 24 weeks between the IL-2 and control arms respectively. The significance of these results and those from other studies on the use of IL-2 in HIV disease are discussed. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The Ceasefire Oregon gun turn in program was initiated to educate the community regarding violence through a gun turn-in program with voluntary surrender of firearms, educational efforts about violence, and institution of public safety policies. The community board of directors was composed of multiple community leadership organizations. A multi-intervention education, outreach and media program consisting of distribution of brochures, presentations, school education programs, and workshops was implemented throughout the year in addition to the gun turn-in program held in May for two days. A survey was administered to participants in the program at the turn-in sites. The cumulative total for guns turned in years 1994 to 1999 was 4,345. Half of the respondents reported possession of a gun at home. The most common reasons for participating in the gun turn in were obtaining gift certficates and not wanting the gun any more.. A successful community grassroots program, Ceasefire Oregon has shown sustainability over six years with increased participation secondary to education, advertising and incentives. Community and statewide efforts can assist with building the infrastructure for programs, however more tools for quantitative performance program evaluation would facilitate measuring the impact on the community.

DE Amik lake; sustainability; Ramsar agreement; watery land; wildlife
AB Turkey has been on a crucial routes of the migrating birds. These birds have been coining from Istanbul- Camlica hills and through Artvin-Borcka to the homeland. And the migrating birds turn to the Africa continent over Syria by passing Hatay-Belen. During the migration, the birds use the location of Amik Lake as a watery land for temporary settlement. The Amik Lake which should have been protected as a watery land for birds according to Ramsar Agreement that Turkey signed, was caused to dry ten years ago. There weren't only negative effects on the wildlife by drying but also soil degraded and productivity decreased though the aim was to improve agriculture and contributions to local developments on the Amik Lake dry land. During the last two decades, it was known that one of the birds, which is called Anhinga rufa extincted as a cause of drying ol Amik Lake. In this study, some results that emerged as a cause of drying of Amik Lake were presented.

ID ANALYTIC HIERARCHY PROCESS
AB Sustainability has become an increasingly significant issue, although practical implementation remains difficult. In Italy, promoting sustainability is particularly problematic at the provincial and municipal level, where the lack of resources and expertise, and the effects of uncoordinated policies make it difficult to achieve minimum requirements to make sustainable policies operational. One essential requirement is knowledge of baseline environmental conditions in each municipality. In the province of Reggio Emilia (Northern Italy) Legambiente, an environmental association, launched an initiative called 'Ecopaese' aimed at gathering data on environmental conditions and stimulating local administrations to implement sustainable policies. To this end, the state of the environment in the 45 municipalities within the province has been monitored using 25 indicators. Their values have been used to rank the municipalities by multiple criteria analysis (MCA). The results of this comparative approach provide information about the level of sustainability attained in the province as a whole as well as in the single municipalities. It is hoped that it will provide the basis for direct action plans at the provincial level by identifying areas for remedial action, as recommended by Agenda 21, the declaration adopted by many countries attending the Rio Summit in 1992.

ID COAL WASHERY PROJECTS
AB Opencast mining dominates coal production in India. A survey was conducted to evaluate its local atmospheric impact. Emissions data were utilised to compute dust generation due to different mining activities. Work zone air quality, ambient air quality and seasonal variations are described revealing high pollution potential due to suspended particulate matter (SPM) and consequent impact on human health. Air pollution control measures involve planning and implementing a series of preventive and suppressive measures in addition to dust extraction systems. Different abatement measures are enumerated. Pollution control by trees, the tolerance of trees to different air pollutants and plant species useful for controlling pollution are also discussed. There is a need for wider application of dust control chemicals on haul roads. Sustainable management of pollution can be achieved by the proper implementation of suggested abatement measures.

AB The 29th Olympic Game will be held in Beijing in 2008. It will be a green game to promote sustainable development of men, cities and regions through ecological development advocating "man and nature he in one'. "Eco" here means a process, a driving force, an action, a culture and a kind of vitality Leading to sustainable development. It is a mechanism embodying the Olympic spirit of competition, cooperation and self-reliance. The paper explained the ecological significance, connotation and objectives of Beijing Green Olympic Game. Ten major ecological heritages of Beijing hate been investigated including ecologically sound landscape, culture, transportation, physical exercise, health care, sanitation, food, family relationship, agriculture, and human ecological totality. To preserve or restore the above mentioned old tradition, a green Olympic action plan has been made out in Beijing initiated by NGOs, supported by entrepreneurs and coordinated by government agencies. Four kinds of eco-engineering have been planned far blue sky, clean water, green land and eco-city development. The demonstration role of Beijing Green Olympic Game to developing regions and countnes is also discussed.

AB The in vitro biological activity of 19 medicinal plants from Nepal was re-assessed after 6 years of storage. Methanol extracts from the plants were assayed for activity against six strains of bacteria and three strains of fungi. The extracts were tested with and without exposure to UV light in order to identify photoactivity. Out of the 19 plants tested, three lost all activity, six retained all activity, and ten had partial activity. The results will be of interest to traditional healers in Nepal, and may impact the sustainable harvesting of these medicinal plants. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB As deforestation and habitat degradation proceed worldwide, the elaboration of realistic policies to protect and sustain forests assumes increasing urgency. Experience from one area of threatened tropical dry forest illustrates, however, that staunch environmental regulation based on partial understandings can have strikingly contradictory effects. In this study from the Dominican Republic, extensive dialogue and field observation with local residents offered a glimpse beyond the obvious proximal causes of forest loss-the subsistence farmers and charcoal makers regularly seen felling trees-to important influences of their socioeconomic and legal contexts.

AB Objectives To evaluate the long-term effects of regular moderate or vigorous intensity exercise on blood pressure and blood lipids in previously sedentary older women.
   Design Subjects were randomly assigned to either a supervised centre-based (CB) or a minimally supervised home-based (HB) exercise program, initially for 6 months. Within each program, subjects were further randomized to exercise either at moderate (40-55% heart rate reserve, HRres) or vigorous intensity (65-80% HRres). After 6 months, all groups continued a HB moderate or vigorous exercise program for another 12 months.
   Methods Healthy, sedentary women (aged 40-65 years) (n = 126) were recruited from the community. Subjects exercised three times per week for 30 min. They were evaluated at baseline, 6,12 and 18 months.
   Results There was a significant fall of 2.81 mmHg in systolic blood pressure (P = 0.049) and 2.70 mmHg in diastolic blood pressure (P = 0.004) after correction for age and baseline values with moderate exercise, but not with vigorous-intensity exercise. When this analysis was repeated with the change in body mass included, the results were unchanged. After correction for potential confounding factors, there was a significant fall in total cholesterol and low density lipoprotein cholesterol with vigorous but not moderate exercise at 6 months (P < 0.05) but not at 18 months.
   Conclusions In this largely normotensive population of older women, a moderate, but not vigorous exercise program, achieved sustained falls in resting systolic and diastolic blood pressure over 18 months. The study demonstrates that in older women, moderate intensity exercise is well accepted, sustainable long-term and has the health benefit of reduced blood pressure.

AB We use the returns on a set of international financial securities to identify exogenous shocks to the Canadian federal surplus. We find that a large portion of the variation in the surplus can be replicated by a linear combination of these returns and that the recent rise in debt resulted from adverse shocks and a delayed response by the government. We develop a framework to evaluate the gains from a risk management strategy, using these securities to hedge against shocks. We find that hedging generates significant welfare gains by enhancing the sustainability of fiscal policy and diversifying the risk associated with tax changes.

   environment (Previously titled "Natural resource conservation and waste
   management")
SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN DIETETIC ASSOCIATION
LA English
DT Article
ID SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE; FOOD; POPULATION
AB It is the position of the American Dietetic Association to encourage environmentally responsible practices that conserve natural resources, minimize the quantity of waste that is generated, and leave the least adverse affect on the health of all living organisms and the environment. Ali components of the food system, from farmer to consumer, are affected by the availability and cost of energy and the availability and quality of water. Outdoor and indoor air quality significantly impacts the health of all living organisms. Decisions that dietetics professionals make as practitioners and consumers can affect the quantity and type of solid waste generated. The demand for natural resources should be evaluated when selecting the most cost-effective, environmentally sensitive approach to the management of solid waste. Special precautions are needed when using and disposing of hazardous and medical waste to protect the safety of our clients and employees. This position paper provides information and resources for dietetics professionals for addressing the complexity of the environmental issue presented. Conservation strategies are identified that dietetics professionals can use in their worksites and at home. These conservation practices may reduce cost and decrease the environmental impact. we have on our communities and the world.

TI Structures for organization of transactions in Bulgarian agriculture
SO JOURNAL OF THE FACULTY OF AGRICULTURE KYUSHU UNIVERSITY
LA English
DT Article
AB In this paper we extend our previous efforts to incorporate achievements of the New Institutional and Transaction Cost Economics to the agrarian sphere. First, we demonstrate that Bulgarian agrarian economy is a Transaction cost economy, and clarify various types of transacting costs in transitional conditions. Next, we describe existing structures for governing of agrarian transactions, and evaluate their costs minimizing and incentive potential. Lastly, we estimate prospects for organizational modernization, and determine effective boundaries of market, private, public, and mixed modes for agrarian transacting.
   Neoclassical scenario for transformation of previous communist model ("free market plus private ownership") has not worked in Bulgarian agriculture. Transition has changed "rules of the game" but it has not made agrarian agents "more rational" and "less opportunistic". Consequently costs for new property rights and institutional development, and for market and private modes of individual transacting, have taken a good part of all social expenditures. High assets dependency, big uncertainty, low appropriability, and less frequency have determined a specific transitional structure of agrarian transacting. Less market transacting, big reliance on informal relationships at large scale, great extent of "over" integrated modes, part time farming and production cooperation phenomenon, block of all classes of transactions etc, all have come to existence. Besides, a large number of inefficient or contradictory third party (e.g. Government, Non-governmental organizations, international assistance etc) involvements in agrarian transacting have been in place. All this has deformed substantially emerging fanning system, and domination of primitive and "gray" structures, little sustainability of large business and cooperative farms, significant distortion of national agrarian capital, and backward technological "development", have come to agenda.
   Low efficiency of public in-house organization and limited budget sources would restrict Government direct intervention in agrarian transactions. Agrarian policy should be toward exploring potential of market, private, and cooperative modes through new property rights provision, institutional and infrastructural support, improving law and contract enforcement, market information, extension education, assisting farmers association etc. Less expensive modes for trilateral governance (coordination, control on opportunism, incentives for specific investments) with active involvement of private sector and farmers organizations are to be preferred.

AB Background. This study sought to identify potential cost-effective methods to improve trauma care in hospitals in the developing world.
   Methods. Injured patients admitted to an urban hospital in Ghana over a 1-year period were analyzed prospectively for mechanism of injury, mode of transport to the hospital, injury severity, region of principal injury, operations performed, and mortality. In addition, time from injury until arrival at the hospital and time from arrival at the hospital until emergency surgery were evaluated.
   Results: Mortality was 9.4%. Most deaths (65%) occurred within 24 hours of admission. Sixty percent of emergency operations were performed over 6 hours after arrival. Tube thoracostomy was performed on only 13 patients (0.6%). Only 58% of patients received intravenous crystalloid and only 3.6% received 1 or more units of blood.
   Conclusion. We identified several specific interventions as potential low-cost measures to improve hospital-based trauma care in this setting, including shorter times to emergency surgery and improvements in initial resuscitation. In addition to addressing each of these aspects of trauma care individually, quality improvement programs may represent a feasible and sustainable method to improve trauma care in hospitals in the developing world.

ID EXPERIENCE; EVOLUTION; TENURE
AB Land administration systems, and particularly their core cadastral components, are an important infrastructure which facilitates the implementation of land use policies. While most land administration systems traditionally have a primary objective of supporting the operation of land markets, they are increasingly evolving into a broader land information infrastructure which supports economic development, environmental management and social stability in both developed and developing countries. While a great deal of attention is given to land use policies worldwide concerned with such areas as forest management, coastal zone management, environmental sustainability and managing the urban environment, less attention is given to the infrastructures which facilitate the implementation of the associated policies and programmes. Importantly, all these activities rely on some form of land administration infrastructure which permits the complex range of rights, restrictions and responsibilities in land to be identified, mapped and managed as a basis for policy formulation and implementation. As a result, there is an increasing interest in the concept of land administration infrastructures and their core cadastres, in the principles and policies concerned with establishing such infrastructures and in "best practices". In addressing this need, this paper attempts to explain the evolving concept of land administration infrastructures, the concept of "best practice" and the concept of a land administration "tool box" of principles, policies, laws and technologies which are useful in reforming or re-engineering land administration systems in support of a broader land policy agenda.

AB An increasing number of senior managers recognize the importance of formulating a strategy on corporate social responsibility. However they often find it difficult to translate the strategy into action. This article presents a framework that describes the drivers of corporate social performance, the actions that managers can take to affect that performance, and the consequences of those actions on both corporate social and financial performance. By carefully identifying and articulating the drivers of social performance and measuring and managing the broad effects of both good and bad performance on the corporation's various stakeholders, managers can make a significant contribution both to their company and to society. This more careful understanding of both the drivers of social performance and the impacts of that performance on the various corporate stakeholders permits better integration of that information into the day-to-day operational decisions and the institutionalization of social concerns throughout the organization. The framework includes the details of the systems, structures, and measures that are necessary to change organizational culture and processes to improve both social and financial performance.

ID RESOURCES
AB There is a now a burgeoning literature that attempts to explain how sustainable development applies in the mining context. Little research, however, has been commissioned to examine exactly how mining companies are interpreting the concept. To help bridge this major gap in the literature, a study was conducted in which the environmental and socioeconomic initiatives undertaken by the world's 20 largest gold mining companies - the operations of which produce some 51.8% of the world's gold - were examined and analysed. The primary information and data used in the study were obtained from company websites, annual reports, specific corporate environmental and socioeconomic literature, and a follow-up questionnaire sent to the attention of each company's chief presiding environmental officer. Results show that the industry, generally, has taken a proactive stance toward environmental issues and to a lesser extent, socioeconomic and community matters. The study more importantly confirmed that the gold mining segment of the industry has embraced the concept of sustainable development to varying degrees, a pattern that interestingly parallels that of the relevant theoretical literature.

DT Article
AB Profetas (Protein Foods, Environment, Technology and Society) is a Dutch trans-disciplinary research programme, aiming to develop more sustainable food systems. The central theme of the programme is the question: is a transition feasible from a diet based primarily on animal proteins to a diet based for a large part on new food products made from plant proteins? In the programme this question is studied from very different disciplinary perspectives. In the programme a consumer and chain oriented approach is adopted. In the experimental part of the programme, pea proteins are studied, Profetas is funded by the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research, with support from the Ministry of Agriculture, Nature management and Fisheries and the food industry. The programme compromises 16 PhD and post-doctoral projects.

AB Regional fishery organizations are increasingly being viewed as "vehicles of good governance" created to secure the sustainable development of international fisheries. These political expectations have not been followed by analytical refinement of how to explain and understand their formation, roles, objectives, institutional setups, or efficiency. This article provides a conceptual discussion of regional fishery organizations and introduces an organizational typology as a basis for their study. Thus, an analytical distinction is made between regional fisheries management organizations, regional coordination and development organizations and scientific research organizations. This typology and the evolution of the Law of the Sea, from an open access to the exclusive economic zone regime, are used to analyze the institutional arrangements of regional fishery organizations.

AB Kibale National Park (KNP), Uganda, has a number of chimpanzees habituated for tourism. The close genetic relationship between humans and chimpanzees means that there is the potential for disease transmission between the two. The aim of this study was to establish the diseases to which chimpanzees may be exposed by surveying the medical histories of humans in contact with the chimpanzees of KNP. Medical questionnaires were given to tourists visiting KNP and to the population of a village close to the park. The 62 tourist surveys returned indicated a high prevalence of disease symptoms, in particular diarrhoea, as well as ongoing infectious diseases and a lack of current vaccinations. The 50 local surveys returned also indicated a high prevalence of disease symptoms, in particular respiratory disease, along with a low rate of vaccination and a high frequency of visual contact with the chimpanzees both within and outside KNP. This study indicates that humans are a potential source of infection for chimpanzees. The results, which have been communicated to the appropriate authorities, will assist in the devising of proper tourist viewing regulations and provide local health authorities with the information necessary to improve both public health and chimpanzee health. Further recommendations include education of tourists regarding appropriate vaccinations, hand washing prior to the visit, the use of facemasks during the visit, and the provision of latrines. Chimpanzee ecotourism is becoming increasingly popular and protecting the chimpanzees' health will help to ensure that ecotourism is a sustainable activity.

AB A review was carried out of the mammalian fauna of the Kilum-Ijim forest in the mountains of northwest Cameroon. The purpose was to examine the loss of species, particularly of larger mammals, and the implications of this for forest ecology. Information was collected by direct observation, hunter interviews and a literature review. The forest is the largest remaining representative fragment of the West African montane forest habitat. Seventy-seven species of mammal have been recorded in the forest over the last 50 years. Most are small, especially rodents, bats and insectivores. Seven species are endemic to the Kilum-Ijim area. The process of species extirpation probably began over 100 years ago with the loss of the mega-fauna, possibly beginning with elephant Loxodonta africana (several generations ago), and certainly with buffalo Syncerus caffer (at least 20 years ago), and other large mammals. Remaining large mammal population densities are very low and many species are close to regional extinction. The long-term consequences of these extinctions is uncertain but, as many tree species are monkey- or ruminant-dispersed, severe ecosystem damage has probably already occurred. Human population density in the area is around 300 people per sq km, and no sustainable offtake of wild animals will ever be possible that would provide more than a few grams of meat per person per year from the forest. The protein requirements of the communities of the area will have to continue to be supplied from domesticated stock. Since 1987 the Kilum-Ijim Forest Project of BirdLife International has been working to conserve the remaining forest, using a community forestry approach in collaboration with traditional and local authorities and the government of Cameroon, The project is investigating ways to improve the production of domestic animals outside the forest boundary.

AB Baculoviruses are double-stranded DNA viruses which are highly selective for several insect groups. They are valuable natural control agents, but their utility in many agricultural applications has been limited by their slow speed of kill and narrow host specificity. Baculoviruses have been genetically modified to express foreign genes under powerful promoters in order to accelerate their speed of kill. In our and other laboratories, the expression of genes coding for insect juvenile hormone esterases and various peptide neurotoxins has resulted in recombinant baculoviruses with promise as biological insecticides. These viruses are efficacious in the laboratory, greenhouse and field and dramatically reduce damage caused by insect feeding. The recombinant viruses synergize and are synergized by classical pesticides such as pyrethroids. Since they are highly selective for pest insects, they can be used without disrupting biological control. Because the recombinant virus produces fewer progeny in infected larvae than the wild-type virus, they are rapidly out-competed in the ecosystem. The viruses can be used effectively with crops expressing endotoxins of Bacillus thuringiensis. They can be produced industrially but also by village industries, indicating that they have the potential to deliver sustainable pest control in developing countries. It remains to be seen, however, whether the current generation of recombinant baculoviruses will be competitive with the new generation of synthetic chemical pesticides. Current research clearly indicates, though, that the use of biological vectors of genes for insect control will find a place in agriculture. Baculoviruses will also prove valuable in testing the potential utility of proteins and peptides for insect control. (C) 2001 Society of Chemical Industry.

   RESPONSES
AB While agricultural research has traditionally focused on average environmental conditions, environmental variability, independent of the mean, can also have biological consequences. Using lettuce (Lactuca sativa) as a model system, we tested two hypotheses: (1) increased temporal variability in water supply impacts plant growth, yield, photosynthesis, water relations and nutrition and (2) arbuscular mycorrhizal AM fungal associations benefit this agricultural crop, especially when plants experience temporal variability in water supply. The experiment used a randomized complete block design with two blocks and three variables (each with two levels): +/- mycorrhizal inoculation, high or low variability in watering intervals, and high or low total watering volume. Temporal variability in water supply, at a time scale similar to what is common in agricultural practices, had negative effects on lettuce production. Inoculation treatments were successful in doubling the extent of AM fungal infection in lettuce roots. There were no main effects of mycorrhizal inoculation on any measured variable, but augmented mycorrhizal associations interacted with variability in water supply to increase root/shoot ratios and decrease tissue concentrations of N and P. Successful application of AM fungi to sustainable agriculture probably requires a general theoretical framework for predicting when effects on plants will be beneficial versus neutral or even detrimental.

AB A team of American and Kyrgyz scholars explores the recent history of environmental legislation in Kyrgyzstan, focusing on legislation and policy relating to biodiversity conservation. They examine a number of important and far-reaching laws enacted to promote tourism, economic development, and sustainable uses of biological resources, and investigate Kyrgyzstan's accession (or planned accession) to important regional and global treaties on conservation. A major objective is an assessment of the extent to which Kyrgyzstan is implementing or is likely to implement these important laws, and whether extant governmental institutions are capable of implementing necessary environmental laws and programs.

ID PRECIPITATION
AB The process industry slowly moves towards a sustainable technology in which raw materials and side products are recovered and reused and the energy consumption is reduced as much as possible. In a further stage this may result in closed systems in which the emission of polluting substances to air and water are reduced to a minimum le vel. In order to face these challenges, new separation technologies are required with a high separation performance at low energy consumption. Membrane technology is a relatively new separation process, which fulfils these criteria. It can be applied in process integrated systems and in this way waste problems are drastically reduced while valuable products are recovered.

ID CHEMICAL RISKS; JUDGMENTS; CHERNOBYL
AB Contaminated soils are a common environmental risk all over the world. One major source of risk is heavy metal soil contamination caused by industrial emissions. Ibis quasiexperimental study investigated the perception of these risks by exposed and nonexposed people, their attitudes toward bioremediation methods using hyperaccumulating plants, and the influence of long-term aspects of sustainability on the acceptance of bioremediation methods. Major findings were that people living in a contaminated area perceived the risk of the heavy metal soil contamination as higher than the general risk of contamination. Second, a factor analysis showed that the factors dread, control, and catastrophic potential were relevant for the perception and valuation of low-dose environmental risks such as the contamination of the investigated area. In addition, a cluster analysis showed that the risk of heavy metal soil contamination was perceived as similar to that of oil contamination, ozone layer, preservatives and genetic technology. It was perceived indifferently with regard to dread. The uncontrollability of heavy metal soil contamination was estimated as medium, and its catastrophic potential as low. Third, exposed and nonexposed participants preferred bioremediation methods to classical methods (e.g., excavation and chemical treatment of the soil), because they perceived the environmental and esthetical performance of the bioremediation as important criteria. Sustainability or precautionary issues, such as the prevention of harm for future generations, were highly correlated with the acceptance of the use of bioremediation methods in people's residential areas.

AB This article presents the results of an investigation into the attitudes of tourist accommodation managers to the principles of sustainable development. The survey of accommodation managers in a major British city, assessed the interest, understanding, and perceived opportunities and barriers to the adoption of sustainable development within a range of tourist accommodation businesses. The main findings show that the widespread adoption of stich practices is constrained by a degree of inertia based on barriers of time, cost and expertise. The results have implications for future strategies attempting to promote sustainable practices within the service industries.

AB This article examines the experience of a conservation with development project in the Brazilian Amazon in promoting sustainable resource management based on community participation. It describes the ecological and socioeconomic context for the project's activities in the Mamiraua Sustainable Development Reserve (MSDR), and the formal structures established for community participation in resource management. The practical experience of project implementation in the MSDR to date is outlined and discussed relative to the nature of customary social organization in the local ribeirinho communities. The discussion identifies several constraints on the functioning of the formal structure for community participation in a society characterized by extensive kinship networks, a high degree of mobility, and dependency on outside interest groups.

AB Increasing concerns have been expressed about whether the alternative character of the organic farming movement is being maintained as it grows in size and popularity. This paper examines this question with respect to organic farming in Ontario, Canada. Using survey and case study data, a number of production, marketing, ideology, and farm size characteristics are assessed as indicators of overall conventionalization as well as the bifurcation of organic farming into two distinct groups. While signs of conventionalization and bifurcation are demonstrated, particularly in the area of field crop farming, the overall analysis suggests that most organic farms retain the central features of an alternative approach, including an emphasis on small, diverse, mixed operations, marketing directly and locally to consumers.

AB We measured the activity and soil microbial biomass in volcanic ash soils from 10 sites under ecological fanning (no pesticides, shallow ploughing, mulching, organic fertilizers, crop rotation) and 15 sites under conventional farming (pesticides, mineral fertilizers, deep ploughing). Our aim was to determine the effects of management system on soil quality and soil fertility in tropical Nicaragua in relation to soil type. None of these sites were irrigated. Conventional management led to significantly increased amounts of total soil P and a significantly larger biomass C-to-P ratio compared to ecological management. Almost all of the other microbial properties, i.e. soil basal respiration, ergosterol and biomass C were significantly improved by ecological management. Also the biomass C-to-soil C ratio was significantly increased, but not the metabolic quotient qCO(2) or the ergosterol-to-biomass C ratios, indicating that the positive effects of ecological management were mainly due to increased C input rates. Biomass C, ergosterol, and basal respiration rate were significantly larger at the loamy sites than at the sandy sites, The same was true for the biomass C-to-soil C ratio, but the ergosterol-to-biomass C ratio and the metabolic quotient qCO(2) were larger at the sandy sites. Our results demonstrate that ecological management is an important tool for soil conservation and sustainable management of arable land in Nicaragua. However, the decline in total P and the low P availability to soil microorganisms need attention as a precaution against P deficiency. The improvement was greatest at the loamy sites, although the effects of management system were in most cases independent of the soil type. For this reason, ecological management should be preferably promoted on loamy soils. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB An assessment of changes in soil properties associated with land-use and management practices is vital for the selection and establishment of appropriate sustainable practices under different agroecosystems. This study compared soil properties between land located on an abandoned kraal site (KS), under fallow (FL) and one that was continuously cropped to maize (CC) for over 12 years. Aggregation and aggregate stability as measured by both dry and wet sieving showed large differences between land-use systems. The soil under CC had a higher proportion (26.4%) of micro aggregates (<0.25 mm) compared with that of FL (10.1%) and KS (6.9%). The dry mean weight diameter (DMWD) was larger in KS (3.03 mm) than in FL (2.17 mm) and CC (1.38 mm.). Soil aggregates in CC were the least stable with a wet mean weight diameter (WMWD) of (1.61 mm) compared with those of FL (2.18 mm)and KS (2.89 mm). Reduced stability of aggregates in CC is likely due to the,gr lower organic carbon content of soil in this land-use (1.7%) compared with that of FL (2.5%) and KS (3.2%). The soil under KS had lower bulk density (BD), penetration resistance (PR) and aggregate tensile strength (ATS) than that of FL and CC. Soil moisture content (MC) and available water capacity (AWC) showed an opposite trend. The soil in KS had a higher concentration of total N (TN), available P and exchangeable K, Ca, Mg and Zn. Soil on CC, on the other hand, had a higher concentration of Mn than that from FS and KS possibly because of its acidic nature. There were significant strong correlations between soil organic carbon and BID (-0.86***), PR (-0,61*), MC (0.82**), ATS (-0.62*), WSA (0.79***), AWC (0.91***), pH (-0.61**) and TN (0.76***). Grain yields of maize were highest in KS followed by FL and least in CC. The high yields were attributed to improved soil properties in plots of KS compared with both FL and CC. In conclusion, the findings suggested that organic matter had a major influence on soil properties and fertility. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Appropriate tillage and fertilizer management practices need to be developed for sustainable crop production without jeopardizing the quality of soil and the environment. Effects of tillage and fertilizer were studied for 4 years on wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and for 2 years on cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) from 1995-1996 to 1998-1999. The experiments were conducted on a sandy clay loam (fine-loa-my, mixed, hyperthermic Typic Haplargids, USDA; Luvic Yermosol, FAO) in semi-arid region of Pakistan. Effects of three tillage methods as main plots and three fertilizer rates as sub-plots were studied in a split plot configuration. Tillage treatments were minimum till (MT), conventional till (CT), and deep till (DT). Three rates of NPK fertilizer (kg ha(-1)) were 60-20-25 (F-1), 120-40-50 (F-2), and 180-60-75 (F-3) for wheat; and 85-19-25 (F-1), 170-38-50 (F-2), and 255-57-75 (F-3) for cotton. Tillage treatments had significant effect on, grain yield of wheat in 2 out of 4 years. Considering average yield over all fertilizer treatments and four seasons, mean wheat yield was 3.4 Mg ha(-1) for MT, 5.0 Mg ha(-1) for CT and 3.6 Mg ha-1 for DT. Mean grain yield based on the average of all tillage treatments over four seasons was 3.2 Mg ha(-1) for F-1, 3.7 Mg ha(-1) for F-2, and 3.9 Mg ha(-1) for F-3. A similar trend was observed for wheat straw yields. Deep ploughing significantly increased seed cotton yield compared to MT and CT treatments. Averaged over all fertilizer treatments and two seasons, mean seed cotton yield was 2.3 Mg ha(-1) for MT, 2.4 Mg ha(-1) for CT and 2.5 Mg ha(-1) for DT. Similarly, the mean seed cotton yield was 2.1 Mg ha(-1) for F-1, 2.5 Mg ha(-1) for F-2 and 2.6 Mg ha(-1) for F-3. For both crops the interaction of tillage and fertilizer treatments was significant. Tillage systems did not significantly affect the plant tissue elemental contents of wheat (at tillering) and cotton (at flowering), However, the increasing rates of N, P and K caused a corresponding increase in tissue contents of N, P and K of wheat and cotton. Tillage and fertilizer treatments had a positive effect on nutrient uptake by wheat. CT and DT increased N, P and K uptake compared to MT treatment. (C) 2001 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Populations of helmeted guineafowl (Numida meleagris) have declined significantly within the Midlands of KwaZulu-Natal Province, South Africa, since the early 1980s. A three-phase project was initiated in 1995 to assess the possible cause(s) of this decline. Initial research investigated socioeconomic factors such as illegal hunting, whereas subsequent statistical analyses, based on questionnaires, revealed correlations between guineafowl population densities and certain land-use practices. Further research focused on other possible causal factors including hyper-fragmentation of the habitat matrix, misuse of agrochemicals, disease, genetic contamination and dietary constraints. Results indicate that, although all these factors might have proximal, negative effects on local populations, there is no evidence to suggest widespread action of any single factor. Radio-tracking of guineafowl at several sites revealed that healthy guineafowl populations thrive in moderately fragmented landscapes, and that hyper-fragmentation of these habitats through increased, intensive crop agriculture, coupled with modern, 'clean' farming techniques, is largely responsible for observed declines in guineafowl populations due to population fragmentation and an undermining of meta-population structure. Resuscitating guineafowl populations to sustainable levels involves creating suitable habitats on a landscape level through management strategies at the conservancy level, with the objective being to strive for habitat diversity and connectivity.

AB Drawing on the resource-based view of the firm, this study took as its major goal the detection of what makes the difference between high- and low-performance firms. To this end, the profiles of core intangible resources of high- and low-performance public firms were explored, Another goal was to discover the firms perceptions of their business environment, and how these differed between the two types of firm. The study used an improved ranking method as a good platform from which to examine empirically the profile of core resources. By doing that, it claims to move towards "attempts to quantify empirically the nature and effects of resource-based constructs offer a fruitful avenue for future research" J. Management 25 (1999) 456. The results support the insight of a resource differential between high- and low-performance firms. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB There are many different causes behind the two civil wars in Liberia and Sierra Leone. Some are clearly unique to each country, whereas some of the most significant causes of war are shared in both cases. This article argues that the most basic reasons for these two wars are to be found in the extreme version of neopatrimonial politics that was developed in Liberia and Sierra Leone. Neopatrimonialism is not unique to these two countries, nor to Africa. However, the historical experience of the two countries suggests that Liberia and Sierra Leone developed an extreme version of neopatrimonial politics built on the need to secure the self through self-categorisation into self and other. The article therefore suggests that the historical legacy of these interlinkages is so substantial that the fates of Liberia and Sierra Leone are locked together like a pair of dead ringers. Neither country is likely to achieve sustainable peace if warlike conditions still exist in the other country.

AB The purpose of this article is to assess the Kyoto Protocol's Clean Development Mechanism (CDM). Drawing upon the literature on sustainable development and sustainability, the criteria for assessment consist of ecological, economic and social elements. Three key debates about the CDM are placed under investigation: proposals to clarify 'supplementarity' by capping the extent to which the CDM can be used to allow industrialised countries to meet their greenhouse gas emission limitation commitments; proposals to restrict CDM eligibility to particular kinds of projects; and proposals to introduce 'geographical quotas', to encourage CDM activity to take place throughout the developing world. Based largely upon its positive consequences for ecosystem and biophysical functions, further study of how restrictions upon CDM project eligibility could be implemented is encouraged.

DE resident attitudes; Hawaii; location development
ID TOURISM; CYCLE
AB Sustainable tourism cannot be successfully implemented without the involvement of those affected by tourism. Therefore, evaluating residents' altitudes towards tourism and involving them in as many aspects of development is an important step in creating sustainability. This paper summarizes work already done on resident inputs to the planning process and discusses the development and status of Waikiki, in the state of Hawaii, USA as a destination. Waikiki is one of the world's premier resort destinations serving both as a resort and residential area. It currently faces stagnating visitor arrivals and increased revitalization efforts, commonly typified by mature destinations. Recommendations for Waikiki's continued vitality are given based on a survey of Waikiki residents' attitudes towards the redevelopment of their community. Results indicate residents' close affinity towards Waikiki and favorable attitudes towards tourism. It is suggested that revitalization efforts be directed to residents' desire for an improved pedestrian environment and adherence to their revealed preferences. Residents' close attachment to Waikiki infers the need for resident endorsement of revitalization efforts. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID NITROGEN-FIXATION; YIELDS; SOIL
AB Maize (Zea mays)-cassava (Manihot esculenta) intercrop is a prominent cropping system in Ghana, grown with little or no fertilizer and component crops planted randomly. One approach to ensure sustainable production of the system is to exploit the biological nitrogen fixation capacity of leguminous crops by using maize and cowpea [Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp] rotation and row planting in the intercrop. The study was conducted at three sites in the forest and forest-savannah transition zones of Ghana from 1997 to 1999. The objective was to develop a stable and highly productive maize-cassava-cowpea intercropping system. There were two cassava varieties (main-plots): Gblemodoade and Ankra, combined with five row arrangements (sub-plots) in a split plot design. The row arrangements were: A,, 1 row cassava (1 m within row)-1 row maize-1 row cowpea after maize harvest; A(2), 1 row cassava (0,5 m within row)-1 row maize-1 row cowpea; A(3), I row cassava (1 m within row)-2 rows maize-3 rows cowpea; A(4), 1 row cassava (0.5 m within row)-2 rows maize-3 rows cowpea; and A(5), 1 row cassava-3 rows maize-5 rows cowpea. The A(1), A(2), A(3), and A(5) arrangements with Ankra and A(1) and A(3) arrangements with Gblemodoade were the most productive (Land Equivalent Ratio = 1.25-2.83) and stable. The stability of these cropping systems was apparently due to the high yield stability of Ankra and Gblemodoade in arrangement A(5). These five cropping systems are recommended for on-farm verification.

ID GROUNDWATER; NITROGEN; BARRIERS; SAWDUST
AB Denitrification walls are a useful approach for removing nitrate from shallow groundwater, but little is known about the sustainability of nitrate removal, which is dependent on the continued supply of organic carbon to denitrifying bacteria. To address this question, we monitored nitrate removal, denitrification and carbon dynamics in a pilot-scale denitrification wall for 5 yr. The wall continuously removed more than 95% of the incoming nitrate in groundwater, which ranged from 5 to 15 mg N L-1. We did not detect decreases in total carbon during the 5-yr study. Available carbon declined for the first 200 days after the wall was constructed but has since remained relatively constant. While microbial biomass has varied between 350 and 550 mug C g(-1) there was no downward trend, suggesting that carbon availability was not limiting the size of the microbial population. However, there was a large decrease in denitrifying population, as indicated by declines in denitrifying enzyme activity. Despite this decrease, denitrification rates have remained high enough to remove nitrate from groundwater and denitrification was limited by nitrate rather than by carbon. Our data demonstrates that there was sufficient available carbon in this denitrification wall to support denitrification and nitrate removal for at least 5 yr. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB The green sulphur bacterium Chlorobium thiosulfatophilum was used to remove hydrogen sulphide from synthetic industrial wastewater and convert it to elemental sulphur in a fixed-film continuous-flow photosynthetic bioreactor. Twenty 150 min x 3 mm ID Tygon tubes formed the active part of the reactor resulting in a total volume of 21.2 mL. Seven steady states were achieved under different experimental conditions using this tubular photo-reactor. Sulphide loading rates ranged from I I I to 328 mg/h L under influent flowrates of 9.0-42.4 mL/h and hydraulic retention times of 0.50 2.35h. The irradiance at the reactor surface averaged 25.4 W/m(2), The sulphide removal rates were found to be 82-100% and elemental sulphur recovery rates were found to be 75-95%. The maximum sustainable sulphide loading rate was found to be 286 mg/h L, which is 2.5 times higher than the previous reported highest value. Sulphide loading rate was found to be the function of radiant flux per unit reactor volume and the bacteriochlorophyll concentration as expressed by the van Niel curve. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

TI The hydrogeology of the Uitenhage Artesian Basin with reference to the
   Table Mountain Group Aquifer
SO WATER SA
LA English
DT Article
AB The Uitenhage Artesian Basin (UAB) lies in the Eastern Cape and is South Africa's most important artesian groundwater basin supplying approximately 1 400 Ml/yr (44 l/s) of water from springs for domestic use to Uitenhage, as well a supporting large citrus irrigation schemes. Groundwater from this basin has been extensively utilised from the early part of the 20(th) century, including periods of over-exploitation resulting in the declaration of a groundwater control area to limit abstraction to sustainable rates.
   The aquifer comprises fractured Table Mountain Group (TMG) sandstones confined in the eastern part of the basin by overlying Cretaceous siltstones and mudstones resulting in artesian conditions. The Coega Fault is a major structural feature dividing the basin into separate system, viz. the southern Swartkops Aquifer and the northern Coega Ridge Aquifer, that are hydrogeologically independent of each other. The Elands River syncline divides the Swartkops Aquifer further into the Kruisrivier and Bethelsdorp Units.
   Borehole yields commonly range from 5 to 10 l/s and the groundwater quality is excellent with low salinities. Water hardening, however, is required due to the acidic and corrosive nature of the groundwater, typical of other Table Mountain Group aquifers in South Africa. Using C-14 data, the age of the groundwater in the basin ranges from 1 500 to 28 000 years with a calculated flow rate of 0.8 m/a. From the chloride mass balance method, recharge rates are determined to be 25 to 55% of annual rainfall. Groundwater temperatures generally show that depths of groundwater strikes do not necessarily correspond with depth of origin, indicating a complex groundwater circulation pattern within the basin.
   Whilst the UAB has been well studied locally, a basin-scale hydrogeological characterisation is considered to be necessary, followed by recommendations and formulation of a management plan to ensure the continued sustainability of groundwater supply from this national asset.

TI Extending flood damage assessment methodology to include sociological
   and environmental dimensions
SO WATER SA
LA English
DT Article
AB Optimal and sustainable flood plain management, including flood control, can only be achieved when the impacts of flood control measures are considered for both the man-made and natural environments, and the sociological aspects are fully considered. Until now, methods/models developed to determine the influences of floods and flood control measures in South Africa, and elsewhere in the world, focus on the man-made environment and neglect the natural environment and social dimensions. Two models, recently completed in South Africa, namely FLODSIM (flood damage simulation model for irrigation areas) and TEWA (flood damage simulation model for urban areas) are cases in point.
   This paper gives and overview of the development of flood damage assessment and mitigation methodology in South Africa. Emphasis is placed on the evolution from the traditional ex-post approach to the lates ex-ante approach in which the sociological and natural environmental dimensions are included. Deliverables from the presentation should be of value to researchers and managers in the fields of flood management and environmental impact assessment worldwide.

TI Indicators of sustainable development for catchment management in South
   Africa - Review of indicators from around the world
SO WATER SA
LA English
DT Article
AB Indicators are the ideal means by which progress towards sustainable development can be measured. However, most indicator initiatives throughout the world have been aimed at state-of-the-environment reporting, with relatively few aimed at developing sectoral indicators. This paper provides the results of a review to establish trends in the development of indicators that assist in integrated water resource management. Twenty-one organisations from around the world were approached with regard to whether they had developed indicators of sustainable development for catchment management. Of these, only five organisations had developed, or were in the process of developing, indicator sets that were available for review. These included the Fraser Basin Council (Canada), the Murray-Darling Basin Commission (Australia), the Tennessee Valley Authority (USA), the United States Environmental Protection Agency and the World Resources Institute. All of these indicator sets were developed using an issues-based approach. Each indicator set was unique, reflecting the policy, both national and organisational, upon which it had been based. An analysis of these five indicator sets revealed that the most important themes that required information for water resource management at a catchment level, were biodiversity and ecosystem integrity, land-use change, water quality, waste production, water availability and resource use. Common indicators included population growth; community involvement; water availability; water use; water quality trends; soil contamination; non-compliance; species at risk; key species assessment; change in vegetation; agricultural impact; access to recreational opportunities, and ecosystem health. The identification of these themes and common indicators will be useful for the development of indicators for catchment management in South Africa. More importantly, policy frameworks and the physical characteristics of catchment systems in the country need to be taken into account. Additionally, it is recognised that no effective indicator set can be developed without the input of stakeholders.

AB Field experiments were conducted in 1996, 1997, and 1998 at Ste. Anne de Bellevue, Quebec, Canada, and in 1996 at Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, to quantify the impact of corn hybrids, differing in canopy architecture and plant spacing (plant population density and row spacing), on biomass production by transplanted and naturally occurring weeds. The treatments consisted of a factorial combination of corn type (leafy reduced stature [LRS], late-maturing big leaf [LMBL], a conventional Pioneer 3979 [P3979], and, as a control, a corn-free condition [weed monoculture]), two weed levels (low density [transplanted weeds: common lambsquarters and redroot pigweed] and high density [weedy: plots with naturally occurring weeds]), two corn population densities (normal and high), and row spacings (38 and 76 cm). At all site-years under both weed levels, the decrease in biomass production by both transplanted and naturally occurring weeds was greater due to the narrow row spacing than due to the high plant population density. The combination of narrower rows and higher population densities increased corn canopy light interception by 3 to 5%. Biomass produced by both transplanted and naturally occurring weeds was five to eight times less under the corn canopy than in the weed monoculture treatment. Generally, weed biomass production was reduced more by early-maturing hybrids (LRS and P3979) than by LMBL. Thus, hybrid selection and plant spacing could be used as important components of integrated pest management (weed control) for sustainable agriculture.

AB A 2-yr field study was conducted during 1998 and 1999 at Stoneville, MS, on a Dundee silt loam to determine weed control, yield, and net return associated with winter cover crops in soybean. Cover crop systems included Italian ryegrass, oat, rye, wheat, hairy vetch, crimson clover, subterranean clover, no-cover crop conventional tillage (CT), and no-cover crop no-tillage (NT), all with standard preemergence (PRE), postemergence (POST), PRE + POST, and no-herbicide weed management. Oat (11.1 Mg/ha) had highest dry biomass compared to all other cover crops (6.0 to 7.6 Mg/ha) at soybean planting. Biomass decreased 9 wk after planting (WAP) compared to the respective biomass at soybean planting in all cover crops. Italian ryegrass and rye biomass decay was slow and about two-thirds of plant residue persisted at 9 WAR Cover crops had no effect on densities of barnyardgrass, prickly sida, and yellow nutsedge, but altered the density of browntop, millet. Total weed biomass was higher in rye, wheat, and subterranean clover than in Italian ryegrass cover crop systems, and higher with the PRE-only vs. POST-only or PRE + POST programs at 10 WAP soybean. Soybean yield decreased in the order of no-cover crop NT greater than or equal to no-cover crop CT greater than or equal to hairy vetch greater than or equal to crimson clover greater than or equal to rye greater than or equal to oat greater than or equal to wheat greater than or equal to subterranean clover > Italian ryegrass. None of the cover crop systems gave soybean yield higher than the no-cover crop CT system in the absence of herbicides. Under a PRE-only program, all cover crop systems had lower yield compared to the no-cover crop CT system. When late-emerged weeds were controlled with POST applications (POST-only or PRE + POST programs), all cover crops, except Italian ryegrass, had no detrimental effect on soybean yields, which were not different from no-cover crop CT plots. In cover crops., input costs were high due to additional cost of seeds, planting, and desiccation. Net return was highest in no-cover crop NT ($105/ha) followed by no-cover crop CT ($76/ha) system. Net returns were negative for all cover crops and losses were highest in crimson clover (-$62/ha) and subterranean clover (-$161/ha).

AB The involvement of allelopathy in various crop-weed competition studies has been suggested by several authors, but its significance has been demonstrated with varying success. It is extremely difficult to unambiguously demonstrate allelopathy in nature because of the complexity of plant interference and its relationship to soil chemistry. However, with an increased understanding of the chemical processes occurring in the agroecosystem, genetic mapping of quantitative traits, and the ability to identify allelochemicals, an effort should now be directed toward understanding the mechanisms for allelopathy, as well as trying to optimize an allelopathic effect to produce more competitive crops. The approach used for rice allelopathy research can be used as a general framework for understanding how genetically encoded traits affect the competitive ability of plants. This framework requires the involvement of a range of scientists from multidisciplinary research areas with the overall objective of optimizing competitive ability in crops. Such research efforts could reduce dependency on herbicides and thus increase the sustainability of weed management practices. This paper aims to illustrate the importance of allelopathy for crop competitive ability and to identify a framework suitable for result-oriented collaborative research toward breeding for competitive ability in crops.

ID BEET PRODUCTION; GERMANY
AB Constant advances in technology and breeding have considerably changed sugarbeet production. The goals of high product quality and environmentally friendly methods of crop production have been increasingly realized, with simultaneous reductions in costs. This can be seen. above all. in the developments in soil cultivation and fertilizing, Reduced tillage methods have grown in popularity and the application of mineral nitrogen has declined.
   Extensive catch cropping contributes to biological pest control and the usage of erosion-preventing mulch sowing. Reduced tillage has promoted soil activity and increased the carrying capacity of soils. The high population densities achieved in recent years make for good beet quality. suppress late-germinating weeds and help to reduce harvest losses.
   Thanks to improved seed protection, area-wide insecticidal soil treatment has been replaced by targeted applications. This likewise has cut down the number of subsequent treatments against virus-carrying aphids. Monitoring systems based on damage threshold concepts are replacing preventive measures in the treatment of foliar diseases.
   There is a continuing trend towards cooperation between farms in sowing, harvesting and transport. Increasingly, the covering of clamps shields the beets against frost and makes it easier to separate the beets from dirt. Cleaner-loaders are now almost everywhere deployed in the field.

AB Many stochastic weather generators commonly used with crop models tend to under predict, interannual variability of climate and, as a result, distort distributions of crop simulation results. We examine the ability of four stochastic weather generators, WeatherMan, MARKSIM, WM2 and LARS-WG, to reproduce interannual. variability of monthly climate and crop simulation results. Comparisons were based on bias and RMSE of means and standard deviations of monthly precipitation totals, frequencies of wet days, mean daily temperature extremes for 12 long-term weather data sets; and yields and dates of anthesis and harvest maturity of three crops under a total of 10 scenarios simulated with dynamic crop models. Evaluation also considered statistical tests of equality of distributions of the same variables between observed and generated weather data sets. The generators generally reproduced climatic means well, except for MARKSIM which showed positive bias of mean monthly rainfall totals and frequencies. WM2 and LARS-WG showed substantial negative bias of interannual variability of monthly precipitation totals. As a result of stochastic resampling of wet-day frequencies, MARKSIM and WM2 showed little negative variability bias of monthly precipitation totals, but positive variability bias of monthly wet-day frequencies. WeatherMan, MARKSIM and LARS-WG under represented variability of monthly mean temperatures, whereas WM2 showed positive but smaller mean temperature variability bias. WM2 reproduced simulated distributions of yield and harvest maturity dates better than the other generators. Results for simulated anthesis dates were not consistent among generators. This study supports the need for some form of low-frequency variability correction in stochastic weather generators for applications in which reproducing interannual variability is important. Results generally favor WM2 over the other generators tested for applications in which variability of simulated yields is of primary importance. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Industrial ecology? A surprising, intriguing expression that immediately draws our attention. The spontaneous reaction is that "industrial ecology" is a contradiction in terms, something of an oxymoron, like "obscure clarity" or "burning ice".
   Why this reflex? Probably because we are accustomed to considering the industrial system as isolated from the Biosphere, with factories and cities on one side and nature on the other, as well as the recurrent problem of trying to minimise the impact of the industrial system on what is "beyond" it: its surroundings, the "environment". As early as the 1950s, this end-of-pipe angle was the one adopted by ecologists, whose first serious studies focused oil the consequences of the various forms of pollution oil nature. In this perspective on the industrial system, human industrial activity as such remained outside the field of research.
   Industrial ecology explores the opposite assumption: The industrial system can be seen as a certain kind of ecosystem. After all, the industrial system, just as natural ecosystems, can be described as a particular distribution of materials, energy, and information flows. Furthermore, the entire industrial system relies on resources and services provided by the Biosphere, fi-om which it cannot be dissociated. (It should be specified that "'industrial", in the context of industrial ecology, refers to all human activities occurring within modern technological society. Thus, tourism, housing, medical services, transportation, agriculture, etc. are part of the industrial system)
   Besides its rigorous scientific conceptual framework (Scientific ecology), industrial ecology can also be seen as a practical approach to sustainability. It is an attempt to address the question, "How can the concept of sustainable development be made operational in an economically feasible way?" Industrial ecology represents precisely one of the paths that could provide concrete solutions.
   Governments have traditionally approached development and environmental issues in a fragmented and compartimentalised way. This is illustrated in the classical end-of-pipe strategy for the treatment of pollution, which has proven to be quite useful, but not adequate to make all efficient use of limited resources, in the context of a growing population with increasing economic aspirations. Thus, industrial ecology emerges at a time when it is becoming increasingly clear that the traditional pollution treatment approach (end-of-pipe) is not only insufficient to solve environmental problems, but also too costly in the long run.

AB Soil alkalinisation generally constitutes a major threat to irrigated agriculture in the semi-arid regions of west Africa. The improvement of sodic soils is generally difficult and expensive. However, a recent study in the Niger valley in Niger, reveals that a natural de-alkalinisation is possible under natural conditions in a semi-arid climate. Transformation of non-saline sodic soil into brown steppe soil type was recorded. On the same site. the cultivation of a Sahelian fodder grass, locally known as 'Burgu' was used on the sodic soil/brown steppe soil transition zone to accelerate this natural de-alkafinisation and characterise its mechanisms. The geochemical properties of both soil types were monitored before cultivation and 1 year after continuous crop cultivation. After cultivation and regular irrigation, the chemical properties of the former sodic soils were close to those of the surrounding brown steppe soils, which are better suited for agriculture. This modification of the sodic soil properties can be attributed to (i) the large amount of water supplied during cultivation that induced salt leaching. This is the main phenomenon responsible for the changes observed; (ii) the root activity that modified the acid-base equilibrium and consumes alkalinity.
   The residual alkalinity (RA) concept was used to select chemical tracers of the concentration/ dilution of the soil solution. Here, sodium amount and calcite + fluorite residual alkalinity (RA(calcite+fluorite)) were the most adequate ones. These two tracers decreased proportionally under the influence of leaching, but the exchanges between cations and protons changed the RA(calcite+fluorite), without modifying the sodium amount. Their combined use allowed us to separate and quantify the uptake of the plant from the leaching in the de-alkalinisation process. This study highlighted that reclamation of this type of sodic soils is feasible. The use of the RA concept is advisable to design a sustainable management system for irrigated sodic or saline soils.

DE Aral Sea Basin; transboundary; flow; ecological; problem; desalination
AB The Aral Sea Basin, which is shared by 5 countries of the former Soviet Union - Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tadjikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan is well known to the world due to the large scale water development in the Soviet period, which caused many ecological problems in the region. One of them is the problem of return waters, which are unmanaged and unused in now acceptable form. The total Transboundary Return Water (TRW) volume formed in the territory of 5 states is 36-40 km(2). The two main reasons for the worsening of water quality in the major rivers of the Aral Sea basin - Amudarya and Syrdarya are: water withdrawal from the rivers for irrigation purposes and release return flow to the river of a large content of salts and other pollutants from irrigated lands. Spontaneous formation, dissemination and accumulation of return waters can, and already have caused considerable negative effects in environment and social development. For the development of a program for the use and management of these waters and its approval by the region's countries, measures preventing these effects must be taken in order to be of mutual benefit to all the countries involved and, simultaneously, to transform these waters into a source of life, biodiversity, sustainability and prosperity in the Aral Sea basin on a scale, that would influence the world community. For stabilization of these water bodies at the regional, and, thus at a global scale, it is necessary to eliminate the following threats: instability of whole scope and especially TRW regime in terms of quantity and quality; uncontrolled allocation and use of such waters; injurious use, including poaching. It must be taken into account that transboundary waters' sustainable development and use require permanent monitoring and management over a range of criteria, providing their ecological stability and safety as well as long-term bioproductivity and biodiversity of ecosystems supported by them. The principle provisions of management system on TRW are proposed for each stage: type of return water use; direction of possible use; stability criterion; restrictions; control.

AB As a consequence of continuous growth in population, in standards of life and in industrial development, stress on water supplies is steadily increasing in the Mediterranean and other areas with water scarcity. Therefore, a need to use raw waters of lower quality has developed. In some of the countries of the Mediterranean and Middle East region, the governments have issued new large-scale programs to recover and reuse treated municipal waste waters, rehabilitate salinated and contaminated wells and desalinate brackish and other difficult raw waters from marginal sources. This paper presents trends for the above type of treatments and discusses alternatives and problems seen in implementing some of the possibilities. Benefits and problems encountered in "real-life" application of modern membrane technologies are presented in the example of three case histories on industrial size and pilot plants for reverse osmosis (RO) or nanofiltration (NF) treatment. Feed waters included are industrial, municipal and agricultural effluents as well as highly contaminated surface and well waters. For some of the cases, economic figures are also presented. Based on the experiences given in the case histories, conclusions for the selection of feed waters and for future technical concepts are drawn.

DE desalination; Libya; applications; sustainability
AB Large increases in water demand with very little recharge have strained Libya's groundwater resources resulting in serious declines in water levels and quality, especially along the Mediterranean coast where most of the domestic, industrial and agricultural activities are concentrated. To meet these increases, Libya turned to desalination as a supplemental water resource as early as 1964. Both thermal and membrane desalination technologies have been used. MSF, MED and VS as well as ED, EDR and RO processes have been employed to provide water for domestic and industrial purposes. Applications included both brackish and seawater desalination with plant sizes ranging from less than 100 m(3)/d to 40,000 m(3)/d with a total cumulative installed capacity exceeding 0.6 MCM/d. The objective of this paper is to summarize the experience gained from operating these plants over a long period of time. To achieve this objective, design and operational data from some of these plants were analyzed with special reference to evolution of process applications, and major problems and limitations and their impacts on process performance. Based on the results of this analysis, Libya continues to be a major user of desalination technologies ranking as the world's 4th to 5th user. Thermal desalination processes (TDPs), which gained momentum in the early seventies, are the major producer accounting for about 75% of the total cumulative installed capacity. RO processes, although a relatively newcomer, come next. EDR processes account for the largest number of plants installed. Applications of all three technologies have been increasing steadily since 1972 with minor decline in the early nineties. Problems have been reported in all phases of plant development: planning, installation and start-up, operation and maintenance. These problems are administrative, technical and financial. They are presented and analyzed with due consideration to "local factors" which are usually ignored by designers/contractors. Although some of these problems are minor, if not addressed properly, their impacts on plant performance can be significant. The experience gained is invaluable on a national as well as regional level and to suppliers, end-users and professionals in the field.

AB Developing an environmentally acceptable desalination project has the following overall benefits: protection of the environment, minimize planning approval time-scales, minimize time for arranging funding or reaching "financial close" and minimizing overall construction time-scales. This can be achieved if the developer recognizes that the project will be environmentally "driven" from site identification to decommissioning and as such develop a project strategy with this in mind from day one. Project cost and other factors (e.g., engineering, water demand) are important, but these can be integrated into environmental considerations. Above all, an environmentally acceptable project is one that fulfils the requirements of sustainable development. Sustainable development has been characterized as a way of social, economic and political progress that meets "the needs of the present without compromising the ability of the future generations to meet their own needs". The following environmental issues should be addressed to meet the above concept (1) Site Identification/Site Selection-site identification is often based on engineering factors to minimize cost of infrastructure whereas site selection should be based on environmental and engineering factors to ensure timely award of consents and licences; (2) Public Relations - public relations is an important issue in the "stakeholder concept". In such cases the developer is encouraged to provide an analysis of alternatives to demonstrate to the public why the selected site and technology are ideally suited at the selected location. This could be achieved via written and oral consultation as well as exhibitions; (3) Planning Approvals (design, construction and operation) - it is important to obtain all national and funding agency approvals. An early review of consents and licences required is recommended; (4) Environmental Standards/Plant Performance - the plant should be designed to environmental standards set by national government and funding agencies. In the absence of these standard, World Bank Guidelines are to be consulted; (5) Climate Change Issues - many countries are now signatory to the climate change protocol. The use of combined heat and power and the choice of generating technology is an important consideration in this aspect. Reduced interest rates in obtaining funding is another driver to consider climate change issues; (6) Environmental Management Plans-these are required for the construction and operational phases of the project. These plans should also include the setting up of community liaison groups to allow public feedback. The above environmental requirements and issues have been reviewed in this paper using the author's personal experience.

AB In most and countries the scarcity of conventional fresh water supplies infers a serious threat to sustainable and balanced socio-economic growth and development. This threat is clearly more pronounced in the less developed countries. However, the mining of non-conventional seawater and wastewater resources could provide an opportunity and a challenge to water supply sustainability. In Kuwait, the average rainfall is 110mm per year and the fresh water streams do not exist. The fresh water resources are limited to groundwater, desalinated seawater, and treated wastewater effluents. The total conventional fresh water resources available in Kuwait are 6 million m(3)/y while the total water demand has exceeded 350 million m(3)/y in the year 2000. With the continued deterioration of existing groundwater resources, almost 90% of the water demand is currently satisfied through seawater desalination plants. The history of desalination in Kuwait dates back to 1951 when the first distillation plant was commissioned. Currently the desalination capacity is1.65 million m(3)/d of which 1.47 million m(3)/d is provided by multi-stage flash distillation (MSF) and 0.17 million m(3)/d is supplied by reverse osmosis (RO). On the other hand, tertiary treated wastewater effluents of about 0.4 million m(3)/d are produced by three major municipal wastewater treatment plants. Such effluent is currently utilized in irrigation. This paper presents the water resources management plan in Kuwait and evaluates the role of desalination and water reuse in meeting the increasing water demand. It also examines the recent trends in water supply and demand as well as the development in desalting plants inventory. Desalination requirements in Kuwait will continue to grow. A dramatic decline in cost has made desalination a viable and economic solution to ensure future water supply in Kuwait and the region, while the growing environmental concern has led to increased interest in water reuse.

AB Liquid or supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO(2)) is a versatile reaction medium for ring-opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) and ring-closing olefin metathesis (RCM) reactions using well-defined metal catalysts. The molybdenum alkylidene complex 1 and ruthenium carbenes 2 and 3 bearing PCy3 or N-heterocyclic carbene ligands, respectively, can be used and are found to exhibit efficiency similar to that in chlorinated organic solvents. While compound 1 is readily soluble in scCO(2), complexes 2 and 3 behave liked heterogeneous catalysts in this reaction medium. Importantly, however, the unique properties Of scCO(2) provide significant advantages beyond simple solvent replacement. This pertains to highly convenient workup procedures both for polymeric and low molecular weight products, to catalyst immobilization, to reaction tuning by density control (RCM versus acyclic diene metathesis polymerization), and to applications Of scCO(2) as a protective medium for basic amine functions. The latter phenomenon is explained by the reversible formation of the corresponding carbamic acid as evidenced by H-1 NMR data obtained in compressed CO2. Together with its environmentally and toxicologically benign character, these unique physicochemical features sum up to a very attractive solvent profile of carbon dioxide for sustainable synthesis and production.

AB In order to guarantee a proper operation of both UPC/NPC and CAC functions in ATM networks, the intrinsic traffic characteristics of connections should first be adequately described by a set of standardized traffic parameters. The most significant traffic descriptors for the VBR service are SCR (Sustainable Cell Rate) and MBS (Maximum Burst Size). In this paper, we work on traffic parameters estimation from VBR source modeling in ATM networks. We propose a new method of traffic parameters estimation from the VBR ON/OFF source model, which satisfies the quality of service (QoS) requirements with the least cost.

AB This paper presents a conceptual object-oriented design (OOD) framework for abstracting forest management design components. The framework for OOD encompassing modularity, encapsulation, interface and inheritance is used to abstract a forest management system in a modular way. We presented that using OOD approaches, a forest management model can be developed generically enough to accommodate various components of forest management modeling. The model framework is flexible and can be updated with relative efficiency, as the system design components are modularized and less independent than those designed with conventional approaches. We identified the basic components and discussed in detail their interface and behavior (functions) in a typical forest management planning process with three distinct modeling approaches; simulation, optimization and meta heuristics. We established OO management design framework which is both generic enough to provide the fundamental services to any types of forest management modeling such as simulation optimization and meta heuristics - however, we demonstrated the latter - and capable of providing specific services such as handling forest development patterns, forming strategies, forecasting and reporting forest changes. We concludes that the OOD approach for abstracting forest management design process allows a great deal of flexibility in constructing flexible, extensible, and adaptable forest management decision support systems tools and provides important information essential for the sustainable management of forested ecosystems.

AB The technological risks associated with electricity generating options are a crucial consideration in the governance of energy strategies. Conversely, many central issues in the broader social debate over the governance of environmental risk (such as acid gas emissions, radioactive waste management, nuclear safety and global climate change) relate very strongly to technology choice in the electricity supply sector. The particularities of this field, therefore, offer a topical and pertinent case with which to explore the relationship between science and precaution in the governance of technological risk. By reference to the electricity sector, the present paper examines the contrasts between 'risk-based' and 'precautionary' approaches to the governance of risk, paying particular attention to the problems of intractable uncertainties and divergent values. A number of theoretical and methodological issues in conventional risk-assessment and cost-benefit analysis are examined and their practical implications for appraisal explored. Attention then turns to the form that might be taken by approaches to the governance of energy risks that are at the same time scientifically well-founded and precautionary. Conclusions are drawn for decision and policy making in this area. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

ID SCIENCE
AB We outline the potential participative governance and risk management in application to technological choices in the nuclear sector within the European Union (EU). Well-conducted public participation, stakeholder consultation and deliberation procedures can enhance the policy process and improve the robustness of strategies dealing with high-stakes investment and risk management challenges. Key nuclear issues now confronting EU member states are: public concern with large-scale environmental and health issues; the Chernobyl accident (and others less catastrophic) whose effect has been to erode public confidence and trust in the nuclear sector; the maturity of the nuclear plant, hence the emerging prominence of waste transportation, reprocessing and disposal issues as part of historical liability within the EU; the nuclear energy heritage of central and eastern European candidate countries to EU accession. The obligatory management of inherited technological risks and uncertainties on large temporal and geographical scales, is a novel feature of technology assessment and governance. Progress in the nuclear sector will aid the development of methodologies for technological foresight and risk governance in fields other than the nuclear alone. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

ID COUNTRIES
AB Chemical safety is recognized in Agenda 21(UNCED - Rio 92), as one of the most serious problems to be faced worldwide being a problem not just of governability, restricted more to the role of states and governments, but of governance at the national and international levels. It poses greater challenges for countries like Brazil where the issues of democracy, security, sustainability and equity, which are fundamental to governance, are merely incipient and still far from solved. Taking as references the analysis of four cases in the Brazilian context, we illustrate the situation from less densely populated areas (as in the cases of mercury use by gold miners in the Amazon and pesticides in agricultural producing areas), through medium-sized towns (as in the accident with cesium 137 in Goiania), to the major urban and industrial centers (as in the cases of lead from battery renovators and benzene in the oil and steel industries and oil refineries). What can be seen is a situation where problems connected with chemical safety have grown in intensity and extent far more than the capacity to deal with them. In industrializing countries, the formulation of chemical safety policies must take into account not only the complexity and uncertainties involved in understanding the problems, but also the aspects relating to the different modes and levels of vulnerability. This is necessary in order to attempt to build better contextualized and more participatory knowledge and decision-making processes at the local and global levels, which we take as basic prerequisites for governance.
