TI Scottish visitor attractions: managing visitor impacts
SO TOURISM MANAGEMENT

AB The visitor attraction sector in Scotland plays a vital, if often overlooked, role in the wider Scottish tourism industry. Yet the sector presently faces a host of internal and external threats. In terms of external threats, the sector is currently experiencing heightened competition not only from overseas tourism markets but also from domestic leisure activities such as sport and shopping. Meanwhile the sector is widely acknowledged to have an oversupply of visitor attractions. In terms of internal threats, it is increasingly being recognised that the sector is susceptible to a range of negative visitor impacts. Even at current visitor levels such impacts could seriously compromise the resources upon which the sector draws and ultimately depends. This paper presents the findings of a postal survey of all of Scotland's 510 paid admission attractions in 1999. The survey explored perceptions of the range and severity of visitor impacts. relating these impacts to factors such as attraction type, admission prices, visitor numbers and ownership status. The paper concludes that predictions of future external trends do not bode well for the Scottish industry in its current form, and that an internally focused, quality-oriented strategy is required if the majority of attractions are to survive and prosper in the coming decade. This, in turn, means developing more effective ways of managing visitor impacts. While the focus of this study is on Scotland, some important lessons are identified for visitor attractions more generally. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI The sensitivity of optimal transport strategies to specification of
   objectives
SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART A-POLICY AND PRACTICE
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper describes a method for devising transport strategies that makes iterative use of transport models to find the optimal levels of pre-defined transport measures. It gives the results from using this method in nine European cities. At the heart of the procedure lies the definition of objective functions which encapsulate policy-makers' objectives with respect to economic efficiency and sustainability. These objective functions include a number of significant parameters and the paper examines the sensitivity of the results to changes in the values of these parameters. The parameters concerned are: the level of shadow price used with regard to public sector financial surplus and deficit; the trade-off between the perspectives of the present generation and a future generation (of importance to issues of sustainability); the trade-off between internal benefits/costs and external (environmental) benefits/costs; and the level of user benefits that can be "value captured" in the sense of raising additional finance for transport policies. Full sets of results are given for these sensitivity tests, and a number of practical transport policy conclusions are made. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

DE water and sanitation; planning; privatization; AWTP; desalination;
   Palestine
AB The present problems that are related to water and sanitation in Palestine are many and varied, and the disparity between water supply and demand is growing with time due to the rapid population growth and aridity. Desalination has the potential to supply unlimited quantities of high-quality freshwater to Palestinian Communities. On the other hand, the situation of the sewerage system in the cities is extremely critical, and there are no sewerage systems in the rural areas. There is an urgent need for substantial improvements and extensions to the sewerage systems and treatment plants. The available funds for the Palestinian Water Authority (PWA) and other municipalities to implement wastewater and desalination projects are limited As a result, it is important to fully explore the use of public-private partnerships that utilize sector resources to finance such projects. The objective of this study is to understand incentives for privatization of water supply and sanitation services, with more emphasis on the households' Affordability and Willingness-to-Pay (AWTP) for improved water and sanitation services. The results show that people in Palestine bear the burden of high water supply and sanitation costs. Privatization of the water and sanitation sector will guarantee sustainable development of these sectors under limited financial resources and dependency on external funds.

AB The water resource issue is one of the most significant problems that the Yellow River basin will face this century, and one which has received much attention by public and government for several years. Water authorities will face great challenges in meeting the in-stream flow requirements and providing more water for growing populations, industry and agriculture. In order to evaluate the sustainability of the water resource system in the study area, an object-oriented system dynamics approach has been used to develop a model for the water resources system in the Yellow River basin, which is referred to as the Water Resources System Dynamics (WRSD) model. It has been developed for simulating a water resource system and capturing the dynamic character of the main elements affecting water demand and supply in the study area. For the business-as-usual (BaU) scenario, the water demands in the Yellow River basin are estimated 50.9, 56.5, and 59.5 billion m(3) for 2010, 2020, and 2030. The existing and potential water supplies from surface water, aquifers and treated waste-water are estimated, and potential water demands for domestic, industrial and agricultural uses are projected. Various water supply and demand scenarios have then been explored by changing variables and parameters, and the sustainability index of the water supply system is estimated for different sub-regions over various periods.

TI A framework for sustainability analysis in water resources management
   and application to the Syr Darya Basin
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
AB [1] Sustainable water management in irrigation-dominated river basins attempts to ensure a long-term, stable, and flexible water supply to meet crop water demands, as well as growing municipal and industrial water demands, while mitigating negative environmental consequences. To achieve this delicate balance, new models are needed which can use indicators of sustainability to guide the decision-making process. This paper presents a new long-term modeling framework which uses quantified sustainability criteria in a long-term optimization model of a basin, ensuring risk minimization in water supply, environmental conservation, equity in water allocation, and economic efficiency in water infrastructure development. "Current'' and "future'' water supply and demand are combined into a coherent system which takes account of the cumulative effects of short-term water use decisions and deals with the tradeoffs between the benefits of current and future generations. The modeling framework is demonstrated with an application to the Syr Darya River Basin of central Asia. Model results show the effectiveness of this tool for policy analysis in the context of the river basin.

AB Recovered Paper Utilisation in the European Paper Industry-Recent Developments and Changes in the Political Frame Work
   Recovered paper is the most important raw material in the European paper industry. Although the recovered paper utilisation and recovery rates vary considerably in the different EU countries, the European paper industry has issued a statement in which they commit themselves to recover and recycle 56% of all used paper by 2005. This means in practice an increase in recovered paper use of about 8 mil tonnes. Numerous national and European regulations affect the achievement of this target The Sustainable Development Strategy of the European Union, The Sixth Environment Action Programme of the European Community as well as the EC Waste Directive outline the freedom of action. The potential of recovered paper to serve as a raw material still has not gained general acceptance. The packaging instructions and regulations for the utilisation of renewable sources of energy and even Me agreements on the olimate influence the recycling of recovered paper. It 5 of utmost importance that suppliers observe ingrade quality guidelines in accordance with the European list of standard grades of recovered paper and board. Growing paper production capacities based on recovered paper as a raw material can only be supplied if used paper recovery is expanded in Europe and less used paper is exported to other continents.

AB An understanding of agroecosystems is key to determining effective farming systems. Here we report results from a 21-year study of agronomic and ecological performance of biodynamic, bioorganic, and conventional farming systems in Central Europe. We found crop yields to be 20% Lower in the organic systems, although input of fertilizer and energy was reduced by 34 to 53% and pesticide input by 97%. Enhanced soil fertility and higher biodiversity found in organic plots may render these systems less dependent on external inputs.

AB The decomposition of CH2FCF3 over some phosphate catalysts was studied. CH2FCF3 began to react at 250, 300, and 450 degreesC over Zr-3(PO4)(4), AlPO4, and BPO4, respectively, and the conversion reached 100% at 475, 500, and 700 degreesC, respectively. The primary reaction over Zr-3(PO4)(4) was estimated to be CH2FCF3 + H2O + 1(/)2 O-2 --> 2CO + 4HF, whereas the reactions over AlPO4 and BPO4 were CH2FCF3 + H2O + O-2 --> CO + CO2 + 4HF and CO + 1/2 O-2 --> CO2. Complete decomposition requires both hydrolysis and oxidation. The oxidation activities of these phosphate catalysts are not high enough to accomplish complete decomposition. However, AlPO4-based catalysts can be combined with each Co3O4, Mn2O3, CuO, and Cr2O3 at a phosphate content of 1/10 by volume to make them sustainable at 550-550 degreesC. The addition of Ce to AlPO4 brought about a promotion effect in CH2FCF3 decomposition similar to that for CCl2F2 decomposition. This might suggest a similarity in the reaction mechanism. The primary reaction in the absence of oxygen was estimated to be CH2FCF3 + H2O --> CO + C + 4HF.

ID INDUSTRY
AB This paper is an extension of a research on sustainable planning of the petrochemical industry. We have previously quantified sustainability to pollution prevention represented by a health index of the chemicals and increased profit represented by a process added value. In the present study, a model with an environmental objective and strategic constraints is considered. The objective in the new model is still quantified in the same fashion as that in our previous model. However, in addition to material balance, supply/demand, and economic constraints, a new constraint set is introduced. This set represents a strategic tool in the form of the Boston Consulting Group growth/share matrix and is used as a product selection criteria to give a competitive advantage to the industry and to direct products with good growth potenial. The ultimate results would be sustainable and financially stable businesses. The model is tested on a case study of planning the development of Kuwait's petrochemical industry. Results give an optimal development structure for different scenarios but also provide a tool for long-range growth and financial stability.

AB Traditional small-scale fermentation technologies offer considerable potential for stimulating development in the food industry of developing countries in light of their low cost, scalability, minimal energy and infrastructural requirements and the wide consumer acceptance of fermented products in these countries. Efficient transfer and adaptation of these technologies is, however, often limited by inadequate basic scientific knowledge of the processes involved and the lack of appropriate biological inoculants and process controls for these technologies. Basic infrastructures, such as suitably equipped laboratories with consistent working conditions, a constant supply of good quality water and reliable power supplies, are critical elements of a minimal technology base for transfer and adaptation of these technologies. Building the institutional capacity in developing countries to facilitate research and development geared toward a better understanding of the technologies applied in small-scale traditional fermentations is essential, as is the encouragement of governments to formulate supportive national policies, which promote small-scale agro-industrial development. Socioeconomic considerations play a critical role in the successful and sustainable transfer and adoption of technologies and their products in developing countries. (C) 2002 FAO-AGS.

AB We study simple models for circadian rhythm, and examine the condition in which the equilibrium is unstable, generating a sustained oscillation. In the models, a clock gene(s) is transcribed to produce mRNAs, which are translated to produce proteins that suppress the transcription of the clock gene(s). First, using a Lyapunov function, we prove under very general conditions that two-variable models cannot generate a stable oscillation, implying that additional structures are needed for the model to generate a sustainable rhythm. By comparing several models of different complexities using the Routh-Hurwitz criteria of stability, we show that a sustained oscillation is more likely to occur if the cell is compartmentalized and the proteins need to be transported from the cytosol to the nucleus, if the proteins have to be modified before entering the nucleus, if the kinetics of transcription inhibition or the transport to the nucleus have cooperativity with a nonlinear dependence on the substrate concentration, or if the products of two clock genes form a heterodimer that suppresses both of their own genes. We discuss the implications of these results. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Predicting impacts of climate change or alternative management on both food production and environment safety in agroecosystems is drawing great attention in the scientific community. Most of the existing agroecosystem models emphasize either crop growth or soil processes. This paper reports the latest development of an agroecosystem model (Crop-DNDC) by integrating detailed crop growth algorithms with an existing soil biogeochemical model, DNDC (Li et al., J. Geophys, Res. (1992) 9759). In the Crop-DNDC model, crop growth is simulated not only by tracking crop physiological processes (phenology, leaf area index, photosynthesis, respiration, assimilate allocation, rooting processes and nitrogen uptake), but also by calculating water stress and nitrogen stress, which were closely related to soil biogeochemical processes and hydraulic dynamics. Crop-DNDC also quantifies crop residue incorporated in the soil at the end of each growing season. Thus the model has tightly coupled crop growth algorithms with soil biogeochemical components, and simulates carbon, nitrogen and water cycles in agroecosystems with a relatively complete scope. The model was validated against field measurements, including soil moisture, leaf area index, crop biomass and nitrogen content, and the modeled results were in agreement with observations on soil carbon dynamics and trace gas emissions as well. Sensitivity tests demonstrated that the modeled results in crop yield, soil carbon dynamics and trace gas emissions were sensitive to climate conditions, atmospheric CO, concentration and various farming practices. There are potentials of applying the model for simultaneously predicting effects of changes in climate or management on crop yield, soil carbon sequestration and trace gas emissions.

AB One of the fundamental basis in the development of sustained-use management systems is the determination of the minimal logging diameters (MLD) and the felling cycle compatible with sustainable logging operations. The method used in the present study to determine the MLD and felling cycle is based on the growth rate and the diameter class distributions of the most important merchantable species in Bassila forest reserve, North Benin. The calculations of the MLD and cutting cycle are done using both the class distribution of the stem diameter and basal area of nine valuable timber species selected within the most important commercial species of this forest reserve. in order to assess the difference between these two approaches.
   Values of MLD and cutting cycle duration obtained using the stem class distribution or the basal area class distribution are in general the same. The MLD calculated for nine timber species varies from 35 to 65 cm. The cutting cycle period obtained is 18 years for the bell-shaped type species and 24 years for the inverse J-shaped type species. For the bell-shaped type species, the mean percentage of recruitment obtained with 18 years felling cycle is about 60% considering the number of the loggable stems and 34% of the loggable basal area. As far as the inverse J-shaped type species are concerned. 24 years felling cycle will allow 55% of mean recruitment considering the number of the loggable stems and 19% of the loggable basal area. For the whole forest stand, 22 years cutting cycle is obtained allowing 57% recruitment of the loggable stems and 23% recruitment of the loggable basal area. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

ID MANAGEMENT
AB Hybrid poplar plantations are one of the most important sources of timber and wood fibres in Italy and represent a significant alternative as sustainable use of agricultural land. Effective management of such plantations requires adequate growth and yield models. In light of this, the paper presents the fundamentals of a top-down growth and yield model for hybrid poplar (I-214 clone) plantations in Italy. In the top-down approach, standing volume, basal area, or other characteristics are the primary quantities predicted and these quantities are disaggregated into size class, and, eventually, into individual tree information. The basic element of the proposed prototype is the stand basal area growth equation. Stand age, current stand basal area, and site index are considered as predictors. If the current DBH distribution is also known, a second function estimates the size-class distribution of overall stand growth, projecting the DBH distribution to the end of the considered growth period. Individual competition indices do not contribute to the explanation of the growth variation at the tree level. Prototype predictions prove to be quite accurate: they are based on readily available forest inventory data, thus extracting knowledge from the wealth of accumulated long-term observations usually carried out in forestry.

ID AQUACULTURE; SUSTAINABILITY
AB Resource use efficiency in Asian carp farming systems is analysed based on a survey of 2493 farms of nine countries. Multivariate classification of farms by intensity and diversity identified six farm types: four types of specialized aquaculture farms at different levels of intensity, and two types of integrated agriculture-aquaculture systems. Pond-based, specialized semi-extensive systems (using mainly inorganic fertilizers and feeds of off-farm origin), and integrated semi-intensive systems (using feeds and fertilizer of both on and off-farm origin) are by far the most common types, accounting for 59% and 27% of all farms respectively. Specialized semi-extensive systems also show the highest protein and nutrient (N and P) use efficiencies, and among the highest labour use efficiency. Super-intensive cage farms are less efficient in nutrient and labour use, but provide very high returns to land and capital investment. On average, the aquaculture components of integrated agriculture- aquaculture systems are less nutrient, land, and labour efficient than specialized semi-extensive systems. Integrated semi-extensive systems (using organic fertilizers of on-farm origin) are particularly inefficient across all indicators. Hence in practice, gains in overall resource use efficiency through on-farm integration with agricultural production are constrained by the relative inefficiency of the aquaculture subsystems on integrated farms. Although such systems can likely be improved, integration as such is not a panacea to increasing resource use efficiency. Wide variation in resource use efficiency within all systems indicates potential for substantial efficiency gains through improved management regardless of the fundamental choice of system.

AB The occurrence of linear alkylbenzene sulfonates (LAS) in a series of soil samples originating from the municipality of Roskilde has been studied. The study includes soil samples from eight different locations with different histories: a preserved natural area that has not been cultured for 50-100 years, a soil that has been ecologically cultured for 40 years, a soil sustainably manured in ecologically culture for 5 years (formerly conventionally cultured) and a soil that has been conventionally cultured using artificial fertilizer. In addition, a soil was studied that had been sludge amended by applying medium amounts of sludge as well as a soil that has been amended with high amounts of sludge for a 25-year period. In the latter case, the sludge amendment was abandoned 6 years before the first sampling, followed by the application of artificial fertilizers. Finally, a meadow in the run-off zone from a sludge storage area was included in the investigations. In addition to the soil samples, selected samples of the applied sludge and other fertilizers were analyzed for their possible content of LAS. Apart from the location where the soil had been heavily sludge-amended and the location situated in the run-off zone of the sludge storage, concentrations of LAS in all soil samples were found to be below approximately 1 mg/kg, which is well below the proposed preliminary soil quality criteria for LAS of 5 mg/kg. On the other hand, the study unambiguously disclosed that in the case of heavy sludge amendment, the proposed soil quality criteria might well be exceeded. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

ID HEALTH; ORGANIZATION
AB The World Health Organization is the leading International agency in health. WHO's reputation reached a peak In the 1970s with the then director-general Halfdan Mahler's advocacy of Health for All by the Year 2000 and the successful worldwide eradication of smallpox. The 1980s and 1990s saw WHO lose much of its authority. Too easily, the blame was put on one man-Mahler's successor, Hiroshi Nakajima. In 1998, Gro Harlem Brundtland, a former Prime Minister of Norway, took office and WHO began a period of major strategic and structural reform. Almost 4 years Into her first term as director-general, I visited WHO's headquarters In Geneva to learn about Dr Brundtland's successes and failures. The ground rules of my visit were that I could talk with anybody and attend almost any meeting (budget discussions were excluded). I interviewed Dr Brundtland, executive directors, members of the staff association, and directors and project managers of programmes such as StopTB, Roll Back Malaria, HIV-AIDS, violence prevention, polio eradication, essential drugs and medicines, and sustainable development. At senior levels, WHO is confident and clear about its purpose-in a way that matches Mahler's vision and goes beyond it in results. Brundtland told me that her most Important achievements were to have "strengthened the credibility of WHO" and to have "raised the awareness of health on to the political and global development agendas". But there is a troubling schism between the aspirations of Its leadership and the realities faced by the organisation on the ground. Rapid change during the past 4 years has reinvigorated WHO's mandate, but poor management has created new tensions that the organisation's leadership seems unwilling to address.

ID SUSTAINABLE COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE; STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT; VIEW;
   PERSPECTIVE; NETWORKS; EXCHANGE
AB The resource-based view of the firm is a useful approach in determining the internal. sources of competitive advantage. Nevertheless, managers need to note some caveats regarding this theory. Contrary to the guidance provided by the resource-based view, the values of certain resources and capabilities may actually be enhanced by seeking more rather than less competition, limiting rather than supporting functional successes, and destroying rather than protecting their exclusivity. We examine five situations in which certain processes may cause seemingly valuable resources and capabilities to lead instead to competitive disadvantages for firms as diverse as Hewlett-Packard, Food Lion, and AT&T. These trade-offs suggest that managers following the resource-based view as a guide may focus too narrowly on individual resources and capabilities, without adequately appreciating the interactions among multiple resources and capabilities and their interactions with the environment.

AB While evidence pointing to environmental, social-equity, and economic threats mounts, few U.S. firms have embraced the principles of sustainable development. This reticence is illustrated through an analysis of the adoption of ISO 14001, an international environmental-management system intended to advance the sustainable-development agenda in organizations. Interviewed managers said they resisted the standard because the benefits of ISO 14001 did not outweigh the costs and because in-house environmental systems served the same purpose. While part of this reticence can be attributed to the standard itself, it is also partly due to the nature of the issue of sustainable development. It is a societal issue to which most firms do not know how to respond. To bridge this divide, sustainable development must become more institutionalized in the regulations, norms, and mindsets of Americans. By translating the general principles of sustainable development into business practices, by developing better measures of sustainable development, and by empowering and engaging employees, firms are more likely to embrace sustainable development so that it permeates all organizational activities.

AB in spite of the great achievements gained in the national schistosomiasis control program during the last 5 decades, serious challenges for the control program exist due to the impact of biological factors, environmental facts and limitation of scientific technology, as well as shortages of socio-economic development in the endemic areas. This paper reviewed the experiences of the national control program, then the author considered it essential to put forward a newly sustainable strategy with an emphasis on the areas with high endemicity of schistosomiasis, on poverty-stricken areas, especially in the Western part of the People's Republic of China. when taking into account both the opportunities and challenges of the future. It is expected that the schistosomiasis control program with a sustainable strategy would promote local economic development in the People's Republic of China.

AB Decision support technologies and paradigms have their origins in management and information sciences but have been widely proposed as providing a basis for improving management for sustainability rural resource management. As such, they provide a means of helping managers to deal with increased information, increasingly complex decisions and to professionalise their activities. However, decision support has. in practice, had limited impact in many rural resource management contexts. Failures can be attributed to non-delivery, non-adoption and to unexpected negative impacts where they are adopted. This paper proposes a response to these challenges by reappraising the role of decision support and proposing a generic framework for the implementation of decision support as a broader initiative than the development of a decision support output, and one that aims to foster learning and co-learning.

AB This paper describes how the methodology of developmental work research, originating from cultural-historical activity theory, was applied in an intervention study of organic vegetable farming. Analysis of disturbances occurring in practice and of the developmental histories of two farms served as basis for modeling organic vegetable farming as an activity system. Contradictions within the activity system revealed that sustainable use of natural resources on the one hand and entrepreneurial integration into society on the other hand were the two major learning challenges faced by the farmers. Learning tools created and used in the study are the special focus of this paper. These are the models of an activity system, the zone of proximal development, strategies for increasing product volume and three orientations towards farm workers. The methodology offers means for problem definition in research and development projects, and enables the formation of non-deterministic directions of development for organic vegetable farms.

AB Efficient energy use by the agriculture sector is one of the conditions for sustainable agriculture because it allows financial savings, fossil resources preservation and air pollution decrease. We propose an Energy indicator (I-En) to evaluate environmental impacts due to energy consumption of arable farming systems to help farmers to manage their energy inputs at the field level according to the guidelines of integrated agriculture. I-En is based on the energetic analysis of four types of energy: two for indirect energy (pesticides and fertilisers) and two for direct energy (machinery and irrigation systems). In a second step, the assessed values of energy consumption are converted by means of an abacus into a mark between 0 and 10. I-En needs only data that are available on farms or easily assessed, and will be implemented with a set of seven other agro-ecological indicators to assess environmental sustainability of farms.

AB The ammonia losses under field conditions vary widely and these nitrogen losses can decrease crops yield. However, experiment with wheat in the Argentinean Pampas showed that yields are not related to the volatilization losses of several nitrogen fertilizers. We hypothesize that ammonia volatilization from urea was compensated with higher apparent soil mineralization rate and then, even with high ammonia volatilization from urea, wheat yields were not affected. We evaluated ammonia-volatilization, apparent nitrogen. mineralization, apparent nitrogen uptake efficiency, and their effects on wheat yields. The experiment was carried out with wheat grown in a no-till Typic Hapludoll, using urea, UAN and IBDU. Ammonia losses were 17.1% and 4% of N applied as urea and UAN, respectively; IBDU and control were low. Wheat Yields were not affected by ammonia losses. The N uptake and N export was greater in fertilized treatments. For urea, the highest volatilization rate was compensated by the highest soil mineralization rate. From the sustainable agriculture point of view, the volatilization would be dangerous because the soil could tend to compensate that loss, thus impoverishing itself in native nitrogen.

AB The design of sustainable N management strategies requires a better understanding of the processes influencing the ability of soils to supply N to a growing crop. Although commonly ignored, the release of C by plant roots may have a tremendous impact on soil organic matter turnover under certain soil conditions. The main objective of this study was to determine if living corn (Zea mays L.) roots would increase the N-supplying capacity of a soil with an enhanced mineralizable N pool. A rotation of corn-corn-soybean [Glycine mar (L.) Merr.]-wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) in combination with cover crops and the application of composted manure were used to increase the mineralizable N pool. The N-supplying capacity of bare soil and soils planted with corn and wheat was calculated, and changes in N and C pool sizes were determined by laboratory incubations. Living corn roots increased the inorganic N-supplying capacity of the conditioned soil by >50%. We suggest that this increase is caused by an increase in net N mineralization. This is supported by the considerable size reduction of the 70-d N pool in the soil planted with corn. No significant increase in the soil N-supplying capacity was observed when wheat was planted, indicating the possibility that this effect may vary dramatically among plant species. The contribution of corn and wheat root rhizodeposition to the active C pool and as energy source to enhance microbial activity and organic matter turnover is discussed.

TI Modifying DSSAT crop models for low-input agricultural systems using a
   soil organic matter-residue module from CENTURY

AB In low-input systems, where most nutrients become available from soil organic matter (SOM) and residue turnover, the applicability of DSSAT (Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer) crop simulation models is limited because (i) it recognizes only one type of SOM (i.e., humus) and recently added, but not yet humified, residue; (ii) it does not recognize a residue layer on top of the soil; (iii) newly formed humus is given a fixed ON ratio of 10; (iv) only one litter pool is recognized for N although three are recognized for C; (v) for residues with C/N ratios <25, the three litter pools for C decompose at a rate that is independent of the residue's N concentration; and (vi) SOM and residue flows are independent of soil texture. A SOM-residue module from the CENTURY model was incorporated in the DSSAT crop simulation models, and a residue layer was added on top of the soil. Modifications were also made in the senescence module of CROPGRO, a model within DSSAT, so that seneseed material is now added daily to the soil. Evaluation of the model, using a data set of 40 yr of bare fallow, showed an excellent fit [product moment correlation coefficient (r) of 0.983] between simulated and measured values for SOM-C. Soil N from decomposing SOM and residues was evaluated with data from a Brazilian experiment with seven leguminous residue types. By, incorporating the CENTURY SOM-residue module, DSSAT crop simulation models have become more suitable for simulating low-input systems and conducting long-term sustainability analyses.

TI Water pollution and degradation in Pearl River Delta, South China
SO AMBIO

DT Article
ID LOADS
AB The Pearl River Delta Economic Zone is the most dynamic economic area in South China. One of the major problems in the region is the sustainable utilization of the water resources. On the basis of analysis of the water environment status and pollution sources, it is suggested that domestic sewage is the primary cause of pollution. Two new concepts "degradation coefficient" and "degradation volume" of water resources, due to pollution, which may be used to assess macroscopically the carrying capacity of the water resources and sustainability of the water environment, are proposed by the authors. The results calculated indicate that the volumes of degraded water resources will be up to 204, 352, and 537 million m(3) in 2002, 2010, and 2020. It is suggested that water for daily consumption and domestic sewage must be controlled more effectively and there should be cross-regional coordination in tackling problems of water environment.

TI Avoiding conflicts over Africa's water resources
SO AMBIO
LA English
DT Article
AB Some 85% of Africa's water resources are comprised of large river basins that are shared between several countries. High rates of population growth accompanied by continued increases in the demand for water have resulted in several countries passing the point where the scarcity of water supplies effectively limits further development. Present population trends and patterns of water use suggest that more African countries will exceed the limits of their economically usable, land-based water resources before 2025. Normally, water allocation and distribution priorities within a country are aligned with national development objectives. While this may achieve national "water security" objectives, greater emphasis needs to be placed on regional efforts to ensure that the available water resources are used to derive sustainable long-term benefits for the peoples of Africa as a whole. Ideally, each country's water-resource management strategy needs to be aligned with that of its neighbors if peace and prosperity are to be maintained and conflict is to be avoided in the region.

AB Secondary forests regrowing on abandoned agricultural land constitute an important, albeit widely overlooked, component in the landscape matrix of tropical lowland America. These 'new' forest resources on private land-holdings derive either from unsustainable cattle-ranching practices of better-off farmers or are part of the crop/fallow system of resource-poor farmers. If previous land use was light, secondary forest management may offer an interesting use option to better-off farmers, providing that subsidies for stand improvement are given. Improved fallow systems using partly the successional vegetation may be a way to establish sustainable small-scale agriculture for resource-poor farmers. Given some technical and financial input, land-use systems based on secondary vegetation could play a vital role both in sustainable landscape management and biodiversity conservation.

ID ECOLOGICAL MODERNIZATION
AB In this introduction, the editors suggest a framework for the study of globalization and environmental governance, review important contemporary developments in supranational environmental governance, and introduce individual contributions to the special issue. Held, McGrew. Goldblatt, and Perraton's distinction between hyperglobalist, skeptical, and transformationalist perspectives on dynamics of globalization is useful in the study of the transformations in environmental governance around the world today. Three important innovations are examined: the development of supranational environmental institutions, increased use of market-based regulatory instruments, and the rise of global civil society involvement. Emergent transformations in global environmental governance are not inevitable, and neither are they sufficient for sustainability. Rather they are constantly threatened by the interests and actions of economic actors and constrained as well by politics, geography. and global inequality. Persistent efforts by, interested parties are required to retain salience, maintain momentum, and extend effectiveness of the new forms of environmental governance.

DT Article
AB Environmental policy development in 30 advanced and developing countries is examined using the capacity-building approach. Findings indicate that an appropriate mix of institutions is decisive for policy performance and that formal institutionalization is helpful for longer term policy-learning processes. Globalization is not found to be negative, as often claimed: Rather, the globalization of environmental policies and proponents counteracts ecologically ignorant economic interests and fosters diffusion a environmental innovations. Assistance from international organizations and regimes plays an increasingly critical role. Environmental and politico-administrative reforms appear to be mutually supportive. Democratic structures and institutions are a basic precondition for effective environmental policies. Although many countries have been able to achieve environmental gains from new technologies, policies, and forms of stakeholder cooperation. even the most advanced need to strongly increase environmental policy and management capacities to meet the continuing challenge of sustainable development.

AB This article challenges certain tenets of the theories of reflexive law and ecological modernization. Although farsighted prevention-oriented and structural changes are needed, some proponents of these theories argue that the very industries and firms that create environmental problems can through continuous institutional learning, the application of life-cycle analysis, dialogue and networks with stakeholders, and implementation of "environmental management systems" be transformed into sustainable industries and firms. Although useful, these reforms are insufficient. It is not marginal or incremental changes that are needed for sustainability but rather major product, process, and system transformations-often beyond the capacity of the dominant industries and firms. This article also questions the alleged failure of regulation to stimulate needed technological changes and identifies the conditions under which innovation for sustainability can occur Finally, it discusses differences in needed policies for industrialized and developing countries.

TI Identifying cost management strategies in dialysis clinics: Sustainable
   savings with positive outcomes

AB Objectives: To examine whether cost management strategies are used in a revenue-constrained environment without compromising clinical effectiveness.
   Study Design: Cross-sectional analysis of monthly cost and acuity-adjusted hospitalization data.
   Methods: This research included longitudinal regression analyses involving 10 years of data, 1990 through 1999, from each of 6 dialysis centers. Two sets of regression models were used: one set examined cost interactions and cost trends (P less than or equal to .001); the second set examined clinical outcomes (P less than or equal to .001). Four cost management strategies were examined: (I) selective reductions in targeted cost categories, (2) cost reductions through improved efficiencies, (3) cost avoidance by shifting responsibilities to external parties, and (4) uniform reductions across all cost categories.
   Results: Managers appeared to have limited opportunity to selectively or uniformly reduce costs because of cost "stickiness" and minimal resource substitutability. Improvements in operational efficiencies and cost shifting to external parties occurred. Over time, however, realized efficiencies increased at a decreasing rate, whereas cost shifting actually declined. Contrary to prior hospital studies, these results indicate significant economies of scale. No statistical correlation was found to indicate that the physician/clinic management teams' use of cost reduction strategies affected acuity-adjusted hospitalizations of dialysis patients.
   Conclusions: Strategic models that include both financial and outcomes data can enable healthcare managers to predict both positive and negative results of cost management proposals. These models can help identify aspects of an organization's cost structure that affect sustainable cost savings: cost stickiness, cost substitutability, institutional experience, realized operational improvements, and economies of scale.

AB The response of Larrea divaricata and L. cuneifolia to cutting stems 0-20 cm above the ground was studied in the and piedmont area west of Mendoza. Argentina. The species, occur at different elevations and in vegetation zones: L. cuneifolia < 1250 m. L. divaricata between 1250 and 2500 m. Four treatments with 10 replicates were analysed in randomly chosen plants: cut at ground level with lopping shears: cut at ground level with a pick: cut at 10 cm with lopping shears: arid cut at 20 cm with lopping shears. The initial and final height, volume. and dry matter (above- and below-ground) were determined. The relation between volume and initial and final dry matter and height was analysed through a factorial MANOVA (p < 0.05). and the functional relation between volume, dry matter arid height was estimated by adjusting a regression model. In both species. maximum recovery was reached when cut with shears, and predicted recover,,, (turnover) was 17-18 yr. In the two last treatments height was a useful predictor of dry matter. L. divaricata-dominated plots have a lower biomass. growth rate, and allocation to stems and root than L. cuneifolia-dominated plots. Regrowth following clipping on an area of 3-10 ha, is sufficient to support the annual needs (cooking and heating) of one family.

AB 1. This study is the first attempt using Levins's Theory (loop analysis) in order to develop a sustainable management for the scallop. Argopecten purparatus, fishery in Peru during El Nino-Southern Oscillation events (ENSO) and upwelling conditions. Based on this theoretical framework, it was possible to estimate the local stability for each of these model systems and to follow the qualitative changes of the variables in response to external factors:
   2. Based on our results, we suggest the following management policies to be implemented: (1) during ENSO events the size at the first capture of the scallops should be >70 mm and (2) the increase in the number of fishermen during ENSO events must be prevented. Both measures increase the sustainability of fishery under ENSO and upwelling conditions. The ecological models predict that during ENSO and upwelling events, any management strategy to increase the recruitment of the scallop would not have a positive impact on the adult stock.
   3. Finally, we suggest that more efforts must be focused on the development of extended ecosocial models, which incorporate further social and economic variables, increasing realism of the abstractions for this fishery activity. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

AB The species of Prosopis (Leguminosae) are well adapted to grow in the arid regions of the world. In Mexico, nearly 70% of its territory accounts for arid lands and nine species of this genus are found in the country which are currently utilized for multiple purposes. Given that a sustainable exploitation of this important natural resource is necessary, knowledge of the genetic variability of natural populations is required. The genetic variation among and within four wild populations of Prosopis glandulosa, P. juliflora, and two of P. laevigata, located in the Mexican States of Chihuahua (1), Sinaloa (2), Guanajuato (3) and Hidalgo (4), respectively, was determined using random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPDs). There was a genetic variation of 72.48% among these four populations, and within them the estimated genetic variation was 27.52%. Between the populations of P. laevigata the genetic variation obtained was 7.15%, and within them 92.85% (AMOVA, P < 0.001). Based on the assumption of Wright's island model, the genetic variation found among populations corresponds to a gene flow (N(e)m) of 0.09, while the gene flow detected between the populations of P. laevigata was 3.2. A total of 27 RAPD phenotypes were identified in the four populations; among them, 11 corresponded to P. laevigata. The phylogenetic analyses showed that the three species are differentiated in three clades and that probably P. juliflora was the origin of the other two species. The protogynous trait of their flowers and the outcrossing are the main factors that may explain the genetic variation observed in these populations.

AB We evaluated the temporal variation of microbial biomass C, beta-glucosidase, acid phosphomonoesterase (acP), alkaline phosphomonoesterase (alP), and protease activity over 18 consecutive months. The likely causes for the seasonal variability at a non-degraded and a degraded site in south-western Nigeria were identified. Microbial biomass, alP, and beta-glucosidase activity were sensitive indicators of soil quality changes over time. Microbial biomass C correlated significantly with soil moisture conditions and soil organic matter-related parameters. AlP and beta-glucosidase activities were not controlled by climatic conditions over the course of two rainy seasons and one dry season but were temporally related to microbial biomass C and total C and N. Due to the steadiness of the alP activity over time the enzyme is considered a suitable indicator with which to monitor long-term changes of soil quality. Single sampling during the course of a year is adequate. Both microbial biomass and beta-glucosidase activity fluctuated highly. They were sensitive indicators to monitor short-term variations of soil quality with. Sampling for microbial biomass ought to be limited to the rainy seasons, whereas the measurement of beta-glucosidase activity need not be restricted seasonally. Due to the short-term variability found, sampling should be repeated. AcP and protease activity fluctuated highly during the course of a year and exhibited pronounced inter-seasonal differences. The marked seasonal changes could not be ascribed to soil moisture conditions and only poorly to major ecological C soil processes. This was more pronounced for acP than for protease. Hence, neither parameter was considered a sensitive and meaningful indicator of soil quality changes over time.

AB Selected physico-chemical and chemical characteristics of 13 coconut coir dust (mesocarp pithy tissue plus short-length fibres) samples from Asia, America and Africa were evaluated as peat alternatives. All properties studied differed significantly between and within sources, and from the control Sphagnum peat. pH of coir dust was slightly acidic, whereas salinity varied dramatically between 39 and 597 mS m(-1) in the saturated media extract. The cation exchange capacity and carbon/nitrogen (C/N) ratio ranged from 31.7 to 95.4 cmol(c) kg(-1) and from 75 to 186, respectively. Most carbon was found as lignin and cellulose. The concentrations of available nitrogen, calcium, magnesium and micro-elements were low, while those of phosphorus and potassium were remarkably high (0.28-2.81 mol m(-3) and 2.97-52.66 mol m(-3) for P and K, respectively). Saline ion concentrations, especially chloride and sodium, were also high. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The development of a model of interdependence between investment in construction and gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, based on a long-term trend, for the developing countries of Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is presented. The study follows previous research undertaken by others who have investigated the relationship between investment in construction and economic development and found a positive correlation between the share of construction in GDP and the level of national income. The hypothesis tested is: there is a minimum level of investment in construction in developing countries (measured in terms of construction value added [CVA] as a percentage of GDP) to achieve sustainable growth in the economy. The study is based on data acquired on 15 of the countries in SSA over 22 years and the sample is split into two groups: one in which GDP per capita is rising, the other in which GDP per capita is falling. This research puts forward evidence that there is a critical level of CVA/GDP (at 4-5%) below which a relative decrease in construction volume corresponds directly to a decreasing growth in GDP per capita. The converse does not appear to be true. Implications and recommendations for public policy for the concerned countries are discussed.

AB Based on the evidence of a close link between the process of economic growth and the supply of infrastructure, the paper explores the state of the infrastructure system in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) with particular focus on the underlying problems militating against the development of a sustainable infrastructure in the region. The persistence of poverty in the SSA region - reflected in terms of limited access to potable water, decent shelter and adequate health, education and communication services - is argued to be as much a cause as a consequence of the absence of sustainable infrastructure facilities. The paper concludes by specifying the need for policy to address financing and investment options for infrastructure development, and by specifying strategies for capacity building in construction engineering and management based on technology transfer and the effective utilization of local resources.

   countries; joint ventures; innovation; public policy; technology
   exchange; Technology Transfer; Hong Kong
AB Effective transfers of core knowledge and essential skills from one region/country/organization to another are often advocated to accelerate long-term development. However, the successful transfers of technologies in general and construction technology in particular have often been restricted by various barriers. A common problem is that the 'transferor' will not devote special resources to effecting sustainable (rather than superficial) 'transfers' if only the 'transferee' is perceived to benefit from such Technology Transfers. However, a broader conceptualization of technology incorporates multiple dimensions/components of 'knowledge' and skills, including 'cultural', linguistic, logistic and 'networking' capacities. This broadened concept could convince both parties of mutual benefits to be derived through an 'exchange' of strengths in different components of such technologies. The paper is based on a survey of international literature on these issues, structured interviews and responses to a questionnaire issued to a cross-section of practitioners in Hong Kong. The foregoing paradox of Technology Transfers and the proposed paradigm of 'technology exchange' are discussed in terms of the construction industry. Construction Joint Ventures that have proliferated in many countries including Hong Kong are seen to be a suitable vehicle for facilitating such technology exchange. Appropriate policies and incentives at macro( governmental), meso- (organizational) and micro- (project) levels are needed to empower and propel this process as part of an integrated strategy for the long-term development of construction organizations and industries.

AB Soil organic carbon (C) is an important component of forest carbon pools and should be taken into account in sustainable forest management. However, there is a need to derive indicators for this attribute, as organic C content (Mgha(-1)) in forest soils is generally not available in Quebec survey data. Thus, we developed models to predict organic C accumulation in the forest floor and in mineral soils of upland forest soils (i.e., with forest floor thickness less than or equal to30 cm) using soil survey data as input variables. The best-fit model for predicting forest floor organic C content consisted of the explanatory variables forest floor thickness, latitude, and longitude. The model R(2) was 0.76, and its CV was 28%. The second best-fit model, excluding geographical coordinates, included forest floor thickness and mean growing season precipitation as explanatory variables (R(2) = 0.71, CV = 29.5%). The model for predicting mineral soil organic C content was composed of two submodels: (i) organic C concentration of a mineral horizon as a function of its colour and (ii) bulk density of that horizon as a function of its estimated C concentration (obtained from the former model). The R(2) of the model for predicting organic C content in mineral soils was 0.57, and its CV was 29%. The models were used to predict organic C contents in 5547 pedons, dispersed throughout the commercial forest of Quebec and for which basic soil profile description data were available. It was then possible to evaluate and compare mean soil C accumulation in different forest stand types and to construct two maps of soil organic C accumulation in upland forest soils of southern Quebec. The results pointed out that forest floor thickness combined with mineral soil horizon colour, texture class, and pH would be useful sustainable forest management indicators of organic C accumulation in upland forest soils.

TI Phosphorus in wastewaters: is there a potential for recovery as calcium
   phosphate?
SO CHIMICA OGGI-CHEMISTRY TODAY
LA English
DT Article
ID REMOVAL
AB The removal of phosphorus from wastewaters is a current necessity, in order to meet water quality targets, and avoid environmental problems related to eutrophication. Agricultural application of phosphorus-rich sewage biosolids is becoming unpopular, and, as a result, the final destination for wastewater phosphorus is often the landfill. Recycling of this phosphorus is the sustainable alternative,for a society that increasingly needs to manage its resources. This, however, can only be achieved if scientific and technical issues are resolved. A range of phosphate phases can be made to precipitate from wastewaters. Of all the possibilities, calcium phosphates represent the most desirable,for industrial recycling, and at the same time, the most technically challenging alternative. This article discusses current knowledge and proposes directions for future research.

AB Recent analyses continue to modify our understanding of terrestrial carbon sinks. The sinks are large and variable enough to account for much of the variability in the growth rate of atmospheric CO2. They are distributed throughout both northern mid-latitudes and the tropics. Identification of the factors influencing an observed sink is extremely difficult; methods for attribution are reviewed. Although various ecological mechanisms (e.g. CO2 fertilization, nitrogen deposition, climatic variability) have been shown experimentally to have short-term effects on physiological processes controlling the amount of carbon in terrestrial ecosystems, it is unclear which of these mechanisms has been most important in the past 10-100 years and which will be most important in the future. The decades-long supposition that CO2 fertilization has been a major driver of terrestrial carbon uptake is being challenged. A major portion of the sink in the northern mid-latitudes (although probably not in the tropics) is a result of recovery from past changes in land use and management. To the extent that these direct human actions explain most of the current (and future) sink, attribution and thus accounting become more tractable, but the continued functioning of the sink is limited and largely dependent on deliberate actions (e.g. afforestation, sustainable forest management and preservation).

AB Major requirements for operationalization of the concept of sustainable development in urban transportation infrastructure operations management are presented. In addition, it is shown that the current approach to management is incompatible with the requirements for sustainable urban development. Consequently, the conceptual framework of a desirable approach is proposed. The philosophy of this approach is that the basic mission of infrastructure operations management is to obtain and maintain the maximum levels of people and goods mobility possible within the resources and environmental capacities in an area. A mathematical model is presented for obtaining the desirable levels and characteristics of traffic on each segment of an urban transportation network. In addition, three illustrative applications of the implemented model are presented.

SO COMPUTER-AIDED CIVIL AND INFRASTRUCTURE ENGINEERING
LA English
DT Article
ID FUZZY
AB A multicriteria model is developed for analyzing the planning strategies for reducing the future social and economic costs in the area with potential natural hazard. The developed multicriteria decision-making procedure consists of generating alternatives, establishing criteria, assessment of criteria weights, and application of the compromise ranking method (VIKOR). The alternatives are the scenarios of sustainable hazard effects mitigation, generated in the form of comprehensive reconstruction plans, including the redevelopment of urban areas and infrastructures, multipurpose land use, and restrictions on building in hazardous areas. The plans have to be evaluated according to the criteria representing public safety, sustainability, social environment, natural environment, economy, culture, and politics. The multicriteria model can treat all relevant conflicting effects and impacts in their representative units. The evaluation of alternatives is implicated with imprecision (or uncertainty) of established criteria, and the fuzzy multicriteria model is developed to deal with "qualitative" (unquantifiable or linguistic) or incomplete information. The application of this model is illustrated with the post-earthquake reconstruction problem in Central Taiwan, including the restoration concerning the safe and serviceable operation of "lifeline" systems, such as electricity, water and transportation networks, immediately after a severe earthquake.

AB This paper empirically analyzes the socioeconomic energy metabolism of Austria in the period 1830-1995. During this period Austria underwent a transition from being a largely agricultural society to being an industrial society. We describe the changes associated with this transition in terms of the 'physical economy,' or more precisely, in terms of changes in the throughput of energy, assessed in physical units (J per year). In accordance with currently used methods of material flow accounting (NIFA), we define the indicators 'direct input' and 'domestic consumption' with respect to socioeconomic energy flows. Using these indicators, we analyze the transition from 1830, at which time biomass provided more than 99% of Austria's domestic energy consumption (DEC), to 1995, when biomass accounted for 30% and fossil energy for 60% of DEC. Total DEC in Austria increased by a factor of 6 in this period. The paper discusses the relevance of these changes for processes of interaction between society and its natural environment, focusing on the interrelations between energy metabolism and changes in land use.

AB In western Europe, Finland is a country that has most recently cut down its large old-growth forests. In the 18th century, nearly one-third of the forests in the southern half of the country were real old-growth forests (> 200 years). In northern Finland, the proportion was almost half of the forested area. At present, the percentage of old-growth forests in the southern half is a mere 0.1 and in the northern half still a good 10. It is estimated that only 2% of the original old-growth forests now remain in the temperate regions of Finland, which are abundant with animal and plant species.
   Most of the profound changes in forests are attributable to human activities. In the severe Finnish climate, the utilisation of timber has been a necessity, and population growth further increased the demand for timber used for heating and other domestic purposes. Clearing fields for cultivation also reduced the forested areas, while the rise of industry also consumed increasing amounts of timber.
   Concurrently, since there were also factors that supported the growth of the standing timber stock, it is not self-evident that the timber volume was in constant decline. First, after the Little Ice Age (1550-1850) the average annual temperature has risen and the annual growth period has lengthened. Both of these features have stimulated the growth of trees. Second, the use of timber in industry and space heating has continued to become more efficient and economical. Third, a significant feature in the changes in space heating is that firewood has to a great extent been replaced by other energy sources. Consequently, the demand for timber in the Finnish economy has not increased steadily-at least not parallel to GDP.
   While the felling of timber decisively increased in the 19th century, more attention was paid to forestry in order to guarantee sustainability. Both the governmental forest policy and the actions of private landowners aimed to increase the growth of the standing timber stock. However, it took many years before forestry achieved tangible results in promoting growth. Only in the late 20th century was there unanimous agreement that the standing timber stock has been increasing, and even today, researchers do not agree on the situation before the 1950s.
   This paper focuses on examining the relationship between the consumption of timber and the growth of standing timber stock. The key research question is whether, during the past two centuries, Finland ever overused its forests to the extent that the annual felling exceeded the annual growth of timber.

AB This paper makes the case that if ecological economics seeks 'consilience' with biology it must acquaint itself with evolutionary theories about social development and human behaviour. The author reviews some of the literature in this area. Particular attention is paid to the newly emerging discipline of evolutionary psychology, which sets out a neo-Darwinian view of human nature in which individual and social behaviour is dominated by the evolutionary strategies of the 'selfish gene'. The paper discusses the relevance of this perspective for two specific 'problem areas' in ecological economics. The first of these is the question of consumption and consumer behaviour. The second is the problem of 'mismatch' between the pursuit of economic growth and social well-being or contentment. These examples illustrate that evolutionary psychology may sometimes provide a natural ally for ecological economics, in particular pointing up certain failures of conventional economics. On the other hand, it also offers harsh lessons concerning the difficulty of changing evolved behaviour patterns. The paper suggests three possible avenues of response by ecological economists to the insights of evolutionary psychology. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Indians of the Northwest Coast of North America had cultural continuity for at least two millennia before contact with people from the old world. This archeological fact suggests that their societies had achieved sustainability and resilience in relationships to their ecosystems and the salmon runs. The governance principles used by Northwest Indians in managing fisheries and other resources provided resilience. In addition to a land ethic, these principles included exchange systems based on public reciprocity. Property rights were clear and trespass was a capital offense. Chiefs and titleholders had to be generous facilitators. Leadership authority over land was contingent upon adherence to ethical and generous behavior as well as good management. These indigenous institutions were quite different from the rules currently governing the management of most ecosystems. In critiquing current institutions, many ideas similar to those in the indigenous systems have been proposed in isolation; the example described in this paper suggests the importance of combining them.

TI Scale and topology in the ecological economics sustainability paradigm
SO ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS

DT Article
DE sustainability; scale; spatio-temporal; topology
ID ALLOCATION; EFFICIENT
AB An ecologically sustainable scale of the economic system requires inclusion of spatial-temporal dimensions and topological relationships. While Herman E. Daly and Marcus Stewen have deliberated some of the issues surrounding economic scale in their papers ("Allocation, distribution and scale: Towards an economics that is efficient, just and sustainable" [Ecol. Econ. 6 (1992) 185], "The interdependence of allocation, distribution, scale and stability-A comment on Herman E. Daly's vision of an economics that is efficient, just and sustainable" [Ecol. Econ. 27 (1998) 119] and letters to the editor [Ecol. Econ. 30 (1999) 1], [Ecol. Econ. 30 (1999) 2], they do not address spatio-temporal constraints on ecological processes. Although Daly frames the scale of the economy based on sustainable throughput of resources relative to the environment, the pragmatic approach to defining this sustainable scale must incorporate other dimensions of scale. While Daly [Ecol. Econ. 6 (1992) 185], [Ecol. Econ. 30 (1999) 1] correctly promotes a logical sequence of policy instruments, scale should indeed elicit dependence from allocation and distribution decisions. Stewen's [Ecol. Econ. 27 (1998) 119], [Ecol. Econ. 30 (1999) 2] arguments included that these instruments have co-evolutionary interdependencies, but such arguments do not guarantee economic nor ecological sustainability. A more useful definition of sustainable economic scale includes spatial and temporal dimensions, scale constraints and topological relationships as they are framed by ecological components and processes. The spatial scale of the global economy is large, but temporally the global economy is diminutive: two characteristics that typically define catastrophic events in ecological parlance. Using a spatio-temporal framework, Daly's boat analogy can be extended to real-world linkages and possible solutions through supplementing the current view of economic scale with spatio-temporal distance and topology.

AB Non-timber forest product (NTFP) extraction is a popular alternative to timber extraction that figures prominently in efforts to utilize tropical forests sustainably. But the ability to conserve biodiversity through NTFP management, particularly in extractive reserves in Amazonia, has remained untested. We found that intensive management of Euterpe oleracea (Palmae) fruit, one of the most important extractive products in the Amazon, has substantial impacts on biodiversity, whereas moderate management does not. We mimicked traditional levels of fruit harvest in a replicated experiment over one fruiting season. High-intensity harvest (75% of fruits removed) reduced avian frugivore species diversity by 22%. Low-intensity harvest (40% of fruits removed), however, had no effect on diversity. On a larger scale, we found that forests with enriched densities of E. oleracea supported more fruit-eating birds but fewer non fruit-eating birds than non-enriched forests. Taken together, these results suggest that intensive NTFP management to meet market demands may trigger substantial ecological impacts, at least at the level of our study. E. oleracea harvest should be limited where conservation of biodiversity is a goal.

AB Backus, Kehoe, and Kydland (1992), Baxter and Crucini (1995), and Stockman and Tesar (1995) find two major discrepancies between standard international business cycle models with complete markets and the data: In the models, cross-country correlations are much higher for consumption than for output, while in the data the opposite is true; and cross-country correlations of employment and investment are negative, while in the data they are positive, This paper introduces a friction into a standard model that helps resolve these anomalies. The friction is that international loans are imperfectly enforceable; any country can renege on its debts and suffer the consequences for future borrowing. To solve for equilibrium in this economy with endogenous incomplete markets, the methods of Marcet and Marimon (1999) are extended. Incorporating the friction helps resolve the anomalies more than does exogenously restricting the assets that can be traded.

TI Enhancing sustainable development by triple value core business adding
   to the of government
SO ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT QUARTERLY
LA English
DT Article
AB Much of the debate on sustainable development is focused on improvements to production and development practices. However, government decision-making processes can have a significant influence over sustainable development outcomes. Many decision-making processes used to resolve sustainable development issues result in compromised or lowest-common-denominator outcomes. This article argues the need for a more diversified approach to sustainable development by using decision-making processes involving government projects and programs to add value to economic, social, and natural capital. The article introduces the concept of triple value adding to the core business activities of government. Triple value adding involves applying new approaches to improve the planning, designing, and packaging of public projects and service programs to increase their economic, environmental, and social capital multiplier effects and thereby achieve more sustainable development outcomes. This article suggests some practical measures to embed sustainability into the core business of public agencies.

DT Article

ID POWER-GENERATION; EMISSIONS; CONSUMPTION; TURKIYE; FUTURE
AB This paper deals with policies to meet the increasing energy demand for electricity and domestic heating in Turkey, Air pollutant emissions due to power generation and their harmful effects on the environment are also presented. We also argue in favor of small scale dams for sustainable development. Turkey has a total gross hydropower potential of 433 GW, but only 125 GW of the total hydroelectric potential of Turkey can be economically used. By commissioning of new hydropower plants (HPPs), which are under 10 construction, 36% of the economically usable potential of the country would be tapped. On the other hand, biomass (wood and wastes) energy is the second important renewable energy source for Turkey. In 1998, the biomass share of the total energy consumption of the country was 10%. In this study, the potential of important biomass energy sources and animal solid wastes of the country were determined. The effects of hydropower and biomass usage on the environment were also discussed. Considering the total cereal products and fatty seed plants, approximately 50-60 million tons per year of biomass and 8-10 million tons of solid matter animal waste are produced. and 70% of the total biomass is seen as possible to use for energy. Some useful suggestions and recommendations are also presented. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Green national accounting: the case of Chile's mining sector
SO ENVIRONMENT AND DEVELOPMENT ECONOMICS
LA English
DT Article
ID NATURAL-RESOURCES; SUSTAINABILITY; INDICATOR; PRODUCT
AB This article uses the welfare foundations for the usual net domestic product (NDP) income measure of the traditional National Accounts System (NAS) provided by Weitzman (1976, 2000), and the propositions of Hartwick (1993) and Hamilton (1994a) to correct this measure in order to obtain a green (sustainable) measure of economic income. It estimates green measures of the economic income of Chile's mining sector for the period 1977-1996. Different methodologies regarding the valuation of mining resources are employed, and exploration expenditures in the mining sector are included to empirically estimate the green measures of income. The results clearly show that the usual income measures of the traditional NAS overestimated the economic income generated by the Chilean mining sector during the period by 20-40 per cent, and its rate of growth by 3-20 per cent. Moreover, this overestimation has increased in recent years. These empirical results are remarkably similar when different methodologies are used to calculate green measures of the mining sector's economic income. The empirical evidence produced in this work, together with the one provided by other studies, leads to the conclusion that Chile's outstanding recent economic growth has not delivered the amount of economic income recorded by its NAS, since a significant part of it corresponded to depreciation of the country's natural capital.

DE demand and supply; forest conservation; forest dynamics; impulse
   response analysis; land tenure; sustainable forest management
ID TIMBER
AB This paper examines the dynamic effects of forest conservation measures. Both short-term and long-term impacts on timber markets are studied using a Finnish example. Forest conservation is interpreted as an exogenous negative shock in the standing timber growth owned by private forest owners, and its effects are retrieved through an impulse response analysis based on a dynamic demand-supply and timber stock model. The results show that timber markets are influenced by forest conservation. The conservation of forest assets reduces traded quantities and increases timber prices. These effects are of the same relative magnitude, thus leaving the annual timber-selling income of private forest owners unchanged. The results suggest that some of the negative short-run impacts of conservation on commercial timber stock will be compensated in the long run by intensified use of the remaining stock. This may to some extent reduce the ecological usefulness of the conservation policies. While the timber markets converge in the long run towards a new post-conservation state the short-term interruptions suggest that caution should be used in establishing set-asides in privately owned forestland.

SO ENVIRONMENT AND DEVELOPMENT ECONOMICS

DT Article
AB The article describes and quantifies the financial benefits of small-scale community forestry, conducted on an ecologically sustainable basis-'eco-forestry', by customary landowners in Papua New Guinea. Through economic modelling the article also attempts to quantify the global benefits generated. Eco-forestry is subsidized by donors directly and through NGOs in its setting up and certification. Financial modelling suggests that, with a subsidy, eco-forestry is capable of generating a return to landowners that is comparable to industrial logging. While the return to logging followed by conversion to agriculture is much more attractive than eco-forestry, agriculture is an option available only in some locations. Economic modelling finds that the external economic benefits emanating from tropical forest conservation that replaces logging in Papua New Guinea are far greater in scale than the financial benefits to landowners. However, the lack of reliable data on the environmental benefits of forest conservation means that economic analysis is somewhat inconclusive. The need for further research to quantify environmental benefits is thus highlighted. The subsidization of forest conservation directly, instead of indirectly through small-scale forestry, is investigated and found to generate a similar level of economic benefits to eco-forestry. However, the cost of direct subsidization is greater. Moreover, mechanisms for direct subsidy are undeveloped in Papua New Guinea. Donors may prefer to continue to subsidize small-scale forestry where it replaces logging because of its apparent conservation and side benefits and because it is operational, while at the same time exploring and extending cost-effective models of direct conservation that have the advantage over eco-forestry of being applicable in more remote areas. Compared with industrial logging, eco-forestry contributes little to consolidated revenue. Therefore it is to be expected that eco-forestry will meet government resistance if it makes significant inroads into the allocation of logging concessions.

AB There is a growing realisation that agriculture is a central mechanism for delivering sustainable rural development in Europe. However, agro-industrial and postproductivist logics and dynamics have largely tended to marginalise its significance. In this paper we explore some of the conceptual parameters needed to develop the rural development dynamic. This is one which recentralises agriculture and farm-based activities and provides a basis for countering the growing crisis in rural and agricultural policymaking. In order to further embed the rural development dynamic, however, new alliances need to be attached to the struggles that are currently underway in rural areas. This will involve the state and social scientists playing a greater constructive role in developing the social infrastructure around which current exemplars of agrarian-based rural development can become more mainstream.

AB In developing countries, large dam projects continue to be launched, primarily to secure a time-stable freshwater supply and to generate hydropower. Meanwhile, calls for environmentally sustainable development put pressure on the dam-building industry to integrate ecological concerns in project planning and decision-making. Such integration requires environmental impact statements (EISs) that can communicate the societal implications of the ecological effects in terms that are understandable and useful to planners and decision-makers.
   The purpose of this study is to develop a basic framework for assessing the societal implications of the river ecological effects expected of a proposed large dam project. The aim is to facilitate a comparison of desired and potential undesired effects on-site and downstream. The study involves two main tasks: to identify key river goods and services that a river system may provide, and to analyze how the implementation of a large dam project may alter the on-site capacity and downstream potentials to derive river goods and services from the river system.
   Three river goods and six river services are identified. River goods are defined as extractable partly man-made products and river services as naturally sustained processes. By four main types of flow manipulations, a large dam project improves the on-site capacity to derive desired river goods, but simultaneously threatens the provision of desirable river goods and services downstream. However, by adjusting the site, design, and operational schedule of the proposed dam project, undesirable effects on river goods and services can be minimized.

ID EROSION
AB Appropriate land management decisions are important for current and future use of the land to ensure its sustainability. This requires that land management units (LMUs) be specified to enable the identification of specific parameters employed in decision making processes. This paper presents the development of a conceptual model, within geographic information systems (GIS), for defining and assessing LMUs from available biophysical information. The model consists of two main components (sub-models): land quality-based suitability analysis and soil erosion estimation. Using a fuzzy set methodology, the first sub-model was constructed to derive a land suitability index (LSI) for a cropping land utilization type. The LSI thus highlights the suitability grades of every pixel in the study area on a continuous basis. A sub-model of soil erosion was established based on the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) utilising the same spatial data bases employed for structuring the LSI. Using a soil loss tolerance principle, a fuzzy membership function of average annual soil loss (called soil loss index, SLI) was established, leading to compatibility between LSI and SLI for data integration. LMUs were then derived from various combinations of LSI and SLI. The methodology developed shows the significance of the model for refining available land suitability evaluation systems, which take no account of expected land degradation (from erosion) due to a nominated land use. It also provides a valuable guideline for cost-effective GIS applications in the identification and assessment of homogeneous land units, using available spatial information sets, at a finer scale.

AB The prevailing corporate trend regarding development of energy resources in the tropics emphasizes financial gain over long-term societal benefits. Some corporations are beginning to find a competitive advantage linked to proactive relations with host communities and adequate protection of fragile ecosystems. Herein, we describe a case study where an international energy production company worked with stakeholders to achieve social capital and sustainable development. The strategies aimed to strengthen local capacity to improve social welfare and to ensure conservation and wise use of biodiversity. We provide examples, discuss lessons learned and make recommendations for future development projects.

AB Phenological transects were employed to assess monthly leaf, flower, unripe fruit and ripe fruit abundance for a total of 1732 individual plants within five tropical forest habitats at the 'Lago Caiman Research Camp', Noel Kempff Mercado National Park, northeastern Santa Cruz Department, Bolivia. Fruit surveys along trails were conducted concomitantly to assess fruit availability for the resident terrestrial frugivore community. The results of the two methodologies are compared and discussed with respect to wildlife and forest management in the region. Phenological transects revealed that Cerrado forest. tall forest, low vine forest. Sartenejal (swamp) forest, and pied mont (premontane) forest, showed seasonal variations in flower, unripe fruit and ripe fruit abundance. however, the broad temporal patterns were significantly different across habitats. Seasonal variation in overall foliage abundance was only marked for Cerrado forest. Ripe fruit production within the study site was not significantly different across months, with different habitats peaking asynchronously in abundance. From a frugivory perspective, overall ripe fleshy fruit abundance also varied considerably between habitats, and again showed asynchronous peaks in habitat production. However, both methodologies revealed the early dry season (June-July) as a period of ripe fleshy fruit scarcity throughout the study area. This period represents a resource 'bottleneck' for the resident frugivore community and phenological results allowed the identification of a number of keystone fruit resources for the region. Furthermore, fruit resources which are super-abundant in the early-mid wet season (November-February) might also be considered keystone resources for the region, given that they axe available in an otherwise fruit scarce forest. The dynamic spatial patterning of fruit availability at Lago Caiman suggests that certain habitats might be considered keystone habitats, since they provide the majority of fruit resources on a seasonal basis. Finally, the potential of phenological information in tropical forest management plans is discussed and underlined by the observation that rainfall in itself fails to predict fruit availability in the dominant habitats at Lago Caiman.

AB Invasive alien plants are consumptive water-users. and may have reduced river flows in South Africa by about 6.7% according to a broad-scale study. An effective programme to bring the invasions under control would cost about US$ 92 million per year for the next 20 years. This paper reports on studies of four representative catchments (the Sonderend, Keurbooms. Upper Wilge and Sabie-Sand) to assess the impacts and costs of invasions at a scale that is more relevant to managers. Several alien plant species have invaded the catchments. Non-riverine invasions are mainly Pinus and Hakea species in Sonderend and Keurbooms, eucalypts in the Upper Wilge, and pines and scramblers (e.g. Lantana camara) in the Sabie-Sand catchment. Riverine invasions are dominated by Acacia mearnsii and, to a lesser extent, A. dealbata, except in the Sabie-Sand and the lower Sonderend River where Eucalyptus species are important. About 44% of the Sonderend, 54% of the Keurbooms, 2% of the Upper Wilge and 23% of the Sabie-Sand catchments has been invaded to some degree. The corresponding reductions in the natural river flows attributed to these invasions are about 7.2, 22.1, 6.0 and 9.4%. If the invasions are not controlled they could potentially spread. and occupy 5 1, 77, 70%c, respectively, of the first three catchments. At an annual expansion rate of 10-15% this would take about 13, 26 and 63 years, respectively, The invadable areas in the Sabie-Sand catchment are already invaded so invasions will only increase in density. It would take about 26-30 years to reach 100% canopy cover. The projected flow reductions for the four catchments would increase to 41.5, 95.5, 25.1 and 22.3%, respectively. The estimated cost of the control programmes to prevent these losses would be about US$ 13.2, 9.9, 4.1 and 6.6 million for the Sonderend, Keurbooms, Upper Wilge and Sabie-Sand catchments, respectively. Should the catchments be allowed to become fully invaded before control operations were started, then the costs would rise to US$ 86.5, 20.5, 278.0 and 11.1 million, respectively. The impacts and costs are significant and are comparable with those calculated independently for other South African catchments, Water is acknowledged to be a key constraint to economic growth in South Africa and there is considerable pressure for efficient and sustainable use of the limited water resources. The projected impacts would justify control programmes aimed at clearing alien invader, for water conservation. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper presents a short-run roundwood supply analysis of self-employed Norwegian forest owners, based on a two-period utility maximising consumption-savings model. The supply function was estimated by applying the Tobit model on an unbalanced panel of approximately 160 Norwegian farmers, from 1976 to 1997, representing a total of 3413 observations. Simultaneity between the single forest owner's harvesting level and his individual tax rate was allowed by estimating simultaneous equations Tobit models. The current roundwood price and standing stock per hectare had significant positive impacts on the supply, while harvesting costs, age of the owner, tax rate and lagged roundwood price (representing expected price) had negative impacts. Price and cost elasticities were relatively sensitive to the prices forecasted for the owners who did not Supply roundwood in a given period. These results suggest that price subsidies and operating subsidies, as well as tax relieves, could increase the harvest level, which is considerably lower than the sustainable harvest level. An operating subsidy seems at least as efficient as a price subsidy, while tax reliefs are the least efficient of the three policy means. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The characterization of "natural" or "presettlement" forest has become a relatively common practice in Canada as forest managers strive to put into practice concepts of sustainable forest management. Various methods have been developed to undertake such characterizations, leading to confusion about how to define "presettlement forest" and uncertainty over the approach that will best serve as a basis for management. We report on two methods of presettlement forest characterization: the "Witness Tree" and the "`Potential Forests" approaches. We compare results from these approaches to the existing forest composition in the Fundy Model Forest, New Brunswick. Both approaches indicate a decline in the predominance of tolerant hardwood and eastern cedar since presettlement. However, the Potential Forests approach consistently suggests much higher presettlement frequencies of spruce (Picea spp.) and, in most cases, pine (Pinus spp.) than the Witness Tree method. Differences between frequencies of tree species estimated by the two methods probably result from biases associated with both methods and the different scales of reporting. If used critically, the combined use of both sets of presettlement forest information will allow managers to determine the historical frequency of individual tree species and forest communities. Such information will provide some guidance in maintaining the diversity of native species and community types.

AB Mental health clinical practice guidelines have proliferated, but there is little evidence regarding the degree to which they are actually implemented in clinical practice. The goal of this study was to locate and review all peer-reviewed reports published through 2000 that provide quantitative information on rates of adherence to specific mental health guidelines. A literature search yielded 41 pertinent studies. These studies were of three types: 26 were cross-sectional investigations performed after the release of guidelines, six were conducted before and after release of guidelines without any specific intervention (pre/post), and nine involved a controlled trial of a specific intervention. Only 37% were conducted in the mental health specialty sector. Adequate adherence was found in 27% of the cross-sectional and pre/post studies but in 67% of the controlled trials. Successful interventions tended to be complex, involving system redesign or additional resources. Only six of 13 investigations (46%) that also measured patient outcome found that better outcome was associated with greater guideline adherence. Several studies showed that after cessation of interventions, adherence rates returned to preintervention levels. Thus, evidence indicates that guideline adherence is not high without specific intervention, but that certain interventions (typically multifaceted and resource-intensive ones) improve adherence. However, the public health challenge is to design and implement interventions that are sustainable in general clinical practice.

AB With an increased interest in and policy commitment to involving service users in the planning and delivery of health service provision, there is a clear need to explore both the rhetoric and realities of what user involvement entails. In the present paper, by drawing upon an evaluation of a community-based exercise facility for people with mental health problems the authors explore ways in which the reality of user involvement is subject to a range of configurations within health services. The paper describes piece of qualitative research that was undertaken within a participatory framework to explore the nature of user involvement within the facility. data have been analysed using a grounded theory approach to provide insights into: the organisational context in which user involvement take place; factors which encourage meaningful participation on the part of service users; perceived barriers to user involvement; and issues of sustainability and continuity. This research approach has enabled the authors to explore the views and experiences of users, service providers and referral agencies in relation to the nature and potential for user involvement. The findings illustrate ways in which user involvement may take place under both flexible and formal arrangements across a variety of activities. The present paper provides an account of some of the meanings and experiences of what 'successful' user participation may involve and the conditions which underpin 'success'. The authors conclude that successful and meaningful user involvement should enable and support users to recognise their existing skills, and to develop new ones, at a pace that suits their particular circumstances and personal resources. This process may require adaptation not only by organisations, but also by service providers and non-involved users.

AB Morphological reconstruction and biogeochemical characterisation of the lagoon of Comacchio (Italy) were carried out in order to provide recommendations for the recovery, conservation and sustainable management of the Fattibello-Spavola coastal lagoon ecosystem. Samples were taken in two seasons: July 1997 and November 1998. The irregular morphology of the Fattibello lagoon affects depositional processes and seawater exchange (tidal currents). Several depressions retain part of the dense water of the saline wedge; these stagnant waters became sinks for fine terrigenous and organic matter. The basin is already extensively supplied with N and P compounds from land. The inflow is demonstrated by the large quantity of organic C, N and organic and inorganic P compounds in the superficial sediment. The ratios between the various forms of macronutrients indicate that the organic matter is primarily of autochthonous origin, with relatively low C/N ratios (8.4 +/- 0.6 and 8.1 +/- 0.6 in July and November, respectively). Shallow areas were almost always oxygenated by tidal currents and thus rich in organisms, with a predominance of molluscs and Ficopomatus enigmaticus. However, the trophic equilibrium of the ecosystem was affected by the accumulation of organic matter in the depressions, favoured by the increased hydrodynamics during the autumn. These accumulations generate high oxygen consumption and release considerable quantities of nutrients into the water column, with the risk of serious dystrophy throughout the basin during the summer. Local dredging and an improvement of the circulation have been suggested and carried out to contain these processes. Reclamation measures in the longer term were proposed.

AB In Thau coastal lagoon, phosphate concentrations have decreased by 89% from 1971 to 1994. The present relatively long term (over 25 years) study compares changes in the contribution of point (PS) and non-point sources (NPS) total phosphorus (P) loads. The analysis of the distribution of the sources in comparison with the changes in the phosphate concentrations in the Thau lagoon aims to point out their relative impact in order to create a sustainable management plan for this system. This is needed, firstly because water quality supports shellfish farming, which is the main economical activity of the basin. Secondly, because the population is planned to increase by 40% between 1995 and 2020 thus leading to an increase of urban pressures. PS P loads, represented by discharges by wastewater treatment plants, have increased by 143% while NPS P loads, both represented by export from lands and loads from non-connected population, have decreased by 64%. Despite important changes in land-use by an exceptional decrease of vineyards areas (-12.5%), domestic effluents main contribute (>60%) to both PS and NPS P loads and seem to be more implicated in the decrease of phosphate concentrations in the Thau lagoon, probably because of the different phosphorus forms engaged.

AB Many students manage their learning processes on the basis of one measure of achievement: the grades they receive on assignments. While these represent current levels of performance, lifelong learning requires that students manage their learning and the quality of their experience as well as performance. This article summarizes the dangers involved in using a singular measure of achievement, and reports on a teaching innovation that encourages students to assess their own learning and experience prior to receiving back graded work. The innovation was successful in allowing students who valued learning to take a holistic view of their achievements.

ID PARTICIPATORY RESEARCH
AB Increasing cost/price ratios in sugarcane production and the pressure to remain internationally competitive have forced Australian sugar mills to try to use their infrastructure more efficiently. Generating rosters for sugarcane harvesters manually is difficult because the mills have a large number of harvesters and tight capacities in the transportation facilities. The Cooperative Research Centre for Sustainable Sugar Production conducted a participatory research process with five mills in the Australian sugar industry to develop models to optimize harvester rosters. Embedded in the research process and underpinned by action learning was the development of a novel integer-programming model, its validation, and its implementation. The participatory research overcame barriers to implementation of the rosters produced by the model and allowed the five participating mills to realize benefits in terms of more efficient transport operations.

AB The development of new methods of administering coccidiosis vaccines has facilitated their use in the hatchery and thereby improved prospects for the economic vaccination of broilers. The acquisition of protective immunity to Eimeria species is boosted by further exposure to infection after vaccination. Factors that affect the reproductive efficiency of non-attenuated and attenuated vaccines are considered and the key role that oocyst production plays in establishing and maintaining uniform immunity in a flock of chickens is discussed. In addition to immunisation, a possible advantage to the application of certain vaccines is that their use could repopulate poultry houses with drug-sensitive organisms. Theoretical rotation programmes in which the use of drugs is alternated with that of vaccines are described. Variability of the cross-protective immune response between strains of the same species should be considered during vaccine development and subsequent use. The significance of less common species of Eimeria, not included in all vaccines, also needs to be assessed. An important consideration is the occurrence of pathogens other than Eimeria (such as the bacterium Clostridium) in flocks given coccidiosis vaccines and the methods by which they might be controlled. More research is required into the relationship between bacterial and viral infections of poultry and coccidiosis vaccination. Vaccines need to be developed that are simple to apply and cost effective for use in areas of the world where small-scale poultry production is commonplace. In the near future it is likely that more live vaccines based upon oocysts derived from attenuated strains of Eimeria will be developed but in the longer term vaccines will be based on the selective presentation to the host of specific molecules that can induce protective immunity. This achievement will require significant investment from the private and public sectors, and, if successful, will facilitate the sustainable control of coccidiosis in poultry production.

DE primary teacher education; developing countries; costs of training;
   teacher supply and demand
AB This paper explores some of the financial issues that arise for teacher education policy and practice in developing countries. It is based on the results of the MUSTER1 research programme First it provides an overview of the context which shapes investment in teacher education across four countries. Second, each case is considered from different perspectives-a profile of the supply side, estimates of the costs of training. and an analysis of demand. This leads to some reflections on each case which draw attention to the main issues. The final discussion draws out some implications for policy, not least those arising from the inability of some training systems to meet demand at sustainable levels of cost. This creates dilemmas in terms of whether to adopt systems that can produce large numbers of teachers at low costs with reduced time in college. or maintain expensive conventional full-time pre-career residential systems and accept shortfalls in the supply of teachers long into the future. The data analysed here are derived from extensive MUSTER research in Ghana, Lesotho, Malawi and Trinidad and Tobago.(2) (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB SETTING: A government health system in southern Thailand where the directly observed treatment, short-course (DOTS) strategy has been implemented.
   OBJECTIVE: To compare the practice of actual directly observed treatment (DOT) and the observer sustainability for different types of observer.
   METHODS: During 1999-2000, 411 patients with new smear-positive pulmonary tuberculosis were followed up. The patients and/or their observers were interviewed about the presence of any person with the patient during drug intake and the practice of watching the patient swallowing the medicine (actual DOT). Data were recorded monthly and analysed by Cox and logistic regression models.
   RESULTS: For health personnel (HP), community member (CM), and family member (FM) observers, the proportions who did not practise actual DOT were respectively 11%, 23%, and 35%, and the proportions who changed to no observer or self administration were respectively 11%, 1%, and 2%, during the first 9 months of treatment. Health personnel had the lowest risk of not practising actual DOT (odds ratio HP/FM 0.1, 95%CI 0.1-0.2; CM/FM 0.9, 95%CI 0.5-1.6) but the highest risk for change to self administration.
   CONCLUSION: To increase the coverage of actual DOT, strategies are needed to maintain health personnel as the DOT observers and to promote actual DOT among family member observers.

TI Advertising trends in urban China
SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID ATTITUDES; ADVERTISEMENTS
AB The Chinese advertising market expanded in the past decade at an average annual rate of above 40 percent. The sustainability of such a rapid growth depends in part on the general attitudes of the public toward advertising. This paper reports the results of a telephone survey of 825 consumers in five major cities in China. The survey focused on general beliefs about the institution of advertising, personal experiences, and general attitudes toward advertising. The relationships among beliefs, personal experiences, and general attitudes are modeled. The paper also investigates the relationships among demographic variables and experiences, beliefs,and attitudes. The study shows that urban Chinese have similar or more positive attitudes toward advertising than their U.S. counterparts and that these positive attitudes demonstrate resilience over time. As in the United States, younger consumers have more positive beliefs and attitudes toward advertising. But in contrast to the United States, those with higher levels of education tend to have more positive attitudes and beliefs.

TI Allometric relationships in Bactris gasipaes for heart-of-palm
   production agroecosystems in Costa Rica
SO JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
ID BIOMASS; TREE; STANDS
AB Peach palm (Bactris gasipaes Kunth) agroecosystems for hearts-of-palm constitute a productive and sustainable land use for the humid tropics. Allometric models allow to predict biomass non-destructively at any time, and subsequently, to determine the span of growth phases, biomass and nutrient pools, and economic yields. The overall goals of this study were to obtain and validate predictive functions of above-ground dry biomass of peach palm shoots, and to relate standing biomass with heart-of-palm yields as well. Towards this purpose, peach palm shoots were harvested and separated into components (foliage, petiole and stem) in the Atlantic region of Costa Rica. Basal diameter (BD) was a more effective predictor of biomass than height to the fork between the spear leaf and the first fully expanded leaf, total height and number of leaves. Regression models explained 70-89% of the variance in component (foliage, petiole and stem) or total shoot biomass. Nonlinear regression, which independently calculates equation coefficients for biomass components and total shoot biomass, was compared with a nonlinear seemingly unrelated regression (NSUR) procedure, which simultaneously fits the component equations that predict leaf, petiole and stem in order to assure biomass additivity. Equation coefficients for NSUR fitted-regressions that also model unequal variances, were substantially different from those for individual regressions; e.g. Biomass(leaf) = 114739 BD1.8042, Residual mean square (RMS) = 69.9 for the individual equation, versus Biomass(leaf) = 6841 BD2.086, RMS = 72.4 for the NSUR fitted-equation. NSUR equations had slightly less precision in estimating biomass than individual equations but consistently less bias. In separate harvests of peach palm plants within four stands ranging in age from 1.9 to 21 years, estimates of component and total above-ground shoot biomass were similar to observed values except for the youngest stand in which biomass was overestimated. In another harvest, yield of heart-of-palm per plant was linearly related to total above-ground biomass in two peach palm stands of age 5 and 9 years. The non-destructive estimation of above-ground biomass from easily measured plant dimensions will permit any-time, less expensive and reasonable precise biomass estimates in peach palm. Biomass data can be incorporated to decision support aids for nutrient management in heart-of-palm agroecosystems and serve other purposes such as for carbon sequestration calculations.

   EXPERIENCE
AB Introduction: In the animal model, segmentation of the atria with radiofrequency-generated linear lesions (LL) using the loop catheter has been shown to be highly effective in terminating chronic atrial fibrillation (AF). This study addresses the question whether the same lesion set also would prevent reinduction and sustainability of AF.
   Methods and Results: We studied two groups of dogs. The AF group included eight dogs in which the atria were paced until chronic AF was present. After 6 months of sustained AF, the dogs were converted to normal sinus rhythm (NSR) by the creation of LL in both atria. Rapid atrial pacing was restarted 6 months later and continued for 4 weeks. In the NSR group, there were nine dogs in NSR without inducible AF at baseline. LL were created, and after 6 months rapid atrial pacing was applied for 4 weeks. Rhythm status was monitored weekly. Transthoracic echocardiography was performed at baseline, before linear lesion placement, and before pacing/repacing. At the conclusion of the study, the hearts were excised and examined. The lesions were stained, and their quality was assessed. AF was induced in a much shorter interval in the dogs in which AF had previously been present than in NSR dogs (8 +/- 5 days vs 25 +/- 13 days; P < 0.05). LL prevented sustainability of AF induced via rapid pacing once the pacing stimulus was stopped. Incomplete lesions were associated with increased inducibility of atrial tachycardia and AF.
   Conclusion: In this animal model of AF, LL are not only capable of terminating chronic AF, but also lead to self-termination of AF once the rapid pacing is stopped. Self-termination of AF after induction with rapid pacing was not observed in this AF model in the absence of LL. In the dogs with 6 months of AF, the presence of AF led to increased atrial susceptibility to AF induction by rapid pacing, even with LL and after 6 months of recovery. Incomplete LL allows induction of atrial tachycardia and AF.

AB Iodine deficiency disorders (IDD) were prevalent in the Islamic Republic (IR) of IRAN before 1989, when the national salt iodization program with 40 mg l/k of salt was initiated. Despite a comprehensive IDD control program, less than 50% of the households in rural areas consumed iodized salt by 1994. A law for the mandatory production of iodized salt for households was passed in 1994. The purpose of this study was to evaluate goiter status and urinary iodine excretion 2 yr after this law was implemented. In each of 26 provinces, 30 groups of 40 schoolchildren, total 36,178, were examined for goiter and classified according to World Health Organization (WHO) classification. Urinary iodine excretion was measured in 2,917 children by digestion method. Goiter was endemic in all provinces, but the majority were small (grade 1) goiter. Median urinary iodine was 20.5 mug/dl 85.1% had urinary iodine greater than or equal to10 mug/dl. Median urinary iodine was above 13 mug/dl in all 26 provinces. In all provinces the percentage of schoolchildren with urinary iodine <5 &mu;g/dl was less than 16%. In nine provinces the median urinary iodine was between 13 to 20 g&mu;/dl; urinary iodine of their schoolchildren was <5 mug/dl in 10.8% and <2 &mu;g/dl in 6-9%. No significant difference was observed between boys and girls or children of rural and urban regions in urinary iodine excretion. We conclude that 7 yr after the beginning of salt iodization and 2 yr following mandatory iodized salt consumption, urinary iodine excretion is adequate in schoolchildren; considering the data of the percent of households consuming iodized salt and programmatic setting of the IDD program, The IR of Iran has reached a sustainable control program for iodine deficiency.

ID PROGRAMMING APPROACH; DYNAMICS; SYSTEMS
AB Fisheries management is typically a complex problem, from both an environmental and political perspective. The main source of conflict occurs between the need for stock conservation and the need for fishing community well-being, which is typically measured by employment and income levels. For most fisheries, overexploitation of the stock requires a reduction in the level of fishing activity. While this may lead to long-term benefits (both conservation and economic), it also leads to a short-term reduction in employment and regional incomes. In regions which are heavily dependent on fisheries, short-term consequences of conservation efforts may be considerable. The relatively high degree of scientific uncertainty with respect to the status of the stocks and the relatively short lengths of political terms of office, generally give rise to the short-run view taking the highest priority when defining policy objectives. In this paper, a multi-objective model of the North Sea is developed that incorporates both long-term and short-term objectives. Optimal fleet sizes are estimated taking into consideration different preferences between the defined short-term and long-term objectives. The subsequent results from the model give the short-term and long-term equilibrium status of the fishery incorporating the effects of the short-term objectives. As would be expected, an optimal fleet from a short-term perspective is considerably larger than an optimal fleet from a long-run perspective. Conversely, stock sizes and sustainable yields are considerably lower in the long-term if a short-term perspective is used in setting management policies. The model results highlight what is essentially a principal-agent problem, with the objectives of the policy makers not necessarily reflecting the objectives of society as a whole.

AB Variation in otolith shape (otolith polymorphism) in Hoplostethus atlanticus, Hoplostethus mediterraneus, Paratrichichthys trailli. Pagrus major and Trachurus murphyi, quantified using principal components analysis based on Fourier transform decompositions of outlines of otolith shape, was particularly high among the samples of H. atlanticus from the North Atlantic, New Zealand, Australia and Namibia. The scatter was uniform, however, and did not show any significant differences among regions. The implication drawn from the high variability in otolith shape of H atlanticus was that otolith shape polymorphism was maintained by some form of balancing selection across many small local environments which may result in k-selection with consequent poor response by H. atlanticus to maximum sustainable yield harvesting strategies. The variation in otolith shape defined by the otolith morphospace of the five species that were measured. showed a decreasing trend in scatter (i.e. decreasing complexity of shape) proceeding from the species with the deepest habitat (H. atlanticus) to the most shallow (T murphyi).

ID DIETARY IRON; FERRITIN; NUTRITION
AB Iron deficiency is one of the most prevalent nutrient deficiencies in the world. A sustainable solution to dietary iron deficiency may be achieved in part by increasing bioavailable iron in seeds used for foods such as rice. Because ferritin is used as a natural source of iron in the early development of humans, other animals and plants, the bioavailability of iron in rice seeds, provided in amounts equal to ferrous sulfate, and in transgenic rice with ferritin was tested in iron-deficient rats. A standard hemoglobin (Hb) repletion bioassay was used with rats made anemic followed by complete diets containing equivalent amounts of iron as FeSO4, or one of three different bioengineered rice varieties (Kitaake and two transgenic derivatives with ferritin targeted to the seed, FK11 and FK22). Rice diets were as effective as the FeSO4, diet in replenishing hematocrit, Hb concentration and liver iron concentrations. These data suggest that Mendelian and biotechnological approaches to manipulating ferritin expression of seed iron in rice may contribute to a sustainable solution to global problems of iron deficiency.

AB The problem of gully erosion is very severe in the riparian areas of the alluvial deep soil region in India. Research and development have progressed in response to the change in social needs. The earlier strategy of maintenance of law and order has changed to one of reclamation and restoration of the productive capacity of riparian areas. Watershed management in the ravines has been adopted for development of food security, eco-restoration and pollution control. Case studies on the watershed management in watersheds projects initiated in the mid-1980s revealed the scope for bringing increased prosperity through crop diversification and eco-restoration. In consideration of the erosion process, new concepts of management zones and improved conservation and reclamation practices have been developed. The sociological factors have been rationally analysed, as they applied to watershed management in the ravines. A new paradigm of watershed management by group action is necessary in the future. Since the Ways of combating the ravine problem and enhancing the productivity of ravine-degraded lands were made on rational process-based approach, there is scope for it to be implemented in other countries with similar land and socio-economic situations.

AB International environmental organizations propose voluntary eco-labeling as a market incentive to promote industry to operate in an ecologically sustainable and environmentally friendly manner. A microeconomic analysis questions whether voluntary eco-labeling will cause producer profits in a competitive industry to decline and whether eco-labeling will necessarily generate different prices for labeled and unlabeled product. Using wood product as an example, results identify conditions that may exist when firms lose profits, even under a voluntary system, and where existing production constraints may lead to a single price, regardless of labeling.

ID LESSONS
AB This paper analyzes the problem of fit of environmental institutions to the conservation of fisheries CPRs and the maintenance of artisanal fisheries in the estuary of Patos Lagoon, southern Brazil. The analysis identified problems with the definition of boundaries and rights to fisheries resources and incongruities between rules and local environmental/resource conditions which can affect the sustainability of artisanal fisheries. The driving forces of misfits showed to be associated to internal and external factors including the weak and changeable institutional arrangements, socio-economic conditions, the regime structure of governance, and individual stewardship for resources.

SO MARINE POLICY

DT Article
AB Strategic management and planning within estuaries seeks to identify a framework that enshrines sustainability. Within the UK, a scoping exercise has been used to clarify user requirements and define the economic benefits that could be derived from a supporting programme of research. The programme recognises the need for a mix of fundamental, strategic and applied research, to address, in particular, issues of
   long-term change;
   physical, chemical and biological interactions and
   system response (including socio-economic interactions).
   Achieving such a programme will need to take advantage of research at a number of different spatial and temporal scales. These span from global climate change initiatives, through catchment and estuary wide studies to work on specific features (banks, mudflats, etc.). They necessarily consider changes over time scales of seconds to aeons. Realistically, for strategic planning and management, the goal is to be able to predict, with a reasonable degree of confidence over a 20-50 year time horizon. Given the highly non-linear and complex adaptive nature of estuary systems, absolute predictions may not be possible. Rather, it will be necessary to identify probable/possible outcomes, or system states, as a basis for guiding management actions. This, in itself, will require managers and planners to move away from a prescriptive interventionist approach towards a more adaptive one. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Finding ways to assess and measure the impact of tourism and its associated development on sustainability is critical to developing long-term sustainability plans for regions such as the Indian Himalayas. Among the methods proposed is ecological footprint (EF) analysis or appropriated carrying capacity analysis. EF analysis estimates the area of productive land and water ecosystems required to produce the resources that a population consumes and to assimilate the wastes that the population produces in supporting itself. This study used EF analysis to quantify the sustainability of Manali, a rapidly growing tourist center in Kullu District, Himachal Pradesh, India, it considered the changes in the size of Manali's footprint since the advent of mass tourism in the early 1980s, the direct impact that tourists are having on the size of the footprint, and the challenges of applying this analysis in a developing world context. Data regarding land use, goods and services, and population were collected through local interviews and available data. The results indicate that between 1971 and 1995, the overall EF of Manali town grew from 2102 to 9665 ha, an increase of over 450%; the EF of Manali is now 25 times greater than its size. This indicates that Manali is increasingly relying on outside ecosystems for its sustenance. The article highlights areas of focus for future sustainability planning, including waste management, decreasing fossil fuel dependence, ecofriendly tourism, and creating greater environmental awareness, particularly among tourists.

LA English
DT Article
DE austainability in mountainous regions; highland-lowland interactions;
   material flux analysis; energy; nourishment
AB The debate over sustainable development raises the question of regional potential to improve resource management from an ecological point of view. This involves finding substitutes for nonrenewable resources, increasing resource efficiency, and increasing regional autonomy with regard to mass resources. In this context, the question of the possibilities for neighboring highland and lowland regions to find a win-win situation in resource management gains new relevance. Swiss highland and lowland areas served as the study area for the present article. Material flow analysis was applied to quantify the physiological interactions. Energy, human nutrition, and animal fodder served as indicators. Interactions are discussed on the basis of 2 "sustainability scenarios": (1) a 2-kW society, and (2) a diet with low meat consumption. The results led to the following main conclusions. First, physiological net interactions between the regions are currently very low. The natural resource potentials of the regions cannot be used intensively as objects of exchange. Mass resources such as water, biomass, and construction materials play a minor role in the overall regional economic output. With respect to energy and nourishment, the "global hinterland" as the main supplier is much more important for both regions. Second, in sustainability scenarios, the 2 regions could become complementary in the production of food and fodder. In addition, the highlands could eventually become a supplier of renewable energy. Thus, a high degree of sustainability in resource management can increase interregional resource interaction because of the promotion of regional resource idiosyncrasies.

AB Phosphorus deficiency is one of the major constraints for normal plant growth and crop yields in the acid soils of Ghana and therefore addition of P inputs is required for sustainable crop production. This is often difficult, if not impossible for small-scale farmers due to the high cost of mineral P fertilizers and limited access to fertilizer supplies. Direct application of finely ground phosphate rocks (PRs) and their modified forms have been recommended as alternatives for P fertilization. The direct application of the natural and modified PRs to these acid soils implies the need to predict their agronomic effectiveness of the PRs in the simplest and most cost-effective manner. In this study the classical greenhouse pot experiment was compared to the P-32 isotopic kinetics laboratory method for evaluating the agronomic effectiveness of natural and modified Togo PR in six highly weathered Oxisols from southwest Ghana. In the P-32 isotopic kinetics laboratory experiment the six soil samples were each fertilised at the rate of 50 mg P kg(-1) soil in the form of triple superphosphate (TSP), Togo PAPR-50%, and Togo PR, respectively. Controls without P amendment were also included. Isotopic exchange kinetics experiments were carried out on two sets of samples, immediately after P fertilizer additions (without incubation) and after 6 weeks of incubation under wet conditions and at a room temperature of 25degrees C. In the greenhouse pot experiment, P fertilizers in the form of Togo PR, Togo PAPR, Mali PR and TSP were each applied to the six soils at rates equivalent to 0, 30, 60, and 120 kg P ha(-1), respectively. The P fertilizers were mixed with the soils and maize (Zea mays L.) variety Obatanpa was grown for 42 days before harvest. The isotopic kinetics data of the control samples indicated that 5 of the studied soils had very low P fertility status as reflected by their low P concentrations in solution (Cp<0.02 mg P l(-1)) and low exchangeable P (E(1)min < 5 mg P kg(-1)). The capacity factor and the fixation index of the soils were variable. Application of water-soluble P as TSP increased both the Cp and E-1 values of all the soils above the critical levels. Togo PR was least effective among the fertilizers tested for all soil soils, except in Boi soil. Acidulation of Togo PR (Togo PAPR-50%) was an effective means to increase its agronomic effectiveness. Direct application of natural Togo PR would be only feasible in the Boi soil series as reflected by its high Pdff% value in soil solution. Incubation with the P fertilizers caused an increase in the soil pH and a decline in the effectiveness of the applied P fertilizers, irrespective of the soil and the fertilizer utilized. Based upon the results of the greenhouse pot experiment, the relative crop response index (RCRI) in terms of increasing dry matter yield and P uptake followed the order of TSP > PAPR = Mali PR > Togo PR = Control. Both the laboratory index, Pdff% in soil solution derived from the isotopic method and the RCRI values obtained from the pot experiment produced similar results in ranking the P fertilizers tested according to their agronomic effectiveness. The isotopic kinetic method may be considered as an alternative to both greenhouse and field methods in the evaluation of agronomic effectiveness of P fertilizers in tropical acid soils when it offers comparative advantages in assessing the soil P status and its changes. But trained staff and adequate laboratory facilities are needed to perform this technique. Also the method can be used as a
   Further research is needed to assess the overall agronomic effectiveness (immediate and residual effects) of PR sources in predominant cropping systems of this region of Ghana.

AB A main constraint to agricultural productivity in the southern regions of Chile is the low available soil P exacerbated by the high P sorption capacity of the predominant Andisols. Therefore, substantial amounts of P fertilizers must be applied to obtain optimum growth and crop yields. One cost-effective strategy followed to supply P to crops grown in these soils is the direct application of the local Bahia Inglesa PR source. However, a more sustainable strategy would be to combine the use of the local PR with the crop species and cultivars that are able to grow in these acid soils and can utilize efficiently PR. Rape is reported to be very efficient in utilising P from PR sources due to its capacity to exude organic acids to the rhizosphere. Therefore, the present study was conducted to evaluate the ability of five rape cultivars grown in an Andisol of southern Chile in utilising P from two PR sources (Bahia Inglesa and Bayovar) and triple superphosphate, a water-soluble P fertilizer. It was found that rape was able to absorb significant amounts of P from the PR sources and much less from the TSP and soil P. Both Bahia Inglesa and Bayovar PRs were found to be as effective as TSP for the rape genotypes in the Andisol Pemehue. The use of the P-32 isotope technique enabled to assess the ability of the genotypes tested to utilize P from the different P fertilizers applied. The genotypes G2 and G3 showed increased P acquisition from the PR than the genotype G5. Combined utilization of P efficient genotypes and direct application of the Bahia Inglesa PR seems to be a promising technology for attaining sustainable agricultural productivity in the Andisols of Chile. Further field trials for validating these findings at the level of cropping systems are needed. This agronomic testing should be accompanied by in-depth studies to assess the relative importance of the morphological and physiological traits determining a higher P efficiency.

ID SUPERPHOSPHATE
AB Phosphorus (P) inputs are required for sustainable agricultural production in most acid soils of the tropics and subtropics. Phosphate rocks (PR) and organic materials have been suggested as alternative P sources in these soils. Quantitative information on the P availability from sewage sludge (SL) is scanty. Methods to improve the effectiveness of PR such as partial acidulation and compaction with water-soluble P sources have been recommended. The objective of this greenhouse study was to evaluate the relative agronomic effectiveness (RAE) of Florida PR and sewage sludges (irradiated and non-irradiated) applied alone and in mixture with a water-soluble source (triple superphosphate, TSP) at two rates (50 and 150 mg P kg(-1) soil). The P-32 isotope dilution technique was utilised to determine the proportion of P in the plant taken up from the P fertilizer treatments. Wheat was grown on an acid loamy sand Dystric Eutrocrepts and harvested 6 weeks after planting. Results on total P uptake and the RAE of the P fertilizer sources tested indicated that the addition of 50 mg P kg(-1) soil as TSP was adequate in supplying P to the 6-week-old wheat plants as compared to PR and sewage sludge. Intermediate values were obtained for the mixtures. Similar responses were observed for the high P rate. For a given P rate, phosphorus uptake from PR and SL in presence of TSP was higher than P uptake from these sources alone, indicating an enhancement effect of TSP on the effectiveness of these non-readily available sources. With respect to P uptake from PR applied alone, the relative increases in P uptake from PR due to TSP influence were 52 and 67% for the low and high P rates, respectively. The relative increases in P uptake from SL due to TSP when compared to P uptake from SL alone were 102 and 59% for the low and high P rates of application. Application of a water-soluble P fertilizer together with a non-readily available P source shows an enhancement on the P uptake from the non-readily available P source by the wheat plants. In this experiment the estimated enhancement effects are very likely underestimated.

AB A "soil P fertility recapitalization'' initiative utilizing large rates of phosphate rocks (PRs) was proposed to improve the soil P status and increase the sustainable food production in acid and P-deficient tropical soils. Two series of experiments were carried out using five tropical acid soils treated with heavy applications of Gafsa phosphate rock (GPR). In the first series, the soils were mixed with GPR at the following application rates: 0, 500, 1000 and 2000 mg P.kg(-1), and incubated for one month in moist conditions. In another series, 1000 mg P kg(-1) applied as GPR was added to three soils and incubated for 1.5 month; thereafter 50 mg P kg(-1) as triple superphosphate (TSP) were added. The P-32 isotopic exchange method was utilized to assess the contribution of GPR to the available soil P. Changes in amounts, E, of P transferred with time as phosphate ions from the soil particles to the soil solution as well as changes in pH, calcium and phosphate concentrations in soil suspensions were determined. It was found that: (i) the contribution of P from GPR to recapitalization of soil P fertility was mainly assessed by E pool size, pH, calcium and phosphate concentrations; other variables were not significant at the 0.1 level; (ii) heavy applications of GPR did not saturate all the P sorption sites, P freshly applied as water-soluble P was still sorbed; (iii) recapitalization of soil P fertility using GPR was partly obtained in some acid tropical soils; (iv) Upon dissolution, GPR provided calcium ions to crops and to soils, thus reducing Al toxicity, but its liming effect was limited. To explain these effects with heavy application rates of GPR, it was postulated that a coating of Al and Fe compounds is formed around PR particles with time, thus reducing further dissolution.

TI Isotopic assessment of soil phosphorus fertility and evaluation of rock

AB Soil phosphorus (P) deficiency is a major factor limiting crop productivity in many tropical and subtropical soils. Due to the acidic nature of these soils, rock phosphate (RP)-based P fertilizers that are cheaper than manufactured water-soluble P fertilizers can be an attractive alternative under certain conditions. Assessment of the efficacy of these alternative P fertilizers and a rational management of local P resources for sustainable agricultural production require an understanding of the dynamics of P in the soil-plant system and the interactions of various P sources in soils and monitoring of soil available P levels. The present work was conducted to test the applicability of the (32)P isotopic kinetic method to assess the soil P fertility status and evaluate the agronomic effectiveness of local rock phosphates in subtropical China. A series of experiments was carried out in the laboratory, greenhouse and field conditions with the following specific objectives: (a) to evaluate the suitability of this isotopic kinetic method in evaluating soil P fertility in 32 soil samples collected across southern China, (b) to test and further develop chemical extraction methods for routine soil P testing, (c) to monitor the dissolution kinetics of local low to medium grade rock phosphate sources and their effect on soil properties and (d) to evaluate their agronomic effectiveness in greenhouse and field experiments. Since most of the studied soils had very low concentrations of soluble P and high P-fixing capacities, the isotopic kinetic method was found unsuitable for evaluating soil P fertility and to predict plant P uptake. In contrast, the proposed chemical extraction method (NaHCO(3)-NH(4)F) predicted very well plant P uptake, suggesting that this extraction method can be routinely used to evaluate soil bioavailable P in similar soils in subtropical China. From the incubation study, it was found that although the local low to medium grade RPs were inferior to the reactive NCPR in increasing soil available P levels, they have the potential to improve soil chemical properties. Field experiments indeed demonstrated that the medium grade Jinxiang RP significantly increased crop yield, suggesting that local low to medium grade RPs could be used as P sources to provide P to plants and also to improve soil chemical properties. Overall, these results provide important information for a rational management of P resources for sustainable agriculture in subtropical China.

AB The Child in Need Institute (CINI) has been working toward sustainable health and nutrition development for women and children for the last twenty-six years. During the initial stages, the Institute focused on treatment and prevention of malnutrition in children under five years of age. Over the years, the program strategies have shifted to a more holistic lifecycle approach. This approach targets individuals during crucial periods of their lives-pregnant women, children (0-2 years of age) and adolescents (10-19 years of age)-as well as other vulnerable segments of the population. To reach out to these target groups, the Institute uses a three-pronged strategy that includes case management, behavior change communication, and linkage formation. Programs are either community- or center-based depending upon the need of the populations. CINI's current strategy has shown positive trends in improving the health and nutrition status of women, children, and adolescents in the community. Results include reduction of low birth weight babies, increase in proper antenatal care, reduction of severely malnourished children, decrease in maternal and infant mortality and morbidity rates, and improvement in community involvement in all reproductive and child health programs. CINI is currently monitoring its performance and activities to carry out operations research for providing further evidence for the effectiveness of its interventions.

ID VITAMIN-A-DEFICIENCY; CHILDREN
AB Micronutrient deficiencies of vitamin A, iron, and iodine continue to be of public health significance in India. The government of India initiated national programs to prevent, control and combat these deficiencies and their serious consequences. The interventions involved (1) distribution of iodized salt in the endemic areas, (2) administration of semiannual massive dose of vitamin A to young children, and (3) distribution of iron-folic acid tablets to the vulnerable groups. Evaluations revealed that the biologic impact of these interventions was unsatisfactory. Inadequate allocation of funds (10% of the actual needs) necessary to cover the enormous number of beneficiaries was one of the important obstacles. Consequently, the allocation of supplies to different provinces was far short of the requirements (10-30%). As a result of poor orientation, the functionaries were not adhering to the guidelines, leading to woefully inadequate (1-20%) and irregular coverage. There was no proper monitoring or supervision to make midcourse corrections to improve the functioning. The community was not informed of the purpose and details of each intervention. Hence, it did not utilize the resources completely and remained passive recipients. The community was not aware of the dietary approaches to prevent micronutrient disorders owing to absence of nutrition education. With the adoption of National Nutrition Policy by the government of India, a concerted and focused approach should be adopted. The future strategies should include a mix of short-term supplementation and food-based strategy encompassing food fortification and home gardening. Innovative approaches in information, education, and communication (such as social marketing strategy) for making the interventions sustainable should be adopted.

AB Drawing on an empirical study on automakers' management of supplier involvement in product development in Japan, this paper shows that when the design of a component is outsourced to a supplier, how much automakers know about the component matters for them to gain a better outcome. While the actual tasks of designing and manufacturing components could be outsourced, automakers should retain the relevant knowledge to obtain better component design quality. The paper argues that knowledge partitioning should be distinguished from task partitioning, and provides some implications for the knowledge-based theory of the firm.
   The results indicate that effective pattern of knowledge partitioning differs by the nature of component development project in terms of technological newness. For regular projects. it is more important for the automaker to have a higher level of architectural knowledge (how to coordinate various components for a vehicle) than of component-specific knowledge, which is supposed to be provided by the supplier. However, when the project involves new technology for the supplier, it is important for the automaker to have a higher level of component-specific knowledge to solve unexplored engineering problems together with the supplier. In innovative projects, effective knowledge partitioning seems to demand some overlap between an automaker and a supplier, rather than efficient and clear-cut boundaries that are optimal for regular projects. Such "fluid" nature of knowledge boundaries contingent on the project types poses a challenge for firms seeking both technological leadership and efficiency in established products,
   Developing and maintaining knowledge about an outsourced component is by no means easy. When the actual design tasks are outsourced, automakers miss substantial opportunities to gain relevant knowledge through learning by doing. Also, obtained knowledge may be diffused among competitors through shared suppliers, Another problem for automakers is that component-specific knowledge is important for only limited cases (innovative projects). Even worse, component-specific knowledge has a trade off relationship with architectural knowledge.
   Such an inherent dilemma of managing knowledge, however, may provide some automakers with the opportunity to achieve sustainable competitive advantage, Additional analysis shows that one automaker managed both types of knowledge better than others in a manner that deals effectively with the dilemma. Its organizational mechanisms include career development policies. extensive documentation of technological information, internal training programs, and incentive schemes. The difficulty in implementing those mechanisms in a consistent and complementary manner seems to explain why there was a significant variance among automakers in knowledge level. even when the actual tasks were carried out by a shared supplier.

AB Soil compaction and forest floor removal influence fundamental soil processes that control forest productivity and sustainability. We investigated effects of soil compaction and forest floor removal on tree growth, N uptake and N status in ponderosa pine. Factorial combinations of soil compaction (non-compacted and compacted) and forest floor removal (forest floor present and no forest floor) were applied to three different surface soil textures. For studying N uptake, four trees from every treatment were (15)N labeled with 130.6 mg m(-2) of (15)N. Tree responses to compaction were dependent on the forest floor removal level. In loam and clay soils, non-compacted+no forest floor was beneficial to tree growth. Tree growth was depressed with compaction+no forest floor in clay soil. In sandy loam soil, compaction+no forest floor showed the best tree growth. No N deficiency was found in any soil type but a graphical method suggested correlation between N status and tree growth. In loam and clay soils, compaction+forest floor present increased N uptake. Nitrogen uptake was explained significantly by potential N mineralization in loam and clay soils. In sandy loam soil, the effects of compaction and forest floor removal were more complex, with the N uptake improved in the compaction+no forest floor treatment and reduced under compaction+forest floor present. Soil compaction may have influenced N tracer uptake because of improved unsaturated flow and root-soil contact. However, N immobilization may have restricted N uptake in compaction+forest floor present in the sandy loam soil. The study illustrates how soil properties and site preparation can potentially interact to affect N dynamics and forest productivity.

DE environment; floods & floodworks; river engineering
AB There are five million people at risk from flooding in England and Wales along with nearly two million homes and 185 000 business properties. The principal operational responsibility for reducing this risk rests with the UK government's Environment Agency, which employs over 5000 staff dedicated to the role. This paper explores key technical, organisational and environmental challenges facing the Environment Agency in delivering sustainable flood defence in England and Wales. It examines new strategic developments and the recent restructuring of the Environment Agency's flood defence service, and illustrates the practicalities of sustainable flood defence by looking at the autumn 2000 floods, the Gainsborough flood alleviation scheme, land use change, river restoration projects and managed realignment of flood defences.

AB Catchment-wide flood management plans are now being prepared for all 80 catchments in England and Wales. They aim to provide the basis for sustainable flood management policies within each catchment over the next 50 years and serve as a framework for the future management of risks. This paper describes the background to the catchment flood management plans and the principles involved. It also reviews a specially tailored modelling and decision support framework that has been set up to automate the key steps in the catchment planning process, thus ensuring consistency between plans and value for money.

ID VITAMIN-A; IRON FORTIFICATION; UNITED-STATES; NUTRITION; IMPACT; FOODS
AB Food fortification is likely to have played an important role in the current nutritional health and well-being of populations in industrialized countries. Starting in the early part of the 20th century, fortification was used to target specific health conditions: goitre with iodized salt; rickets with vitamin D-fortified milk; beriberi, pellagra and anaemia with B-vitamins and Fe-enriched cereals; more recently, in the USA, risk of pregnancy affected by neural-tube defects with folic acid-fortified cereals. A relative lack of appropriate centrally-processed food vehicles, less-developed commercial markets and relatively low consumer awareness and demand, means it has taken about another 50 years for fortification to be seen as a viable option for the less-developed countries. The present paper reviews selected fortification initiatives in developing countries to identify different factors that contributed to their successful implementation, as well as the challenges that continually threaten the future of these programmes. Ultimately, the long-term sustainability of fortification programmes is ensured when consumers are willing and able to bear the additional cost of fortified foods. There has been an enormous increase in fortification programmes over the last couple of decades in developing countries. Considerable progress has been made in reducing vitamin A and I deficiencies, although less so with Fe, even as Zn and folic acid deficiencies are emerging as important public health problems. Food fortification based on sound principles and supported by clear policies and regulations can play an increasingly large role in this progress towards prevention and control of micronutrient malnutrition.

AB The purpose of the present paper is to review the evidence in favour of food-based strategies to meet the challenges of micronutrient malnutrition in the developing world. Increasing dietary diversification is the most important factor in providing a wide range of micronutrients, and to achieve this objective in a development context requires an adequate supply, access and consumption of a variety of foods. Diets in developing countries generally lack many nutrients, including energy (inadequate amounts of food), so that strategies need to also emphasize an increase in total food intake, in addition to a greater variety. Agricultural and food policies tend to be oriented to primary agricultural productions, but they could also be formulated to promote and support home gardens and small livestock production for the explicit purpose of increasing the household consumption of micronutrient-rich foods. The adoption of 'desirable' dietary patterns for nutrition improvement, e.g. appropriately formulated to meet micronutrient needs, could be used in the formulation of agricultural policies and programmes. This process could be achieved through support for integrated farming systems oriented to assuring household food security, but also based on a variety of foods that will meet total dietary (including micronutrient) needs. Thus, availability of energy-rich staples, animal and/or fish as major sources of protein, and vitamin-, mineral- and phytonutrient-rich fruit and vegetables could constitute the types of production envisaged. The cultivation of edible indigenous plants as additional sources of micronutrients could also be added. The low bioavailability of some key micronutrients from foods, such as Fe, are substantially enhanced with the right food combinations and with appropriate food processing and preparation techniques. Simple appropriate technology for the preservation of micronutrient-rich foods would need further development and promotion for their year-round availability. Linking community development policies to national programmes for the alleviation of hunger and malnutrition, with an emphasis on increasing the variety of foods consumed, is probably the best strategy for improving micronutrient malnutrition sustainably.

AB The following article discusses the current emphasis and attention being given to the future of emergency management, as well as theoretical constructs designed to guide research and help practitioners reduce disaster It illustrates that while the disaster-resistant community disaster-resilient community, and sustainable development/sustainable hazards mitigation concepts provide many unique advantages for disaster scholarship and management, they fail to sufficiently address the triggering agents, functional areas, actors, variables, and disciplines pertaining to calamitous events, In making this argument, the article asserts that any future paradigm and policy guide must be built on-yet go further than-comprehensive emergency management. The article also reviews and alters the concept of invulnerable development. Finally, the article presents "comprehensive vulnerability management" as a paradigm and suggests that it is better suited to guide scholarly and practitioner efforts to understand and reduce disasters than the aforementioned perspectives.

AB This report describes a 4-year long bilingual interdisciplinary primary health care project that was designed to make culturally sensitive services available to underserved Korean immigrants in Chicago. It also describes some of the particular needs of this population and the strategies that the project staff adopted to identify and address the population's mental health needs. The project reflected the successful collaborative efforts of four participating principals: the Korean community, the University of Illinois at Chicago College of Nursing, the Chicago Department of Public Health, and the W. K. Kellogg Foundation. The model of service demonstrated in the project paired a bilingual advanced practice nurse, a certified family nurse practitioner, with a bilingual community advocate to conduct a program emphasizing community outreach and health promotion and prevention. A bilingual physician provided consultation for the nurse and attended to patients in need of medical care. Patients were referred to bilingual community social service agencies for assistance with a variety of other problems. A central goal of the project was for the services developed during its course to be assimilated into the regular programming of the Chicago Department of Public Health, a goal that was achieved. Finally, some of the challenges of introducing role change into an organization are discussed.

AB The use of renewable energy sources is a fundamental factor for a responsible energy policy in the future. Taking into account the sustainable character of the majority of renewable energy technologies, they are able to preserve resources and to provide security, diversity of energy supply and services, virtually without environmental impact. The present paper deals with the description of several applications of renewable energy sources in the area of the South Aegean Sea islands.
   The potential of the most important forms of renewable energy such as solar and wind energy, biomass, photovoltaics and geothermal energy, is investigated and analysed for the majority of the South Aegean Sea islands, while alternative scenarios are assessed and discussed.

AB The liberal revolutions in Spanish America are essentially the result of the adoption of modern constitutions based on the equality of citizens. In Venezuela as well as in Colombia, the new born states declared several times the rule of dictatorship and martial law. How did the patriots arrive at the proclamation of the state of exception in which the army exercised the reality of power? Is the Bolivarian Caesarism the consequence of the war, the result of the strengthening of non liberal tendencies of Liberalism, or the consequence of a resurgence of the Ancien Regime? By analysing the theme of the "fixed point", this article attempts to understand how independent elites searched to stabilize the revolution in a sustainable order, and the reasons for their failure which ultimately led to the dissolution of Gran Colombia.

AB This paper investigates the genetic diversity of one llama (Lama glama) and two guanaco (L. guanicoe) populations in Argentina by the analysis of six dinucleotide microsatellite loci markers derived from llama. Population parameters of the used markers such as allele size and distribution, mean heterozygosity, Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, and population genetic distances were calculated, as well as polymorphic information content (PIC) and exclusion probability (EP). The camelid populations showed high mean heterozygosities and gene diversity values, with little differences between them, in concordance with the observed non-deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Among the total alleles, the analysis showed 25 (45%) private alleles in guanaco and 16 (36%) in llama. The results indicated that the investigated populations have high genetic variability and would be suitable as genetic stocks for conservation and sustainable utilisation programmes.

This article argues that the interest in "bird-friendly" coffees and other forms of biodiversity marketing have much to learn from the 15-year development of another relatively successful, environmentally friendly coffee product: certified organic coffee. This Mexican case study argues that organic coffee emerged as a result of a series of institutional transformations that, in interaction with particular ecosystems, have left their imprint on the agricultural landscape. The emergence of organic coffee in Mexico arose from more than a decade of populist agrarian organizing and accompanying organizational innovations, and depended upon the substantial amount of preexisting "social capital accumulation" in the Mexican countryside. Eco-labeling efforts focus on certification criteria and marketing, and pay insufficient attention to the social processes that can lead to the outcome of a sustainable product and sustainable agricultural landscapes.

AB Development of sustainable-crop production systems depends on identifying effective strategies for the management of postharvest crop residues. The effects of time-of-incorporation (autumn-incorporated [AI] vs. spring-incorporated [SI] and irrigation (irrigated[Irr] vs. nonirrigated [Nirr]) on barley Hordeum vulgare L. straw decomposition and microbial activity were investigated in relation to soil N availability and crop production over one cropping cycle in Canterbury, New Zealand. Over the winter-fallow period, the weight loss of AI barley straw averaged 33% as compared with 18% for surface straw of SI treatments. By harvest, nearly all of the difference in mass loss between AI and SI straw (17%) from NIrr treatments could be attributed to decomposition in the fallow period. Irrigation increased straw decomposition during the cropping period by 68% in AI treatment compared with only 37% in SI treatment. The effect of winter-straw placement on the response of barley straw to summer irrigation was related to the size of the residue-borne microbial populations at the start of the cropping period. Although relatively little N was released (<5 kg N ha(-1)) from decaying barley straw, cultivation, and incorporation of straw in autumn (AI) did result in greater topsoil (0-25 cm) mineral N levels during the winter period as compared with the SI treatment. Overall, Irr and AI of straw increased the dry matter production and N uptake of the summer barley crop, resulting in a concomitant decrease in soil mineral N levels relative to Nirr SI treatments. The mechanisms that explain this difference in crop response to winter residue management require further investigation.

AB The rice (Oryza sativa L.)-wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cropping system occupies about 13.5 million ha in South Asia and is important for the region's food security. We examined the long-term yield trends, changes in soil nutrient fractions (both total and available), and nutrient balances in a 20-yr rice-rice-wheat experiment conducted in the Indo-Gangetic plain of Nepal. The yield of first rice crop fertilized with recommended NPK fertilizer or farmyard manure (FYM) declined an average of 0.09 or 0.07 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively. These 20-yr trends explained only 20 to 21% of the variability in yield, and inexplicable shorter-term yield trends were observed. Likewise, wheat yield declined at 0.05 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1) (with both NPK and FYM) over the 20 yr. However, the yield of second rice crop did not decline over that period. The total and available N and P, and total and labile C contents of soil from Year 10 to 20 were either maintained or increased, but total K and available K declined. The apparent K balance showed net losses of 62.3 and 15.2 kg K ha(-1) yr(-1) with NPK and FYM treatments, respectively. Depletion of soil K and inadequate K fertilization seems to be the primary reasons of limited and declining yield of first rice and wheat crop. In addition, the yield of wheat declined because of a delay in sowing, which was estimated to be 0.04 Mg ha(-1) for each day delay in sowing. The study showed that the current local fertilizer recommendations, particularly for K, for the rice-rice-wheat system are inadequate.

AB Unsuitable land use worldwide has led to environmental degradation. Land use effects on the environmental component of soil quality were assessed in 47 benchmark soils of three natural environments (Xerolls, Xerepts, and Cryepts) in southern Spain. Within each environment, soil groups with traditional land uses were compared with native sites. Soil quality changes were inferred by measuring the relative changes in chemical and physical soil properties. Irrigated terraces, rainfed cropland, and grassland, all within Xerepts, and grazed thyme scrub land were degraded with respect to native sites (significant differences at P < 0.05). In all cases, total porosity, macroporosity, and cation exchange capacity declined by more than 18% (-0.11 cm(3) cm(-3)), 30% (-0.11 cm(3) cm(-3)), and 48% [-10.5 cmol(+) kg(-1)], respectively. Except in irrigated terraces, soil erodibility increased by as much as 59% (+0.16 USLE factor). Substantial losses of soil organic C (37%, -14.7 Mg ha(-1)), available water (52%, -36.2 mm), total N (65%. -1.7 Mg ha(-1)), and rooting depth (68%, -39 cm) were also observed in grassland and thyme scrub land. These changes suggest adverse effects on environmental protection functions of soil because of soil compaction and/or elimination of structural binding agents. Scanning electron microscopy images confirmed these morphological changes in microaggregates. Similar changes did not occur in cropland and grassland within Cryepts or in planted pine forest land. Reforestation with pine (Pinus nigra Arnold, Pinus sylvestris L., and Pinus uncinata Mill. ex Mirb.) provided organic cements and fungal hyphae that reinforce soil aggregation as well as ecologically valuable humus. Because cropland and grassland were able to recover the natural soil properties without human activity, we deduce that Cryepts are resilient.

AB The structure of the soil in the arable layer is controlled by tillage, soil biota activities and weathering, whereas the structure below this layer is mainly the result of the activities of soil biota. Organic farmers tend to minimise the depth of the main tillage operation to encourage soil biota to create a soil structure with continuous biopores and a well crumbled topsoil. The best main tillage operation for preventive weed control, especially important in organic farming, is mouldboard ploughing. The shallow ploughing experiments described in this paper were conducted to ascertain the minimum ploughing depth for an ecologically accountable, sustainable tillage system with good weed control, good land qualities (in terms of workable days, aeration and soil moisture conditions) and finally with good yields. The "ecoplough" used for shallow ploughing was developed by Rumptstad Industries to meet the requirements of relatively shallow ploughing with good soil inversion for weed control. The plough has seven or eight bottoms for ploughing depths of 0.12-0.20 m, a working width of 2.1 m and a working speed of 1.7 m s(-1). Its width is such that the tractor with wide low-pressure tyres runs on top of the land.
   After using the plough for 6 years on Luvisols (> 200 g kg(-1) < 2 mum) in the IJsselmeer polders and on Luvisols (120-160 g k(-1) < 2 mum) in polders near the northern coast of The Netherlands, it was found that compared with conventional ploughing, shallow ploughing required less energy and labour and produced a relatively smooth surface. The latter facilitates the preparation of a seedbed consisting of relatively fine, strong, stable and moist aggregates. Organic matter, soil biota and nutrients were concentrated higher in the profile, influencing the workability of the soil, the growth of weeds and the growth of crops. Most of the yields were similar to yields after conventional ploughing, but weed populations increased when ploughing depth was < 0.2 m. It was concluded that for organic farming on "active" soils (soils subject to shrink/swell with > 200 a ka(-1) < 2 mum), shallow ploughing seems to be the best reduced tillage system. It has several advantages. The main factor determining the minimum ploughing depth is control of weeds, especially of perennials. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Impacts of rotation age changes on growth/removals ratios
SO SOUTHERN JOURNAL OF APPLIED FORESTRY
LA English
DT Article
DE sustainability; forest inventory; inventory projection; modeling
AB When forest managers and policymakers wish to assess the ability of a given forest resource to support a sustainable level of timber harvests, they frequently use growth/removals ratios (G/R) developed from forest inventory data. Recently published inventory data for forests of the southern United States have documented numerous states in which softwood harvests exceed softwood growth, raising concern over the sustainability of this critical resource. At the same time, forest managers in the South have been investing in a wide range of practices that have dramatically increased the growth rates for softwood plantations. As these growth increases are verified in the field, forest managers respond accordingly with adjustments to management regimes, including shortening of rotation lengths. This, in turn, means that the area of forest harvested annually must increase in a given forest estate to approach a regulated forest condition.
   The Timber Inventory, Growth, and Removals model (TIGR) is a spreadsheet model developed to evaluate the impact of shortening rotation length on the growth/removals ratios for managed forests. The model demonstrates that a temporary imbalance of removals over growth results when the rotation age is shortened. Hence, managers and policymakers should use caution when making inferences or public claims about sustainable harvest levels from growth/removals ratios alone. If the public has been convinced that G/R ratios greater than 1.0 imply sustainable harvests, then difficult explanations will be required when the G/R ratio drops below 1.0.

DT Article
AB Objectives of sustainable development are defined for the economic, social and environmental dimension, but for effective compliance as well as for sustainability characteristics such as justice or participation they must be complemented by core institutional objectives. The CSD's set of sustainability indicators was the first one to explicitly take into account the institutional dimension of sustainability, and other organizations such as the World Bank and the OECD have followed. Like most pioneers, the indicators suggested offer significant room for improvement.
   In order to measure the effectiveness of the relevant institutions, Agenda 21 has been analysed regarding its institutional content (organizations, mechanisms, orientations). From this basis, the purposes of the institutions have been determined in a stepwise approach and indicators developed that permit us to measure the progress achieved against the purposes of the respective institution.
   The methodology developed can be applied to other international agreements, providing the basis for an integrated reporting system. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.

AB Knowledge of groundwater recharge rates is essential for developing sustainable groundwater resources management schemes and for assessing the susceptibility of the groundwater system to contamination by leachable nutrients and toxic compounds such as nitrates and pesticides. This study was carried out to develop a method for estimating groundwater recharge in a glacial till aquitard using inverse groundwater modeling based on the USGS modular finite-difference groundwater model. The three-dimensional model incorporated the effects of the various hydrogeologic properties, such as hydraulic conductivity, specific yield, storage coefficient, and porosity, and hydrologic processes influencing recharge such as evapotranspiration and subsurface drainage. The model also accounted for the spatial variability of hydraulic conductivity in the oxidized and unoxidized layers based on geostatistical analysis. The groundwater model was calibrated and validated using years with adequate groundwater data. Inverse modeling was consequently performed using the calibrated model and simulation results yielded generally fair agreement between observed and calculated head distribution. Simulation results indicated that the annual net groundwater recharge for the five-year simulation period considered ranged from 18.7 mm/yr to 33.2 mm/yr constituting approximately 2.3% to 4.3% of the annual precipitation in the area. The recharge estimates are within the typical range of recharge for the humid Midwest. The finite-difference model could serve as an alternative method for estimating groundwater recharge in a glacial till aquitard.

AB We investigate long-term productivity trends in a representative intensive rice cropping system using periodic farm level survey data spanning more than 20 ears of the Green Revolution in two rice bowls of the Philippines, Estimation of production functions with year dummy variables shows substantial declines in productivity from the early 1980s to the mid-1990s. Examination of secondary data shows, however, that the survey years were unrepresentative of long-term trends and were unduly influenced by exogenous yield shocks. Correction for these effects removes the productivity decline, but shows that productivity has stagnated. A renewed emphasis on increasing crop genetic yield potential may be necessary in order to improve productivity and restore the contribution of this important farming system to poverty alleviation.

AB Supported Ni catalysts on perovskite-type CaTiO3, SrTiO3, and BaTiO3 oxides were prepared by the solid-phase crystallization (spc) method and tested for the partial oxidation of CH4 to synthesis gas. The impregnation (imp) method was used for comparison. spc-Ni/SrTiO3 showed the highest activity as well as the highest sustainability against both coke formation and reoxidation of Ni metal, followed by spc-Ni/BaTiO3, spc-Ni/CaTiO3, and then imp-Ni/SrTiO3. The order of the activity was clearly confirmed in the reaction at high space velocity. Both transmission electron microscopy and temperature-programmed reduction showed the presence of finely dispersed and stable Ni metal particles on the catalysts and their amount correlated well with the order of the catalytic activity. It is suggested that incorporation of Ni is enhanced in SrTiO3, followed by BaTiO3, and much less in CaTiO3, resulting in the higher dispersion of Ni metal particles on SrTiO3. Less heat was generated over spc-Ni/SrTiO3 during CH4 oxidation, suggesting that the heating of the catalyst bed by CH4 combustion must be quickly compensated for by endothermic reforming reactions. Oxygen mobility was highest over spc-Ni/SrTiO3 as judged from CO2 pulse measurements. The high sustainability against coke formation may be due to the high activity of finely dispersed nickel metal particles for the reforming reactions partly assisted by the mobile oxygen on the catalyst.

AB Shortly after the initial detection of western flower thrips (WFT), Frankiniella occidentalis (Pergande), in Australia during 1993 a resistance management strategy based on the alternation of chemical groups was implemented. This study aimed to verify this strategy by field testing alpha-cypermethrin against WFT with and without chemical alternation. Up to 114 times alpha-cypermethrin resistance (at LC50) was detected and resistance increased with and without chemical alternation; however, chemical alternation did significantly reduce numbers of thrips compared with a nonalternation strategy. Resistance has the potential to undermine the sustainable use of those chemicals to which there is no current detectable resistance. Consequently, chemicals with a high frequency and level of resistance against WFT need to be identified through monitoring and quickly eliminated from WFT chemical control recommendations.

AB During an investigation into a chronic wasting disease in southern Sudanese cattle, a participatory appraisal method called a 'seasonal calendar' was used to understand local perceptions of seasonal variations in cattle diseases, disease vectors, intermediate hosts and rainfall. Repetition of a standardized seasonal calendar with Dinka informants demonstrated good reproducibility of the method. Comparison of rainfall data produced by seasonal calendars and objective measures of rainfall demonstrated good validity of the seasonal calendar method. Subjective assessment of seasonal calendar scoring patterns by veterinarians indicated that herders' perceptions of seasonal populations of biting flies, ticks and snails were similar to modern veterinary knowledge. The uses of seasonal calendars in veterinary epidemiology are discussed. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Agricultural development strategy for India in the 21st century must be through increasing productivity of the land under cultivation, with reduced costs of production and higher use efficiency of inputs with no harm to the environmental quality. The prime requisite is the promotion of health of the soil-plant-environnient system to be free from economic exploitation under overuse and abuse of the inputs as if with impunity. To this end, a new strategy of promoting ecotechnologies, a blend of traditional practice and modern advances (as agro-ecosystems) replaces existing methods to eliminate its grave consequences. This is the agro-ecosystem management, a prudent design for economic viability of the farmer and ecological sustainability of crop yields, that is elaborated and presented here.

ID BIOLOGY
AB The UN Conference on Environment and Development (1992) helped to mobilize international understanding on promoting the awareness component for conservation and sustainable use of biological resources. As a result, two broad initiatives received focused attention: (i) orientation of education towards improving the capacity of the people to address environment and development issues, and (ii) integrating human dimension component into biological conservation programmes. On account of vastness of the area and prevailing eco-cultural diversity of the country, it is increasingly realized that there is an urgent need to develop programmes to address location/region-specific concerns. In this context, the Indian Himalayan Region (IHR) which represents a unique biogeographic entity, unfortunately, has not received due attention under the changing perspective of conservation science. Nevertheless, a few initiatives, including the present one, have yielded positive results. This paper analyses the results of a systematic conservation education programme (initiated by G.B. Pant Institute of Himalayan Environment and Development) and highlights its potential of becoming a model for the entire IHR.

AB First, the response of an ideal elastic half-space to a line-concentrated impulsive normal load applied to its surface is obtained by a computational method based on the theory of characteristics in conjunction with kinematical relations derived across surfaces of strong discontinuities. Then, the geometry is determined of the obtained waves and the source signature-the latter is the imprint of the spatiotemporal configuration of the excitation source in the resultant response. Behind the dilatational precursor wave, there exists a pencil of three plane waves extending from the vertex at the impingement point of the precursor wave on the stress-free surface of the half-space to three points located on the other two boundaries of the solution domain. These four wave-arresting points (end points) of the three plane waves constitute the source signature. One wave is an inhibitor front in the behaviour of the normal stress components and the particle velocity, while in the behaviour of the shear stress component, it is a surface-axis wave. The second is a surface wave in the behaviour of the horizontal components of the dependent variables, while the third is an inhibitor wave in the behaviour of the shear stress component. An inhibitor wave is so named, since beyond it, the material motion is dying or becomes uniform. A surface-axis wave is so named, since upon its arrival, like a surface wave, the dependent variable in question features an extreme value, but unlike a surface wave, it exists in the entire depth of the solution domain. It is evident from this work that Saint-Venant's principle for wave propagation problems cannot be formulated; therefore, the above results are a consequence of the particular model proposed here for the line-concentrated normal load.

AB The risk of ground water contamination resulting from rapid leaching of highly soluble pesticides can be minimized through the application of the pesticide adsorbed on a matrix or carrier, which limits the amount of pesticide immediately available for undesirable losses. The use of natural materials for this purpose is of special interest in terms of economy and sustainability. In this work the adsorption of the herbicide hexazinone by two montmorillonites saturated with various inorganic and organic cations was determined and the ability of the two clays displaying the highest adsorption capacities [Fe3+-saturated Wyoming montmorillonite, (Fe-SW) and hexadecyltrimethylammonium-saturated Arizona montmorillonite (HDTMA-SA)] to act as carriers for slow release of hexazinone and to reduce herbicide leaching losses was evaluated. Hexazinone formulations based on Fe-SW and HDTMA-SA displayed slow release properties in water and soil/water suspensions, reduced herbicide leaching in soil columns, and maintained herbicidal activity, as compared with the currently available commercial hexazinone formulation (wettable powder). Loosely bound hexazinone-HDTMASA formulations, which led to the slowest breakthrough of hexazinone in soil columns along with the greatest amounts of herbicide released from the clay particles, displayed the most interesting characteristics for their use as slow release formulations and to prevent ground water contamination.

AB A study was conducted to examine the role of nutrition in the development of gastrointestinal (GI) parasitism, performance and pathophysiology of parasitism in female lambs. Forty-four months old ewe lambs received for 6 weeks 0, 1500 or 7000 L-3 larvae of Teladorsagia circumcincta in two doses per week. The animals were given access to a pelleted diet to meet energy requirements for gaining weight close to their potential (H) or approximately 50% of it (L). The level of protein in the diet was 20-30% above requirements for both planes of nutrition.
   Measurements of body weight, serum pepsinogen concentration and faecal egg counts were taken at weekly intervals. All animals were slaughtered 2 weeks after the last larval dosing for estimation of worm count, carcass composition and reproductive tract development. Voluntary intake of infected animals decreased by approximately 10%. Both nutrition and infection influenced lamb performance and carcass composition. However, no direct effects on reproductive tract parameters due to the presence of infection were observed.
   The level of L-3 infection showed a significant effect not only on faecal egg counts and on worm burden, as it could be expected, but also on the proportion of females to males, which increased significantly with the level of infection.
   While the plane of nutrition did not show a significant effect on faecal egg counts or on worm burden, surprisingly, both female worm size and their fecundity decreased significantly with the level of nutrition. This response was accompanied by a significant increase in the concentration of circulating eosinophils suggesting that the immune response of lambs consuming high levels of energy was enhanced compared to that of lambs kept on a restricted diet.
   Results herein show that in young female lambs fed on adequate levels of protein, an improvement in energy supply does not only improve carcass characteristics but clearly enhances the development of resistance to GI nematodes infection. This stay have decisive management implications for the control of parasitic infections in sustainable production system. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Firms' increasing use of external labor arrangements has been difficult to reconcile with resource-based propositions concerning the development of organizational capabilities. We tested hypotheses drawn from the transaction costs perspective to predict which jobs firms would fill through external arrangements rather than through traditional employment relationships. The findings may help to explain the apparent paradox between the increasing externalization of workers and their use as a source of sustainable competitive advantage.

AB Most agricultural landscapes are a mosaic of farmers' fields, semi-natural habitats, human infrastructures (e.g. roads) and occasional natural habitats. Within such landscapes, linear semi-natural habitats often define the edges of agricultural fields. This paper reviews the role and interactions within and between the flora of these elements. In temperate, intensive agriculture, such field margin habitats, which historically had true agricultural functions, now are important refugia for biodiversity. As manmade habitats, field margins may also have important cultural roles as part of our landscape heritage, e.g. hedges in Britain. Whilst field margins are not usually specific habitat types, they contain a variety of plant communities in a variety of structures. These may range from aquatic elements to ruderal and woodland communities.
   Studies demonstrate a variety of interactions between fields and their margins. Agricultural operations, such as fertiliser and pesticide application, have effects on the flora. Some margin flora may spread into crops, becoming field weeds. Margins also have a range of associated fauna, some of which may be pest species, while many are beneficial. either as crop pollinators or as pest predators. The biodiversity of the margin may be of particular importance for the maintenance of species at higher trophic levels, notably farmland birds, at the landscape scale. Margins contribute to the sustainability of production, by enhancing beneficial species within crops and reducing pesticide use. In northwestern Europe, a variety of methods to enhance diversity at field edges have been introduced, including sown grass and flower strips. The impact of these on weed flora and arthropods indicate mostly beneficial effects though conflicts exist, notably for the conservation of rare arable weed species. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

ID HEALTH; DISPARITIES
AB Although community-based research Is intended to be culturally sensitive, more advanced consideration of the impact of race, gender, and class is needed for health disparity research involving women of color. Research processes must permit the simultaneous disclosures of the racial, gender, and class identities among women of color that are assumed and imposed,
   The authoritative knowledge that women of color have about their lives and their health should form the basis for collaboration between researchers and study participants. The dissemination of research findings to study participants, and dialogue on those findings, is imperative for the development of sustainable interventions.

ID CORAL-REEFS; TOURISM; COMMUNITIES
AB Many environmental indicators have been accepted within the tourism industry. However while purporting to represent the environment, indicator research fails to evaluate the ecological impact of tourism. There are well-founded-reasons for this failure, including the ambiguous character of science, which promises a regulatory regime for managing the environmental impact of tourism, but which cannot be delivered. To illustrate this dilemma, the difficulties involved in developing bio-indicators for a coral reef are discussed. The inconclusiveness of current knowledge is illustrated and attention drawn to the disturbing implication that the present situation offers little protection when called upon in the arbitration of land use decisions.

AB While the social impacts of tourism in developing countries have been extensively researched, virtually nothing is known about the changes it initiates in human-environmental relations. In order to investigate this interaction, a survey was conducted in Zanzibar, Tanzania. Evidence suggests that tourism is fundamentally changing the relationships individuals have with society and nature in a way detrimental to the goals of sustainable development. Ultimately, the findings might explain the rapid growth in this industry as a self-reinforcing process. Sustainable tourism-or the notion that development can be managed in an environmentally neutral way-might thus be a contradiction in terms. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB beta-D-Glucopyranosidase (betaG, EC 3.2.1.21) has been isolated from some collateral activities, alpha-L-arabinofuranosidase (Ara, EC 3.2.1.55), alpha-L-rhamnopyranosidase (Rha, EC 3.2.1.40), and o-acetylesterase (Est, EC 3.1.1.53), using a commercial enzyme preparation and a simple method economically sustainable for the food industry. The procedure comprises precipitation of extraneous substances by adding ethanol and CaCl2. ultrafiltration, and adsorption, first on bentonite and then on chitosan. The results obtained were the complete isolation of betaG from the above-mentioned activities, a drastic reduction in extraneous compounds, such as brown substances and polysaccharides, and a slight increase in purification.

AB Promoting indigenous submerged macrophytes is considered an important measure to restore shallow lakes. On the other hand, dense stands of aquatic vegetation often cause nuisance for boating, swimming and by obstruction of water flow. Consequently, the interests of recreational users may conflict with nature conservation. At first sight, aiming lake management at intermediate vegetation biomass seems a good solution for this controversy. However, as can be shown with a simple economical model, such a compromise may not always be an optimal solution in terms of total welfare across all users of a lake. Here, we show that a management strategy aimed at moderate plant biomass can also be unfeasible for ecological reasons. This is shown by applying two very different models: a minimal logistic model of plant growth which is easy to understand, and the relatively complex and realistic simulation model Charisma which, among other things, includes the seasonal cycle and a detailed description of the dynamics of light availability for macrophytes. The qualitative results of both models were remarkably similar. If the ecosystem has no alternative stable states, it is possible to set vegetation to any desired sustainable level using an appropriate harvesting strategy. However, if an intermediate vegetation biomass is to be realized the costs of harvesting are high, because the yield is predicted to be maximal in that case, If the ecosystem has alternative stable states, harvesting becomes risky because the vegetation may collapse entirely below a certain, in practice unknown, biomass. Also, even moderate harvesting may reduce the resilience of the vegetated state, making the ecosystem more vulnerable to adverse conditions such as unfavorable weather conditions or bird grazing.

AB Increased trade in non-timber forest products (NTFPs) has been promoted as one possible means to slow tropical deforestation by increasing the economic value of intact forest. A market survey of NTFPs occurring in the Capim River basin in eastern Amazonia, Brazil demonstrated that the reality for many smallholder communities in frontier and remote regions includes chronic transportation difficulties, high variability in fruit production, perishable products and lack of market expertise. In some communities, declining abundance of NTFPs due to logging and fire has resulted in a lack of forest products to even meet subsistence needs. In areas close to cities where transportation is assured and where forest clearing has eroded the natural occurrence of some valuable native NTFPs, smallholders who manage and successfully market native fruit and medicinal species are overcoming these obstacles. In frontier regions undergoing rapid transformation, however, decline in locally used and regionally marketed NTFPs currently pose detrimental consequences for communities. Findings suggest that an overemphasis on NTFP marketing has diverted attention from local livelihood, resource access and subsistence issues.

AB Very little research has been conducted in the Himalayan and Karakorum Highlands of northern Pakistan on the aspects of biodiversity and conservation. The present research was carried out within the scope of the Pakistan-German Research Project, 'Culture Area Karakorum' which aims to highlight the 'Problems and Prospects of High-Mountain Research' in northern Pakistan. Naltar Valley, IUCN Management Category no. 4, located in the western Karakorums, is a remote area with difficult access. The current venture is two-fold; first, it describes the floral biodiversity of this remote area in northern Pakistan and second, discusses its exploitation by various entities with certain management implications to follow. Collection of species, their preservation and dialogue with the local, rural communities offered information on the plant biodiversity, providing the first extensive list of flora at the primary-valley level including their altitude range, habit and month of occurrence. In total, 153 plant species belonging to 38 families and 113 genera have been recorded after extensive field research in the area. Dominance has been observed for Asteraceae, Polygonaceae, Saxifragaceae and Rosaceae. Twenty-four plant species from Naltar emerged as ethnobotanically important for local medicinal uses and some commercial uses. Indeed, Thymus serpyllum, Gentiana tianshanica, Stellaria graminea, Geranium wallichianum and Capparris spinosa are the most important medicinal plants and their demand has increased, leading to over-exploitation. Cedrus deodara has completely disappeared from Naltar and Willow Salix sp. has almost been eradicated, except in the sub-alpine belts. The diversity of plant species within this remote area is very important for its obvious contribution to a sound mountain ecosystem. Prior to the present venture, not much was known about the floral aspects of this mountainous region of northern Pakistan. Many species are new additions to the plant list in this area. The species are distributed within the altitude range of 1,700-4,000 m and above, and are further explored for their ethnobotanical uses. It is recorded that some species are extensively used by the indigenous communities, some plant collectors from the lowlands and foreigners as well. Extensive grazing, uprooting of plants and soil-slope erosion intensify the environmental problems. A few species are further used for curing diseases through direct usage or marketing in the lowlands. Unfortunately, due to minor local conflicts, the area has been given low priority for its inclusion in the development and conservation programmes going on in other parts of these mountains. On the other hand, hospitable populations have a greater potential for the success of conservation and the wise usage of programmes. Concerted efforts are required to broaden our understanding of the dynamics of floral values as well as local concepts in this remote part of the world, and to check species decline. For sustainable use, in situ and ex situ conservation, controlled harvesting and aforestation may be the solution. Further extensive field conservation/management research is needed.

AB Forest management in temperate and boreal regions is often based on a strong foundation of applied ecological research. Increasingly, this has allowed the needs of saproxylic (dead wood associated) insects to be addressed. However, there has been very little equivalent research in tropical forests, where saproxylic insect faunas are likely to be much richer and where forestry is usually subject to weaker environmental controls. This study compares the saproxylic beetle fauna of old-growth, selectively logged and regrowth rainforest in the Daintree lowlands of northeastern Queensland, Australia. Old-growth levels of abundance, species richness, assemblage composition and guild structure were not maintained in logged and regrowth forest, suggesting that intact assemblages may not survive in the long-term in managed tropical rainforest. However, retaining a continuous supply of commercially overmature trees in the managed stand may prevent a repeat of the widespread extinctions of saproxylic insects witnessed in temperate and boreal forest regions.

AB Six-month long trials were conducted on different vermireactors fed with one of the following forms of water hyacinth: (a) fresh whole plants, (b) dried whole plants, (c) chopped pieces of fresh plants, (d) 'spent' weed taken from reactors after extracting volatile fatty acids (VFAs), (e) precomposted fresh weed and (f) precomposted spent weed. The first four forms were studied with and without cowdung. The experiments revealed three clear trends (i) of the various forms of the weed assessed, the precomposted forms were the most favoured as feed by Eudrilus eugeniae, Kinberg, while the fresh whole form was the least favoured, (ii) the different forms of spent weed were favoured over the corresponding forms of fresh weed, and (iii) blending of cowdung (similar to14% of the feed mass) with different forms of water hyacinth had a significant positive impact on vermicast output, growth in worm zoomass, and production of offspring relative to the corresponding unblended feed. In all reactors, the 'parent' earthworms steadily grew in size over the six-month span, and produced offspring. There was no mortality. The experiments thus confirm that water hyacinth can be sustainably vermicomposted in any of the forms with E. eugeniae. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A growing awareness of the impact of buildings on the environment has created a greater need to take account of environmental factors. To address this effectively. the environmental impact of a building has to be a primary consideration of the design learn. Two approaches are available to the design team to provide clients with assurance that ecological design principles are carried through to construction. These are the comparatively new international environmental management systems standard, ISO 14001. and the slightly older approach of eco-labelling. The two approaches are different but aim at the same goal. This paper explores to what extent these two approaches can achieve their aim of sustainability with the construction industry and questions whether some of the wider issues of sustainability has been ignored.

AB In Japan, several forest-defoliating insects reach outbreak levels and cause serious defoliation. Stand mortality sometimes occurs after severe defoliation. However, in general, tree mortality caused by insect defoliation is low because of the prevailing moist climate in Japan. Evergreen conifers are more susceptible to tree mortality as a result of insect defoliation whereas deciduous broad-leaved trees are seldom killed. Insect defoliation occurs more frequently in man-made environments such as among shade trees, orchards, and plantations than in natural habitats. Outbreaks of some defoliators tend to occur in stands of a particular age: e.g. outbreaks of the pine caterpillar, Dendrolimus spectabilis Butler (Lepidoptera: Lasiocampidae) occur more frequently in young pine plantations. In contrast, defoliation caused by outbreaks of lepidopterous and hymenopterous pests in larch plantations is more frequent with stand maturation. There is a relationship between outbreaks of some defoliators and altitude above sea level. Most outbreaks of forest defoliators were terminated by insect pathogens that operated in a density-dependent fashion. Since the 1970s, Japan has been prosperous and can afford to buy timber from abroad. More recently, there has been an increasing demand for timber in Japan, that coincides with a huge demand internationally, so that the country will need to produce more timber locally in the future. The increasing pressure on the forestry industry to meet this demand will require more sophisticated methods of pest control coupled with more sustainable methods of silviculture.

ID INDONESIA
AB Almost four years after the fall of Soeharto and five after the financial crisis began, Indonesia is still struggling to deal with economic restructuring and recovery political transition, decentralisation and redefining national identity. The nation has regained political and economic stability, but is in fragile condition and is losing reform momentum. Without substantial progress soon, avoiding renewed crises becomes unlikely. Taking advantage of present stability is therefore crucial.
   The economy is far from having been restructured, far from achieving rapid and sustainable growth, and far from regaining the per capita output level of 1997. The democratic transition has become bogged down with three changes of president, elite infighting and a more assertive parliament. The new presidency has brought political stability, as Megawati is likely to survive at least until the next elections. However, fundamental constitutional issues surrounding the direct election of executive figures, district representation, the independence of the judiciary and the role of the People's Consultative Assembly (MPR) require resolution.
   Decentralisation has successfully reached its first birthday. While many of the predicted pitfalls have been avoided, the government must still wrestle with allocation formulae, trade and business restrictions and taxes, minimum wage hikes, treatment of foreign investment and state enterprises, delivery of services, and accountability. Separatism and ethnic and religious chauvinism are testing Indonesia's sense of identity. Separatist movements in Aceh and Papua have gained momentum, despite offers of autonomy, and despite military actions. Ethnic and religious conflicts still flare in Sulawesi, Maluku and Kalimantan. Debate is sharpening on the proper role of Islam in the state, including that of paramilitary and vigilante groups formed to defend Islam and enforce moral values.
   Indonesia's economic growth of 3.3% in 2001 exceeded that of most of its neighbours, but represented a slowing from the 4.8% growth recorded in 2000 and included a marked slowdown in the last quarter. The government has restored relations with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), as witnessed by the recent approval of another Letter of Intent (1,01) and extension of the current program until 2003. However, reforms are lagging, especially in debt restructuring, banking, financial supervision, revenue generation and privatisation. The gloomy international scene has impacted strongly on Indonesia's exports and casts doubts on 2002 growth prospects. Given the slowdown in the economy in the fourth quarter of 2001, lacklustre reform efforts and current poor global prospects, expectations are for somewhat less growth than last year-certainly lower in the first half, but stronger in the second as the world economy picks up.

AB Management of boreal mixedwood forests in Canada has traditionally relied almost exclusively on the clear-cut silvicultural system. In recent years, greater utilization of the hardwood component of boreal mixedwoods and increased societal concerns over maintenance of the integrity and sustainability of these ecosystems has provided impetus for forest managers to consider alternative silvicultural practices in boreal mixedwood forests. Little is currently known, however, concerning the response of soils and vegetation to forest harvesting systems in the mixedwood forests of the Liard River valley, Northwest Territories (NWT). Therefore, the objective of this study was to quantify the effects of patch clear-cut, strip clear-cut, and clear-cut harvesting systems on soil properties and understory vegetation composition and structure. Treatment sites with 3 or 4 years of recovery since harvesting and adjacent uncut forest sites were sampled using transect methodology. Soil samples were collected and understory vegetation community species composition and percent crown cover were assessed in 1-m(2) quadrats. Compared with the range of conditions present in the uncut forest, increases in mineral soil bulk density (2%), exchangeable calcium (7%), LFH horizon thickness (13%), pH (0.2 units), and total organic carbon (5%) and decreases in LFH horizon total nitrogen (6%) and exchangeable potassium (22%) were observed following harvesting. Harvesting resulted in the reduction in crown cover of feathermoss species and increased abundance of shrub and herb species and minimal changes to species composition. Multivariate analysis of the data indicated that the method of harvesting did not result in significant differences in species composition and structure of the understory vegetation community. Overall, winter harvesting of these boreal mixedwood sites did not have a major impact on the majority of soil properties evaluated or on the species composition of the understory vegetation community.

TI Transforming environmental monitoring into action plans: Lessons learned
   from a decade of RADARSAT-1 initiatives in Latin America
SO CANADIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
LA English
DT Article
AB Over the past decade nations around the world have invested scarce resources in civilian radar remote sensing from space, through capital investments in satellites and data-acquisition programs, organizational support for training, technical assistance, and purchases of high-technology equipment and materials. This paper provides a retrospective on major collaborative initiatives that have taken place in Latin American related to RADARSAT-1 over this period and outlines challenges still to be faced if RADARSAT and other imaging radar systems are to reach their full potential to inform operational resource managers and policy-makers. The purpose of this paper is to assess RADARSAT-1 initiatives in Latin America in terms of accomplishments and lessons learned in three areas: (1) technology development, transfer, and exchange between Canadian and Latin American experts; (2) applications to natural resource monitoring and management through the involvement of operational users; and (3) incorporation into international and national policies for sustainable development. RADARSAT-1 achievements are measured in terms of long-term goals described in the EverGreen Plan, a 1989 proposal designed to build indigenous capabilities and encourage operational use and acceptance by political, economic, and business leaders. This assessment is based on the results of a survey of GlobeSAR-2 national coordinators and is set in the context of a review of RADARSAT-1 programs that have taken place in Latin America over the past decade. A thematic analysis of 278 papers presented at the IX Latin American Remote Sensing Symposium is included to highlight resource application areas in which RADARSAT-1 has proven most successful. The authors have played active roles in RADARSAT-1 initiatives during the past 10 years. Christine Nielsen was co-author of The EverGreen Plan, and served as a consultant to Radarsat International (RSI) in 1991, responsible for designing an international education strategy prior to the launch of RADARSAT-1. Tania Sausen is a leader in remote sensing training and education programs at INPE. Over the past ten years she has organized many seminars and training courses, primarily related to ERS. Sausen is President of Technical Commission VI - Education and Communication for the International Society of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing.

AB Only few aspects of photochemistry covering the fundamental photophysical processes, some examples taken from everydays life in the laboratory and from recent advances of solarchemical applications have been discussed in this article. However, it was intended to point to the interdisciplinary character of photochemistry and to clarify its fundamental importance for the modem society. Nature has made use of photochemistry from the early beginnings of life. Although we are still for from a complete understanding of light-driven processes in natural systems we have made much progress in understanding some basic features of photochemical processes in "simple" systems. In future photochemistry will play an important role in developing sustainable industrial processes for environmentally friendly technologies.

AB There is increasing need for efficient management of resources within developed and emerging cities. However, without an adequate framework within which to address relevant issues, there may be no legacy for the next generation in most cities. This paper makes an attempt at highlighting a framework through which an urban center could be established and administered within the and regions. The first part looks at the general background and concepts of sustainable development while the second part highlights the characteristics of the and regions and the pertinent issues that warrant the adoption of sustainable development. The third part draws from the various concepts, to generate a general framework that can be applied in any part of the and regions with little or minimal adjustment. The fourth part makes a passing survey of some regions and cities, which have made use of sustainable development approaches in trying to solve relevant problems of cultural interaction, energy and the economic challenges. Based on observations and analysis drawn from the proposed design framework, the paper concludes that there is need for more research and application of the concept of sustainable development in the and regions.

DE low income countries; Indian cities; urban transport; non-motorized
   transport; sustainable cities
AB Non-motorized transport is an integral element of urban transport in Indian cities. More than 50% of the city residents cannot afford any other mode of transport unless heavily subsidized. Therefore, non-motorized transport has to be given equal priority in designing the urban infrastructure. This paper uses Delhi, India as a case study to indicate that the existing urban transport infrastructure in cities does not meet the needs of a large number of city residents who remain outside the formal planning process. This leads to sub-optimal conditions for all modes of transport. An efficient bus system cannot be designed without taking care of the slow vehicles (non-motorized vehicles, NMVs) on the road. Since sustainable transport systems in Indian cities demand the movement of large number of people by bus transport and NMVs, planning for the latter is indispensable. Planning for non-motorized transport and integrating it with the other modes of city transport is a prerequisite for creating sustainable transport systems, thus leading to sustainable cities.

AB Like many cities in the USA suffering from structural decline, in recent decades the city of Detroit has applied a 'pro-growth' agenda involving the encouragement of development within the core city. More specifically, entertainment and sports-related schemes have been the focus of this agenda in recent years. However, the use of such schemes to achieve broader regeneration aims presents problems as well as benefits. The case of Detroit shows that the value of such an approach is by no means certain, and it highlights the importance of the governance context in providing the motivation for, as well as the means of applying, such an approach.

AB This paper discusses the inter-related concepts of sustainable urban development and CPTED (crime prevention through environmental design). It argues that a 'safer' and 'sustainable' community must be characterised by the image of regulation, or at least some control of real and imagined threats to personal or community health and the threat of crime and personal attack. Planners and urban designers have a growing awareness and experience of 'sustainable development' and are beginning to consider the capacity of the built environment to reduce both the fear of crime and the potential for offending. This paper concludes that a synthesis of the two concepts can represent a meaningful contribution towards crafting an effective strand of 'urban environmentalism' that can be utilised to facilitate the design of safer, more liveable and sustainable urban communities.

AB An assumption underlying the growing support for marine protected areas (MPAs) is that they meet conservation goals and provide economic benefits to fisheries and ecotourism. However, support for MPAs will be at risk if managers cannot assess whether various MPA objectives are being fulfilled. Current approaches to MPA management emphasize the need to evaluate performance criteria; however, there is little consensus on criteria and their evaluation.
   We propose a marine protected area evaluation model (MPAEM), based on and modified from a multidisciplinary approach used to assess the sustainability of fisheries, called rapid appraisal of fisheries (Rapfish). The application of the MPAEM was explored in a pilot study of 20 MPAs located in different regions of the world. Results indicate that the MPAEM can be used to evaluate MPA management effectiveness. However, the manner in which the evaluation attributes are scored and ways of engaging user groups should be explored before MPAEM can become part of the day-to-day management of MPAs.

AB In many parts of the world there is an urgent need for landscape restoration to conserve biodiversity. Landscape restoration is not straightforward, however, because many issues and processes must be understood for effective action to take place. In an attempt to guide restoration efforts for biodiversity, conservation, Lambeck (1997, 1999) developed a taxon-based surrogate scheme called the focal-species approach. The focal-species approach involves the identification of a suite of species targeted for the management of threatening processes and vegetation-restoration efforts. Together, their "requirements for persistence define the attributes that must be present if [the landscape] is to meet the needs of the remaining biota" (Lambeck 1999). Some of our concerns with the focal-species approach include the following, first, the underlying theoretical basis of the focal-species approach is problematic. As part of a taxon-based surrogate scheme, a suite of focal species is presumed to act collectively as a surrogate for other elements of the biota, But taxon-based surrogate schemes have had limited success everywhere they have been applied. Second, the focal-species approach may be unsuitable for practical implementation, primarily because of the lack of data to guide the selection of a set of focal species in the majority of landscapes. We argue that restoration strategies should be based on appropriate theory, realistic assessment of available information, and an achievable outcome for the hind managers who own or control the majority of land in the most significantly affected landscapes. Given the potential limitations of the focal-species approach, a mix of different strategies should be adopted in any given landscape and between different landscapes to spread risk of failure of any one approach. We believe that it is important to rouse awareness about the potential limitations of the focal-species approach and to ensure that land managers do not assume it will inevitably lead to the conservation of all biota in a landscape.

TI Accrual budgeting and fiscal consolidation in the EMU
SO CONTEMPORARY ECONOMIC POLICY
LA English
DT Article
ID INSTITUTIONS
AB Drawing on modern macroeconomic literature focusing on the study of politico-institutional determinants of public policies, this article analyzes the institutional design of the European fiscal policy laid down by the Treaty of Amsterdam and the Stability and Growth Pact. Both documents provide countries in the EU, and in particular those that have adopted the euro, with a common code of fiscal conduct that is expected to uphold discipline in the management of government finances. Nevertheless, a simple review of this code of conduct shows the existence of serious drawbacks mainly derived from the asymmetry between the treatment given to outcomes of fiscal policy in comparison with that given to the procedures followed in generating them. It seems that the current design of the European fiscal coordination system does not really take into account the findings of modern macroeconomics and does not pay due attention to the relation between budgetary processes/institutions and outcomes in fiscal policy. Moreover; this article argues that in the implementation of the broad reforms needed to achieve a sustainable fiscal consolidation, there are political complementarities (in the sense that the ability to gain political consent for one reform depends on the acceptance of other reforms) between the setting tip of new fiscal policies of expenditure containment and new fiscal procedures.
   All in all, this analysis points to a sorely needed procedural reform in public sector budgeting as the best contribution to pursuing the stabilization of European public finances: the fuller use of accrual concepts in budget reporting. Much more than an isolated technical exercise, the shift to accrual budgeting could be quite a useful tool to facilitate wider reforms aimed at improving public sector financial management and performance while enhancing transparency and accountability.

ID NATURAL-PRODUCTS
AB Bioprospecting has been viewed by many scholars as a possible solution to sustainable forestry utilisation and enhanced benefit to all involved stakeholders (Sitten, 1996). This initiative is being followed by the Kenya Forestry Research Institute (KEFRI) in collaboration with local and international bodies. A well-defined bioprospecting framework minimises suspision, biopiracy and generate wealth, both in knowledge and monetary, terms which is spread upto the grass-root level. Current bioprospecting of lesser-developed and highly potential indigenous plant, Mondia whytei (Asclepiadaceae) is showing interesting results. The study has shown that this plant is highly, regarded by the Luhya tribe of Western Kenya for spiritual enrichment, subsistence and commercial purposes (Mukonyi, 1999; Mukonyi, 1998). It is estimated that through domestication a well-managed acre piece of land can generate over US$ 3,300 per year. With the current practice of obtaining Mondia from natural forests, each dealer earns a maximum of US$ 3,600 annually Presented in this report are interim results, based on socio-economic surveys, chemical analysis, product development and marketing. Technological transfer through domestication of M. whytei is being undertaken through community based initiatives M. whytei is currently being exploited unstainably from the wild and the demand outstrip supply therefore making it threatened. In some areas of Western Kenya, it has been completely wiped out. The situation is compounded by the fact that there are no thorough scientific studies that have been contacted to establish its value and provide possible solution for enhanced conservation and sustainable utilization. From the on going studies, the main flavouring principle found in the roots has been identified 2-hydroxy - 4 - methoxy - benzaldehyde. Technology For processing raw roots based on the Flavouring principle (Mukonyi and Ndiege, 1999; Mukonyi and Ndiege, 1998;) has been developed thus, increasing the market Value of Mondia products by 75%. The nutritional value in terms of mineral and protein content hail, been analysed. Propagation studies have been carried out and about 50,000 seedlings have been domesticated by local communities in Western Kenya.

ID HIGH RAINFALL AREAS
AB Combating soil degradation and desertification are among the most crucial aspects of forward-looking policy action to promote sustainable land use while improving household food security. Increasing population pressure coupled with the scarcity of suitable land for cultivation, have led to the reduction of traditional fallow periods by most farmers, with consequent land deterioration. A study is underway in Zambia to validate and adapt soil management techniques in order to arrive at fanning systems that yield sustained food production with minimum depletion of renewable and non-renewable resources, and thus reducing the need for shifting cultivation. The comparative efficacy of 1 year improved fallow systems using 3 different leguminous tree species planted in pure stands to improve soil fertility and intercropped with maize to improve household food security by adding economic value to the fallow is being evaluated. Significant differences (P<0.05) were observed in the branches of Leucaena diversifolia, Cajanus cajan and Cassia siamea as influenced by maize, while the establishment and growth of maize were not significantly affected by any of the trees L. diversifolia proved to be a better Nitrogen fixer compared to pigeon pea (C. cajan) and C. siamea Lowest soil mineral Nitrogen concentrations were recorded in plots of Cassia both in sole and intercropped plots. Significantly higher (P<0.05) maize grain yields were obtained in plots where maize was intercropped with L. diversifolia (6.73 t/ha) compared to the control (sole maize) which yielded 4.22 t/ha, while maize grown in association with C. cajan yielded lowest (2.33 t/ha). The economic value of planted fallows was increased by intercropping trees with maize during the first year.

AB Land use planners have the challenge of incorporating biologically sound guidelines into development plans to balance human development with conservation of natural resources. Valued as an important component of the natural heritage of the northeastern United States, anadromous river herring (Alosa pseudoharengus, A. aestivalis) represent a model system to look at how ecological data can help conserve biological diversity in systems impacted by humans. Juvenile river herring spend 3-7 months in freshwater then migrate to the ocean. However, factors that trigger migration, and consequently influence distribution and abundance, are not well understood. Thus, our objectives in this study were to (1) describe juvenile river herring migration patterns, both "peak" (>1000 fish/wk) and "all" (>30 fish/wk) migration; (2) identify potential cues for this migration; (3) examine effects of one, type of ecosystem alteration, low water levels, on river herring; and (4) suggest how this information can be incorporated into an effective conservation plan. Weekly during June-November 1994, we sampled both migrating and nonmigrating river herring and seven associated abiotic and biotic variables in one continuous and one intermittent flow system on Cape Cod, Massachusetts. We then used multiple logistic regression to predict when juvenile river herring migrate. In the continuous-flow system, juvenile river herring migration primarily occurred during the midday hours from July through early November, with the peaks of migration, comprising >96% of all migrating fish observed in early July and early September.. The peaks of migration occurred during the new moon, when Bosmina spp. density was low, and all periods of migration occurred when water visibility was low, during decreased amounts of rainfall. In the intermittent flow system, juvenile river herring migration was frequently inhibited due to low water levels, and herring were on average 25 mm smaller than those in the continuous flow system. Using these results, managers can more effectively monitor river herring populations by identifying factors associated with migration and isolating critical flow periods when fish movement is likely to occur. Thus, we can detect changes in herring population size due to human impacts. Ultimately, these data can be incorporated into an ecologically sound conservation plan for juvenile anadromous herring that may help ensure their survival while balancing human needs for natural resources.

AB The present paper sets out to aid in the development of 'environmental load displacement' indicators. Developing the notion of the 'environmental memory' of physical flows, we estimated embodied pollution in trade of 18 industrialized countries with (a) the rest of the world and (b) developing countries, from 1976 to 1994. We found that in the last years of analysis, total imports of Japan, USA and Western Europe have entailed, in general, larger air pollutant emissions than local exports, The balance of embodied emissions in trade (BEET) seems to follow an inverted-U shape across time in Japan and Western Europe, and an N-shape in the US. In the period of analysis, Japanese and European environmental terms of trade with developing countries 'improved' (from the Japanese and European point of view), whereas American environmental terms of trade with developing countries 'deteriorated' over time. Although there is no statistical trend between income and embodied emissions in imports in a cross-section analysis, there does seem to be a positive relationship between both variables at a national level. The results suggest that, despite many shortcomings. this type of assessment may shed useful insights on the international aspects of sustainable development. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB This paper explores the limitations of conventional economic analysis of intergenerational problems and examines some of the alternatives suggested in the literature. It is argued that proper consideration of future generations has at least three requirements. First, when future costs and benefits are considered, it should be taken into account that they are to be enjoyed by different generations. Second, the sustainability requirement should be adopted, This represents an equity commitment to the future and implies the recognition that future generations have the right to nondeteriorated ecological and economic capacity. The paper studies the ways in which the recognition of these rights might be incorporated into economic evaluation and management. Third, an appropriate institutional network to enforce the recognition of these rights in decision-making processes should be constituted. Its design and necessary functions are also analyzed.

AB This study is a survey of agriculture practices and pest management strategies among rice and rice-fish farmers in the Mekong Delta. Based on an economic comparison between different farmer categories, it is argued that rice-fish fanning provides a sustainable alternative to rice monoculture, if the farmer takes full advantage of the natural productivity of the rice field ecosystem. The aim should be to reduce the resource use, avoid overuse of agrochemicals and improve production efficiency through increased recycling of nutrients and matter, Integrated pest management (IPM) strategies should thus be adopted as a necessary complement to fish farming practices. IPM rice-fish farmers have the highest net income (19 500 000 VND per year ha(-1)), due to comparatively low costs and high yields of both rice and fish, Also IPM rice-farmers have a high net income (18 400 000 VND per year ha(-1)). Their productions cost are lower, but their rice yield is similar to that of non-IPM rice farmers.

AB The ecological requirements to drastically increase the productivity of materials use call for improvements in the efficiency of consumption. This (eco-)efficiency discussion often takes a functional view on consumption, noting that present consumption is inefficient and that it is not the products that the consumers want, but the services that the products yield. However. contemporary consumption serves many needs that are not functional and universal, but subjective and obscured from the producers. This paper develops a time use approach towards consumption, which makes allowance for the subjectivity of needs. while still enabling the analysts to approach the concept of a sustainable lifestyle. A distinctive premise of the analysis is that it assumes time and money not to be interchangeable and consumption to be limited by available consumption time instead of purchasing power, This approach is demonstrated by linking the direct and the indirect energy use of Finnish two-person households to the data of a national time use survey. The results are used to point out some of the potential time use rebound effects of such new eco-efficient services that transfer activities from private households to the market actors.

ID EMISSIONS
AB We present calculations on the sustainable national income (SNI) indicator. first proposed by Hueting, which corrects net national income (NNI) for the costs to bring back environmental resource use to a 'sustainable' level. Using an applied general equilibrium (AGE) model specifying 27 production sectors, we calculate different variants of SNI for the Netherlands in 1990, given a set of pre-determined sustainability standards. The AGE model is extended with emissions and abatement cost curves, based on large data sets for nine environmental themes. The model combines the advantages of a top-down approach (the AGE model) with the information of a bottom-up approach (the environmental data and data on emissions reductions costs). The presented numerical results show that in 1990 Dutch SNI is about 50% below NNI. though many uncertainties are still present in the data and the model. The enhanced greenhouse effect is the most expensive environmental theme. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Population and environment debates regarding Africa, whether Malthusian or Boserupian in nature, focus on populatior levels as the driving force behind the relationship between environment and society. This article argues, instead, that how people adjust to their rise in numbers is more important than are population levels. It focuses on the role of local informal institutions, such as land tenure systems, but also on customs, norms, and networks, and their change over time in mediating the relationship between people. and the environment. The article is based on fieldwork conducted between 1995 and 1998 in the Sahelian and Sudano-Sahelian zones of Africa, as well as on a review of colonial documents pertaining to the area written in the first half of the twentieth century. The article concludes that adaptations made to local, informal institutions within the past century have enabled an environmentally sustainable land use within the context of a rising population and growing scarcity of natural resources.

AB Heavily doped cadmium tin oxide (CTO) film electrodes were developed for fast electron exchange with redox proteins. The metal oxide films showed nearly reversible electron transfer for the [2Fe-2S] proteins spinach ferredoxin (Sp fd) and putidaredoxin (Pdx), and the well-studied heme protein horse heart cytochrome c. These represent a family of proteins that are of comparable size, but vary significantly in overall charge, formal redox potential, and type of metal center. The unmediated electron exchange was achieved through variation of metal oxide film synthesis parameters that led to an increase of the charge carrier concentration up to the levels typical for degenerate semiconductors. In addition, the flat band potential of the films was shifted close to or more positive of the formal redox potentials of proteins such that the semiconductor electrodes would be utilized in an accumulation mode. The rates and sustainability of electron transfer for the two ferredoxins obtained on these cadmium tin oxide electrodes are as high or higher than previously reported.

SO ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING D-SOCIETY & SPACE

ID SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
AB The recent work in critical geopolitics problematizes the notion of boundaries and interrogates the narratives, ideologies, and institutions that inform processes of boundary making, or 'reborderings'. From the perspective of critical geopolitics, boundary making for conservation purposes is understood as an act of power embedded within a discourse of environmental geopolitics. Through reborderings, environmental geopolitics thus reflects and informs everyday practices and relations of power between local, state, and international actors. In this paper I illustrate a process of rebordering in Trinidad, the West Indies, in which local, state, and international actors engaged in a contest to define conservation boundaries and produce bounded identities within the Nariva Swamp. Rebordering in the Nariva Swamp reflected and influenced state and local practices in complex ways, altered relations of power on multiple levels, and led to the production of a bounded space that is simultaneously local and global.

DT Article
AB This paper describes the key role that city authorities and their civil societies should play in mediating the relationship between economic globalization and human development so that cities act not only as engines of growth but also as agents for greater social justice and environmental sustainability. In a globalizing and urbanizing world, urban governments have a much more important role in guaranteeing that citizen Heeds are met and citizen rights arc respected. This is not a conventional public-sector-led, professionally determined role but one more rooted in participatory democracy and partnerships with citizens, both to redress the limits of market mechanisms and to ensure urban livability.

TI Export processing zones and the quest for sustainable development: a
   Southern African perspective
SO ENVIRONMENT AND URBANIZATION
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper discusses why export processing zones (EPZs) provide little prospect for addressing Southern Africa's economic problems while also threatening not only labour standards but also greater regional cooperation. It describes the "race to the bottom" as governments in the region compete for foreign investment by lowering labour standards, often restricting union rights and offering incentives to foreign firms that are so costly that they greatly limit the net benefits of the new investments to the national or local economy(while providing considerable benefits for foreign investors and shareholders). The paper then examines detail the costs and benefits of Namibia's EPZs which, despite generous 011S concessions and controls on labour unions, produced only 400 nczojobs in the first three years compared to the 25,000 anticipated. It also explains how the granting of EPZ status to mining companies and refineries will diminish government revenues, and describes the heavy investment and costly incentives offered to attract a new textile company.

TI Democratic governance fairytale or real perspective? Lessons from
   Central America
SO ENVIRONMENT AND URBANIZATION
LA English
DT Article
ID HEALTH
AB This paper examines the concept of democratic local governance and its relevance for health development in Central America, a region which was torn apart by conflict in the 1980s. Peace-building has been taking place since the 1990s in a difficult macro-level context, as stabilization and structural adjustment policies in the postwar period have led to drastic state reforms with high social costs for the marginalized population. Innovative experiences and strategies in health have also developed in the region over the last decades, based upon local participatory governance, contributions to public health policy, development and peace-building at the local level. This article describes two of these municipal health development processes, the SILOS (Local Health Systems) in the northern zone of San Salvador, El Salvador and the municipal health process in Leon, Nicaragua. The paper examines the relevance and sustainability of these local initiatives and the importance of democratic local governance for (health) development. It also analyzes the extent to which macro-level reform policies have enabled the development of these processes and perspective for sustainability of democratic local governance in countries confronted by serious lack of governability. Whilst the imperative for reform/change is beyond doubt, as well as the advances booked in terms of local democratic governance and health, the authors underline the need to address the incoherence in global reform policies and - in the current situation - the impossibility of achieving democratic governance and equity in health within the confines of the city. Finally, the authors question the relevance of a development paradigm that does not address democratic local governance and existing structural (political, social, economic) inequalities.

TI Sustaining markets or sustaining poverty reduction?
SO ENVIRONMENT AND URBANIZATION
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper suggests that too much attention may be given to financial sustainability within projects whose objective is to reduce urban poverty. External agencies might usefully recognize the long history and remarkable persistence that charitable giving and state redistributive processes have shown whilst markets sometimes fail. Experience suggests that poverty reduction - higher and more stable incomes, stronger asset bases, secure adequate-quality homes with basic infrasructure and services and protection from the law-may best be achieved by increasing the capacity of urban poor groups, individually and collectively, to draw on the market, the state and charitable finance (including grants or soft loans from international and domestic sources) to reduce their poverty. It is support for this capacity of urban poor groups that needs to be sustained. Market mechanisms can play important roles-as shown by the key role of savings and credit schemes organized and managed by the urban poor themselves. But these arc a means, not ends in themselves. And market mechanisms may be most easily and readily used by those who are not the poorest.

TI Durban's Local Agenda 21 programme: tackling sustainable development in
   a post-apartheid city
SO ENVIRONMENT AND URBANIZATION
LA English
DT Article
AB Durban's Local Agenda 21 programme has been at the forefront of the Local Agenda 21 movement hi Southern Africa since the mid-1990s. This paper describes the first four phases of the programme, 1994-2001. The paper also outlines the difficulties faced in localizing the sustainable development concept in Durban. Key amongst these challenges was the initiation and development of the programme during a period of local government transformation and restructuring. The perception that Local Agenda 21 has a "green" focus and is "anti-development" (due to its location within an environmental department) has also resulted in a lack of proactive and sustained political support. These problems have been exacerbated by limited human and financial resources, which have restricted the programmes capacity to build support and consensus amongst stakeholders. Durban's Local Agenda 21 programme has, however, helped keep sustainable development on the city's agenda and has provided a mechanism through which local stakeholders can interact with local government around environmental management issues. The paper concludes with a section on the lessons learned and factors required to ensure future progress.

AB Restored soils are often low in organic matter (OM). As a result, OM is applied to increase soil fertility. Earthworms can assist soil incorporation of OM, but feeding behaviours, and as a result their roles in this process, differ between species. Laboratory experiments examined the effects of OM availability on the growth and behaviour of Aporrectodea longa and Lumbricus terrestris. Hatchling growth was recorded from 11 vessels containing soil and OM (separated cattle solids), either surface applied (SUR) or mixed into the soil (MIX). Growth of L. terrestris was also recorded where separated cattle solids (SCS) were concentrated in bands at the surface (SUR) or at depths of 0.03 (UPP) or 0.08 m (LOW). In a further experiment, L. terrestris and L. rubellus were kept in mono-species cultures and paired combination, in treatments with selected SCS placements, which allowed assessment of OM position on species interactions. After 28 weeks, both L. terrestris and A. longa exhibited significantly greater growth rates (P < 0.05) in SUR treatments. The behaviour of both species changed with time. L. terrestris were located in areas where OM was concentrated. After 24 weeks, mean masses of 3.1, 2.2 and 1.6 g were recorded for SUR, UPP and LOW treatments, respectively. Where L. rubellus and L. terrestris were co-cultured, the former had significant (P < 0.05) negative effects on the growth of the latter, but only when surface OM was limited. At restored sites, application of OM may be important in the development of sustainable earthworm populations and hence their role in soil amelioration.

AB Soil fertility constraints to crop production have been recognized widely as a major obstacle to food security and agro-ecosystem sustainability in sub-Saharan West Africa. As such, they have led to a multitude of research projects and policy debates on how best they should be overcome. Conclusions, based on long-term multi-site experiments, are lacking with respect to a regional assessment of phosphorus and nitrogen fertilizer effects, surface mulched crop residues, and legume rotations on total dry matter of cereals in this region. A mixed model time-trend analysis was used to investigate the effects of four nitrogen and phosphorus rates, annually applied crop residue dry matter at 500 and 2000 ka ha(-1), and cereal-legume rotation versus continuous cereal cropping on the total dry matter of cereals and legumes. The multi-factorial experiment was conducted over four years at eight locations, with annual rainfall ranging from 510 to 1300 mm. in Niger, Burkina Faso, and Togo With the exception of phosphorus. treatment effects on legume growth were marginal. At most location,;, except for typical Sudanian sites with very low base saturation and high rainfall, phosphorus effects on cereal total dry matter were much lower with rock phosphate than with soluble phosphorus, unless the rock phosphate was combined with an annual seed-placement of 4 kg ha(-1) phosphorus. Across all other treatments, nitrogen effects were negligible at 300 turn annual rainfall but at 900 mm, the highest nitrogen rate led to total dry matter increases of up to 77% and, at 1300 mm, to 183%. Mulch-induced increases in cereal total dry matter were larger with lower base saturation, reaching 45% on typical acid sandy Sahelian soils, Legume rotation effects tended to increase over time but were strongly species-dependent.

AB Background. The 1993 directive Tomorrow's Doctors recommended an increase in community-based teaching. In response, many new programmes have been established focusing on the teaching of clinical skills to pairs or groups of students in general practice, when patients are asked to see the students in the practice or in their homes, specifically to assist with teaching. This differs from the traditional model of teaching primary care, when one student sits with the doctor while s/he consults. Although current research suggests that patients are happy for one student to be present during a consultation with their GP, little or nothing is known about their views of this new method of teaching basic clinical skills in the community. If the new community-based teaching programmes are to be sustainable, continuing support from the patients is necessary. Students have been taught clinical skills in the community at University College London Medical School for several years. Research has demonstrated its effectiveness and its popularity with students. However, to date, patients' views have not been explored.
   Objective. Our aim was to determine the patients' views and feelings on community-based teaching, in order to discover both the positive and negative aspects for participating patients.
   Method. A qualitative semi-structured interview study was carried out in undergraduate teaching general practices in North London.
   Results. Respondents felt very positive about participating in the community-based teaching programme. There were two underlying components to this: altruism and personal gain. Within altruism, reasons included: provision of a service to the community and repaying the system. Aspects of personal gain included: improved knowledge, improved self-esteem and companionship. Patient concerns included: embarrassment, reinforcement of the sick role and concerns about student access to notes.
   Conclusions. Patients enjoy their involvement in community-based teaching and perceive themselves as making a valuable contribution. The findings of the research will be reassuring for doctors who presently are involved and those who plan to be involved in the future. Doctors need to be aware of the possible shifts in the doctor-patient relationship when actively seeking patients' help in the teaching.

AB To date, aquatic feeds have depended heavily on fishmeal and fish oil as their source of protein and lipid. However, the feed industry is encountering shortfalls in the availability of these ingredients because of a decline in the number of fish captured in the wild and the increased human demand for some of the species currently being used for fishmeal and oil production. Therefore, efforts are now being directed in different parts of the world to finding alternative quality ingredients, which ideally are less expensive and readily available for use in practical diets. The data accrued have shown that a large proportion of both fishmeal and fish oil can be replaced by other protein and lipid sources. However, it is emphasized that an optimal essential amino acid balance be maintained and that the n-3 highly unsaturated fatty acid requirement be satisfied when combining economical protein and lipid ingredients. Newly developed feeds should aim at being nutrient-dense in order to reduce the output of solid, P and N waste. This can be done through improving nutrient availability, optimizing the digestible protein to energy balance of the diet, and replacing dietary fishmeal with alternate ingredients. These diets should also be effective for maintaining good health and improving disease resistance in fish through enhancement of immune responses. A wholesome approach to culturing fish would be to use appropriate feeding standards that are aimed not only at improving economic returns but also at developing a lasting cohabitation of sustainable aquaculture and a cleaner environment. Furthermore, in the 21st century aquaculture would still retain its place as a prominent source of food protein, signifying that fish feed research remains a forceful area in discovering better feeds for the industry.

AB Status of the southeastern U.S. stock of red porgy (Pagrus pagrus) was estimated from fishery-dependent and fishery-independent data, 1972-97. Annual population numbers and fishing mortality rates at age were estimated from virtual population analysis (VPA) calibrated with fishery-independent data. For the VPA, a primary matrix of catch at age was based on age-length keys from fishery-independent samples; an alternate matrix was based on fishery-dependent keys. Additional estimates of stock status were obtained from a surplus-production model, also calibrated with fishery-independent indices of abundance. Results describe a dramatic increase in exploitation of this stock and concomitant decline in abundance. Estimated fully recruited fishing mortality rate (F) from the primary catch matrix increased from 0.10/yr in 1975 to 0.88/yr in 1997, and estimated static spawning potential ratio (SPR) declined from about 67% to about 18%. Estimated recruitment to age 1 declined from a peak of 3.0 million fish in 1973-74 to 94,000 fish in 1997, a decline of 96.9%. Estimated spawning-stock biomass declined from a peak of 3530 t in 1979 to 397 t in 1997, a decline of 88.8%. Results from the alternate catch matrix were similar. Retrospective patterns in the VPA suggest that the future estimates of this population decline will be severe, but may be less than present estimates. Long-term and marked declines in recruitment, spawning stock, and catch per unit of effort (both fishery-derived and fishery-independent) are consistent with severe overexploitation during a period of reduced recruitment. Although F prior to 1995 has generally been estimated at or below the current management criterion for overfishing (F equivalent to SPR=35%), the recent spawning-stock biomass is well below the biomass that could support maximum sustainable yield. Significant reductions in fishing mortality will be needed for rebuilding the southeastern U.S. stock.

AB The anthropogenic nature of Andean ecosystems is discussed in the framework of tree-line dynamics in selected sites in Ecuador. Indicators of human impact are evidence of the need for a scientific understanding of neotropical mountains that is better in tune with the special conditions of tropical Andean environments. Tropandean systems are neither tropical ecosystems nor midlatitude regions, and lessons from ecologically damaging activities in those ecosystems cannot be transferred readily to Tropandean systems. Better research from the ethnobiological and ecological fronts is needed if we are to comprehend the intricate functions of neotropical mountains, particularly the cloud-forest belt, which is regarded as the most threatened ecosystem when considering sustainability scenarios.

AB This article explores the results and implications of enabling pupils to create their own multimedia sequences in relation to local wildlife areas within easy reach of schools. The research, based on personal experience in the media and teaching about environmental matters over 20 years, employed what Bassey (1995) calls 'common-sense theory' using knowledge gleaned and moulded over those 20 years, informed by the constant comparative method (Glaser and Strauss, 1968). The approach was interventionist, where a change was made to an existing situation and the consequences studied. The result suggests that there could be an important role for information communication technology in relation to wildlife sites and the recent New Opportunities Fund focus on green spaces ansd sustainable communities sponsored by the UK national lottery.

AB Restoration of sustainable geomorphic processes that create floodplain topography through development of sand-splay complexes at intentional breaches is one method to promote variability in physical structure needed for habitat restoration. The topography of splay complexes pro,, ides a range of floodplain elevations that creates local variability in (i) inundation duration and frequency and depth to ground water that influence riparian vegetation establishment; and (ii) flow depth and velocity that create refuge for fish. Two intentional levee breaches along the lowland Cosumnes River, Central Valley, CA, were evaluated during water years 1999 and 2000 in order to document changes in morphology and relief associated with deposition of sandsplay complexes. During the study period, annual peak-flow recurrence intervals ranged from similar to 1 to 3 years, and water flowed through the breaches for a minimum of 55 days during water year 1999 and 53 days during water year 2000. At the two study sites, rapid vertical accretion and scour occurred within the first several years after intentionally breaching the levee at the Accidental Forest floodplain (constructed in 1995) and at the Corps Breach floodplain (constructed in 1997). Splay complexes are organized into a variety of landforms, including lateral levees and lobes separated by new floodplain channels. Maximum deposition measured on the splay surface is 0.36 m/year, while maximum scour in channels is 0.27 m/year. Juxtaposition of floodplain splay deposition and adjacent channel scour creates relief ranging from similar to 1.6 to 0.25 m that decreases with distance from the breach and that becomes more pronounced over time as higher magnitude floods scour channels in the old floodplain sediment and deposit new sand and silt onto the surface of the splay. The ratio of splay complex height to depth of formative flow, is estimated as similar to 0.4. Progradation of main and secondary splay channels takes place by down-floodplain sand transport (25 m/year maximum). Large wood recruited onto the floodplain through the breach promotes local scour and deposition that enhances topographic variability. At one of the study sites, initial grading of a low setback berm prior to opening the breach forced a change in floodplain flow direction and the geometry of the splay complex. Additionally, progradation of the complex is arrested by an excavated pond that creates a sediment trap, We present a conceptual model that describes the importance of floods in constructing and modifying sand-splay complexes that create floodplain topography. The potential habitat variability created as floodplain topography evolves is the linkage between physical and ecological processes that are critical for restoration. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB In Limfjorden, Denmark, an extensive mussel fishery exploits the wild stocks of Mytilus edidis with annual landings of 80,000-100,000 t of mussels. During the last 10 years the impact of mussel dredging on the ecosystem has been studied, including the effect of resuspension of sediment and nutrients and the impoverishment of in- and epi-fauna assemblages. Furthermore, dredging changes the physical structure and complexity Of the seabed which affects mussel growth and interactions among zoobenthic species. The blue mussel constitutes the dominant fraction of the zoobenthic suspension feeders, and is important for the transport of material and energy from the pelagic to benthic systems and the control of phytoplankton biomass. In order to evaluate the impact on clearance capacity of a reduction in mussel densities due to mussel dredging, mussel filtration activity measured in situ has been related to the mixing of the water column and the amount of near-bed phytoplankton. Fishery practice for mussel dredging in Limfjorden is discussed in relation to its known impact on the ecosystem and the ecological role of the mussels, and modifications towards an ecosystem management approach and a more sustainable fishery are suggested. The suggested modifications include: a fishery practice where the mussel beds are thinned out when the mussels have attained good quality, and a transplantation practice of mussels from areas with a high mortality to areas with a high growth rate. Both practices intensify the production in a certain area, leaving other areas open for alternative production or for permanent closure for the benefit of the benthic flora and fauna. In addition, other shellfish species represent interesting new resources for fishing or aquaculture. Habitat restoration, such as the relaying of mussel shells from the mussel industry, is another important management tool that should be included in an ecosystem management approach of the mussel fishery.

AB Groundwater overexploitation and aquifer overexploitation are terms that are becoming common in water-re-sources management. Hydrologists. managers and journalists use them when talking about stressed aquifers or some groundwater conflict. Overexploitation may be defined as the situation in which, for sonic years, average aquifer abstraction rate is, greater than. or close to the average recharge rate. But rate and extent of recharge areas are often very uncertain. Besides, they may be modified by human activities and aquifer development. In practice, however, an aquifer is often considered as overexploited when some persistent negative results of aquifer development are felt or perceived. such as a continuous water-level drawdown. progressive water-quality deterioration, increase of abstraction cost. or ecological damage. But negative results do not necessarily imply that abstraction is greater than recharge. They may be simply due to well interferences and the long transient period that follow changes in the aquifer water balance. Groundwater storage is depleted to some extent during the transient period after abstraction is increased. Its duration depends on aquifer size. specific storage and permeability. Which level of "aquifer overexploitation" is advisable or bearable. depends oil the detailed and updated consideration of aquifer-development effects and the measures implemented for correction. This should not be the result of applying general rules based on sonic indirect data. Monitoring. sound aquifer knowledge, and calculation or modelling, of behaviour are needed in the framework of a set of objectives and policies. They should be established by a management institution, with the involvement of groundwater stakeholders, and take into account the environmental and,octal constraints. Aquifer overexploitation. which often is perceived to be associated with something ethically bad, is not necessarily detrimental if it is not permanent. It may be a,step towards sustainable development. Actually, the term aquifer overexploitation is mostly a qualifier that intends to point to a concern about the evolution of the aquifer flow system in some specific, restricted points of view, but without a precise hydrodynamic meaning. Implementing, groundwater management and protection meat sures needs quantitative appraisal of aquifer evolution and effects based on detailed Multidisciplinary studies. which have to he supported by reliable data.

TI Who speaks for whom? A look at civil society accountability in
   bioprospecting debates in Mexico
SO IDS BULLETIN-INSTITUTE OF DEVELOPMENT STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
AB In the early 1990s, in Mexico's state of Oaxaca, an organisation made up of four indigenous communities in the Sierra Juarez, the UZACHI, negotiated a bioprospecting contract with the multinational pharmaceutical company, Sandoz. The local civil society (CS) actors directly involved in negotiating and carrying out the project considered their bioprospecting experience a positive one that could contribute significantly to the communities' longer term sustainable development process. In contrast, neighbouring community representatives and CS organisations, as well as NGOs of national and international scope, publicly condemn the initiative. In this article the UZACHI-Sandoz case is employed to illustrate the challenges associated with civil society accountability (CSA) in the context of a struggle for contested rights associated with biodiversity conservation and development. In looking at civil society's role in Mexico's debate around bioprospecting, it explores a number of questions that are raised regarding the way CS representation, responsibility, and voice are played out.

ID DIRECT CP VIOLATION; SEARCH; DECAYS
AB FNAL E871 (HyperCP) collected over 38 terabytes of data during the 1997 fixed-target run at Fermilab. The data-acquisition (DAQ) system wrote data to tape with a typical rate of 13 MB/s. A second data collection period in 1999 allowed for the collection of a further 82 terabytes of data. However, changes in the spill structure and an increase in primary beam intensity necessitated an upgrade of the 1997 DAQ system. The 1999 run of HyperCP featured a DAQ system which recorded data on 20,421 8 mm tapes at a sustainable rate of 27 MB/s. The rationale and methods for this upgrade are detailed within.

TI Success and failure factors in software reuse
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SOFTWARE ENGINEERING
LA English
DT Article
DE survey; software reuse; empirical study
AB This paper aims at identifying some of the key factors in adopting or running a company-wide software reuse program. Key factors are derived from empirical evidence of reuse practices, as emerged from a survey of projects for the introduction of reuse in European companies: 24 such projects performed from 1994 to 1997 were analyzed using structured interviews. The projects were undertaken in both large and small companies, working in a variety of business domains, and using both object-oriented and procedural development approaches. Most of them produce software with high commonality between applications, and have at least reasonably mature processes. Despite that apparent potential for success, around one-third of the projects failed. Three main causes of failure were not introducing reuse-specific processes, not modifying nonreuse processes, and not considering human factors. The root cause was a lack of commitment by top management, or nonawareness of the importance of those factors, often coupled with the belief that using the object-oriented approach or setting up a repository seamlessly is all that is necessary to achieve success in reuse. Conversely, successes were achieved when, given a potential for reuse because of commonality among applications, management committed to introducing reuse processes, modifying nonreuse processes, and addressing human factors. While addressing those three issues turned out to be essential, the lower-level details of how to address them varied greatly: for instance, companies produced large-grained or small-grained reusable assets, did or did not perform domain analysis, did or did not use dedicated reuse groups, used specific tools for the repository or no tools. As far as these choices are concerned, the key point seems to be the sustainability of the approach and its suitability to the context of the company.

ID DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES; COSTA-RICA; EXPOSURE; PESTICIDES; WORKERS
AB The 12.4 million economically active population (EAP) of the seven Central American countries includes a large informal sector. Social security covers only 14-60%. No surveillance of occupational safety and health (OSH) hazards or accidents exists. Extrapolating the incidence of occupational accidents among insured Costa Rican workers to the Central American EAP yields two million accidents yearly, still a gross underestimate. Occupational diseases are underreported, misdiagnosed, and not recognized as such. A number of regional OSH programs aim at modernization of the labor administrations and address the formal sector, in particular textile maquila, in connection with free trade agreements. The weak role of the ministries of health is expected to strengthen under the Pan American Health Organization OSH program. Employers largely influence new policies. Workers' influence on OSH policies has been weak, with only about 10% unionization rate and scarce resources and OSH knowledge. Informal workers, however, are getting organized. OSH research is underdeveloped and not linked to policy making. Construction, agriculture, and general un/underemployment are considered priorities for intervention. The informal sector needs to be included in national and regional OSH policies. Regional collaboration and international development support are of strategic importance to achieve sustainable improvement in OSH.

   CARAPA-GUIANENSIS; TROPICAL FALLOWS; FINE ROOTS; TREE; DYNAMICS;
   PHOTOSYNTHESIS; TRANSPIRATION
AB The study responds to the demand for the cultivation of exploited native tree species of the Amazon for high quality timber production in plantations, The relationship of the light availability, the water and nutrient content of the soil, the net photosynthesis and the biomass production of one- to eight-year-old Swietenia macrophylla King (true mahogany), Carapa guianensis Aubl. (Andiroba), and Cedrela odorata L. (Cedro) was investigated on natural sites and in plantations in the states of Amazonas, Para, and Mato Grosso, Brazil. Gas exchange measurements showed that the net photosynthesis of Swietenia and Cedrela strongly depends on a high water and K content of the soil, while the net photosynthesis of Carapa was less influenced by the water and K content of the soil. Maximum water uptake of Swietenia was found in wet soils with a soil water potential of -3 to -5 kPa, of Carapa in soils with a soil water potential of -25 to -28 kPa and of Cedrela in soils with a soil water potential of -7 to -8 kPa. The water uptake of all three species decreased with decreasing K content of the soil (range of soil K content: 4-16 mg k(-1)), but the water uptake of Carapa was less influenced by the water potential and the K content of the soil compared to Swietenia and Cedrela, The K uptake of all three species increased with increasing K content of the soil. The K uptake of Swietenia and Cedrela strongly depended on a high water content of the soil, whereas Carapa took up considerable amounts of K also in drier soils.
   The biomass production of Swietenia, Carapa, and Cedrela could be calculated by a growth model derived from the relationship between the photoactive radiation, the soil water potential, the K content of the soil and the water and K uptake and the net photosynthesis of the three species with an accurracy of 65 % to 72 %. The reliability of the growth model was tested under field conditions with 256 plants each of Swietenia, Carapa, and Cedrela. It turned out that Carapa is better adapted to poorer soils and changing soil water contents than Swietenia and Cedrela and therefore could be especially recommended for the recultivation of degraded areas, while for sustainable timber production of Swietenia and Cedrela on degraded areas a careful plantation managment and fertilization are indispensible.

TI Estimating marketing persistence on sales of consumer durables in China
SO JOURNAL OF BUSINESS RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
DE marketing persistence; time series method; sales; advertising; China
ID HYSTERESIS
AB Conventional studies consider advertising spending as a means to increase sales, and it has to be a sustained action in maintaining a desired level of sales. Recent studies on marketing persistence, however, indicate that a short-term marketing action could result in a longlasting high level of sales. This phenomenon could save scarce marketing resources and is of obvious importance for marketing strategists. This paper aims to achieve two objectives, First, we propose an econometric model to estimate the effect of marketing persistence. Second, we apply the model to study the persistence phenomenon in China's consumer durables market. Based on our findings, we draw implications for designing sustainable strategies for long-term marketing profitability. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

TI The social outcomes of education and feedbacks on growth in Africa
SO JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
ID ECONOMIC-DEVELOPMENT
AB Most of the effects of education included in the complete model presented here are shown to be consistent with those found in the mainstream of the research on each outcome using microeconomic data. This, however, is a first effort to estimate net education effects more comprehensively, beyond just growth and health effects on other key measures of development in Africa, and also a new view of indirect feedbacks on economic growth and of externalities.
   After developing the conceptual framework, the regression estimates are presented together with a discussion of the net direct and indirect effects of education on each outcome. These are shown to improve infant mortality, increase longevity, strengthen civic institutions and democratisation, increase political stability, and increase investment in physical capital, which in turn have positive delayed feedback effects on the economic growth process. The effects also lower fertility rates and population growth rates but the latter occurs only after long delays because of the short-term positive effects of education on health. There are significant net education effects reducing poverty, inequality and crime, the latter after netting out negative externalities from growth and white-collar crime, Education effects reducing poverty and substituting skills for extractive exports also contribute to environmental sustainability.
   Simulations solve the complete model endogenously and iteratively over time for all of the direct and indirect (largely externality) effects. They reveal that indirect feedback effects including those on non-market outcomes are larger than the direct effects. Some effects are immediate, but many of the lags are long. So policy options for a continent in crisis that consider these lags are considered.

ID INCOME; HAPPINESS; MOBILITY; WEALTH
AB To date the literature on subjective well-being has focused on the developed economics. Me provide empirical evidence from two emerging market countries, Peru and Russia. Our results - and in particular a strong negative skew in the assessments of the respondents with the greatest income gains - support the importance of relative rather than absolute income differences. Among other factors, we attribute our results to shifts in reference norms and to macroeconomic volatility. Relative differences seem to matter more for those in the middle of the distribution than for the very, wealthy, or the very poor Our respondents were more critical in assessing their progress vis-A-vis others in their country versus those in their community. The large and consistent gap we find between objective income trends and the subjective assessments of the upwardly mobile may have implications for the future economic and political behaviour of a group that is critical to the sustainability, of market policies.

   strategies
AB South China has become the third largest region associated with acid deposition following Europe and North America, the area subject to damage by acid deposition increased from 1.75 million km in 1985 to 2 8 million km(2) in 1993. Acid deposition has caused serious damage to ecosystem. Combined pollution of acid rain and SO2 showed the obvious multiple effects on crops. Vegetable was more sensitive to acid deposition than foodstuff crops, Annual economic loss of crops due to acid deposition damage in eleven provinces of South China was 4. 26 billion RMB Yuan. Acid deposition caused serious damage to forest. Annual economic loss of wood volume was about L 8 billion RMB Yuan and forest ecological benefit loss 16, 2 billion in eleven provinces of south China. Acid deposition in south China was typical "Sulfuric acid type". According to the thoughts of sustainable development, some strategies were brought forward as follows: (1) enhancing environmental management, specifying acid-controlling region, controlling and abating the total emission amount of SO2; ( 2) selecting practical energy technologies of clean coal, for example, cleansing and selecting coal, sulfur-fixed-type industrial briqutting, abating sulfur from waste gas and so on; (3) developing other energy sources to replace coal, including water electricity, atomic energy and the new energy such as solar energy, wind energy and so on; (4) in acid deposition region of south China, selecting acid-resistant type of crop and tree to decrease agricultural losses, planting more green fertilizer crops, using organic fertilizers and liming, in order to improve buffer capacities of oil.

AB The effects of a VC difference in water temperature on maximum sustained swimming speed, swimming energetics and swimming kinematics were measured in the chub mackerel Scomber japonicus (Teleostei: Scombridae), a primarily coastal, pelagic predator that inhabits subtropical and temperate transition waters of the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian Oceans. New data for chub mackerel acclimated to 18degreesC are compared with published data from our laboratory at 24degreesC. Twelve individuals acclimated to each of two temperatures (15.6-26.3cm fork length, FL, and 34-179g at 18degreesC; 14.0-24.7cm FL and 26-156g at 24degreesC) swam at a range of speeds in a temperature-controlled Brett-type respirometer, at the respective acclimation temperature. At a given fish size, the maximum speed that S.japonicus was able to maintain for a 30-min period, while swimming steadily using slow, oxidative locomotor muscle (U-max,U-c), was significantly greater at 24 than at 18degreesC (52.5-97.5cms(-1) at 18degreesC and 70-120cms(-1) at 24degreesC). At a given speed and fish size, the rate of oxygen consumption ((V)overdotO(2))was significantly higher at 24 than at 18degreesC because of a higher net cost of transport (1073-4617jkm-lkg7l at 18degreesC and 2708-14895Jkm(-1)kg(-1) at 24degreesC). Standard metabolic rate, calculated by extrapolating the log(V)overdot(2) versus swimming speed relationship to zero speed, did not vary significantly with temperature or fish mass (126.4+/-67.2 MgO(2)h(-1)kg(-1) at 18degreesC and 143.2+/-80.3mgO(2)h(-1)kg(-1) at 24degreesC; means S.D., N=12). Swimming kinematics was quantified from high-speed (120Hz) video recordings analyzed with a computerized, two-dimensional motion-analysis system. At a given speed and fish size, there were no significant effects of temperature on tail-beat frequency, tail-beat amplitude or stride length, but propulsive wavelength increased significantly with temperature as a result of an increase in propulsive wave velocity. Thus, the main effects of temperature on chub mackerel swimming were increases in both Un(max,c) and the net cost of swimming at 24degreesC. Like other fishes, S. japonicus apparently must recruit more slow, oxidative muscle fibers to swim at a given sustainable speed at the lower temperature because of the reduced power output. Thus, the 24degreesC mackerel reach a higher speed before they must recruit the fast, glycolytic fibers, thereby increasing U-max,U-c at 24degreesC. By quantifying in vivo the effects of temperature on the swimming performance of an ectothermic species that is closely related to the endothermic tunas, this study also provides evidence that maintaining the temperature of the slow, oxidative locomotor muscle at 6degreesC or more above ambient water temperature in tunas should significantly increase sustainable swimming speeds, but also increase the energetic cost of swimming, unless cardiac output limits muscle performance.

AB Conservation easements are an effective tool for maintaining working forests, preserving environmental values, and protecting communities from excessive development pressure. The Society of American Foresters (SAF) supports conservation easements as one tool for ensuring sustainable forest management. Selling or donating conservation easements may may allow landowners who are committed to sustainable management to resist pressure to sell their property to developers. Similarly, in the face of pressure to withdraw working forests from active management, conservation easements offer a way to provide adequate environmental and open-space benefits while allowing continued timber harvesting.

AB The Pingree Conservation Easement in Maine is a model of how large landowners can accomplish forest management and long-term conservation goals while realizing a financial return for this decision. The land conservation trust holding an easement has the perpetual responsibility to ensure that the owners of the property adhere to the easement terms. In this capacity, the New England Forestry Foundation has the responsibility to develop an independent, cost-effective, and scientifically defensible monitoring protocol for the Pingree easement. Elements of the monitoring program, including a three-level hierarchical monitoring method, from satellites to ground, are under development.

AB In 1994, the Northern Forest Lands Council published 37 recommendations designed to maintain traditional patterns of land ownership in the Northern Forest. During the past six years, Maine, New Hampshire, New York, and Vermont each substantially or partially implemented more than 75 percent of the recommendations. State implementation was remarkably consistent and included most of the recommendations for protecting exceptional resources. The federal government implemented half of the council's recommendations, almost all of which were related to strengthening rural economies, suggesting a low national concern with most of the underlying issues.

AB Delivering iron fortified foods that provide meaningful levels of bioavailable iron without altering the accepted appearance and taste of the product presents multiple challenges. Issues relating to food technology, product formulation, acceptance and efficacy evaluation, marketing and quality control must all be addressed. Procter & Gamble Company has developed a unique technology that stabilizes iron in an aqueous system. Utilizing this technology, a fortified powder drink has been developed that is easy to distribute, store and use and that delivers 20-30% of the U. S. RDA for iron, as well as significant amounts of vitamin A, iodine, zinc and vitamin C in a single serving. Acceptance, bioavailability and effectiveness trials have all produced positive results. This type of fortified product can contribute to alleviating iron deficiency but requires scaling up, packaging, quality control and distribution through normal trade channels and public institutions to have a sustainable impact. To be effective, a well-planned communications campaign should also accompany any major iron fortification program. Eradication of iron deficiency anemia can be done but requires a holistic approach that addresses multiple barriers and leverages the untapped expertise and strength of the alliance between public and private sectors.

DE community; sustainable interventions; iron deficiency
AB The need for combined and integrated strategies to address iron deficiency is widely recognized, utilizing targeted supplementation, as well as food based strategies including both fortified and nonfortified foods. The challenge is not so much knowing "what" to do as is understanding "how" to implement effective and sustainable interventions. Because the causes of iron and other micronutrient deficiencies are complex, including inadequate food intake, unsanitary conditions and inadequate health services, the solutions may also be complex, requiring multisectoral and interdisciplinary approaches. Top-down strategies are unlikely to be effective and sustainable. Rather, the beneficiaries of the program at the community level must be able to understand malnutrition in simple terms, to envisage potential solutions and to become "demanders" of services. The experience in Thailand provides an example of a country-wide, community-based and participatory approach utilizing facilitators and motivators at the local level to implement and sustain interventions. The experience in Thailand indicates the potential for developing effective and sustainable interventions to address iron deficiency and other micronutrient problems as part of a broad, community-based effort.

AB Based on a database of at present 160 mechanical soil profile datasets, the site and horizon dependent mechanical soil strength expressed as precompression stress can be predicted by multiple regression analysis and used for documentation in maps at different scales. Stress dependent changes in air permeability or air capacity can be derived for the virgin compression stress range as well as the effect of stress propagation in soils or stress attenuation capacity and depth dependent changes of ecological properties. Thus, areas with defined mechanical sensitivity as a function of depth can be derived and recommendations for site adjusted farming techniques can be given. In addition it allows the agricultural machine industry to develop site adjusted machines to support the ideas of good farming practice, defined by the soil protection law of Germany.

ID NATURAL FIBERS; BIOCOMPOSITES; PERFORMANCE
AB Sustainability, industrial ecology, eco-efficiency, and green chemistry are guiding the development of the next generation of materials, products, and processes. Biodegradable plastics and bio-based polymer products based on annually renewable agricultural and biomass feedstock can form the basis for a portfolio of sustainable, eco-efficient products that can compete and capture markets currently dominated by products based exclusively on petroleum feedstock. Natural/Biofiber composites (Bio-Composites) are emerging as a viable alternative to glass fiber reinforced composites especially in automotive and building product applications. The combination of biofibers such as kenaf, hemp, flax, jute, henequen, pineapple leaf fiber, and sisal with polymer matrices from both nonrenewable and renewable resources to produce composite materials that are competitive with synthetic composites requires special attention, i.e., biofiber-matrix interface and novel processing. Natural fiber-reinforced polypropylene composites have attained commercial attraction in automotive industries. Natural fiber-polypropylene or natural fiber-polyester composites are not sufficiently eco-friendly because of the petroleum-based source and the nonbiodegradable nature of the polymer matrix. Using natural fibers with polymers based on renewable resources will allow many environmental issues to be solved. By embedding biofibers with renewable resource-based biopolymers such as cellulosic plastics; polylactides; starch plastics; polyhydroxyalkanoates (bacterial polyesters); and soy-based plastics, the so-called green bio-composites are continuously being developed.

AB Lignin represents a vastly under-utilized natural polymer co-generated during papermaking and biomass fractionation. Different types of lignin exist, and these differ with regard to isolation protocol and plant resource (i.e., wood type or agricultural harvesting residue). The incorporation of lignin into polymeric systems has been demonstrated, and this depends on solubility and reactivity characteristics. Several industrial utilization examples are presented for sulfur-free, water-insoluble lignins. These include materials for automotive brakes, wood panel products, biodispersants, polyurethane foams, and epoxy resins for printed circuit boards.

ID GASIFICATION
AB Fuel cells have the potential for generating electricity very efficiently, and because of their modular construction, retain the same efficiency at any scale. Biomass is one of the renewable energy sources which is not intermittent, location-dependent or very difficult to store. If grown sustainably, biomass can be considered CO2 neutral. A combined heat and power (CHP) system consisting of a fuel cell integrated with wood gasification (FCIWG) may offer a combination for delivering heat and electricity cleanly and efficiently, even at small-scales.
   The "isolated community" (IC) could be an island, or simply where grid-supplied electricity is weak or non-existent. The IC was taken to consist of 200 people and three retail outlets. Heat and electricity use profiles for this IC were produced and the FCBVG system was scaled to the power demand.
   The FCIWG system was modelled for two different types of fuel cell, the molten carbonate and the phosphoric acid. In each case, an oxygen-fired gasification system is proposed, in order to eliminate the need for a methane reformer. Technical, environmental and economic analyses of each version were made, using the ECLIPSE process simulation package. Since fuel cell lifetimes are not yet precisely known, economics for a range of fuel cell lifetimes have been produced.
   The wood-fired phosphoric acid fuel cell (PAFC) system was found to be suitable where high hea/electricity values were required, but had low electrical efficiency. The wood-fired molten carbonate fuel cell (MCFC) system was found to be quite efficient and suitable for smallscale electricity generation purposes. ne expected capital costs of both systems would currently make them uncompetitive for general use, but the specific features of an IC with regard to the high cost of importing other fuel, and/or lack of grid electricity, could still make these systems attractive options.

AB Making decisions for environmental management is a complex task due to the multiplicity and diversity of technological choices. Furthermore, the exploitation of natural resources and the preservation of the natural environment imply objectives that are often in conflict within a sustainable development paradigm. Managers and other decision makers require techniques to assist them in understanding strategic decision making. This paper illustrates the use of a multiple-objective decision-making methodology and an integrative geographical information system-based decision-making tool developed to help watershed councils prioritize and evaluate restoration activities at the watershed level. Both were developed through a multidisciplinary approach. The decision-making tool is being applied in two watersheds of Oregon's Willamette River Basin. The results suggest that multiple-objective methods can provide a valuable tool in analyzing complex watershed management issues.

AB Purpose: The severe exercise intensity domain may be defined as that range of work rates over which V(over dot)O-2max can be elicited during constant-load exercise. The purpose of this study was to help characterize the V(over dot)O-2 response within this domain. Methods: Eleven participants performed cycle ergometer exercise tests to fatigue at several discrete work rates between 95% and 135% of die maximum power (P-max) achieved during an incremental exercise test. Results: As previously demonstrated, the relationship between power and time to fatigue was hyperbolic. The asymptote of power (critical power. P-critical) was 198 +/- 44 W. The rapidity of the V(over dot)O-2 response increased systematically at higher work rates such that the relationship between power and time to V(over dot)O-2max was also well fit by a hyperbola. The power asymptote of this relationship (196 +/- 42 W) was not different from P-critical (P > 0.05). The two hyperbolic relationships converged at 342 +/- 70 W (136% P-max). Conclusion: These data suggest that, for this population of male and female university students. the upper boundary of the severe exercise intensity domain is similar to136% P-max This upper boundary is the highest work rate fur which exercise duration is prolonged sufficiently (in this study, 136 +/- 17 s) to allow V(over dot)O-2 to rise to its maximal value. The lower boundary for severe exercise is just above P-critical, which is the highest work rate that is sustainable for a prolonged duration and that will not elicit V(over dot)O-2max.

AB The initiatives of conservation and valorisation of industrial heritage are particularly significant in the Nord-Pas-de-Calais region of Northern France, where key sectors of industry haven developed and many disappeared: mines, steelmills, textiles, food and agricultural industries, chemistry, metal works and many others. The authors show how these initiatives represent different types of collective mobilisation, and how they put a light, at the local and regional level, on the relationships between industrial identities and local and regional policies of conservation. After a period of local initiatives, the 1990's mark a turn : first there is a new trend in regional politics which intends to associate, inside Northern Europe, sustainable development with the valorisation of industrial heritage and collective memory; and second one notes a series of initiatives due to industrial firms which are still in full activity.

ID SWISS RAINFALL SIMULATORS; EROSION; GERMAN
AB Rainfall simulator experiments were set up in Balatonszabadi oil chernozem soil. The soil crodibility factor (K factor) was calculated based on the soil loss data from rainfall simulation and the Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE).
   The C factor of the LISLE model describes the effects of land cover such as cities, rivers, lakes, forests,. pastures/meadows, orchards, arable lands and others. On arable lands the estimated soil loss is highly dependent on C factors. The present goal is to highlight the effects of local soil crodibility experiments on the number of crops that can be chosen for sustainable land use.
   Local measurements proved some estimated Hungarian crodibility data from the literature to be too high, resulting in higher predicted soil losses. Higher predicted soil loss increased the necessity for soil protection operations and decreased the number of plant species available for sustainable crop production.
   Incorporating the USLE equation into a GIS model makes it possible to calculate soil losses for particular areas (watersheds, for instance) or to analyse potential management strategies by adjusting factors in the equation (such as vegetation cover), running the model, and then comparing the output with alternative scenarios.

AB Law and policy implications of the precautionary principle in the field of marine environmental protection are explored in this paper in a three-part analysis. First, seven slippery aspects of the precautionary principle are highlighted, including confusion in terminology, definitional variations, definitional generalities, the spectrum of precautionary measures available, ongoing philosophical tensions and competing socioeconomic interests, debate over who should be responsible for making precautionary decisions, and limited interpretation by international tribunals. Second, the rather feeble precautionary responses to the tempestuous issues of climate change, hazardous chemicals, and overfishing are described. Third, the potential for the precautionary principle to synergize with human rights norms, such as the emerging right to a healthy environment, and other principles of sustainable development is discussed.

AB This article studies the connection between political instability and the sustainability of an exchange rate regime. A model based on the credibility of monetary policy shows that political unrest should be correlated with the adoption of flexible exchange rates. That intuition is tested using various measures of political instability on a panel of 125 countries between 1980 and 1994.

AB We studied movements of white-lipped peccaries (Tayassu pecari, Artiodactyla, Tayassuidae) throughout the Osa Peninsula and their use by local people during 1997-2000, using interview techniques. We draw five main conclusions: 1) White-lipped peccaries living on the Osa Peninsula range within Corcovado National Park for most of the year. 2) Peccaries travel beyond the Park boundaries to the north and south-cast of the Peninsula at the end of the wet season when a fruit shortage occurs in Corcovado. 3) The local people hunt peccaries as the herds move through the Peninsula. 4) Current small herd sizes observed by locals in the Peninsula and by researchers in the Park may indicate a decline of the peccary population, 5) Peccaries constitute neither an important source of food nor a source Of cash income for local people. We Suggest that sustainable use of peccaries in this region is neither realistic nor necessary. Instead of trying to legalize and regulate hunting, effective systems to control illegal hunting should be implemented, especially outside the Park boundary from October to January when the animals are on the move.

AB The use of mulch or compost to reduce foliar disease in fresh market tomato could reduce fungicide use. Between 1997 and 1999, foliar disease was monitored in tomatoes grown in beds with bare soil, black polyethylene, composted dairy manure, or hairy vetch. Early blight was reduced in plots with vetch compared with bare soil or compost in all years and compared with polyethylene cover in I year. Early blight was reduced in plots with polyethylene versus compost and bare soil in I and 2 years, respectively. Septoria leaf spot was reduced in plots with vetch versus other bed strategies in 1998 and bare soil or compost in 1999, This disease was reduced in plots with polyethylene versus bare soil or compost in 1998 and 1999. Soil coverage of tomato leaflets and soil particle dispersal were reduced in plots with polyethylene or vetch versus bare soil or compost in both years that these variables were assessed. Sensor wetness duration was reduced in plots with polyethylene or vetch versus bare soil or compost in one of two years. These findings suggest that foliar disease reduction in mulch was associated with reduced splash dispersal and, in one year, reduced leaf wetness.

AB In an effort to develop a sustainable source of podophyllotoxin for the production of anticancer drugs such as etoposide, teniposide and etopophos, Podophyllum peltatum accessions with podophyllotoxin-rich leaf biomass were identified and transplanted to different growing conditions by vegetative cuttings. Results indicate that the lignan profile in leaves does not change over time or due to environment conditions. Podophyllotoxin and alpha-peltatin content in the blades seems to be stable with an inverse relationship of concentration between these compounds. A podophyllotoxin-rich leaf accession showed low biosynthetic capability to synthesize alpha- and beta-peltatin and the converse was also true, indicating that selection and cultivation of high-yielding podophyllotoxin leaf biomass may reduce production costs.

AB The diverse biological resources in nature are vast factories of chemical diversity. With the recent advances in the biological and chemical sciences it is now easier than ever to explore the potential uses of immense biological resources in a sustainable manner. Our investigations focused on the bioprospecting of both terrestrial and marine organisms have led to the discovery of a number of interesting chemical compounds. The discovery of a new class of cholinesterase, a-glucosidase and phosphodiesterase I inhibitors. several new antioxidants, and other classes of bioactive natural products is presented. The theory of the chemical basis of memory through hydrogen bonding in the brain is further elaborated.

AB Developing countries are faced with large shortfalls of electric-power generation, shortages of usable indigenous fuels, and transportation bottlenecks for those fuels. The loss of revenue that is forced upon the industry due to power cuts and frequent interruptions of power supply is substantial. Renewable sources of energy have an important role to play in providing much needed power in the context of growing global concern about sustainable energy supplies and protecting the environment from the adverse effects of fossil fuel utilization. The purpose of the study is to identify the factors that influence the adoption of solar-based technology. An examination of the literature in the area of diffusion of technology has led to the identification of different variables. The possible relationships that may exist between these variables is depicted in the conceptual framework. This paper attempts to clarify the relationships between the variables that have been identified and the decision to adopt. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper introduces a new type of chemical pulping process technology. In the design of the process, significant efforts have been made to attain sustainable utilisation of natural resources. The paper discusses the essential issues to be taken into consideration when annual fibres are used in the pulp and paper industry. The paper focuses on the physical and chemical properties of the raw materials and their relationship with the environmentally friendly concept of cellulose and paper production, The chemistry and structure of the Chempolis process as well as certain properties relevant to pulp and paper qualities are described. The concept of the Chempolis process is based on three major stages: delignification, bleaching and recovery of acids. In acidic delignification conditions, the dissolution of silicon present in the raw material is prevented. while the nutrients are dissolved. Furthermore, the hydrolysis of xylan can be controlled. To minimise the cost of recovery, cooking chemicals are selected from the compounds which are formed during the processing of lignocellulosic. Alkaline TCF conditions are used in bleaching to enable totally effluent-free operation. The Chempolis process is based on a closed system. Apart from the bleached chemical pulp, the output flows include solid organic biofuel, which can be used to generate energy for the mill and fertilizer for the cultivation of raw material. Due to the simplicity of the process and the efficient raw material utilisation, the mill economy is attractive. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB By extrapolating Gordon's measures of the quality bias in the official price indexes, we construct quality-adjusted price indexes for 24 types of equipment and software (E&S) from 1947 to 2000 and use them to measure technical change at the aggregate and at the industry level. Technological improvement in E&S accounts for an important fraction of postwar GDP growth and plays a key role in the productivity resurgence of the 1990s. Driving this finding is 4% annual growth in the quality of E&S in the postwar period and more than 6% annual growth in the 1990s. The acceleration in the 1990s occurred in every industry, consistent with the idea that information technology represents a general-purpose technology. Furthermore, we measure for the aggregate economy and different sectors the "technological gap": how much more productive new machines are compared to the average machine. We show that the technological gap explains the dynamics of investment in new technologies and the returns to human capital, consistent with the Nelson-Phelps conjecture. Since the technological gap continues to increase-it more than doubled in the past 20 years-our evidence supports the view that at least some of the recent increase in productivity growth is sustainable.

SO SERVICE INDUSTRIES JOURNAL

DT Article
ID CONCEPTUAL-MODEL; MANAGEMENT
AB This article explores practical and competitive aspects of the role that technology plays in service firms. A review of resource based theory leads to a conceptual model describing how technology can contribute to sustainable competitive advantage (SCA). The pragmatic challenge of implementation is then explored and the first conceptual model is extended. These discussions lead to two research propositions that are employed to (a) select four suitable case studies from a larger sample, and (b) structure subsequent analysis and discussion of the case findings. The propositions and corresponding data reveal a potential paradox implicit in the technology, selection and implementation process. Namely that SCA is often based upon resources that emerge from conditions of uncertainty, ambiguity, and poor ex ante 'measurability', whereas these same conditions have a negative impact upon managerial control and therefore implementation success.

TI No evidence of an epidemic of locally acquired heterosexual HIV

LA English
DT Article
ID POPULATION
AB Background: An early sign of a major heterosexual human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) epidemic will be heterosexual infection acquired from persons who were themselves infected through heterosexual intercourse.
   Goal. To test the hypothesis that there is a growing heterosexual epidemic of HIV in Norway.
   Study Design: Data from the mandatory, comprehensive, anonymous HIV case reporting system were analyzed concerning Norwegian residents who had acquired HIV heterosexually and for whom such infections were diagnosed before the year 2001.
   Results: One hundred fifty-five (71%) of 221 men were infected abroad, whereas 107 (76%) of 140 women were infected in Norway (mainly by drug injectors and immigrants); 23 men and 55 women had been infected in Norway by partners who themselves acquired HIV through heterosexual intercourse (secondary heterosexual transmission). There was a slightly increasing incidence of all heterosexual cases and secondary cases.
   Conclusions: Secondary heterosexual HIV transmission remains rare in Norway, and a sustainable epidemic of locally acquired infection seems unlikely in the foreseeable future. The magnitude of the heterosexual epidemic will be strongly influenced by infections acquired abroad.

AB This study examines why mining booms occur and why some people participate in them while others, living in comparable conditions, do not. Ethnographic data were collected among the Ndjuka Maroons, forest peoples in the Suriname Amazon. The occupational justifications of 41 gold miners and 34 nonminers generated a decision-tree model with a 95.5% prediction rate. The results suggest that decisions about mining are rational given the present economic conditions of both Ndjuka households and of Suriname as a whole. The author argues that environmental awareness campaigns and stricter law enforcement are not likely to encourage more sustainable resource use in Suriname, and probably not in other parts of the Amazon rainforest. Rather, more effective conservation policy would be to promote people-centered development in rural regions through improved public education and health care, while stabilizing national economies.

AB We draw on field research from Costa Rica and New Zealand to examine the potential for sustaining ecotourism projects over time. We find that successful ecotourism projects exist in a paradoxical or dialectical system with internal dynamics that tend to speed up the rate of tourism production. This poses a number of ecological, economic, and social problems. In general, the problems are known to local communities and public officials. The challenges are also technologically fixable and economically viable. The obstacles are political. The communities exist in larger political systems that lack the capacity to control economic action. In other words, the political process is not capable of keeping the economic system in check.

AB This paper explores cultural constructions of masculinities and femininities among farming families in a French community. In particular, it shows how, with the development of agricultural technology, the tractor has become a symbol of male power and spatial domination over women. Drawing on life-history interviews and ethnographic observations, it is argued that farmers have appropriated agricultural technology and used it to construct and reaffirm their masculine identities. As a result of this appropriation, women's work in agricultural production has become limited to carrying out menial tasks which are seen as secondary to farming. Focusing on narratives revolving around men, women and tractors, the paper shows that the tractor, as a symbol of male domination, is directly opposed to images of femininity, However, it is argued that the tractor can also become the expression of struggle and contention over masculine power and patriarchal gender relations on the farm.

AB Crystalline silicon has been the dominant material for the production of solar cells for the past 20 years and this leadership is expected to continue. This is based on the inherent advantages of silicon as a semiconductor and on the major industry that has been built to manufacture silicon devices. A number of trends are becoming clear. Multicrystalline silicon usage is growing more rapidly than monocrystalline. There is a growing emphasis on high-efficiency solar cells and technology is permitting extremely thin wafers to be used. Advances are being made in ribbon silicon, and production of this material is increasing. The prospects are good for steady, continuous growth in photovoltaic solar cells, but establishing a sustainable supply of silicon feedstock remains a key issue as does balancing manufacturing the capacity with demand.

DE solar; silicon; feedstock; production; PV; industry; photovoltaic
AB For the growth of the photovoltaic industry, it seems inevitable to create an independent feedstock supply with solar grade high-purity silicon, because the availability of the hitherto used by-products in the electronic silicon industry is limited and will not increase reasonably within the next 10-15 years.
   One of the results of the study "Present and likely future bottlenecks analysis for a sustainable photovoltaic policy" carried out by Bayer and Life, within EPIA, sponsored by the European Commission, within the ALTENER programme, shows that the feedstock used to date, based on electronic grade silicon Scraps is already limiting the PV market expansion even if a true shortage is not expected before 2004-2005 according to a "low growing PV market scenario". This conclusion implies that a new silicon feedstock not depending on electronic grade silicon production chain must be available on the market from the years 2004 to 2005.
   Bayer evaluated different ways for the production of solar grade silicon with a capacity of upto 5000 mt/yr. By calculating different routes, it seems possible to install a 5000 plant by an investment of 110 Mio. Euro, and to sell silicon feedstock with a price level of 12-15 Euro/kg. Bayer has been developing a suitable process and the new owner, the Deutsche Solar GmbH, is considering what effort is necessary for a pilot production plant.
   The feedstock situation is discussed under the aspect of availability of different materials and the efforts under consideration by different parties. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB During the last 5 years the PV industry continues to experience a strong economic growth between 15 % and 30% per year. Multi-crystalline silicon became the preferred material for PV production with a share of more than 50% of the shipped PV modules world-wide. For the first time, the available quantity of the classical silicon feedstock sources for the PV industry-electronic grade silicon rejects from the silicon and microelectronics industry-is close to be not sufficient to satisfy the requirements of the PV industry, From this situation arises the need to develop short- and long-term solutions to guarantee a sustainable supply of the PV industry with suitable silicon feedstock at acceptable costs.
   This paper presents a possible route for short- and long-term solutions to provide solar grade (SoG) silicon feedstock for the PV industry. On a short-term basis a twofold solution is proposed: (i) reduction of silicon consumption by reducing the wafer thickness and the introduction of recycling scenarios for silicon waste produced by the PV industry, (ii) introduction of very low-resistivity silicon (0.1 Omega cm).
   On long term, a route towards the establishment of a SoG silicon production based on widely available metallurgical grade silicon is proposed. This route includes the development of suitable purification techniques. First results that allowed to lower the impurity tolerances for SoG silicon are presented, The introduction of silicon feedstock with higher impurity concentrations which show a tendency to interact with crystal defects and lead to a degradation of the material performance also requires passivation concepts to achieve highly performing solar cells.

ID POWER
AB Today, consensus is strengthening that mankind ought to prevent atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations from more than doubling, since such a doubling is likely to cause a significant interference with the planet's climate system, to which it might prove difficult to adapt. Nuclear energy possesses large disadvantages, among which waste, proliferation and safety. An expansion of nuclear energy would encounter great social, institutional and economic barriers. Because the 21st century requires a radical transformation of global energy production and consumption towards nonfossil fuels, however, it is one of the noncarbon emitting alternatives that, at present, deserve enhanced research and development efforts. If nuclear energy were expanded 10-fold, it could contribute significantly to mitigating carbon emissions: a 10-fold expansion of nuclear energy could avoid about 15% of cumulative carbon emissions over the period 2000-2075. Nuclear energy, however, can be no panacea for the problem of global warming. Even with a massive expansion, nuclear energy should be complemented by drastic fossil fuel decarbonization measures or the development of renewable energy resources. Preferably, a combination of both should be targeted and complemented by far-reaching efficiency and savings regimes. Since the risks for humanity resulting from climate change are high, it would be unwise to currently abandon any noncarbon energy resource, including fission. A central thrust of continued research and development into nuclear energy ought to be the design of satisfactory nuclear waste depositories and of safe reactors that are less susceptible to proliferation risks.

TI Antiques and tourism in Australia
SO TOURISM MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
DE antiques; tourism; Victoria (Australia); travel demand; niche markets;
   regional development
AB This paper reviews those commercial activities described under the labels of antiques, collectables, memorabilia, and oldwares that are undertaken in regional Australia. While it may not be strictly correct to call them an industry in their own right, they are substantial, at least in the Australian context, and appear to be particularly significant for regional economic development in some localities. This paper treats them as a single industry to evaluate their significance as generators of tourism demand and visitation, for they appear to create a range of economic and social benefits that adds value to existing destinations, and links sympathetically to other forms of cultural and heritage tourism. The paper is focussed on the antiques industry in non-metropolitan Victoria (Australia): nonetheless, it raises issues that may well be familiar to other regional environments where niche markets are component parts of the domestic tourism product capable of supporting sustainable and non-intrusive forms of economic growth.

AB Due to increasing trend of intensive rice cultivation in a coastal river basin, crop planning and groundwater management are imperative for the sustainable agriculture. For effective management, two models have been developed viz. groundwater balance model and optimum cropping and groundwater management model to determine optimum cropping pattern and groundwater allocation from private and government tubewells according to different soil types (saline and non-saline), type of agriculture (rainfed and irrigated) and seasons (monsoon and winter). A groundwater balance model has been developed considering mass balance approach. The components of the groundwater balance considered are recharge from rainfall, irrigated rice and non-rice fields, base flow from rivers and seepage flow from surface drains. In the second phase, a linear programming optimization model is developed for optimal cropping and groundwater management for maximizing the economic returns. The models developed were applied to a portion of coastal river basin in Orissa State, India and optimal cropping pattern for various scenarios of river flow and groundwater availability was obtained.

TI A review of effective flood forecasting, warning and response system for
   application in South Africa
SO WATER SA
LA English
DT Article
AB Cyclone Eline caused severe flood damage in South Africa during February 2000, It has been estimated that the total amount lost was approximately R3000 million. South African farmers lost more than 50% of their export products. Flood damages and disruptions to humans and animal species were even bigger in Mozambique.
   The emphasis in South Africa is still on, inter alia, structural mitigation measures. Policy-makers seek foreign support and finances, especially during the reconstruction phase after floods, for reparation purposes only. Little to no attention has been given to scientific hazard and risk assessments to determine a sustainable flood standard for different river reaches, which will contribute to appropriate mitigation and prevention strategies, The aim, after flood disasters, is primarily to ensure that flood losses will be covered and to restore the level of existence of flood victims to where it was before the flood. Furthermore, mainly because of institutional problems currently experienced in South Africa, roles and responsibilities of institutions involved in disaster management are Dot clearly identified. Last mentioned are the reason for absence in South Africa of a formal flood forecast, warning and response system (FFWRS). In most cases where a flood warning system exists, there is evidence that it is insufficient, mainly because of a lack of knowledge and understanding of a well-functioning appropriate FFWRS.
   Sustainable prevention and mitigation strategies should be achieved within a holistic integrated catchment management approach, Such approach is multidisciplinary and is therefore not based on a single engineering solution. The main aim of this paper is to discuss one aspect covered by a holistic integrated catchment management approach, namely a flood forecast, warning and response system, which contributes to the prevention and mitigation of flood losses.

TI Low-cost domestic water filter: The case for a process-based approach
   for the development of a rural technology product
SO WATER SA
LA English
DT Article
AB The paper describes the case of development of a rural technology product in a high-technology IT (information technology) environment, The product is a low-cost water filter for which there is a definite need in rural India. The case brings out how even a simple-looking concept for water filtration has to go through several well-defined steps for successful introduction into the field. These evolutionary steps resulting in a process for product development were found to be not too different from any high-technology product process (including a software product process) leading to the inference that in general the steps for a successful product process are the same whether the end use is for a high-technology application or a low-technology application. The usefulness of carrying out work within a process framework is highlighted. Since the project aims at technology transfer to the rural poor for generating rural livelihoods, appropriate financial models and the general sustainability issues for such an activity are briefly discussed. The usefulness of an IT environment in facilitating the development activity is pointed out. The lessons learnt in this exercise are documented.

AB Rapid groundwater drawdown in Gaocheng City, the alluvial plain of the Taihang Mountain in the North China Plain, has become the biggest threat to agricultural sustainability. In order to determine the factors resulting in the groundwater decline and to develop a practical plan for long-term groundwater use, water-table fluctuation data were collected over a period of 25 years. The analysis showed that although the drawdown of the water-table was mainly due to water used for winter wheat production and other crops, another reason for groundwater level decline was the tremendous decline of upstream groundwater recharge. It was estimated that, compared to the 1970s, decrease in upstream groundwater recharge in the 1990s resulted in about 1.2 m/a of groundwater level decline. Thus, decline of upstream groundwater recharge rather than agricultural water use was the main reason for the recent groundwater drawdown. On the other hand, gradually improved agricultural practices have saved a great deal of water since the 1970s. The analysis also revealed that, although the groundwater level declined during the wheat-growing season, corn-growing season and over the whole year strongly correlated with the amount of precipitation in that period, aside from one year of extremely high precipitation. precipitation did not recharge groundwater directly but affected groundwater levels through a decrease in irrigation water use. Finally, in order to maintain the groundwater balance, agricultural practices have to save about 180 mm/a of irrigation water from their present level.

AB As economic circumstances change and environmental legislation tightens, paper mills are forced to minimize their energy, water and chemistry consumption and minimize the discharge of effluent Efforts of the mills have already led to more closed water systems. Water loop closure results in accumulation of contaminants. According to the so-called '5-fraction model' the contaminants can be divided into 1. Long Fibers, 2a medium fibers (10%), 2b fines and 2c fillers (ash), 3. Colloidals, 4. High molecular dissolved and 5 Low molecular dissolved components. Because of involved problems and costs, paper mills need to optimize their overall production system with sustainable and competitive management and technology principles.
   The objective of this paper is to give a review and some perspectives regarding membrane bioreactors in waterloop closure concepts for recycled papermaking industry in particular.
   Elements of the water loop closure strategy are counter current principle, water loop separation, smart water/pulp management thermophilic aerobic ultra/micro-filtration membrane bioreactor (MBR), desalting by means of electrodialysis (EDR) or Reverse Osmosis.
   Within waterloop closure programmes PINCH approaches, mass balancing tools like WinGems and Ideas are regularly used. In-process treatment will be implemented near the source or release of the relevant contaminant.
   Major contaminant fractions are dissolved and colloidals (biodegradable) and can be converted by means of a Membrane Bioreactors. Pilot trials with "pressurized" or "submerged" types were carried out A start-up of a full-scale MBR installation is discussed. Because of the thermophilic conditions, less space, energy, etc. in comparison with conventional installations, will be necessary. The combination of biological and membrane technologies will have a positive perspective regarding sustainable papermaking processes and papermaking competitiveness.

TI Organic Farming in the Nordic Countries - Animal Health and Production
SO ACTA VETERINARIA SCANDINAVICA
LA English
DT Article
DE Organic farming; animal health; animal welfare; food safety; diseases
AB Organic farming (or ecological agriculture) is of growing importance in the agricultural sector worldwide. In the Nordic countries, 1-10% of the arable land was in organic production in 1999. Organic farming can be seen as an approach to agriculture where the aim is to create integrated, humane, environmentally and economically sustainable agricultural production systems. Principles like nutrient recycling, prevention rather than treatment and the precautionary principle are included in aims and standards. Animal welfare is another hallmark of organic livestock production but despite this, several studies have indicated severe health problems e. g. in organic poultry production in Denmark. Also the quality of animal food products in relation to human health, particularly the risk of zoonotic infections, has been debated. For these reasons there is a need for improvement of production methods and animal health status. Vets play an important role in this development through work in clinical practice and in research. On-farm consultancy should be tailored to the individual farmers needs, and the practitioner should be willing to take up new ideas and when needed, to enter a critical dialogue in relation to animal welfare. Better base line data on animal health and food safety in organic food systems are needed.

AB While there is tremendous interest in sustainability, a fundamental theory of sustainability does not exist. We present our efforts at constructing a theory from Information Theory and Ecological Models. We discuss the state of complex systems that incorporate ecological and other components in terms of dynamic behavior in a phase space defined by the system state variables. From sampling the system trajectory, a distribution function for the probability of observing the system in a given state is constructed, and an expression for the Fisher information is derived. Fisher information is the maximum amount of information available from a set of observations. in this case, states of the system. Fisher information is a function of the variability of the observations such that low variability leads to high Fisher information and high variability leads to low Fisher information. Systems in stable dynamic states have constant Fisher information. Systems losing organization migrate toward higher variability and lose Fisher information. Self-organizing systems decrease their variability and acquire Fisher information. These considerations lead us to propose a sustainability hypothesis: "sustainable systems do not lose or gain Fisher information over time." We illustrate these concepts using simulated ecological systems in stable and unstable states, and we discuss the underlying dynamics. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Societies are exploring what sustainable development means for development choices. Increasingly, we recognise that human population health is not just an input to socioeconomic development, but is an essential outcome, and, over time, a marker of sustainability. There has been recent attention to how stocks of social and human capital precondition gains in population health. However, recognition of how environmental change can limit health and survival has been slower. Over many millennia, disease and longevity profiles in populations: have reflected changes In environmental conditions and, often, excedances of carrying capacity. Today, population growth and the aggregated pressures of consumption and emissions are beginning to impair various global environmental systems. The research tasks In detecting, attributing, and projecting the resultant health effects are complex. Have recent health gains, in part, depended on depleting natural environmental capital? Population health sciences have a crucial contribution to make to the sustainability project.

AB Pearl millet (Penisetum glaucum (L.) R.Br.) is a major food crop grown on impoverished sandy soils in the Sahel. A 9-year long-term study was undertaken in the Sahel to test the hypothesis that integrated use of millet crop residues retained on farm fields after harvest and mineral fertilizers results in greater and more sustainable yields and conserve soil fertility better than either the use of residue or fertilizer alone. The four treatments compared were: (1) control (crop residue removed and no fertilizer applied), (2) crop residue alone, (3) 30 kg N + 13 kg P ha(-1) (fertilizer) alone and (4) crop residue + fertilizer. Use of crop residue + fertilizer increased grain yield fourfold over the control; use of fertilizer doubled millet yield relative to the control and crop residues resulted in 1.2 times more yield than the control. Crop residues significantly improved nutrient-use efficiency of the applied fertilizer. Sustainability yield index (SYI), a measure of an upward trend in yield over time, was greatest in crop residue + fertilizer plots as are soil organic carbon, available P and pH. Stability analysis indicated that crop residue + fertilizer treatment gave in greater yields and returns over fertilizer cost in the various seasons than either crop residue or fertilizer.

TI Talukas can provide critical mass for India's sustainable development
SO CURRENT SCIENCE

AB It is suggested that talukas in India can provide critical mass for sustainable development. A study done for Phaltan taluka in western Maharashtra has shown that all its energy needs like electricity, liquid fuel, etc. can be met by judicious use of agricultural residues and other biomass resources grown in the taluka. The study also suggests that biomass energy-based supply options have the capacity to create substantial wealth and employment in any taluka. An energy and food self-sufficient taluka can be a new paradigm of rural development. Various technological and policy issues needed to move this concept forward are outlined.

ID ILEX
AB The holm oak figures among the most prominent forest species in Algeria. The present state of its populations, the regression of its distribution, its ecological importance and the necessity, in the current world context, to promote biodiversity conservation and sustainable ecosystem development are all reasons justifying the elaboration of an Algerian holm oak forest typology, which furthermore constitutes the preliminary step to any management strategy.
   The vastness of our study area permitted the analysis and evaluation at different scales of holm oak forest diversity in relation with its environmental factors. Several papers have already described the primary role of climate in the distribution of holm oak formations. This study of the climate - vegetation relationship in the Algerian holm oak forests will permit an evaluation of their bioclimatic and altitudinal significance and their dynamic relations.
   The evaluation of different climatic parameters by a new method of automatic interpolation (neural network method) served, on the one hand, to characterize the present bioclimatic area of Algerian holm oak forests, and on the other hand, to indicate an acceptable typology of the altitudinal zonation of mountain's vegetation.

   PERCOLATION; SPECTRIN; SITE
AB Massively cross-linked and property-tunable membranes have been fabricated by free radical polymerization of self-assembled, block copolymer vesicles - polymersomes. Similar efforts with cross-linkable lipids would appear frustrated in the past due to at least two factors: limited reactivity and membrane fragility under local stresses of nano-confined cross-linking. We describe here a diblock copolymer of poly(ethylene oxide)polybutadiene that has a hydrophilic weight fraction like that of lipids and forms robust fluid phase membranes in water. The polymersomes sustain free radical polymerization of the hydrophobic butadiene, thereby generating a semipermeable nano-shell. Cross-linked giant vesicles prove stable in chloroform and can also be dehydrated and re-hydrated without rendering the similar to9 nm thick membrane core; the results imply defect-free membranes many microns-squared in area. Surface elastic moduli as well as sustainable wall stresses up to 10(3) Atm, orders of magnitude greater than any natural lipid membrane, appear consistent with strong tethering between close-packed neighbors. The enormous stability of the giant vesicles can be tuned down for application: blending in the hydrogenated analogue poly(ethylene oxide)-polyethylethylene modulates the effective elastic constants as well as the rupture strength by orders of magnitude. The results appear consistent with rigidity percolation through a finite-layer stack of two-dimensional lattices. Moreover, below the percolation limit, a regime of hyper-instability emerges, reflecting perhaps nanoscale demixing and suggestive of the limitations encountered with low reactivity lipids. The results provide general insights into covalent cross-linking within self-assembled nanostructures.

AB Long term data sets of the National Forest Inventory (NFI) and the Monitoring Forest Health Program (MFHP) are analysed to find trends in relationships between boreal conifer forest communities ranked along a fertility gradient and soil nutrients of the humus layer (LFH-horizon) on podzol soils along a large temperature gradient. The temperature gradient covers the nemoral-boreonemoral, southern-central boreal and the northern boreal regions in the continental zone in Norway. For each region, the forest communities are ranked along a soil fertility gradient: communities dominated by heather species, mosses and lichens represent poorer sites than the communities dominated by grasses and herbs. Communities of grasses and herbs had a lower C/N ratio than communities dominated by heather species. In the colder regions, pH and base saturation were higher in the communities dominated by grasses and herbs than in communities dominated by heather species, while exchangeable acidity (Al + H) showed the opposite trend. Total N (N-tot) was higher in the communities with grasses and herbs than in the heather dominated communities in the warmest region. Phosphorus, S, pH and base saturation were higher and exchangeable acidity lower in the colder regions than in the warmer ones. There were no or low significant differences in base cations among forest communities.
   The analyses show that concentrations of soil nutrients in the humus layer of podzol soils for a given community on a national scale are related to the temperature gradient. Partly these relationships are influenced by the dominant tree species. Furthermore the analyses show that concentrations of soil nutrients within a region are related to the fertility gradient, thus, to type of forest community. These relationships are not similar for the different regions. It is suggested that the differences in relationships between the concentrations of soil nutrients and the fertility gradient for the different regions are influenced by temperature, length of growing season, plant available soil nutrients and acid deposition. For the planning of sustainable forest management, this study shows that more research is needed on forest ecosystem processes to further and better explain the geographical variability in relationships between soil type, soil nutrients and humus layer, forest communities and tree species at national and regional scales.

DE waste management; bio-monitoring devices; reuse
AB In the post-industrial society, waste management is integrated in the concepts of responsibility, reliability and continuity. Therefore industry and public office are obliged to implement the concepts of structured environmental management systems more and more strictly. The endpoints are dependent on the type of wastes and on the priorities set by society. They will with time evolve towards more restriction of all kinds of emissions. This will require increasing inputs of labour, information technology and energy into waste treatment and overall waste management. Particularly for aqueous and gaseous wastes that are not contained, continuously improving treatment with maximum re-use and minimum dissipation in the ecosphere will be the trend of the future. Moreover, the public in general and the individual citizen in particular will request to have (bio)assays to monitor regularly and autonomously the quality of his environment. Such advanced waste management requires considerable energy input. It thus may come in conflict with current concerns about CO2-emissions and the Kyoto agreements. Innovative approaches to combine waste management and the International Climate Change Partnership (ICCP) directives, for instance by implementing biological carbon sequestration, are therefore warranted. Biotechnology has a major role to play particularly in terms of advanced treatment down to ng/l-levels and in terms of validating the quality of the environment by means of powerful and intelligent bio-monitoring devices.

AB Sustainable chemistry aims at an improved efficiency of using natural resources which are used to meet human needs for chemical products. Chemists in science and industry, have become aware of the importance to design environmentally benign chemicals. One aspect is the biological persistence and the present paper reviews work in this field focussing on the degradation of xenobiotics in the environment. Different structural reasons for chemical and biological persistence are described and strategies to use single bacterial isolates or microbial communities for the elimination of xenobiotic pollutants in the environment are summarized. Perspectives and limitations to evolve and use this catabolic potential are critically discussed with respect to the complexity of mixtures of xenobiotics often found in practice. An interdisciplinary approach for the prospective design of environmentally benign substances is presented and examples for new commodity chemicals that better fit the naturally existing catabolic potential are included.

DT Article
ID WORLD-WIDE-WEB; MEDICAL INFORMATION
AB Objective This study updates work published in 1998, which found that of 47 rating instruments appearing on websites offering health information, 14 described how they were developed, five provided instructions for use, and none reported the interobserver reliability and construct validity of the measurements.
   Design All rating instrument sites noted in the original study were visited to ascertain whether they were still operating. New rating instruments were identified by duplicating and enhancing the comprehensive search of the internet and the medical and information science literature used in the previous study. Eligible instruments were evaluated as in the original study.
   Results 98 instruments used to assess the quality of websites in the past five years were identified. Many of the rating instruments identified in the original study were no longer available. Of 51 newly identified rating instruments, only five provided some information by which they could be evaluated. As with the six sites identified in the original study that remained available, none of these five instruments seemed to have been validated.
   Conclusions Many incompletely developed rating instruments continue to appear on websites providing health information, even when the organisations that gave rise to those instruments no longer exist Many researchers, organisations, and website developers are exploring alternative ways of helping people to find and use high quality information available on the internet. Whether they are needed or sustainable and whether they make a difference remain to be shown.

AB The activity and stability of composite catalysts obtained by mixing Pt/Al2O3 with SO42--ZrO2, were studied in the reaction of hydroisomerization-cracking of n-octane (300degreesC, 1.5 MPa, WHSV = 4 h(-1), H-2/n-C-8 = 6) obtaining light isoalkanes (isobutane, isopentane, isohexane), very important components of the pool of reformulated gasoline. Both components of the composites were pretreated in H-2 before mixing. Prereduction eliminated the fraction Of SO42- reducible at low temperature, thought to produce SO2 during reaction, a poison for the metal function. A reduction in the poisoning of the metal, produced by adsorption of S compounds, was tried in order to get a higher metal activity for the production of atomic H, needed for the hydrogenation of coke precursors and the prevention of deactivation.
   The pretreatment temperature was adjusted between 300 and 500degreesC in order to keep a suitable amount of sulfate, needed for a sustainable isomerizing-cracking activity and for the stabilization of the tetragonal crystal phase Of ZrO2, the most catalytically active crystal phase. When compared to non-reduced catalysts, composites reduced at 300-350degreesC displayed improved activity and stability for benzene hydrogenation, a metal-catalyzed reaction, and the results were addressed to a decrease in S poisoning. In the pretreated composites the SO42--ZrO2 active tetragonal phase was maintained in spite of the loss of S. For isomerization-cracking of n-octane, the pretreated catalysts showed a higher selectivity to isobutane and a fairly longer stability than non-pretreated catalysts, like Pt/SO42--ZrO2 and SO42--ZrO2 mixed with Pt/Al. TPO tests showed that the catalysts were essentially free of coke. This fact was addressed to a lower coking rate on prereduced sites and to a higher metal activity for hydrogenation of coke precursors. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All lights reserved.

AB A novel bilayer chitosan membrane was prepared by a combined wet/dry phase inversion method and evaluated as a wound dressing. This new type of bilayer chitosan wound dressing, consisting of a dense upper layer (skin layer) and a sponge-like lower layer (sublayer), is very suitable for use as a topical delivery of silver sulfadiazine (AgSD) for the control of wound infections. Physical characterization of the bilayer wound dressing showed that it has excellent oxygen permeability, that it controls the water vapor transmission rate, and that it promotes water uptake capability. AgSD dissolved from bilayer chitosan dressings to release silver and sulfadiazine. The release of sulfadiazine from the bilayer chitosan dressing displayed a burst release on the first day and then tapered off to a much slower release. However, the release of silver from the bilayer chitosan dressing displayed a slow release profile with a sustained increase of silver concentration. The cultures of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus in agar plates showed effective antimicrobial activity for 1 week. In vivo antibacterial tests confirmed that this wound dressing is effective for long-term inhibition of the growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus at an infected wound site. The results in this study indicate that the AgSD-incorporated bilayer chitosan wound dressing may be a material with potential antibacterial capability for the treatment of infected wounds.

AB Objectives To describe and evaluate two different models of a clinical informaticist service
   Design A case study approach, using various qualitative methods to illuminate the complexity of the project groups' experiences.
   Setting UK primary health care.
   Interventions Two informaticist projects to provide evidence based answers to questions arising in clinical practice and thereby support high quality clinical decision making by practitioners.
   Results The projects took contrasting and complementary approaches to establishing the service. One was based in an academic department of primary health care. The service was academically highly rigorous, remained true to its original proposal, included a prominent research component, and involved relatively little personal contact with practitioners. This group achieved the aim of providing general information and detailed guidance to others intending to set up a similar service. The other group was based in a service general practice and took a much more pragmatic, flexible, and facilitative approach. They achieved the aim of a credible, acceptable, and sustainable service that engaged local practitioners beyond the innovators and enthusiasts and secured continued funding.
   Conclusion An informaticist service should be judged on at least two aspects of quality-an academic dimension (the technical quality of the evidence based answers) and a service dimension (the facilitation of questioning behaviour and implementation). This study suggests that while the former may be best achieved within an academic environment, the latter requires a developmental approach in which pragmatic service considerations are addressed.

AB In southern Africa, two indigenous silk moth species, Gonometa postica and G. rufobrunnea (Lepidoptera: Lasiocampidae), produce commercial-quality silk with fibre that rivals that of the domesticated silkworm and thus has potential for commercial utilization, Although extensive harvesting of cocoons is taking place, little is known of the biology of these two species, including the frequency distribution of cucoon and adult sizes. In both species the sexes differ in size, but the extent of these differences has never been formally quantified. Female cocoons are approximately twice as large as male cocoons, and yield more silk fibre. Thus, sex ratios in natural populations will be important hen harvesting cocoons, Our aim was to determine if there are differences in sex-specific cocoon size between: the species; host-plant-specific populations; localities within their distribution range; and between first and second-generation pupae The sex ratio and frequency of dwarfism in populations, were also determined. Both Gonometa species were significantly sexually dimorphic in cocoon length, width and shape and they could be sexed based on size and shape. Cocoon length was a suitable alternative measure to occupied cocoon mass, and may be used as a rough estimate of silk yield. The sex ratio of both species was approximately 1: 1 and did not differ consistently between generations. Dwarfs were only found in G. postica populations, Cocoon sizes differed significantly between species, the sexes and localities, but not between generation, and host-plant-specific populations. The variability in cocoon sizes found at localities would have implications for silk yields, but sex and species are by far the most important determinants of cocoon size. This information will form the basis of a sustainable harvesting programme for Gonometa spp, in southern Africa.

AB The "system of rice intensification" (SRI) that evolved in the 1980s and 1990s in Madagascar permits resource-limited farmers to realise yields of up to 15 t of paddy/hectare on infertile soils, with greatly reduced rates of irrigation and without external inputs. This paper reviews the plant physiological and bio-ecological factors associated with agronomic practices that could explain the extraordinary yields in terms of synergies resulting from the judicious management of the major crop production factors: time, space, water, plant nutrients and labour. The findings underscore the importance of integrated and interdisciplinary research, combining strategic and adaptive (on-farm participatory) approaches that explore and link bio-physical and socio-economic factors in crop production. Such approaches would permit to unlock currently untapped production potentials of rice and other major cereal grain crops, without extra costs to farmers or to the environment.

AB The assessment of carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) in agro-ecosystems of West African savannas (WAS) may be a useful tool to define sustainable intensification schemes needed to respond to the rapid increase in local populations as well as global change issues. Changes in soil properties, and particularly in the soil organic matter status, under semi-permanent cultivation were thus examined through a groundnut crop-fallow chronosequence in southern Senegal. The effect of fallowing was mainly restricted to the 0-20 cm soil layer and hardly affected soil physical properties. In this layer, steady improvements were recorded for Mg and Ca contents. Carbon and N amounts increased by 30%, and by 50% for available P (POD) within the very first year of fallow and then remained steady (C and N) or dropped back to levels recorded for crops (POD). The rapid initial change in organic status after crop abandonment was attributed to fast recovery of woody vegetation. The steady soil organic matter (SOM) content in oldest fallows compared to young fallows probably resulted from poor protection of soil organic matter from oxidation during biological activity. This hypothesis was confirmed by mesh-bag experiments, which indicated that >40-60% of decaying woody root biomass disappeared after 6 months of in situ incubation. In fallow systems in southern Senegal, soil fertility may in fact rely at least as much on fast organic matter cycling in soil food webs as on SOM build-up. Carbon storage in the soil-plant system of mature fallow ecosystems was only 27 t C ha(-1) higher than in crops and consisted mainly of pools with fast turnover. Consequently, the potential of semi-permanent cultivation for C sequestration in the WAS will be rather indirect, by a shift to more intensified practices, thus avoiding the conversion of dense forests to cropping in more humid areas.

AB Carbon (C) and associated nutrient budgets related to land use in agro-ecosystems in West African savannas (WAS) are a matter of both local (sustainability of farming systems) and global (C balance) concern. In a mixed-farming system in southern Senegal, patterns of C, nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) allocation in the plant-soil system (down to a 40 cm soil depth) were compared at harvest in 14 plots, six being under semi-permanent cultivation with groundnut (Arachis hypogaea L.), others being under continuous cultivation with millet (Pennisetum glaucum L.), maize (Zea mays L.) or rice (Oryza sativa L.). Carbon stored in the plant-soil system amounted to 25.0, 27.4, 34.9 and 71.9 t per ha, respectively, in groundnut, millet, maize and rice fields. Ninety percent of C and P (total in plant P(t), available P in soil (POD)) and 95% of N of the whole ecosystem were stored in the soil. The high C and nutrient amounts found in rice plots were attributed to the clayey texture of the soil and to seasonal flooding. The lower values for C, N and POD found in soils in the bush ring (groundnut crops) compared to those of the compound ring (millet and maize crops) stemmed from land management. Higher values for C, N and POD in soils in the compound ring were maintained under continuous cultivation thanks to higher organic and nutrient inputs originating from crop residue recycling, manuring and, in the maize plots, spreading of household wastes. In the compound ring, the amount of C stored seemed to depend as much on the amount of C input as on the chemical richness of organic inflow. The effect of land management (bush versus compound ring) on soil properties was generally restricted to the 0-20 cm layer (except for P, cations and pH), and the better soil status in the compound ring was linked to nutrient depletion of the bush ring. From the perspective of global change, the estimated potential of the WAS for C sequestration under continuous cultivation was found to be low. From a methodological point of view, soil carbon status may be considered as a relevant indicator for the fertility of agro-ecosystems in the WAS belt, provided that its biotic components are included, and that both the quality and dynamics of soil organic matter (assessment of seasonal variations, and C flows) and soil texture are characterised.

AB Cropping systems in the northern Great Plains (NGP) have evolved from wheat Triticum aestivum L.)-fallow rotations to diversified cropping sequences. Diversification and continuous cropping have largely been a consequence of soil moisture saved through the adoption of conservation tillage. Consequently, weed communities have changed and, in some cases, become resistant to commonly used herbicides, thus increasing the complexity of managing weeds. The sustainability of diverse reduced tillage systems in the NGP depends on the development of economical and effective weed management systems. Utilizing the principle of varying selection pressure to keep weed communities off balance has reduced weed densities, minimized crop yield losses, and inhibited adverse community changes toward difficult-to-control species. Varied selection pressure was best achieved with a diverse cropping system where crop seeding date, perennation, and species and herbicide mode of action and use pattern were inherently varied. Novel approaches to cropping systems, including balancing rotations between cereal and broadleaf crops, reducing herbicide inputs, organic production, fall-seeded dormant canola (Brassica napus and B. rapa), and the use of cover crops and perennial forages, are discussed in light of potential systems-level benefits for weed management.

AB Economic viability and soil degradation are major issues facing farmers in the grassland ecozone of the northern Great Plains. Management strategies such as crop diversification, reduced fallow, and reduced inputs are being promoted as solutions. However, knowledge of the impacts of these management strategies on the grassland ecozone is lacking. Studies using a systems approach, applied as the experimental framework with which to monitor and assess alternate input and cropping strategies, are being conducted through the collaboration of crop, pest, economic, and soil scientists. Five examples are presented that highlight the arthropod (insects, spiders, and mites) component of multi disciplinary studies designed to evaluate crop management strategies. They demonstrate that arthropods are the most diverse group of organisms in the ecosystems studied and include beneficial and pest species. These studies attempt to utilize the arthropod assemblages to characterize the ecosystems that they inhabit. Ecosystem-based, baseline arthropod faunas are integral to evaluating existing cropping practices and aid in the redesign of farming systems to make them economically viable and environmentally sustainable.

AB Nitrogen oxides are released during atmospheric combustion of fossil fuels and biomass, and during the production of certain chemicals and products. They can react with natural or man-made volatile organic compounds to produce smog, or else can be further oxidized to produce particulate haze, or acid rain that can eutrophy land and water. The reactive nitrogen that begins in the energy sector thus cascades through the atmosphere, the hydrosphere and soils before being eventually partially denitrifed to the global warming and stratospheric ozone-depleting gas nitrous oxide or molecular nitrogen. This paper will suggest how an economic analysis of the nitrogen cycle can identify the most cost-effective places to intervene. Nitrogen oxides released during fossil-fuel combustion in vehicles, power plants and heating boilers can either be controlled by add-on emission control technology, or can be eliminated by many of the same technical options that lead to carbon dioxide reduction. These integrated strategies also address sustainability, economic development and national security issues. Similarly in industrial production, it is more effective to focus on redesigning industrial processes rather than on nitrogen oxide pollution elimination from the current system. This paper will suggest which strategies might be utilized to address multiple benefits rather than focusing on single pollutants.

AB Biomass, net primary productivity, energetics and energy efficiencies were estimated in an age series of Alnus-cardamom plantations in the eastern Himalaya. The impact of stand age (5, 10, 15, 20, 30 and 40 years) on the performance of mixtures of N-2-fixing (Alnus nepalensis) and non-N-2-fixing (large cardamom) plants was studied. Large cardamom (Amomum subulatum) is the most important perennial cash crop in the region and is cultivated predominantly under Alnus trees. Net primary productivity was lowest (7 t ha(-1) per year) in the 40-year-old stand and was more than three times higher (22 t ha(-1) per year) in the 15-year-old stand. Agronomic yield of large cardamom peaked between 15 and 20 years of age. Cardamom productivity doubled from the 5- to the 15-year-old stand, and then decreased with plantation age to reach a minimum in the 40-year-old stand. Performance of cardamom in association of N2-fixing Alnus remained beneficial until 20 years of age. Annual net energy fixation was highest (444 X 10(6) kJ ha (-1) per year) in the 15-year-old stand, being 1.4 times that of the 5-year-old stand and 2.9-times that of the 40-year-old stand. Inverse relationships of production efficiency, energy conversion efficiency and energy utilized in N-2-fixation against stand age, and a positive relationship between production efficiency and energy conversion efficiency suggest that the younger plantations are more productive, The Alnus-cardamom plantation system will be sustainable by adopting a rotational cycle of 15 to 20 years.

AB Nutrient cycling, nutrient use efficiency and nitrogen fixation in an age series of Alnus-cardamom plantations were studied in the eastern Himalaya. The impact of stand age (5, 10, 15, 20, 30 and 40 years) on the nutrient dynamics of mixtures of N-2-fixing (Alnus nepalensis) and non-N-2-fixing (large cardamom) plants was assessed. Foliar nutrient concentrations of Alnus decreased with advancing age groups of plantations and showed an inverse relationship with stand age. Annual N fixation increased from the 5-year-old stand (52 kg ha(-1)), peaking in the 15-year-old stand (155 kg ha(-1)) and then decreased with increasing plantation age. Nitrogen and phosphorus uptake was lowest in the 40-year-old stand, and highest in the 15- and 5-year-old stand, respectively. Nutrient storage in understorey cardamom was very high: up to 31 % N and 59 % P of the stand total in the 15-year-old stand. Nutrient use efficiency was higher (with faster turnover times) in younger stands and decreased (with slower turnover times) in older plantations. Nitrogen retranslocation showed a strong positive relationship with stand age, while that of P was inversely related to stand age. Nutrient standing stock, uptake and return were also highest in the 15-year-old stand. Nitrogen and P cycling in Alnus-cardamom plantations was functionally balanced. Nutrient cycling and dynamics indicated that Alnus-cardamom plantations performed sustainably up to 15-20 years. The management practice should be altered to incorporate replantation after this age.

AB The main strategy of APOC, of community-directed treatment with ivermectin (CDTI), has enabled the programme to reach, empower and bring relief to remote and under-served, onchocerciasis-endemic communities. With CDTI, geographical and therapeutic coverages have increased substantially, in most areas, to the levels required to eliminate onchocerciasis as a public-health problem. Over 20 million people received treatment in 2000. APOC has also made effective use of the combination of the rapid epidemiological mapping of onchocerciasis (REMO) and geographical information systems (GIS), to provide information on the geographical distribution and prevalence of the disease. This has led to improvements in the identification of CDTI-priority areas, and in the estimates of the numbers of people to be treated. A unique public-private-sector partnership has been at the heart of APOC's relative success. Through efficient capacity-building, the programme's operations have positively influenced and strengthened the health services of participating countries. These laudable achievements notwithstanding, APOC faces many challenges during the second phase of its operations, when the full impact of the programme is expected to be felt. Notable among these challenges are the sustainability of CDTI, the strategy's effective integration into the healthcare system, and the full exploitation of its potential as an entry, point for other health programmes. The channels created for CDTI, could, for example, help efforts to eliminate lymphatic filariasis (which will feature on the agenda of many participating countries during APOC's Phase 2). However, these other programmes need to be executed without compromising the onchocerciasis-control programme itself. Success in meeting these challenges will depend on the continued, wholehearted commitment of all the partners involved, particularly that of the governments of the participating countries.

AB The principal strategy adopted by the African Programme for Onchocerciasis Control (APOC), for the control of onchocerciasis in the 19 countries of Africa that now fall within the programme's remit, is that of community-directed treatment with ivermectin (CDTI). Halfway through its 12-year mandate, APOC has gathered enough information on the main challenges to guide its activities in Phase 2. An analysis of reports and other documents, emanating from consultants, scientists, monitors and national and project-level implementers, indicates that there are three broad categories of challenge: managerial; technical; and socio-political. Under these three categories, this review identifies the most pertinent concerns that APOC must address, during Phase 2, to enhance the prospects of establishing sustainable systems for ivermectin distribution. The major challenges include: (1) maintaining timely drug-collection mechanisms; (2) integrating CDTI with existing primary-healthcare services; (3) strengthening local health infrastructure; (4) achieving and maintaining an optimal treatment coverage; (5) establishing and up-scaling community self-monitoring; (6) designing and implementing operations research locally; (7) ensuring the adequacy of community-directed distributors; (8) increasing the involvement of local non-governmental develop organizations in the programme; (9) achieving financial sustainability; (10) implementing equitable cost-recovery systems; and (11) engaging in effective advocacy. The implications of the challenges and suggestions about how they are being (or could be) addressed are also highlighted in this brief review, which should be of value to other programmes and agencies that may be contemplating the adoption of this unique strategy.

AB This paper reviews the issues relating to compliance and participation among the men and women of three countries within the remit of the African Programme for the Control of Onchocerciasis (APOC): Cameroon, Nigeria and Tanzania. Project-monitoring data from 109 focus-group discussions, 6069 household-survey respondents and 89 interviews with ivermectin distributors were analysed to gain an insight into the attitudes and behaviours of men and women in relation to ivermectin treatment and their participation in the programme. Although there are no statistically significant gender differences in coverages for ivermectin treatment, culturally prescribed gender relationships influence the ways in which men and women express and experience treatment-related behaviours. Gender roles also affect participation in the programme. Decision-making in communities on the selection of distributors tends to follow socio-cultural hierarchies based upon patriarchy and gerontocracy. Relatively few ivermectin distributors (21%) are women. Although they receive less support than their male counterparts, the female distributors are just as willing to continue ivermectin distribution in the community, and they perform as well or better than men in this regard. The terms 'community-directed', 'community participation, and even 'compliance' obfuscate important gender differences that are inherent in the implementation of onchocerciasis control. Development of strategies that recognize these gender differences will have important implications for long-term adherence to treatment and for the overall quality and sustainability, of the programme.

LA English
DT Article
ID IVERMECTIN; NIGERIA
AB Community-directed treatment is a relatively new strategy that was adopted in 1997 by the African Programme for Onchocerciasis Control (APOC), for large-scale distribution of ivermectin (Mectizan(R)). Participatory monitoring of 39 of the control projects based on community-directed treatment with ivermectin (CDTI) was under-taken from 1998-2000, with a focus on process implementation of the strategy and the predictors of sustainability. Data from 14,925 household inter-views in 2314 villages, 183 complete treatment records, 382 focus-group discussions, and the results of interviews with 669 community leaders, 757 trained community-directed drug distributors (CDD) and 146 health personnel (in 26 projects in four countries) were analysed. The data show that CDD dispensed ivermectin to 65.4% of the total population (71.2% of the eligible population), with no significant gender differences in coverage (P > 0.05). Treatment coverage ranged from 60.2% of the eligible subjects in Cameroon to 76.9% in Uganda. There was no significant relationship between the provision of incentives to CDD and treatment coverage (P > 0.05). The frequency of treatment refusal was highest in Cameroon (29.2%). Although most (72.1%) of the communities investigated selected their CDD on the basis of a community decision at a village meeting, only 37.9% chose their distribution period in the same way. There is clearly a need to improve communication strategies, to address the issues of absentees and refusals, to emphasise community ownership and to de-emphasise incentives for CDD. The investigation of the 'predictor indicators' of sustainability should enable APOC to understand the determinants of project performance and to initiate any appropriate changes in the programme.

TI APOC's strategy of community-directed treatment with ivermectin (CDTI)
   and its potential for providing additional health services to the
   poorest populations
SO ANNALS OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND PARASITOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB Since its inauguration in 1995, the African Programme for Onchocerciasis Control (APOC) has made significant progress towards achieving its main objective: to establish sustainable community-directed treatment with ivermectin (CDTI) in onchocerciasis-endemic areas outside of the remit of the Onchocerciasis Control Programme in West Africa (OCP). In the year 2000, the programme, in partnership with governments, non-governmental organizations and the endemic communities themselves, succeeded in treating 20,298,138 individuals in 49,654 communities in 63 projects in 14 countries. Besides the distribution of ivermectin, the programme has strengthened primary healthcare (PHC) through capacity-building, mobilization of resources and empowerment of communities. The community-directed-treatment approach is a model that can be adopted in developing other community-based health programmes, The approach has also made it possible to bring to the poor some measure of intervention in some other healthcare programmes, such as those for malaria control, eye care, maternal and child health, nutrition and immunization. CDTI presents, at all stages of its implementation, a unique window of opportunity for promoting the functional integration of healthcare activities. For this to be done successfully and in a co-ordinated manner, adequate funding of CDTI within PHC is as important as an effective sensitization of the relevant policy-makers, healthworkers and communities on the value of integration (accompanied by appropriate training at all levels). Evaluation of the experiences in integration of health services, particularly at community level, is crucial to the success of the integration.

AB Hunter-based beluga monitoring programs, in place in the Mackenzie Delta since 1973 and in the Paulatuk, Northwest Territories, area since 1989, have resulted in collection of data on the number of whales harvested and on the efficiency of the hunts. Since 1980, data on the standard length, fluke width, sex, and age of the landed whales have also been collected. The number of belugas landed each year averaged 131.8 (SD 26.5, n = 1337) between 1970 and 1979, 124.0 (SD 23.3, n = 1240) between 1980 and 1989, and 111.0 (SD 19.0, n = 1110) between 1990 and 1999. The human population increased during this same period. Removal of belugas from the Beaufort Sea stock, including landed whales taken in the Alaskan harvests, is estimated at 189 per year. The sex ratio of landed belugas from the Mackenzie Estuary was 2.3 males: I female. Median ages were 23.5 yr (47 growth layer groups [GLG]) for females (n = 80) and 24 yr (48 GLG) for males (n = 286). More than 92% of an aged sample (n = 368) from the harvest consisted of whales 10 or more years old (20 GLG). The rate of removal is small in relation to the expected maximum net productivity rate of this stock. The continued availability of large, old individuals after centuries of harvesting and the apparent lack of change in the size and age structure of the catch in recent years also support a conclusion that the present level of harvest is sustainable.

AB Objective. To evaluate the efficacy and safety of anakinra in combination with methotrexate (MTX) in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
   Methods. Patients with moderate-to-severe active RA who were receiving MTX for 6 consecutive months, with stable doses for greater than or equal to3 months (those with disease duration of > 6 months but < 12 years,) were randomized into 6 groups: placebo or 0.04, 0.1, 0.4, 1.0, or 2.0 mg/kg of anakinra administered in a single, daily, subcutaneous injection. The primary efficacy end point was the proportion of subjects who met the American College of Rheumatology 20% improvement criteria (attained an ACR20 response) at week 12.
   Results. A total of 419 patients were randomized in the study. Patient demographics and disease status were similar in the 6 treatment groups. The ACR20 responses at week 12 in the 5 active treatment plus MTX groups demonstrated a statistically significant (P = 0.001) dose-response relationship compared with the ACR220 response in the placebo plus MTX group. The ACR20 response rate in the anakinra 1.0-mg/kg (46%; P = 0.001) and 21.0-mg/kg (38%; P = 0.007) dose groups was significantly greater than that in the placebo group (19%). The ACR20 responses at 24 weeks were consistent with those at 12 weeks. Similar improvements in anakinra-treated subjects were noted in individual ACR components, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, onset of ACR20 response, sustainability of ACR20 response, and magnitude of ACR response. Anakinra was safe and well tolerated. Injection site reaction was the most frequently noted adverse event, and this led to premature study withdrawal in 7% (1.0-mg/kg group) to 10% group) of patients receiving higher doses.
   Conclusion. In patients with persistently active RA, the combination of anakinra and MTX was safe and well tolerated and provided significantly greater clinical benefit than MTX alone.

   redox conversion of hydroxyl pairs; peroxy in minerals

AB To survive in deep subsurface environments, lithotrophic microbial communities require a sustainable energy source such as hydrogen. Though H-2 can be produced when water reacts with fresh mineral surfaces and. oxidizes ferrous iron, this reaction is unreliable since it depends upon the exposure of fresh rock surfaces via the episodic opening of cracks and fissures. A more reliable and potentially more voluminous H-2 source exists in nominally anhydrous minerals of igneous and metamorphic rocks. Our experimental results indicate that H-2 molecules can be derived from small amounts of H2O dissolved in minerals in the form of hydroxyl, OH- or O3Si-OH, whenever such minerals crystallized in an H2O-laden environment. Two types of experiments were conducted. Single crystal fracture experiments indicated that hydroxyl pairs undergo an in situ redox conversion to H-2 molecules plus peroxy links, O3Si/(OO)\SiO3. While the peroxy links become part of the mineral structure, the H-2 molecules diffused out of the freshly fractured mineral surfaces. If such a mechanism occurred in natural settings, the entire rock column would become a volume source of H-2. Crushing experiments to facilitate the outdiffusion of H-2 were conducted with common crustal igneous rocks such as granite, andesite, and labradorite. At least 70 nmol of H-2/g diffused out of coarsely crushed andesite, equivalent at standard pressure and temperature to 5,000 cm(3) of H-2/m(3) of rock. In the water-saturated, biologically relevant upper portion of the rock column the diffusion of H-2 out of the minerals will be buffered by H-2 saturation of the intergranular water film.

AB This paper examines the mass of recent research, which suggests that the Nazis were much more successful in winning "working-class" votes than had been previously imagined. Though the research has undeniably shown a great deal of such support, some of the claims made on its basis (e.g. about the cross-sectional and relatively random distribution of Nazi support amongst workers) are not sustainable. In fact working-class Nazis were much more likely to be found amongst some communities than others (e.g. in rural areas and small provincial towns); and the fact that some Social Democrats did desert to the radical right in the early 1930s is not sufficient to claim that explanations framed in terns of "class milieux" no longer function.

AB Flying fox fruit bats are hunted in an annual 2-month season in Niue, a small and isolated South Pacific island nation. The sustainability of this hunt has been questioned because of an obvious recent decline. We estimated the island-wide flying fox population to be between 2040 and 4080 bats, 2 months prior to the 1998-1999 hunt. Sixty hunters interviewed after the hunt had shot 1555 bats, an unsustainable number. Many Niueans believe that an infinite quantity of flying foxes live in two small taboo or forbidden areas that originally acted as wildlife sanctuaries to safeguard animal resources for times of famine. However, our surveys suggest only a small colony roosts in one taboo area. Niueans' belief that taboo areas shelter an unlimited number of bats cannot be refuted as the areas may not be visited. Consequently, few people believe that the population is being overharvested. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The possibility of retrieving the energy contained in forest residues originating from wood exploitation in Galicia (Spain) is evaluated. This study was made on Eucalyptus globulus Labill occupying a forest surface of 240 000 ha. This species plays an important role in the economical development of Galicia, as it is the main forest species for production of pulp. Sampling was made over 1999 in seven different zones, three main stations plus four selected for comparison, situated in Galicia. The residues originating from cutting were sorted into three different groups and their calorific values were measured by static bomb calorimetry. These calorific values, close to 7200 kJ kg(-1), make possible the use of this residual biomass as an energy source. Calorific values were measured by static bomb calorimeter in an oxygen atmosphere. Flammability was determined using a standard epiradiator. Simultaneously, some other parameters, elementary chemical composition, heavy metal contents, moisture, density, ash percentage after combustion in the bomb, and main bioclimatic characteristics, were also determined.

SO BIOSYSTEMS ENGINEERING

ID SOIL
AB The low productivity of smallholder farming systems and enterprises is attributed mainly to the limited resources of farming households and to the application of inappropriate skills and practices that can lead to land degradation. Land productivity may be raised by improved soil and water management and by mechanization (considering the whole spectrum of power sources) that makes better use of human labour and other resources. However, mechanization programmes, which facilitate soil and water management, have to consider cultural and social factors as well as the immediate technical and economic issues. The livelihoods approach provides a framework for dealing with such considerations, which can be elicited through the participation of farmers in the research and development activities.
   Examples are given of participatory research (i.e. research in which scientists and farmers participate as partners) to raise smallholder productivity sustainably in India, Zimbabwe and Latin America. Sustainability is a key issue for economic security in the longer term, and depends on many interacting factors both within and outside the tasks of crop production. The most significant of these factors are discussed and it is emphasized that involving farmers provides a reliable means of accounting for them and enabling the farmers to apply new knowledge to raise productivity, but within the contexts of their own livelihood strategies.

ID GENE-EXPRESSION PATTERNS; HUMAN CANCER
AB Academic researchers are increasingly producing and using cDNA microarrays. Their quality and hybridization specificity are crucial in determining whether the generated data are accurate and interpretable. Here, we describe two methods of monitoring microarray production, the sustainability v of DNA attachment, and the specificity of hybridization. The first method consists of labeling an oligonucleotide, which is, one of the primers used to amplify all cDNA probes on the array (except for beta-actin and GAPDH) with fluorescent dye and hybridize it to the cDNA microarray. Attachment of the cDNAs on the array after the hybridization procedure was monitored by visualizing fluorescent signals from the spots on the array. In the second method, two selected DNA targets, beta-actin and GAPDH, were labeled with fluorescent dye to hybridize to the cDNA array. Hence, hybridization specificity was demonstrated by obtaining fluorescent signals solely from the genes corresponding to the target.

AB While the Convention on Biological Diversity prescribes the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity, it also makes provision for sustainable utilisation of these resources through appropriate access and the sharing of any benefits arising. Implementation of these principles is currently subject to painstaking international negotiations between a diversity of stakeholders with contrasting interests. This article untangles the different positions, and surveys the at-tempts so far at interpreting and implementing the Convention's basic rules and principles.

AB The introduction of mass public education Posed unfamiliar problems for the governments of modern states, and the ways in which governments worked through those problems can reveal much about the culture and values of a state.. This paper focuses on central Government officials and the Ministers they advised, with particular attention to the pivotal period 1960-1976. Trends identified include. the shift from post-War optimism to the more pessimistic view of schooling since the late 1966s; the dynamics of professional development amid over-rapid expansion and contraction; relationships between training institutions and schools; and policy-makers' changing perceptions of teachers as professionals. Four themes are considered in detail. the imperatives of numbers; status concerns as a driver of change; linkages among the Partners' in the schooling enterprise; and accountability. Some questions are posed about the sustainability of the schooling enterprise in England and Wales.

AB The idea to relate intelligent building projects and demonstrations to total sustainability in the built environment is presented in this paper. By considering intelligent buildings in the spirit of built heritage conservation, future architectural and construction efforts can contribute toward emergence of durable buildings that are meant to enhance sustainability in the built environment. The promotion of intelligent and green technologies should be educational in nature, reaching out to a wide range of parties and allowing them to participate in the progress of the technologies. We propose an initiative to promote this process. We also examine two case studies of existing demonstration projects. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

ID FRAMEWORK
AB The concepts and visions of sustainable development that have emerged in the post-Brundtland era are explored in terms laying the foundations for a common vision of sustainable urban development (SUD). The described vision and methodology for SUD resulted from the activities of an international network called BEQUEST, funded by the European Commission. The project involved building consensus over the language and vision of SUD across a wide range of stakeholders in the urban environment and across a range of spatial and temporal scales, development activities and environmental and social issues. The resulting vision of SUD is that of a relative, adaptive process in which the current urban fabric is gradually adapted over time to suit more sustainable lifestyles. A framework for structuring information on SUD has been developed which provides a unique, integrated representation of the scope and extent of the subject that links together socio-economic and technical dimensions as well as planning, property, design and construction interests, in time and space. Impediments to implementation of the vision and method are explored, including lack of demand, lack of capacity, absence of agreed targets and indicators together with other policy problems undermining full sustainability assessment and evaluation of urban re/ development proposals.

AB This paper describes the outcomes of a survey of assessment methods for sustainable urban development (SUD) undertaken by an international network called BEQUEST. It addresses aspects of good practice in terms of SUD, explores the range of methods available and explains the classification used in the directory of methods included in the BEQUEST Toolkit available on the web. An exercise undertaken to map the range of assessment methods to the various sustainability issues and development activities is described. The strengths and weakness and other deficiencies in current forms of sustainability assessment are explored. The key gaps in sustainability assessment are identified for further research and the importance of greater integration in assessment and evaluation, across professional and subject boundaries is emphasized.

AB A prototype decision support system for making informed decisions on urban development has been produced by the pan-European BEQUEST network. The overall aim is to enhance urban sustainability, the process of developing a built environment that meets peoples' needs whilst avoiding unacceptable social or environmental impacts. The system, called the BEQUEST toolkit, consists of modules that present advice on how to make urban development projects more sustainable, how to assess their sustainability and whom to contact for further advice. A glossary of terms related to sustainable urban development (SUD) as well as links to best practice examples and other additional information are also included in the toolkit. The system addresses the issues in a holistic manner and aims to bridge the various scales of urban development from whole urban regions down to buildings and their components and materials. The toolkit has been developed in collaboration with the project's Extranet, an advisory body of more than 100 mainly European professionals and researchers. This group has supported the development of the toolkit through participation in an iterative development process with the core BEQUEST team, addressing the structure of the toolkit and the information that it contains. The Extranet has also tested the system through the Internet, and provided feedback that has led to improvements in the navigational and presentational features of the toolkit and identified areas for future development. The system is a prototype but already demonstrates the usefulness that a full-scale version would possess.

AB This paper places the BEQUEST concerted action (an international project on sustainable urban development) within the context of the discussion that has arisen, within the last decade, about the so-called 'new production of knowledge'. Where such production occurs, short-life inter-disciplinary teams collaborate by engaging in a dynamic form of research characterized by practical problem-solving through negotiated and consensually produced knowledge. In BEQUEST, such knowledge production was electronically mediated - collaboration and dissemination occurred predominantly over the Internet. Attention is drawn to BEQUEST's modus operandi for dealing with contentious issues - sustainable development, inter-disciplinary working, and the design and management of virtual organizations. And it closes by commenting on the implications of crossing discipline boundaries - demanded by 'the new production of knowledge' - for the organization and conduct of research on the built environment.

AB The results of the BEQUEST project on sustainable urban development are reviewed as conceptual contributions and as a dynamic network. The objectives of BEQUEST are considered and compared to the principal achievements. The enlargement of the usual scope of sustainable urban development (SUD) and the insistence on the time and space continuity are highlighted. The different parts of BEQUEST (framework, decision support system, inventory of assessment methods, tool kit, procurement protocol) are discussed in particular in the perspective of new knowledge production through the Extranet. The achievements are situated in a broader perspective, providing a critical review of the current paradigms for SUD. Additional issues which have appeared in other projects are introduced, in particular concerning the cultural, long term aspects of SUD. Finally some perspectives for work after BEQUEST are presented.

AB Interdecadal climate variability complicates fishery science and management. On the U.S. west coast, periods of favorable and adverse conditions may last 30 yrs each. A constant-harvest-rate policy may work for long-lived fishes, (those with life spans comparable to or exceeding the duration of adverse conditions). Exploitation of short-lived fishes (species with life spans shorter than the duration of adverse conditions) benefits from policies that link harvest rate to environmental conditions, but a delayed response can be desirable. Therefore, rapid identification of regime shifts is not necessary but could provide advance notice of long-term changes in expected harvests. Planning horizons, especially for stock rebuilding, may have to be much longer than has been typical, even a century or more. During adverse periods little rebuilding may occur even after total cessation of fishing. Adverse species interactions like intraguild competition or 'cultivation effects' may prolong rebuilding or reduce sustainable yields. Management reference points like F-msy and B-msy can be strongly influenced by abundance of competitors. Importantly, B-msy of large predators may be well above half the unfished biomass if their removal releases smaller competitors. Although adverse interactions may be reversible, rebuilding of apex predators may require decades to centuries.

AB Much of the machinery of modem fish stock assessment is aimed at providing better estimates of current stock size, but the adaptive and feedback policies needed for sustainable long-term management are specified in terms of fishing mortality rate goals in relation to relative stock size, and estimates of optimum fishing mortality rates have dropped sharply since 1990. Should we elect to refocus assessment methods and data gathering more directly on estimation of current and optimum fishing mortality rates, we could probably bypass many of the costs and pitfalls that have plagued traditional assessment approaches. Further, we could concentrate more on providing advice about how to implement safe feedback policies, rather than just contributing to debates about how much is out there to be harvested.

AB Man has a major impact on marine environments through exploitation of fish resources. Fisheries can induce different selective pressures, either directly, i.e., through elevated mortality (which is often highly selective) or through ecosystem-level responses, as exploitation affects food availability and predation risk in both target and nontarget species. Responses to selection can be observed at two levels. First, at the community level, some species may suffer more from effects of harvesting than others; some may even increase in abundance. Responses by species to exploitation are associated with their life histories. In particular, species with late maturation at large size and with low population growth rate tend to undergo more pronounced declines than early-maturing species with rapid growth. Second, the phenotypic composition within species may also change. If phenotypic variability has a genetic basis, then fisheries-induced selection can result in evolutionary change in life-history traits influencing sustainable yields, behavioral traits (e.g., gear-avoidance behavior), and morphological traits. We discuss the possible implications of fisheries-induced adaptive changes for sustainable fisheries management.

AB Large uncertainties that prevail in fisheries create widely recognized biological, economic, and social risks. These risks have spurred development of various methods for dealing with uncertainties, including the 'Precautionary Approach' of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO). However, management agencies still need to implement such approaches more widely, and harvesters must comply more fully with regulations in order to reduce implementation error (the difference between desired and actual consequences of management regulations). Perhaps one way to meet these needs is to establish criteria for ecocertifying specific fisheries, i.e., those in which both management and harvesting practices are expected to maintain biologically and economically productive fish stocks over the long term. Consumers' preferences for ecolabeled products would help align industry's goals with those of management agencies. The threat of losing certification would create incentives for appropriate levels of precaution in agencies' regulations and industry's compliance with them. Ecolabeling initiatives will be aided by recent developments in 'sustainability indicators' and scientifically rigorous performance measures for evaluating them. Particular types of ecolabeling (e.g., voluntary certification combined with consumer education programs) may create appropriate incentives for agencies and industry while avoiding negative reactions by the World Trade Organization to the resulting changes in trade.

TI Strategy from the inside out: Building capability creating organizations
SO CALIFORNIA MANAGEMENT REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
ID RESOURCE-BASED VIEW; COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE; FIRM
AB While popular brands and unique capabilities help sustain a company's competitive advantage, they cannot be built by imitation. Managers have been able to develop sustainable capabilities not by emulating others, but by using their organizational designs and processes to identify, build on, and leverage their "asymmetries"-their evolving unique experiences; contacts, or assets. Such asymmetries may occur even in the simplest organizations. Unfortunately, they frequently are concealed, of little apparent use, and unconnected to value creation. Thus they require new strategy making and organizational approaches for their discovery, development, and application. Based on lessons from a two-year study of a diverse sample of companies, this article shows how managers can grow capabilities that sustain competitive advantage by constantly identifying and growing asymmetries, embedding and empowering them within an organizational design, and shaping market focus to exploit them.

DE assessment for agricultural sustainable development; integrated

AB Based on the provincial units evaluation, this paper makes an assessment for sustainable developing capability of the integrated agricultural regionalization in China. At first, an index system of agricultural sustainable development in China is built up, which includes 5 supporting subsystems of agricultural resources, agricultural development, environment and ecosystem, rural society, sciences-education and management. We selected 95 factors on provincial level as basic indexes. Second, a relative assets/debt assessing method is used to gain relative net assets values (relative superiority) of every provincial unit, which are as supporting data for assessment. We also overlaid the Administrative Divisions Map of China and the Map of Integrated Agricultural Regionalization of China by Geography Information System (GIS) to gain the area units of assessment. Third, according to the relative coherence principle of regionalization we transform administration units to natural units through homogenizing all provincial relative net assets values in every agricultural assessing unit. After making order and grade, we complete the sustainable developing capability assessment to integrated agricultural regionalization in China. The assessing outcome shows that the total sustainable agricultural developing capability of China is not high. Only about 1/3 in number or in area has reached the level of agricultural sustainable development. The relative net assets values exists a reducing trend from East China to West China. It needs a long period and great efforts to realize sustainable agricultural development over all China. Finally, there is a discussion to the study method.

AB Based on the field investigations, this paper analyzes systematically the achievements and problems of constructing the demonstrating areas of the ecological rebuilding and economic sustainable development in Hexi, Gansu Province, and then the thoughts on constructing the demonstrating areas are brought forward. It is considered that all kinds of ecological demonstrating areas should be merged in order to construct large-scale characterized demonstrating areas which go beyond the district. In other words, in Hexi Region, Zhangye District should be constructed as the largest ecoagriculture demonstrating area of high technology; Wuwei District should be constructed as the largest ecological demonstrating area of agricultural comprehensive exploitation; JiuJia District, which is the shortened form of Jiuquan and Jiayuguan, should be constructed as the largest ecotourism demonstrating area; and Jinchang City should be constructed as the largest ecoindustry demonstrating area. At the same time, the constructing pattern should be selected according to the actual circumstances; science and technology should be applied to construct the demonstrating areas and accelerate the industrialization in the big market. Additionally, it is important to smooth the constructing system and implement the flexible and efficacious running mechanism, and it is suggested that the committee should be organized to administer the ecological demonstrating areas in Hexi Region.

TI SUSTAINABLE USE OF LAND RESOURCE AND ITS EVALUATION IN COUNTY AREA -A

   county area; Guangxi
AB Sustainable use of natural resources is different from sustainable development. As the most important natural resource, sustainable use of land resource is the essential guarantee of sustainable development. The nature of sustainable use of land resource is to retain the quantity and productivity of land resource from generation to generation. The evaluation of sustainable use of land resource is an important method to ensure land-use to get onto the sustainable track. Furthermore, building index system is the key of the evaluation. In view of tendency of the evaluation indexes chosen so widely, the evaluation indexes should include only three kinds in the researches on the evaluation of sustainable use of land resource. The first is the stock and structure index of land resource, viz. Areas quantity structure of land resources. In China, it is especially paid attention to the per person index of land quantity and rate between cultivated land and farmland. The second is the productive index of land, which includes the productivity, potentiality, stability and renewal situation of land. The third is the sustained index of land environment. On the evaluation research of area level, we should lay particular emphasis on statistic indexes, With a case of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region in China, the evaluation index system of sustainable land-use in county area has been built in this thesis. Using the weighted average method to calculate the means of sustainable land-use in each county, according to the land-using situation, all counties in the autonomous region have been divided into three types. (1) Sustainable Pattern contains 18 counties, which have higher land resource productivity, stronger sustained abilities of land environment. The economic benefits of land-using in these counties are obviously higher. These counties have gotten highly intensive farming, and they are all in the good circumstance. (2) Basically Sustained Pattern contains 48 counties, which productivity of land resource is of middle level. In part of counties and cities, the stock of land resource inclines to lower level, but their land-using potentialities are still greater. Through changing land-using pattern, these counties can rapidly enter in a good circumstance. (3) Critically Sustained Pattern contains 14 counties, which are mostly in the karst mountain areas. They have less stock of land resource, lower productivity and more extensive cultivation. The productivity of land renewing has been hindered, so it urgently need to be renovated. At last, the writers have explored the basic ways of sustainable use of land resource in Guangxi, China - (1) Retain the stock of land resource and strictly manage farmland uses. (2) Strengthen the value accounting of land resource, and control the farmland occupation of non-agricultural construction. (3) Depend on technology advanced, optimize the land-using structure, and promote the productive level. (4) Carry out land management all-round, and improve the ecological environment of land resource. (5) Enhance evaluation researche and land monitoring, and promote the sustainable utilization level of land resource.

DE small towns; land system; innovation
AB The economic development in China and the rising of the living standard need to speed up the urbanisation. The development of small towns is an important way to Chinese urbanisation. Land use plays a very important role in the development of small towns. However there are many problems in the development of small towns, esp. in land use. The paper first discusses the land problems in the development of small towns. Such as much cultivated land lies idle, under-utilization and waste of land, increasing illegal use of land, unstable contractual relationship for land use. The relationship between the development of small towns and land use is also studied. Then the guidelines for the land system innovations of small towns are put forward. Namely the sustainability of social and economic development, the balance between land reservation and land utilization, the provision of service to village, agriculture and farmer, the management of land resource and land assets, the parsimonious and legal use of land. The basic framework of land system innovations of small towns is put forward finally. It include the land replacement policy for small towns and the permanent tenancy of farmland, the overall plan for land uses and other plans in harmony, the establishment of a flexible system of land supplies, using land with payments, the transfer of agricultural land and refining the land law related to the construction of small towns.

DT Article
AB Volunteering as the only orthopaedic surgeon in the small Asian country of Bhutan provided a fascinating introduction to international work. The orthopaedic work predominantly was trauma and osteomyelitis. Treatment of most problems was complicated by patient delays in obtaining medical care, usually related to transportation difficulties in a steep mountainous land with few roads. The complexities of enhancing orthopaedic care in developing countries include patient access to care, availability of adequate sterility for implantation of fixation devices, and determining in concert with the local government what is a sustainable level of care that can be taught to interested physicians in the country. Among the developing nations, Bhutan is one with a strong interest in the welfare of its people and has an economy that can afford to invest in healthcare. Despite these strengths, there remain interesting challenges for the orthopaedic volunteer. Exposure of the volunteer to the people and their culture enhanced the experience and provides a lure to continue volunteering.

AB Forest management planners must develop strategies to produce timber in ways that do not compromise ecological integrity or sustainability. These strategies often involve modifications to the spatial and temporal scheduling of harvest activities, and these strategies may interact in unexpected ways. We used a timber harvest simulator (HARVEST 6.0) to determine the sensitivity of landscape pattern to the interactions among three strategic parameters: adjacency constraints, spatial dispersion, and size of harvest units. Adjacency constraints reduced the ability of HARVEST to meet cutting targets by up to 70%, depending on other parameters used, while spatial dispersion had a minimal effect. Adjacency constraints had little effect on patch size except when harvests were clustered. Adjacency constraints increased variability in the amount of forest interior and edge, but had a marginal effect on the total amount. Mean patch size decreased even though the mean size of new patches was greater than the initial mean size, because many small remnant patches were created when harvests did not completely fill some existing stands. A clustered spatial dispersion increased the amount of forest interior habitat. Our description of the intuitive interface of HARVEST 6.0 also shows that HARVEST has advanced from being strictly a research tool to a strategic management planning tool.

AB China's economic growth over the past several decades has been among the highest in the world. It has been fueled by cheap fossil fuel energy so energy consumption has risen rapidly, but there are signs that negative feedbacks in the form of waste and inefficiency may affect future development. If energy throughput exceeds the capacity of the environment to process the inevitable waste from production then the development may not be sustainable. We calculate economic diversity using an energy flow network analysis method to explore the relationships of development policy, energy use, efficiency and sustainable development. China and its provinces are presented as a case study and the development status of each province in China is presented. China's development policy does not appear to be sustainable over the period 1985-1998 because of unsustainable energy consumption trends and declining economic diversity. An energy consumption tax is proposed for increasing diversity and dealing with increasing energy consumption in China. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Within Tongoy Bay (north-central Chile), four different habitats (seagrass, sand-gravel, sand and mud) were identified and subsequently considered as subsystems for the construction of trophic mass-balance models. By using the ECOSIM software package of Walters et al. (Ecosystems, 2 (1997) 539), different management scenarios were simulated for these subsystems and for an overall integrated system (combining all habitats) in order to explore strategies of sustainable resource use. System Recovery Time (SRT) as well as single species responses differed with the scenario simulated. The most important findings were: (1) an increase in the harvest of the scallop Argopecten purpuratus would not drastically affect the global properties of the systems; (2) a depletion of its principal predator, the sea star Meyenaster gelatinosus, greatly improved the availability of scallops in the subsystem seagrass, sand-gravel as well as in the integrated model; (3) a biomass reduction of the snail Xantochorus cassidiformis would produce only a small negative impact on the SRT, while a simulated harvest on the clam Mulinia sp. drastically changed the system properties. This clam may thus be considered as a keystone species; (4) predictions of the maximum sustainable yield (MSY) of the scallop were lower than those obtained by single species approaches. Our simulations allow us to conclude that: (1) a strong fishery of the scallop predator, the sea star M. gelatinosus, would greatly increase the yield of the scallop and the other populations or resources of the systems; (2) trophic mass balance models and their simulated scenarios offer great possibilities for the planning of interventions or manipulations of natural systems.

AB This study is a comparative analysis of the development of energy intensity and CO2 emission intensity in the ASEAN countries in the years 1971-97. The reasons and driving forces behind the changes are studied in the article using a complete decomposition methodology. The decomposition analysis explains energy use or CO2 emissions with three different factors: activity effect. structural effect and intensity effect. The authors provide an analysis of dynamic changes of energy consumption and CO2 emission flows. Intensity effects on energy use and CO2 emissions revealed large differences in the performance of ASEAN countries. An interesting finding of the study is that in the 1990s the intensity effects on CO2 emissions in ASEAN countries have started to increase indicating decreasing CO2 efficiencies of the economics. The general observation on the basis of decomposition analyses is that the phase of industrialization is increasing the energy intensity of the nations and. when the increased energy demand is fulfilled with fossil fuels. the CO2 emissions will inevitable grow. However. it has to be recognized that the CO2 emissions per capita in ASEAN countries are very low (except in Singapore) compared with many OECD countries. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB This paper analyzes the regulatory structure of the electricity sector in Israel, which is currently dominated by, the government-owned integrated utility, Israel Electric Corporation (IEC). The current structure of a price cap with a mandatory rate reduction of 2% per year and a target return on equity (ROE) of 6.5% is not sustainable because of IEC's deteriorating financial health, caused by the substantial investments it made to meet the 7,2% per year electricity demand growth in the past decade, which has led to an exceptionally low realized ROE of 3.4% for that period. The investment trend will continue, thanks to the 4-5% per year GDP growth projected for the next 10-20 years, Part of our proposed remedy is performance-based regulation (PBR). implemented via (a) a price cap formula that will restore IEC's financial health and offer IEC downward pricing flexibility, (b) changes in how IEC compensates its workers and (c) a sliding scale plan that provides incentives for IEC to become more efficient and to share risk with it, customers. We augment the PBR proposal by recommending changes in IEC's tariffs and resource procurement procedures that aim to promote the development of a competitive power industry in the next 10 15 years.

AB When people commute to work longer or farther than the actual spatial arrangement of homes and workplaces suggest they could be commuting, people are engaging in excess commuting. In the aggregate, excess commuting is the nonoptimal or surplus work travel occurring in cities because people do not minimize their journeys to work. In this paper an alternative view of excess commuting based on a theoretical maximum commute is presented. The calculation of a theoretical maximum commute allows for an analysis of the range between the theoretical minimum and maximum commutes, which marks an improvement over current approaches to the measure of excess commuting. Conceptually, this range is taken to be the commuting capacity of a city. To what extent commuting capacity is consumed in terms of current levels of commuting forms a primary question of the analysis. A model is formulated and applied to 1990 Census data for a sample of US cities. Numerical and visual results suggest variation in the amount of excess commuting and consumed commuting potential for the sample of cities. The results also suggest a relationship between the jobs-housing balance of a city (as captured by its theoretical minimum commute) and its observed commute. Additionally, the maximization calculation is shown to provide insight into the degree of decentralized urban form. A conclusion is provided which relates the findings of this research to larger issues of urban sustainability.

TI Quantitative assessment of solid waste treatment systems in the

ID ENERGY; SUSTAINABILITY; EFFICIENCY
AB Solid waste treatment options (recycling, incineration, and landfilling; the two latter processes both with co-generation of heat and electricity) have been studied for cardboard, newspaper, polyethylene, poly(ethylene terephthalate), polypropylene, polystyrene, and poly(vinyl chloride) waste. The conversion processes have been analyzed in terms of the second law of thermodynamics. The analysis allows calculating the exergy (useful energy) embodied in conversion products that can be obtained from the required inputs for the treatment processes. Taking into account the waste materials and the resources to convert them, it proved that recycling is the most efficient option for polyethylene with an efficiency of 62.5% versus 43.6% for incineration and 0.9% for landfilling. Next, waste treatment has been put into the broader perspective of industrial ecology. Exergetic efficiencies of industrial metabolic options have been calculated. Here resources for manufacturing and converting solid products have been considered. Furthermore, selection of one type of conversion excludes the generation of other potential conversion products. Therefore, it has to be taken into account that these latter products still have to be produced starting from virgin resources. Recycling proved to be the most efficient strategy: the ratio eta between exergy embodied in all delivered products on one hand, and all exergy withdrawn from the ecosphere or from waste materials on the other hand, is the highest. For polyethylene, eta proved to be 0.568, whereas eta is 0.503 and 0.329 for incineration and landfilling, respectively. On the other hand, if R the ratio between exergy of delivered products on one hand and exergy of virgin materials on the other hand is calculated, the differences between the industrial metabolic options are larger. Recycling polyethylene showed a ratio R of 0.936, whereas ratios of 0.772 and 0.531 were found for incineration and landfilling, respectively. It has been shown that the exergy concept allows a quantitative comparison of different industrial metabolic options, contributing to a better assessment of sustainability of technology with respect to resource management.

ID MANAGEMENT
AB The development of the green sea urchin (Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis) fishery in British Columbia, Canada, is presented as an example of how a precautionary approach was applied to avert collapse of a developing invertebrate fishery and to rebuild towards a sustainable fishery. We consider four components: (1) identification of the appropriate spatial scales; (2) development of scientifically-supported management strategies; (3) consideration of uncertainties; and (4) collaborations amongst scientists, fishery managers, and stakeholders. The green sea urchin fishery in British Columbia has experienced three periods: a "developing" period during which effort and landings increased, but catch per unit of effort (CPUE) declined; a "crisis" period during which effort and landings peaked and CPUE reached a minimum; and a "rebuilding to sustainable" period during which landings and effort stabilised and CPUE increased. Passive management actions (minimum size limit, seasonal closures) were introduced at the beginning of the fishery, but were unable to limit exploitation. Subsequent to the crisis period, active management measures (large area closures, quotas, and an individual quota system) were implemented based on scientific studies and appear to have stabilised the fishery. The availability of fishing logbook information from the inception of the fishery and the development of positive relationships amongst all participants in the fishery were central elements of this rebuilding process. The long time series of logbook information provided sufficient data contrasts to use two surplus production modelling techniques to develop biological reference points for management regulations. The green sea urchin fishery is now a small but important, and apparently stable, component of the dive fisheries in British Columbia. Crown Copyright (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Monte Carlo simulation is used to assess the benefits of different levels of survey intensity for a programme of fixed-station surveys using gill-nets, in terms of the ability to satisfy the management objectives for gummy shark, Mustelus antarcticus, in Bass Strait, Australia. The simulations consider the entire management process: data collection, data analysis, stock assessment, and setting of total allowable catches (TACs). The use in assessments of survey results rather than future commercial catch rates leads to a marked improvement in the ability to satisfy the legislative management objective for Australian fisheries of Ecological Sustainable Development, especially if future catch rates are not related linearly to abundance or if catchability is density-dependent. The benefits of more than six stations per survey site appear limited, however, because of the possible impact of variability in survey results due to factors unrelated to sampling.

ID PRIMARY PRODUCTIVITY; TROPICAL LAKES; PREDICTION; BIOMASS
AB Fishery yields in reservoirs of the Upper Parana River basin are small when compared to those in other parts of the world. Several hypotheses have been formulated to explain the small yields, but low primary production has not been seriously considered as a possibility. In a sample of seven reservoirs, yield was directly related to fishing effort and chlorophyll a concentration; thus, enhancement of these factors may boost yield. However, primary production is difficult to augment in large reservoirs, plus current levels of effort seem to be nearing maximum sustainable yields in some reservoirs, and therefore increased fishing effort is not likely to boost yields to levels recorded in other geographical regions. Low primary production in reservoirs of the Upper Parana River basin appears to be a result of interactions between physical characteristics of the reservoirs and climatic conditions of the region.

AB Forest companies in British Columbia and Alberta have requested increases in allowable cuts on their public land tenures. The present regulatory framework about allowable cut effects is briefly outlined for each province. Seven requirements are proposed for granting an ACE, including consistent and reliable performance, risk, assessments, stable operating and market conditions, robust age class distribution, government and public confidence, adequate benefits, and no unacceptable negative impacts on non-timber values. Some of the important "bad" and "good" news about allowable cuts is itemized, together with the drivers for change in sustainable forest management (SFM). It is concluded that professional and technical rigour is required in requests for an ACE. The cost of access to Crown timber has been increased by SFM and foresters and the industry are challenged to produce credible scenarios using new computer technologies, and then to carry them out.

TI Future shock in forestry - Where have we come from; where are we going;
   is there a "right way" to manage forests? Lessons from Thoreau, Leopold,
   Toffler, Botkin and Nature
SO FORESTRY CHRONICLE

ID PRODUCTIVITY; DISTURBANCE; ECOSYSTEMS
AB Future shock (Toffler 1970) occurs when the rate of chance in society exceeds the willingness or ability of individuals and institutions to adapt to the change. The rapid increase in human population and change in expectations of forestry over the past 40 Years has created future shock in our profession. A similar situation has developed in the social and biophysical sciences. Future shock is threatening to divert the evolution of forestry front its path towards site-specific, multi-value social forestry that respects both ecological and biological diversity. It is doing so by forcing change ahead of our knowledge and experience of the outcomes of the change. This is threatening to replace the site-specific, professional decision making that respects nature and social values and is needed to achieve a sustainable relationship between humans and forests, by rigid, administrative. regulation-based forestry. It may even encourage a return to what in reality can become exploitative forestry under the guise of aesthetics, beauty and care or the environment. Forestry has always been changing as society's expectations, needs and desires with respect to forests ha e changed. This is appropriate and should continue, but it should be the right change-change that respects the ecology and sociology of the desired new balance of values. This new balance includes. as it should, a variety of non-traditional values. but these should be additive to, rather than a replacement for. such important social values as employment, wood products and wealth creation. There is a variety of new paradigms and new institutional arrangements that could guide this change in forestry, but first there needs to be a clear statement of a desired forest future. Lacking the 100-year experience of the outcomes of these new paradigms. we need to develop and use credible, ecologically based, forest ecosystem management models based on both experience and knowledge to help guide the evolution of forestry towards the desired goal. Appropriately trained professional foresters should remain the foundation for the design and implementation of forestry that achieves the desired new balance of values. while a much wider representation of social interests will be involved in setting the new forestry goals. There is merit in listening to the words and philosophies of the great thinkers on forestry and conservation issues. Important lessons can be teamed. However, there has been a pervasive misinterpretation of many of the wise thoughts of writers like Thoreau and Leopold. When carefully revisited, their wisdom supports the balanced view of forestry and nature that appears to be the only way forward towards the future that we think our grandchildren and their grandchildren will want.

AB This paper examines attempts to integrate the objectives of biodiversity conservation and social and economic development through a variety of approaches associated with different forms of protected areas and generally labelled as 'integrated conservation and development'. It examines how the linkages between conservation and development are conceptualized, and the types of policy prescriptions and associated models and practice of integrating conservation and development. It identifies misconceptions about four key aspects that are common in conventional integrated conservation and development approaches. These difficulties involve the conceptualization of community, participation, empowerment and sustainability. Integrated conservation and development projects have often floundered as a result of over-simplification of these factors. It assesses attempts made to overcome these common misconceptions through examining the experiences of two innovative approaches to integrating conservation and development in the Caribbean and in Amazonia. It Concludes that fundamental changes are necessary to institutions and management and decision-making strategies to address these issues and to effectively meet conservation and development objectives.

AB The implications for UK upland sheep systems of reducing nitrogen fertilizer application to perennial ryegrass/white clover swards were studied over 3 years. Sward height (3.5-5.5 cm) was controlled for ewes with lambs until weaning using surplus pasture areas for silage; thereafter, ewes and weaned lambs were grazed on separate areas, and sward height was controlled by adjusting the size of the areas grazed and using surplus pasture areas for silage if necessary. Combinations from three stocking rates [10, 6 and 4 ewes ha(-1) on the total area (grazed and ensiled)] and four nitrogen fertilizer levels (150, 100, 50 and 0 kg ha(-1) ) provided six treatments that were replicated three times. Average white clover content was negatively correlated with level of nitrogen fertilizer. The proportion of white clover in the swards increased over the duration of the experiment. Control of sward height and the contribution from white clover resulted in similar levels of lamb liveweight gain on all treatments. All treatments provided adequate winter fodder as silage. It is concluded that the application of nitrogen fertilizer can be reduced or removed from upland sheep pastures without compromising individual animal performance provided that white clover content and sward height are maintained. Resting pastures from grazing by changing ensiled and grazed areas from year to year sustained white clover content over a 3-year period.

TI Cross-cultural competence for police work: Training strategies
SO GRUPPENDYNAMIK UND ORGANISATIONSBERATUNG
LA German
DT Article
ID RACE
AB Increasing tension and scandal-laden conflicts with members of ethnic minorities during the 1990s make it clear, that the German police force is still not satisfactorily prepared to deal with a multi-cultural society. An immediate reaction was the engagement of training programmes, giving higher-rank officials something to present as an approach to solving the problem. This can apparently be seen as cosmetic change without effect on the structure and culture of the organisation. This work attempts to map the potential for sustainable development of intercultural competence via training programmes, based on the results of international research on police work. Four classical models of intercultural training are described, and their suitability for further education within the police analysed. Starting from the difficulties of determining the actual competency requirements specific in the field, and the basic problems of mediating and acquiring inter-cultural skills, the article concludes with a discussion of sustainable education strategies, which extend to fundamental questions of organisational development.

   southwestern Saudi Arabia
SO HABITAT INTERNATIONAL
LA English

   methods; Saudi Arabia
ID MANAGEMENT; LAND
AB The paper assesses the planning efforts in southwest Saudi Arabia during three stages of development, traditional, transitional and contemporary. The modern planning models were introduced in this area over the last 30 years to deal with rapid economic and social development. The investigation views them as ineffective in preserving the indigenous pattern as well as controlling the urban blight and sprawl especially when comparing the outcome of traditional planning models. With modern models, the traditional village of southwest had a distinguished urban pattern, architectural style and vernacular landscape. The guidance for directing planning efforts should express and respect local economic, climatic, and cultural requirements in the form of policies and guidelines. The planning efforts should preserve physically social values and promote sustainable resources. The planning efforts enhance in a way or other the environmental quality of the built environment, landscape, and remedy the haphazard urban growth and blight, which took place during the transitional stage.
   The paper proposes a new relationship between a planning and social structure to overcome the unprecedented changes based on a re-evaluation of traditional practices. It argues that a new emphasis on local participation and control might help reverse the current pattern of legitimate planning efforts being subverted by entrenched local interests. It uses the traditional settlements as case examples of past practices and current conditions for directing future planning efforts. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

   in Accra, Ghana
SO HABITAT INTERNATIONAL
LA English

DE solid waste management; public-private partnerships; privatisation;
   Ghana
ID MANAGEMENT
AB In the course of 5 yr, the system of solid waste collection (SWC) in Accra has undergone a fundamental turn from public to private provision. The transition was motivated by the apparent inability of the city's Waste Management Department to deal with the mounting problems of waste collection and the prevailing belief that the market would help to overcome these. The indigenous private sector was called upon to improve service performance. Until mid-1999 public and private modes of SWC co-existed, enabling a systematic comparison between them using a 10-point assessment scheme. The analysis shows that privatisation has benefited consumers in terms of wider coverage, higher frequency, and more reliable services, but that there are also a number of drawbacks. notably worsened labour conditions and increased environmental dangers. The greatest flaw. however, is its lack of financial sustainability. This is related to the non-commercial nature of the service. particularly the social and political sensitivity of cost recovery in a poor country. The central government's 1999 decision to impose a private monopoly in SWC-in order to speed up the process and solve the waste collection problem in the metropolis once and for all-is criticised. This decision will compound financial problems, hamper the development of an indigenous business sector and fail to build on the potentials of a system that seemed very promising.

TI The hidden challenge of cross-border negotiations
SO HARVARD BUSINESS REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
AB Cultural differences can influence business negotiations in unexpected ways, as many a hapless deal maker has learned. But the differences extend well beyond surface behaviors, such as proper table manners and the exchange of business cards-and even beyond deeper cultural characteristics, such as attitudes about relationships and deadlines.
   Indeed, there's another, equally treacherous aspect to cross-border negotiation: the ways that people from different regions come to agreement, or the processes involved in negotiations. Decision-making and governance processes can vary widely from culture to culture, not only in terms of legal technicalities but also in terms of the behaviors and core beliefs that drive them. Numerous promising deals have failed because people ignored or underestimated the powerful differences in process across cultures.
   In this article, James Sebenius offers ways in which negotiators can prepare for such cultural differences. A useful approach, he says, is to map out the decision-making process-including who's involved, what formal and informal roles people play, and how a resolution is actually reached. With that knowledge, you can design a strategy that anticipates obstacles before they arise.
   Governance and decision-making processes can take devilishly unexpected forms as you cross borders. But by designing your strategy and tactics so that you're reaching all the right people, you increase your chances of striking a sustainable deal. Those negotiations that might otherwise have failed because people ignored or underestimated powerful disparities in process will, in the end, yield a meaningful yes.

DT Article
DE hepatitis B; universal immunization; sustainability; epidemiology;
   policy; India
AB Based on the recommendations of the World Health Organization, India as a member-state is likely to implement universal immunization against hepatitis B through the existing Universal Immunization Programme (UIP). A pilot project is already under progress in two municipal zones of Delhi. This paper begins by reviewing epidemiological features of hepatitis B in India, some established aspects and other emerging trends. The gaps in the existing knowledge base are also given due consideration. The current recommendation is to deliver the vaccine at zero-day for infants in the absence of facilities for antenatal screening and immunoglobulin administration. The paper explores the potential pitfalls for integrating the proposed hepatitis B vaccination with the DPT (diphtheria/pertussis/tetanus) schedule. Based on the findings of the National Family Health Survey, the likely coverage for the states is estimated for both the schedules - zero-day and with DPT. The performance of the pilot phase is reviewed through the results of a coverage survey. The paper also estimates the resources that should be committed to launch the universal immunization of hepatitis B vaccination and the sustainability issues thereof. The paper finally concludes with the position that hepatitis B immunization will 'sink or sail' with the UIP Further, this should act as an engine for recharging the infrastructure and functioning of the public health system and promote general preventive practices like universal precautions.

AB Sustainable fisheries require (1) viable stock populations with appropriate harvest limits and (2) appropriate habitat for fish to survive, forage, seek refuge, grow and reproduce. Some deep-water habitats, such as those formed by deep-water stands of coral, may be vulnerable to fishing disturbance. The rate at which habitat can be restored is a critical aspect of fishery management. The purpose of this study was to characterize growth rates for a habitat-forming deep-sea coral. Two nearly complete colonies of red tree coral (Primnoa resedaeformis) collected from waters off southeast Alaska were used for an analysis of age and growth characteristics. CAT scans revealed that colonies consisted of multiple settlement events, where older basal structures provided for settlement of new colonies. The decay of Pb-210 over the length of the colony was used to validate age estimates from growth ring counts. Age estimates were over 100 yr for sections near the heavily calcified base. Based on validated growth ring counts, growth of red tree coral ranged from 1.60 to 2.32 cm per year in height and was approximately 0.36 mm per year in diameter. These growth rates suggest that the fishery habitat created by red tree coral is extremely vulnerable to bottom fishing activities and may take over 100 years to recover.

AB Recombinant DNA technology has great potential to enhance and extend the advantages of conventional plant breeding, and increase the production and productivity of crops to meet the increasing demand for food and food products in the future. Judicious application of this technology provides opportunities for alleviating some of the major constraints to crop productivity under subsistence fanning conditions in the developing countries. Considerable progress has been made in developing strategies for the production and deployment of transgenic crops. However, biosafety concerns have been raised regarding the deployment and release of genetically engineered plants. This debate has divided the fanning and consumer communities over acceptability of genetically modified foods. There is a need for a thorough investigation regarding the fate of transgenic plants in the environment, and their interaction with wild relatives and non-target organisms. The production and release of transgenic plants should be based on experience and sound scientific reasoning. The regulatory requirements for deployment of transgenic crops should be streamlined and harmonized, in order to achieve sustainable food production, poverty reduction, and environmental protection in resource-poor countries in the semi-arid tropics.

   rice-equivalent yield; energy production efficiency
AB A field experiment was conducted at Crop Research Centre of Govind Ballabh Pant University of Agriculture and Technology, Pantnagar, during 1996-97 and 1997-98, to identify the appropriate rice (Oryza sativa L.)-based cropping sequences for sustainable productivity and profitability under foothills of Himalayas. Rice as base crop was sequenced in 10 feasible crop sequences, viz. wheat (Triticum aestivum L. emend. Fiori & Paol.)-rice, chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.)-rice, lentil (Lens culinaris Medikus)-rice, field pea (Pisum sativum L.)-rice, wheat-mungbean (Phaseolus radiatus L.) green-manure-rice, wheat-sesbania (Sesbania aculeata Pers.) green-manure-rice, wheat-maize (Zea mays L.) + cowpea [Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp] fodder-rice (Oryza sativa L.), chickpea-maize + cowpea fodder-rice, lentil-maize + cowpea fodder-rice and field pea-maize + cowpea fodder-rice sequence. The green-manuring of sesbania and mungbean in rice-wheat system gave an additional rice-equivalent yield 1.11 and 0.9 tonnes/ha over wheat-rice, respectively, and showed maximum land-use efficiency (90.95%). Further chickpea-rice sequence (10.88 tonnes/ha) showed its superiority to all other sequences having 2 crops. Among 300% cropping intensity, sequence chickpea-maize + cowpea fodder-ride (13.90 tonnes/ha) proved most efficient in term of rice-equivalent yield, production efficiency (38.09 kg/ha) and mean economic returns (Rs 43,992/ha), while sequence wheat-maize + cowpea fodder-rice was highest carbohydrate (9.68 tonnes/ha) and chemical energy (50.51 K cal x 10(-6)/ha) producer among all sequences.

AB The semiconductor industry has undergone a significant change in its structure throughout the last decade. Considering the advent of large foundaries the future chances of small and medium sized foundaries specialised in the production of wafers for mixed signal circuits and associated services are discussed. If the mixed signal business model is developed in a proper way, e.g. not competing in the mainly digital core competence markets of the big foundaries but concentrating on specialised niches, such a model will work. For a sustainable growth scenario it is necessary to establish and maintain sufficient differentitation elements, a competitive cost structure and a credible view into a continuous development along the industry roadmap. State of the art manufacturing execution and control system are a must for foundries of any size and scope.

AB This paper offers reflections on information systems design based in everyday practices. Drawing on experience in what I name the hyperdeveloped world of industrial research and development in the United States, I outline a series of concerns, organized under the themes of information flows, local improvisations and work practices. I then offer a set of alternative understandings of change and innovation that underwrite a practice-based design approach. These include a view of innovation as indigenous to technologies-in-use, an emphasis on the investments needed to create sustainable change, and an orientation to artful integration as an objective or information systems design.

AB How do we define civilisation? Who created the conditions for the quality of life we now enjoy? Who haw been the greatest civilisers? What are our key life support systems and who provides the skills which create them? What do we want from our urban environment and who can give it to us? Are our cities in the prime of life, or are they geriatric? Are they sustainable? These and other challenges are considered and addressed in this review of the infrastructure of modern society and of the choices we face as we embrace the twenty-first century, with the emphasis on the urban environment.

AB We define strategic OR/MS as "OR/MS work that leads to a sustainable competitive advantage." We found evidence of strategic OR/MS in the literature of strategic information systems (SIS) and OR/MS. We examined 30 early examples of SIS, many of which contained OR/MS work. Many of the most successful had high OR/MS content, while the least successful contained none. The inclusion of OR/MS work may be a key to sustaining an advantage from information technology. We also examined the Edelman Prize finalist articles published between 1990 and 1999. We found that 13 of the 42 private sector applications meet our definition of strategic OR/MS.

ID FUEL; INFRASTRUCTURE; VEHICLE
AB Fueled by concerns about urban air pollution, energy security, and climate change, the notion of a "hydrogen economy" is moving beyond the realm of scientists and engineers and into the lexicon of political and business leaders. Interest in hydrogen, the simplest and most abundant element in the universe, is also rising due to technical advances in fuel cells - the potential successors to batteries in portable electronics, power plants, and the internal combustion engine. But where will the hydrogen come from? Government and industry, keeping one foot in the hydrocarbon economy, are pursuing an incremental route, using gasoline or methanol as the source of the hydrogen, with the fuel reformed on board vehicles. A cleaner path, deriving hydrogen from natural gas and renewable energy and using the fuel directly on board vehicles, has received significantly less support, in part because the cost of building a hydrogen infrastructure is widely viewed as prohibitively high. Yet a number of recent studies suggest that moving to the direct use of hydrogen may be much cleaner and far less expensive. Just as government played a catalytic role in the creation of the Internet, government will have an essential part in building a hydrogen economy. Research and development, incentives and regulations, and partnerships with industry have sparked isolated initiatives. But stronger public policies and educational efforts are needed to accelerate the process. Choices made today will likely determine which countries and companies seize the enormous political power and economic prizes associated with the hydrogen age now dawning.

ID PRODUCT DIFFERENTIATION
AB I examine the implications of the presence of multiproduct firms for cartel stability in a horizontally differentiated market. Under quantity competition, an increase in the number of varieties produced by each firm, for any given number of firms, increases the critical discount factor above which collusion is sustainable by trigger strategies, and thus makes collusion less likely. This is also the case under price competition, except for a special case where the number of firms is small and the products are close substitutes. These results may help explain apparent inconsistencies between theoretical predictions and empirical evidence on the effect of market structure and product differentiation on the likelihood of collusion.

AB To evaluate environmental sustainability of complex systems, such as agricultural cultivation, it is necessary to adopt a systemic approach that considers all mass and energy flows that drive processes and that interlace, amplify, and influence each other. Emergy analysis, a thermodynamic-ecological methodology developed by Odum (1988), produces powerful indicators to evaluate process efficiency and to assess long-term sustainability. We performed a comparison among three cherry crops with different cultivation methods (traditional, biological and integrated) employing different inputs (natural and non-natural), in order to understand how agricultural systems should be developed in order to be economically successful with respect to the environment. Traditional methods using high quantities of non-natural inputs demonstrated unsustainability, while the integrated method of natural and purchased inputs turned out to be the best. The emergy approach demonstrated a powerful methodology to assess sustainability, and the indications obtained for cherry crops could be extrapolated to other types of cultivation.

DE industrial ecology; regional industrial ecosystem; North Karelia energy
   system; scenario approach; waste fuels; co-production of heat and power;
   greenhouse gases; regional industrial ecosystem management system
AB The emerging concept of industrial ecology (IE) has been applied in practice in few case studies on local/regional industrial recycling networks. Analogously to a natural ecosystem, the aim is to develop material cycles and energy cascades between local cooperative actors. An optimal resource basis of an industrial ecosystem is the Sustainable use of local renewable natural resources. In this paper, we consider the region of North Karelia in Finland, with 19 municipalities, and hence somewhat expand the system boundaries of an industrial ecosystem case study. The current situation and two scenarios of municipal heating energy production are presented. The heating system consists of individual, district and electric heating. The heat production and related greenhouse gas emissions are considered. The current fuel use is based on imported oil and regional fuels (peat, wood wastes). Also, shares for co-production of heat and electricity (CHP) are shown. In scenario one, we assume the majority of the fuel basis in oil and absence of CHP. Scenario two illustrates nearly complete dependence on regional wood wastes and firewood with the current share of CHP. The North Karelia region provides the IE theory with a fruitful case study because the supply of waste fuels and local renewables is vast and waste utilisation technologies (CHP, fluidized bed burning) constitute a significant part of energy production. Implications of the applied scenario approach are discussed in the context of regional decision making and, in particular, for its implementation with the concepts of a regional environmental management system (REMS) and a regional industrial ecosystem management system (RIEMS).

AB This paper describes the evolution of an evaluation method developed initially to assess progress towards sustainable development for various land use activities in Costa Rica. Since that time, the method has been expanded to apply to all types of business activities in any location, and refined so that a numerical score can be provided for each attribute. These scores can then be presented graphically in four categories. The method has since been tested on a variety of businesses and is being refined for electronic submission and display of the results. The benefits of this approach, as well as its shortcomings and some of the problems resolved, are presented.

AB Conservation projects have been initiated at a greater rate around the world as nations discover the increasing amount of land degraded and rate of species extinction in their regions. In this paper, we define the theoretical framework being used in a Community-Based Conservation Management project in China and Vietnam. While the cultures and political structures of the participating countries and institutions maybe limiting factors to the implementation of community-based activities, we believe that definition and perception of terminology used in community-based conservation projects is important to an international development programme involving seven universities located in three countries. Expectations might not be the same as in developed and/or democratic countries. The main goal still remains, to integrate public education and involvement into conservation activities in order to better protect the environment. Our perception is not to change the political foundation of other countries but to give them tools for sustainable resource use.

AB The paper examines the nature of water-energy interactions at the level of end users in an economy where the demand for both water and energy exceeds the available supplies of these resources. The paper attempts an assessment of the nature of coping strategies adopted by individuals to deal with shortages/uncertainties/unreliability in the availability of water and energy per se and in inter-linked activities, and to provide indicative estimates of the cost of the prevailing supply scenario. The paper also examines the nature of policy interventions that could help in moving towards bridging the gap between the demand and supply of water and energy, especially in inter-linked activities. The scope of the paper is confined to the agricultural/irrigation and urban water supply sectors. Attempts at bridging the gap between demand and supply of both the resources call for both short-run and long-run solutions. A favourable policy environment, improved management of utilities, better organization and methods of existing infrastructure, metering of consumption, charging of rational tariffs for these services, larger investments in the creation of new capacities and a more active role of the private sector could to a large extent help in narrowing the gap and making the water and energy sectors more sustainable in the long run.

AB The International Commission on Irrigation and Drainage (ICID) is a scientific and technical, non-governmental international organization. The objectives of ICID are to stimulate and promote the development and application of irrigation, drainage, flood control, river training and environmental management in all their technical, economic, social and environmental aspects, as well as the needed research leading to the use of modern techniques. During the past years intensive discussions have been going on at a global scale regarding the future of dams. These discussions have mainly been initiated due to environmental concerns and resettlement problems related to the development of new reservoirs. In the light of these discussions ICID was asked to clarify its position. Since then a position paper oil the 'Role of dams for irrigation, drainage and flood control' has been prepared which was almost unanimously approved by ICID's national committees. In this paper the main issues and findings as described in the position paper are presented. The future steps ICID is planning to take in order to contribute to the finding of sustainable solutions and improvements in decision-making processes on dams are also illustrated.

ID ORGANIZATION; FIRMS
AB This article seeks to explain how knowledge, organisational forms, and societal institutions interact to shape the learning and innovative capabilities of firms. It focuses on education and training systems, and types of labour markets as key societal institutions shaping work organisation and the knowledge base of the firm. The paper argues that tacit knowledge, which is difficult to create and transfer in the absence of social interaction and labour mobility, constitutes a most important source of learning and sustainable competitive advantage in the knowledge economy. Institutions that are able to harness tacit knowledge as a source of learning are more likely to produce strong innovative capabilities. The analysis suggests that there are two alternative models of competence building that are favourable to learning and innovation, namely, the 'organisational community' and 'occupational community' model. The paper looks at the cases of Japan, the high-technology clusters in the USA and UK, and Denmark as illustrative examples, It argues that societies with different institutional arrangements will continue to develop a variety of organisational forms and learning strategies that privilege some sectors and discourage others. Institutionalised variation in patterns of learning and innovation therefore reproduce distinctive regional or national patterns of technological specialisation.

AB The world's fresh water resources are unequally distributed both in time and in space. Until recently water resource management focused on reallocating water to when and where it was required, a supply-side or fragmented approach. Nowadays there are signs that water resource availability is dwindling-due to both population growth and increased per capita water use-and ecosystems are being damaged. To face this challenge a new holistic approach is needed. This approach includes the integrated or conjunctive use of surface and groundwater resources and takes account of social, economic and environmental factors. Moreover, it recognizes the importance of water quality issues.
   In this context, the paper examines the main aspects and problems concerned with the planning, design, construction and management of conjunctive use of surface and subsurface water resources, along with its environmental impacts and constraints to sustainable development. The importance and role of research thrust, technology transfer, institutional strengthening, effective partnerships between governments and stakeholders, and sound financial frameworks are also examined. Finally, the challenges and benchmarks for future actions that the scientific community and planners have to face and deal with, are briefly outlined. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

AB Water shortage shifts attention from the traditional concept of crop yield-production per unit of land-to the productivity of water-production per unit of water. Whether this parameter is best increased through responsive, sophisticated irrigation scheduling or through predetermined schedules, providing limited water, has been a contentious issue for some years. This paper brings together modelling studies from Pakistan that address this issue, as well as raising the question of whether deficit irrigation threatens sustainability through the build-up of salts in the soil profile.
   It is shown that under conditions of plentiful water, highest productivity is achieved when irrigation is precisely scheduled to meet crop needs. However, when water is short its productivity is substantially increased (by almost 50%) by deficit irrigation. No salt problem occurs as long as amount of water applied through irrigation is sufficient to meet 80% of the total crop evapotranspiration. Under limited water conditions, the productivity achieved is little affected by setting predetermined irrigation schedules, allowing the operating agency to concentrate on reliability of service. Finally, it is also shown that the salt build-up is independent of irrigation scheduling. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

ID TAXATION
AB A dynamic model for a single-species fishery, which depends partially on a logistically growing resource with functional response, is proposed using taxation as control instrument to protect fish population from overexploitation. The analysis of the model shows that both the equilibrium density of fish population as well as the maximum sustainable yield increase as resource biomass density increases. The optimal harvesting policy is also discussed with the help of Pontryagin's Maximum Principle. It is found that for the optimum equilibrium value of resource biomass density, the total user's cost of harvest per unit effort must be equal to the discounted value of future price at the steady state.

AB This paper reports the results of a series of factory trials which has been recently completed involving Staffordshire University, a major United Kingdom water company and a commercial brick manufacturer, which demonstrate the practical possibilities of incorporating three by-product wastes, waterworks sludge, incinerated sewage sludge ash and carpet yarn, into the commercial brick-manufacturing process as a sustainable alternative to their current disposal route of landfill. An initial laboratory development programme primarily involving waterworks sludge or water treatment residue (WTR) confirmed the technical feasibility of its use in brick-making as an alternative disposal route. However, owing to the very high water content of this waste when freshly produced, ranging between 85 and 70% depending on individual sources, its introduction into the commercial brick-making processes was identified as likely to present practical difficulties. Consequently, to overcome this problem the reported work describes a successful way in which the handling of WTR was improved by pre-mixing it with the two other by-products that jointly possess water-absorbing properties and the ability of improving the unfired strength of the experimental products. This investigation then progressed from the laboratory to full-scale brickworks trials encompassing the manufacture of >300000 experimental bricks. This work programme also included emission monitoring during the firing process, together with full physical testing of the experimental products for direct comparison with the standard commercial products manufactured at the collaborating brick factory.

AB Regional agricultural projects based on water resource development have many potential impacts on social and natural environments. In this research, potential long-term environmental problems of the Southeastern Anatolian Project (GAP) related to water resources, land use, land degradation, agricultural pollution and demography are analysed from a systems perspective. The analysis focuses on the totality of environmental, social and economic issues. For this purpose, a system dynamics simulation model (GAPSIM) has been developed as an experimental platform for policy analysis. GAPSIM was validated, first 'structurally', using the tests suggested by the literature and then the model 'behaviour' was tested and calibrated with respect to available data. The reference behaviour of GAPSIM reveals that, as the irrigated lands are developed, GAP faces significant water scarcity because of the increased intensity of cotton, the crop with the highest demands for water. Simulation results also indicate that two key environmental factors, pesticide and fertilizer consumption may reach undesirable levels. Alternative irrigation water release strategies, development rates of irrigated fields and farm rotation practices appear as important policy tools in achieving long-term environmental sustainability. GAPSIM promises to be not only a useful laboratory for policy makers of GAP, but also a useful generic structure applicable to other similar regional development projects.

DE sustainable city region; indicators; sustainable development; Shanghai
AB Building on a description of the present situation in Shanghai, a series of ten regionally relevant indicators are identified and described. Using data from 1978-1998, relationships between these economic, social and environmental indicators are explored using correlation and regression analysis. The analysis indicated that, in Shanghai, conflict between economy and environment existed throughout the research period and the evolution of the city region system seems to lack regularity. The key elements affecting trends in the development of the Shanghai city region are Gross Domestic Product, Total Investment and Urban Living Area per Head. The city region system seemed more sustainable, indicated by an improvement in environmental quality and relative lower investment growth rate, when the annual change rate of Gross Domestic Product was less than 7-8%.

AB Different species of animals require different cardiac performance and, in turn, their cardiac muscle exhibits different properties. A comparative approach can reveal a great deal about the mechanisms underlying myocardial contraction. Differences in myocardial Ca2+ handling between fish and mammals suggest a greater energy cost of activation in fish. Further, while there is considerable evidence that heart rate (or cycle frequency) should have a profound effect on the efficiency of teleost cardiac muscle, this effect has been largely overlooked. We set out to determine how cycle frequency affects the power output and efficiency of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) ventricular muscle and to relate this to the heart's function in life. We measured power output and the rate of oxygen consumption (V over dot (O2)) and then calculated efficiency over a physiologically realistic range of cycle frequencies. In contrast to mammalian cardiac muscle, in which V over dot (O2) increases with increasing heart rate, we found no significant change in V over dot (O2) in the teleost. However, power output increased by 25 % as cycle frequency was increased from 0.6 to 1.0 Hz, so net and total efficiency increased. A maximum total efficiency of 20 % was achieved at 0.8 Hz, whereas maximum power output occurred at 1.0 Hz. We propose that, since the heart operates continuously, high mechanical efficiency is a major adaptive advantage, particularly at lower heart rates corresponding to the more commonly used slower, sustainable swimming speeds. Efficiency was lower at the higher heart rates required during very fast swimming, which are used during escape or prey capture. If a fixed amount of Ca2+ is released and then resequestered each time the muscle is activated, the activation cost should increase with frequency. We had anticipated that this would have a large effect on the total energy cost of contraction. However, since V over dot (O2), remains constant, less oxygen is consumed per cycle at high frequencies. We suggest that a constant V over dot (O2), would be observed if the amount of activator Ca2+ were to decrease with frequency. This decrease in activation energy is consistent with the decrease in the systolic intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+](i)) transient with increasing stimulation frequency seen in earlier studies.

AB For the past century, national assessments of supply-and-demand trends for timber have helped shape perceptions of future commodity consumption and have guided forest policy. Trends and projections since 1952 consistently have shown rising forest products consumption and changing sources of timber supplies. The current assessment envisions forest products consumption rising 42 percent by 2050 and marked shifts in the extent and location of domestic and imported supplies. Prospective shifts include a temporary near-term decline in US roundwood harvest and an increase in share of consumption from imports.

AB Results from the fifth Resources Planning Act (RPA) Timber Assessment suggest that we face a future nearly the reverse of that anticipated in the Forest Service's first post-World War II assessment completed five decades ago, with a growing abundance of softwoods but a regionally restricted supply of hardwoods. Both the bulk of the softwood harvest expansion and the set of limitations in hardwood supply are in the US South. Assessment results also provide insights on trends in some measures of sustainable forest management, timber supply complexities in western forest health issues on public lands, the impacts of forest fragmentation, and the preeminence of private lands in national timber supply.

AB The final permanent solution to micronutrient malnutrition in developing countries is a substantial improvement in dietary quality-higher consumption of pulses, fruits, vegetables, fish and animal products that the poor already desire but cannot presently afford. Meanwhile breeding staple foods that are dense in minerals and vitamins provides a low-cost, sustainable strategy for reducing levels of micronutrient malnutrition. Getting plants to do the work of fortification, referred to as "biofortification," can reach relatively remote rural populations that conventional interventions are not now reaching and can even have benefits for increased agricultural productivity. Biofortification, thus, complements conventional interventions. The symposium articles discuss several examples of ongoing research projects to develop and disseminate nutrient-dense staple food crops and issues that remain to be resolved before successful implementation can be attained.

AB One sustainable agricultural approach to reducing micronutrient malnutrition among people at highest risk (i.e., resource-poor women, infants and children) globally is to enrich major staple food crops (e.g., rice, wheat, maize, beans and cassava) with micronutrients through plant-breeding strategies. These target groups are dependent on these staples for their sustenance. Available research has demonstrated that micronutrient-enrichment traits are available within the genomes of these major staple food crops that could allow for substantial increases in the levels of Fe, Zn and provitamin A carotenoids (as well as other nutrients and health-promoting factors) without negatively impacting crop yield. Furthermore, Fe- and Zn-dense seeds can increase crop yields when sowed to soils deficient in these nutrients ensuring their adoption by farmers in these regions once they are developed. Importantly, micronutrient bioavailability issues must be addressed when using a plant-breeding approach to eliminating micronutrient malnutrition. The reduction of antinutrient substances that inhibit micronutrient bioavailability or the increase in substances that promote micronutrient bioavailability from staple plant foods are both options that could be pursued in breeding programs, although care needs to be taken not to compromise agronomic performance and sufficient attention paid to possible beneficial roles of compounds which reduce the bioavailability of trace minerals. The time has come to invest in agricultural technologies to find sustainable solutions to micronutrient malnutrition. Plant breeding is one such technology that should be adopted by the world's agricultural community and that should be supported by the world's nutrition and health communities.

TI Do democracies exhibit stronger international environmental commitment?
   A cross-country analysis
SO JOURNAL OF PEACE RESEARCH

DT Article
ID ECONOMIC-GROWTH; INEQUALITY; POLLUTION
AB This article tests the hypothesis that democracies exhibit stronger international environmental commitment than non-democracies, using multivariate econometric techniques. A number of proxy variables are used in lieu of environmental commitment, a non-observable variable. Strong evidence is found that democracies sign and ratify more multilateral environmental agreements, participate in more environmental intergovernmental organizations, comply better with reporting requirements under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Fauna and Flora, put a greater percentage of their land area under protections status, are more likely to have a National Council on Sustainable Development in their country and have more environmentally relevant information available than non-democracies. The findings suggest that a spread of democracy around the world will lead to enhanced environmental commitment worldwide. Results are robust with respect to inclusion or exclusion of developed countries in the sample. The use of four different variables for democracy also ensures robustness with respect to the measure of democracy. The strong evidence in favour of a positive link between democracy and environmental commitment stands in contrast to the somewhat weak evidence on such a link between democracy and environmental outcomes. The explanation presumably is that theory predicts a stronger positive link of democracy with environmental commitment than with environmental outcomes.

TI Making power-sharing work: Lessons from successes and failures in ethnic
   conflict regulation
SO JOURNAL OF PEACE RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
AB For managing and settling ethnic conflicts, power-sharing arrangements often seem an appropriate solution. The former antagonists are forced to work together and make decisions by consensus; the ultimate goal is to turn opponents into partners. Obviously, this concept can only be successful under specific conditions and by specific arrangements. Based on a comparative analysis of six cases of power-sharing, the article aims (1) to identify favourable conditions as well as (2) to evaluate the quality of regulations. For successful conflict regulation, both aspects have to be taken into account: if the most favourable conditions are missing or will not be attained over time, then the 'best' power-sharing constitution will fail. If, in turn, 'bad' or insufficient rules and procedures prevail, then even the presence of comparatively beneficial factors will probably not avoid failure. Success will be understood as achievement and sustainability of a particular solution. The article is subdivided into four sections. First, the concept of power-sharing (or consociationalism) will be mapped out. Second, successful and failed European cases of power-sharing will be briefly presented. Third, by comparing these cases, the relevance of a set of conditions - usually assumed to be favourable for success - will be examined. Fourth, the quality of the institutional design of power-sharing regimes will be evaluated in order to distinguish 'better' regulations from more problematic or even counterproductive ones. In concluding, the author points to the crucial role of political elites in sustaining shared rule, but stresses at the same time that in most cases their behaviour is shaped by the institutional arrangements themselves. These have to be designed in a way that supports and fosters learning processes among decisionmakers.

SO JOURNAL OF POLICY MODELING
LA English
DT Article
AB Economists are trained to identify the trade-offs in objectives implicit in virtually every type of policy proposal. The purpose of this paper is to show that, in a poor developing country like India, existing policies conspire to damage the environment, reduce the level of income and the rate of growth, and increase income inequality. It uses an environmentally extended computable general equilibrium model (EECGE) for India to demonstrate that simple policy changes can be made which would raise distributional equity, environmental sustainability, and growth-increasing efficiency all at the same time. The results support the hypothesis that sustainable development is generally possible only when there is a thorough integration of economic, distributional, and environmental policies that can collectively "win" in achieving economic growth, equity, and environmental objectives at the same time.

AB Perennial pepperweed (Lepidium latifolium L.) is a creeping rooted exotic weed that has infested native hay meadows, riparian areas and agronomic fields throughout the western United States. This highly invasive species causes major losses in forage quality and creates numerous management problems. On many sites infested with perennial pepperweed, a near mono-culture exist. Sustainable suppression programs require the establishment of a competitive perennial species. You can not establish seedlings of a perennial competitive species without some initial substantial reduction in perennial pepperweed stands through weed control. Because tillage is not feasible with this creeping rooted species, herbicidal weed control is the primary option. Experience has shown, that the massive and extensive root system of perennial pepperweed can not be completely eliminated with one application of a herbicide. This means that repeated applications of a selective herbicide are required after the perennial seedlings of a competitive species are established. Perennial pepperweed is a broadleaf species that is some what susceptible to applications of 2,4-D. Therefore, the choice revegetation species is limited to a perennial grass that is resistant to 2,4-D applications at low rates as a seedlings and moderate rates once established. The saline/alkaline nature of the soils where perennial pepperweed is often found limit the adapted perennial grasses to tall wheatgrass (Elytriga elongata [Host] Nevski). The herbicide chlorsulfuron has been shown to be more effective in initially controlling perennial pepperweed than 2,4-D. We determined that applications of chlorsulfuron at rates sufficient to control perennial pepperweed resulted in herbicidal residues that severely reduced or eliminated the establishment of tall wheatgrass seedlings. Application of 2,4-D at flower budding for perennial pepperweed (June), followed by seeding tall wheatgrass in the fall (October), and application of low rates of 2,4-D over the wheatgrass seedlings the next spring (May), gave the best grass seedling establishment and suppression of the perennial weed.

AB An understanding of the impacts of grazing during and following drought on rangeland ecosystems is critical for developing effective drought management strategies. This study was designed to examine the effects of drought and grazing on blue grama [Bouteloua gracilis (H.B.K) Lag. ex Griffiths] and western wheatgrass [Pascopyrum smithii Rydb. (Love)] tiller growth dynamics. Research was conducted from 1993 to 1996 at the Fort Keogh Livestock and Range Research Laboratory located near Miles City, Mont. An automated rainout shelter was used during 1994 to impose a severe late spring to early fall (May to October) drought on 6 of twelve, 5- x 10-m non-weighing lysimeters. Twice replicated grazing treatments were: 1) grazed both the year of (1994) and the year after (1995) drought; 2) grazed the year of and rested the year after drought; and 3) no grazing either year. Drought had minimal impact on tiller relative growth rates of plants grazed twice, although it reduced (P less than or equal to 0.01) rates of axillary tiller emergence for blue grama (79%) and western wheatgrass (91%). Defoliation periodically increased relative growth rates (P less than or equal to 0.05) and tiller emergence (P less than or equal to 0.01) of both species. Neither drought nor grazing affected tiller densities or tiller replacement rates of either species nor did they affect productivity of blue grama. Drought, however, reduced (P less than or equal to 0.01) productivity of western wheatgrass 50% in 1994 whereas grazing reduced productivity (P less than or equal to 0.01) by 46% in 1994 and 69% in 1995. Moderate stocking levels (40-50% utilization) during and after drought did not adversely affect the sustainability of these dominant native grasses.

AB This article ventures a framework for assessing the contributions capitalism might make to the common good. Capitalism has manifest strengths - efficiency, growth, support for human freedoms, encouragement for collaboration among nations that are not natural allies. Processes that generate these goods have negative consequences as well - the exploitation of labor, environmental harm, the marginalization of the "least advantaged", the reduction of politics to strategies for advancing special interests. To constrain the negative consequences, public oversight is necessary. The challenge is to devise policies that will limit the harms while protecting conditions that enable free markets to flourish. The paper concludes with an illustrative sketch of policy proposals that exemplify this goal.

ID HEALTH-CARE; TELEMEDICINE; SATISFACTION
AB Telemedicine uses telecommunications technologies to deliver health care to populations located at some distance from health care providers. Telehealth is a somewhat broader term that includes non-clinical applications (such as education). This article draws on data from a nationwide survey of telehealth networks that assesses the extent and character of telemedicine activity. Although statistics point to increased utilization, the distribution of growth has been skewed toward a few applications and it is not clear that rural areas would derive substantial benefit in the absence of federal subsidy. Reported barriers to building sustainable programs often seem to reflect concerns of large hospitals and health care systems rather than constraints faced by rural organizational and individual network members. The potential role of government in addressing barriers is discussed.

AB Sustainable resource management is one of the most complex concerns today. Society has spent billions of dollars conserving soils in production, yet it is unclear whether these efforts buy sustainability, or even what sustainability is. Further study about which soils need conservation merits consideration. We use a simulation model, regression, and optimization analysis to examine the sustainability of resource management in objective, measurable ways. Soil quality, represented by a new index, and other nonirrigated corn production data are placed into a dynamic model to identify: 1) the conditions where soil conservation is efficient, and 2) under what definitions conservation is sustainable. Results show that decisions to use or conserve soil and the impacts of these decisions are highly dependent upon soil type and how sustainability is defined. In general, while soil conservation slowed degradation on erodible soils, it seemed to be more effective and economically efficient the better the initial quality of the soil. This calls into question whether U.S. conservation policy that focuses on marginal soils supports sustainability. Economic research was undertaken to study which soils might best be targeted for conservation, using economic and sustainability criteria. An economic model of nonirrigated corn production was created to determine-under requirements of maintaining a certain level of production or maintaining soil quality-if, when, and where it was best to apply conservation practices. Results show that decisions to use or conserve soil and the impacts of these decisions are highly dependent upon the characteristics of the soil and how sustainability is defined. In general, white soil conservation slowed degradation on erodible soils, it seemed to be more effective and economically efficient the better the initial soil quality.

AB Tourism is now the world's largest industry, generating earnings of pound285 billion/annum. In recent years, the tourism sector has become a significant contributor to the wealth of the UK and represents about 7% of the workforce. Greater mobility and more leisure time has led to greater car use, many more short-term movements of people, and increasing pressure on the transport infrastructure. Consequently, there is real concern about the effect of increased tourist activity on the environment and how the challenge of sustainable tourism can be achieved. This paper examines how the tourism industry is addressing that challenge by balancing the benefits of tourist activity without compromising the environment. In Wales, the Wales Tourist Board is committed to sustainable tourism, and its approach is offered as an example of achievement and how conflicting demands can be resolved.

AB This paper presents an overview of the components of wastewater management systems with particular reference to the emerging 'pollution preventative' source-control system which accords more with 'nature's way' and sustain able-development principles. The types and characteristics of pollutants, and also the ease of the removal of pollutants from wastewaters and the aquatic environment, are discussed. The source-control system is compared with the traditional conventional system on the basis of technical, economic, socio-cultural and environmental appropriateness in order to aid integrated drainage and wastewater treatment system selection and decision making - particularly in developing countries.

AB In North Staffordshire, the Achieving Sustainable Quality in Maternity (ASQUAM) meetings provide the programme for clinical guidelines and audit over the following year. The ASQUAM clinical effectiveness programme has attempted to address a number of the issues identified as obstacles to informed democratic prioritisation. For example, it became clear that a number of topics raised were actually research questions. The organisers therefore decided to split the fourth ASQUAM day into an 'audit' morning and a 'research' afternoon. The meeting organised by RJ, CR and PJ in partnership with the Midwives Information and Resource Service and the National Childbirth Trust, was timed to allow the research ideas to feed into the national Health Technology Assessment (HTA) programme. This meeting was designed to increase the profile of ASQUAM amongst consumers and to increase their representation at the meeting. Objectives were to choose a new set of research priorities for the year 2000, g pattern of comparison to health professionals. There and to ascertain the voting was overall agreement in terms of priorities, with the consumer group prioritising 8 of the 10 topics chosen by the professionals (or 10 of the 11). No significant differences between the proportions of voted cast for each topic by professionals and consumers were found apart from topic 20.
   The numbers of consumers were small which does limit the number the validity of statistical comparisons. Nevertheless, it is clear that voting patterns were similar. Overall the process suggests that democratic prioritisation is a viable option and one that may become essential within the framework of clinical and research governance.

AB The spatial organization of epiphytes has come under increasing attention. This kind of information is necessary or the general understanding of their ecology and for the design of sustainable harvesting methods. In this study, the small-scale (local) distribution of epiphytic bromeliads was studied using correlograms and permutational regression on distance matrices. Fieldwork was carried out in a young secondary forest stand in the central cordillera of Colombia at 3150 m asl. A complete census of the bromeliads in this plot was made. using a lattice with 400 quadrats. Six species of bromeliad were found (1008 individuals). All of these except one showed an aggregated spatial pattern. This pattern Was independent of the position of the. trees in the sampled plot. The distribution Of the bromeliads was determined by the availability of substrate (branch surface area per quadrat), the proximity of conspecifics and the geomorphology of the terrain. The structure of tire forest surrounding air epiphyte had an influence on the position of the epiphyte in the tree (height measured as distance from (he canopy). The use of two-dimensional, lattice-based sampling strategies is discussed as a possible method for comprehensive surveys of epiphyte populations in natural forests.

AB DNA shuffling facilitated the evolution of a human immunodeficiency virus type I (HIV-1) variant with enhanced replication in pig-tailed macaque peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pt mPBMC). This variant consists exclusively of HIV-1-derived sequences with the exception of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) nef. Sequences spanning the gag-protease-reverse transcriptase (gag-pro-RT) region from several HIV-1 isolates were shuffled and cloned into a parental HIV-1 backbone containing SIV nef. Neither this full-length parent nor any of the unshuffled HIV-1 isolates replicated appreciably or sustainably in pt mPBMC. Upon selection of the shuffled viral libraries by serial passaging in pt mPBMC, a species emerged which replicated at substantially higher levels (50 to 100 ng/ml p24) than any of the HIV-1 parents and most importantly, could be continuously passaged in pt mPBMC. The parental HIV-1 isolates, when selected similarly, became extinct. Analyses of full-length improved proviral clones indicate that multiple recombination events in the shuffled region and adaptive changes in the rest of the genome contributed synergistically to the improved phenotype. This improved variant may prove useful in establishing a pig-tailed macaque model of HIV-1 infection.

AB Soil variability is often seen as problematic in land degradation studies in terms of sampling effort, data interpretation and for the extrapolation of results to other areas or time periods. Examples are given from land degradation research undertaken in central Spain which demonstrate some of these problems associated with soil variability. Geostatistics is presented as a useful tool for quantifying soil variability and in particular the variogram for interpreting and understanding spatial patterns. Soil variability is also seen to complicate the issues surrounding management strategies and makes monospecific management strategies less likely to be successful. In recent years several studies have suggested that variability in soil properties and vegetation cover may reduce the risk of land degradation by minimizing the spatial extent of runoff and erosion. These studies suggest that increasing soil variability may prove to be an effective strategy for reducing the runoff and erosion risk. This paper discusses these ideas and highlights the importance of increasing thresholds above which runoff and erosion occurs for the success of such strategies. This in particular applies to many semiarid environments where thresholds are deemed to be extremely low. Finally, these concepts are placed in the context of scale where soil variability may be viewed as existing at a multitude of nested levels varying from the micro- to the macro-scale.

AB The Guadalhorce catchment is characterized by hydrological extremes, severe flooding which has intermittently devastated the coastal conurbation of Malaga and riparian settlements upstream and periodic droughts of several years' duration. The region is also affected locally by high levels of salinity in soils and water. Attempts to manage this situation to permit economic development through agriculture and industry over several centuries seemed to have ameliorated the worst excesses and during the 20th century a series of major dam projects offered the potential for sustainable future economic growth. However, rapid population growth and shifting patterns of agriculture have brought the question of sustainability back on to the agenda.
   This paper analyses the hydrological characteristics of the severe drought of the mid-1990s, in terms of its impacts both on water quantity and water quality in the region. The strategies adopted to maintain domestic and tourist water supplies in the face of high demands from irrigation, particularly looking at the conjunctive use of groundwater, and the development of regional water grids are evaluated. The pressures on water quality, which developed in various parts of the Guadalhorce hydrological system, including in the main water supply network for the city, are also explored.
   The paper concludes that the demands on the water supply system are unlikely to be manageable through current strategies and that ecological and water quality issues will probably prove more critical than water volumes in determining approaches to management of future droughts.

ID GOVERNMENT
AB In reporting on the potential contribution of a community-based waste reduction initiative to sustainable development, our object is to examine the role that such initiatives may play in community regeneration and participative democracy. In the context of changing relationships between government and the individual, we ask whether communities are able, and willing, to accept the self-governing role which is being pressed upon them. We also question the extent to which responsibility for achieving sustainable development can be devolved. The Waste Reduction in the Community Project ran in five diverse communities in Bristol and South Gloucestershire between 1995 and 1998. We examine the goals of the initiative, its procedures and the activities within it; and we review the kinds of achievements that might comprise If,success' in the context of sustainable development, both for the communities themselves and in a wider context. We discuss the outputs and outcomes of the project in relation to these; and reflect on the value of such initiatives in the current climate of modernisation of local government and community regeneration.

TI European policies in West Africa: who benefits from fisheries
   agreements?
SO MARINE POLICY
LA English
DT Article
AB Fishery cooperation agreements with the Sub-Saharan West African coastal states are considered by the European Union as purely commercial deals that are designed to maximize access to coastal state fishery resources, secure employment for European harvesting and processing industries and supply European seafood consumption markets at the lowest possible cost.
   Financial compensation paid by Brussels to the West African countries for fishing rights covers two-thirds or more of the license fees and is a subsidy for European vessel owners. This subsidy puts EU in position of a preferred user of the coastal resources. That displaces foreign investors and local entrepreneurs in the coastal states, distorts economics of the European fishing enterprises and promotes excessive pressure on the resources that greatly harms the marine environment in the West African region.
   Analysis of EU's relations with Guinea-Bissau shows that together with manipulation of the size of fishing fleet used by EU in this country's waters, there were significant irregularities resulting from excessive by-catch, underpayment of tuna license fees and denial of timely statistical information for the coastal state.
   Continuation of this type of relations with Sub-Saharan West Africa is against the long-term interests of the coastal states and sustainability of the coastal resources. Unless significant changes in fishing policies of the EU are made, West African coastal countries will face severe overexploitation of their resources and subsequent drop in license revenues. The EU's departure from purely business approach in fisheries relations with the West African coastal countries and termination of subsidization of the European fleets should be considered as important steps toward new fisheries relations with the region
   On other hand, coastal states should undertake more coordinated approach in dealing with foreign pressures on their resources and harmonize negotiation of the fisheries agreements with the EU. They also must improve the investment climate so foreign fleet operators would be encouraged to integrate their offshore activity with the coastal states' economies. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

ID COMPETITION; EQUILIBRIUM
AB Many established industries, such as the online service industry, the telecommunication industry, or the fitness club industry, are access service industries. When using services in these industries, consumers pay for the privilege of accessing the firm's facilities but do not acquire any right to the facility itself. A firm's pricing decisions in access industries frequently come down to a simple choice among flat fee pricing, usage pricing, or two-part tariff pricing. However, it is not so simple for firms in those industries to make this choice. Access service firms typically face a mix of consumers who have intrinsically different usage rates. A key characteristic of access service firms, however, is that the cost of providing an additional minute of usage is typically negligible, as long as the firm has the necessary capacity to serve its customers. Service capacity, which corresponds to the total available time on a firm's system, is often limited.
   In this paper, we show that service capacity and consumer usage heterogeneity are two important factors that determine a firm's optimal choice. We develop a model that incorporates these two salient characteristics shared by access industries and study what determines a firm's choice among the three alternative pricing structures (flat fee pricing, usage pricing, or two-part tariff pricing). Our analysis shows that, in the presence of consumer usage heterogeneity, service capacity mediates a firm's optimal choice in a complex, yet predictable way. A firm's choice also hinges on whether heavy or light users are more valuable in terms of their willingness-to-pay on a per-unit-capacity basis. The presence of both consumer usage heterogeneity and capacity constraints prompts a firm to choose its pricing structure to attract a desired customer mix and to price discriminate. As a result, two-part tariff pricing is not always optimal in access industries, and a firm's pricing structure can vary in a complex way with the interaction of those two factors.
   Specifically, we show that when light users are more valuable, a firm may use a two-part tariff or a flat fee, depending on whether the firm is constrained by its service capacity, but never charge a usage price alone or offer any signing bonus (a negative flat fee or a flat payment to customers). When heavy users are more valuable, a firm may choose to set a usage price, a signing bonus plus a usage price, or a flat fee. Interestingly, regardless of whether heavy or light users are more valuable in an access service industry, only flat rate pricing is a sustainable pricing structure once the industry has developed sufficient excess capacity.
   We also show that the optimal pricing strategy in access industries can have some intriguing, nonintuitive implications that have not been explored elsewhere. For instance, when the industry capacity is unevenly distributed between competing firms, the large-capacity firm may well be advised to increase, rather than to decrease, its price to accommodate the small firm. It would be too costly and too tactless for the large firm to do otherwise. In fact, the strategy of accommodation calls on the larger firm to retreat in both light and heavy user markets and leave more of its capacity idle and more of the market demand unmet when the small firm's capacity (hence, the industry capacity) increases. This implies that incremental policy measures that encourage the growth of smaller companies in the presence of a large company can be welfare-decreasing because the growth of a smaller firm can force the retreat of a large company at the expense of market coverage.
   Today, services account for two-thirds to three-quarters of the GNP, not only in the United States but also in many industrial countries. Access industries are growing rapidly to exert profound impact on today's economy. However, service pricing in general and pricing access services in particular have not received adequate attention in the literature. In this paper, we take the first step in understanding how capacity constraints and consumer usage heterogeneity mediate the choice of pricing structures in both monopolistic and competitive contexts.

AB Continuous increase of the annual amount of steel scrap generated presents a problem to the sustainability of human society. The effective utilization of scrap is a serious problem to be solved in the near future. and the optimization of the global system of steel production should be considered from various viewpoints, particularly those of environmental load and material efficiency, For the consideration of a global system that contains many different kinds of flow, a criterion for evaluating the efficiency of the system is necessary for optimizing the utilization of materials in the system. The concept of exergy was adopted in this study and the application of exergy analysis to the evaluation of a complicated system was considered. A simulation model was developed for the steel industry in Japan and the exergy analysis of the Blast Furnace-LD converter (BF-LD) process and the Electric Arc Furnace (EF) process was conducted, The exergy loss was expressed as a function of parameters, such as the mixing rate of pig iron in the EF process and the total exergy loss in the system was calculated, The applicability of exergy as a criterion for the analysis of a production process and for evaluating material efficiency was discussed.

AB Participatory research on bovine trypanosomiasis was conducted with Orma pastoralists in Tana River District, Kenya. The use of participatory methods to understand local perceptions of disease signs, disease causes, disease incidence by cattle age group, seasonal patterns of disease and preferences for indigenous and modern control methods are described. Results indicated that local characterization of diseases called gandi and buku by Orma pastoralists was similar to modern veterinary knowledge on chronic trypanosomiasis and haemorrhagic trypanosomiasis (due to Trypanosoma vivax), respectively. The mean incidence of gandi varied from 10.2% in calves to 28.6% in adult cattle. The mean incidence of buku varied from 3.1% in calves to 9.6% in adults. Pearson correlation coefficients for disease incidence by age group were 0.498 (P<0.01) and 0.396 (P<0.05) for gandi and buku, respectively. Informants observed cases of trypanosomiasis in 24.1% of cattle (all age groups); these cases accounted for 41.8% of all sick cattle during the preceding 12-month period. Eight indigenous and three modern trypanosomiasis control methods were identified. Results indicated that an integrated approach to trypanosomiasis control based on private, individual action was well established in the assessment area. When presented with four different trypanosomiasis control methods, community representatives selected 'better use of trypanocides' as the most preferred intervention and 'community-based tsetse control' as the least preferred intervention. This finding prompted researchers to modify the original project activities. Constraints facing the sustainability of community-based tsetse control are discussed.

AB Data on the physical and financial performance of farms are collected annually by the Meat and Wool Economic Service of New Zealand. We used the available data from 1968/69 to 1995/96 to calculate a nutrient balance for the model high-country farm. Our nutrient budget takes account of the loss of nutrients in the form of livestock products (meat and wool), and losses or movement due to leaching and rainfall run-off. Inputs of nutrients occur with the application of fertiliser, in rainfall, and by legumes fixing nitrogen. While there have been large fluctuations in both the quantity of nutrients applied as fertiliser and the quantity of nutrients removed, the whole-farm nutrient balance has remained in credit each year for the whole of the time series for all major nutrients. Separate budgets for developed and undeveloped grassland showed that the nutrient balances were in credit for four of the five nutrients in each case; in developed grassland mean potassium balances were slightly negative while in the undeveloped grassland phosphorus balances were slightly negative. The annual surplus of calcium is significantly higher than for other nutrients. The results indicate a need for re-interpretation of nutrient losses calculated for post-European settlement as they affect understanding of the effects of grazing on the sustainability of high-country grasslands. Over the 30 years studied there appears to have been a cessation and probably some redress of nutrient losses from the system. This indicates that losses were greater earlier in the 150-year period of European settlement than are indicated by the long-term averages.

AB Sesarmid crabs dominate Indo West-Pacific mangroves, and consume large amounts of mangrove litter. This is surprising, since mangrove leaves have high tannin contents and C/N ratios that far exceed 17, normally taken as the maximum for sustainable animal nutrition. This paradox has led to the hitherto untested hypothesis that crabs let leaves age in burrows before consumption, thereby reducing tannin content and C/N ratio. We excavated burrows of Neosarmatium meinerti within high-shore Avicennia marina mangroves, and investigated whether burrow leaves had C, N or C/N values significantly different from those of senescent leaves. Leaves were found in <45% of burrows, mostly only as small fragments, and N concentrations and C/N ratios of burrow leaves never varied significantly from senescent leaves. The leaf-ageing hypothesis was therefore not supported. In the field N. meinerti and Sesarma guttatum fed on sediment in 76% and 66-69% of observations, respectively, and on leaves in <10% of observations. Sediments from two A. marina mangroves had a mean C/N ratio of 19.6. Our results, and the literature, show that mangrove leaves are unlikely to fulfil the N requirements of crabs, whether or not leaf ageing takes place. Sediment detritus could be a richer source of N, as shown by lower C/N ratios and regular ingestion by crabs. By fragmenting leaves crabs may be elevating the nutritional quality of the substrate detritus.

AB This study was carried out in the Eastern Plains of Colombia and assessed the impact of agricultural intensification on the structure of earthworm communities. Earthworms were hand-sorted in a variety of agroecosystems of increasing intensity, from natural savanna to pastures and annual crops. An agricultural intensification index was used to rank systems along an intensification gradient, i.e. from native savanna to pastures and annual crops. Earthworm biomass, specific richness and Shannon index sharply decreased along the gradient. The disappearance of some species in cultivated systems was mostly attributed to the lack of recovery of populations after major perturbations like e.g. tillage. The more resistant species were those presenting high surface mobility (i.e. high colonisation capacity) or high population growth potential (i.e. high ability of population recovering after perturbation). Sensitive species disappeared after pasture establishment but richness was recovered in a period of about 3 years. In 17 year-old pastures, the community has regained its initial diversity and present very high biomass due to the presence of abundant populations of an anecic species. On the opposite side, annual crops had deep detrimental impacts that were more accentuated in the rotations (i.e. systems that were tilled twice a year) and were still present in a 2 year-old fallow.

ID CONCEPTUAL INTEGRATION
AB The cognitive turn in the humanities is an aspect of a more general cognitive turn taking place in the contemporary study human beings. Because it interacts with cognitive neuroscience, it can seem unfamiliar to students of the humanities, but in fact it draws much of its content, many of its central research questions, and many of its methods from traditions of the humanities as old as classical rhetoric. Its purpose in combining old and new, the humanities and the sciences, poetics and cognitive neurobiology is not to create an academic hybrid but instead to invent a practical, sustainable, intelligible, intellectually coherent paradigm for answering basic and recurring questions about the cognitive instruments of art, language, and literature.

ID POLICY
AB Concepts of preservation, conservation, and development shaped in large part the debate about U.S. environmental policy at the end of the 19th century. Forest use was often the focal point of controversy. Throughout the 20th century, Americans continued debating forest use, but by the late 20th century, the assumption that 19th century beliefs prevailed had begun to create a barrier to understanding changing perspectives. This paper begins by discussing one of these new perspectives, sustainable development, which has gained international prominence since the 1992 United Nations Conference on Environment and Development after being mentioned in the 1986 World Commission on Environment and Development's Our Common Future. Following the introduction to sustainable development, this paper briefly presents the results of a 1989 study using Q methodology, which identified the emergence of sustainable development as one of several beliefs in a more complex framework of perspectives on forest use than had been assumed. In addition to sustainable development, this new framework included beliefs in nature as a community to be respected, a place for personal growth, a means for demonstrating self-reliance, and a rallying point for grassroots activism. This paper examines sustainable development in the context of these other belief types and concludes by cautioning policymakers to consider these additional policy arguments and define the policy agenda more fully.

TI The diffusion of environmental management standards in Europe and in the
   United States: An institutional perspective
SO POLICY SCIENCES
LA English
DT Article
ID ORGANIZATIONAL PRACTICES; INDUSTRIES; COMMITMENT; FRENCH
AB ISO 14001, released in 1996, provides the basic framework for the establishment of an Environmental Management System (EMS) that can be audited and certified. ISO is not only an acronym for the International Organization for Standardization, but is also a term that refers to its Greek meaning: 'equal.' The main rationale for the creation of ISO 14001 was that its worldwide acceptance should facilitate international trade by harmonizing otherwise diffuse environmental management standards and by providing an internationally accepted blueprint for sustainable development, pollution prevention, and compliance assurance.
   However, the implementation of ISO 14001 varies significantly across the globe. A significant number of firms have adopted ISO 14001 in Western Europe and Asia. In December 1999, 52% of the 14,106 ISO 14001 certified facilities were located in Western Europe and 36% in Asia. On the contrary, very few American companies have adopted this voluntary standard. U.S. certified facilities accounted for only 4.5% of the total of ISO 14001 certified facilities in the world in December 1999.
   The U.S. institutional environment seems acting as a deterrent to ISO 14000 adoption as U.S. companies are fearful of the certification process which lays their performance open to public scrutiny. The opposite is true in Europe, where governments have encouraged the adoption of environmental management standards by setting up a trusted certification system and providing technical assistance to potential adopters.
   This paper offers a conceptual framework to analyze this variation in adoption rates. It is proposed that the regulatory, normative and cognitive aspects of a country's institutional environment greatly impact the costs and potential benefits of ISO 14001 adoption and therefore explain the differences in adoption across countries. The analysis is supported by data collected from a phone questionnaire to 140 firms in Europe and a questionnaire mailed to 152 firms in the U.S.

AB In 1996, the State of Florida mandated a study of the Florida Keys, the most populated portion of Monroe County, explicitly calling for a carrying capacity analysis to function as a basis for determining building permit allocation in the future. The Florida Keys Carrying Capacity Study, conducted by the State of Florida and the US Army Corps of Engineers, has encountered challenges in trying to convert the vague carrying capacity concept into a functional, quantitative method. Difficulties in responding to external peer review advice suggests that institutional constraints are hindering re-direction of the study.

TI The economic sustainability of post-conflict Kosovo
SO POST-COMMUNIST ECONOMIES
LA English
DT Article
AB Kosovo is currently operating as an independent economic state, having severed the majority of economic links with the former Yugoslavia. This article explains why the Yugoslav dinar was replaced by the DM (in turn replaced by the Euro) as the new national currency of post-conflict Kosovo. Use of the DM, coupled with a relatively open trade policy, has resulted in a severe visible trade deficit. The stock of DM is continuously being replenished by the inflow of money both from the various international agencies operating in Kosovo and from remittances from Kosovars working abroad. The article argues that, even with the current low level of export earnings, the economy of Kosovo is economically sustainable, since the international presence in Kosovo is partly responsible for the high demand for imports. However, in the absence of a competitive export sector, the economy is still highly reliant upon the inflow of remittances, without which Kosovo would be unable to meet the costs of vital imports.

DE marketing & public relations; transport management
AB The development of public transport services is a key element of all local sustainable transport strategies. Achieving modal switch from car users requires marketing systems be changed to identify and target suitable non-users of public transport, rather than just enlarging custom by existing users. However, in the public transport field, marketing is still essentially designed to only address the existing customer base. This is particularly acute among bus operators, who rarely even market effectively to their existing customer base, and have a poor image among car users. This paper draws on the practical experience of some of the relatively few local bus operators and local authorities that have identified and won new markets, including modal shift from car. It looks at the sort of services they have developed, the marketing strategies adopted, and at how the stake-holders worked together. In addition, it provides hard evidence as to the benefits of marketing bus services properly, suggesting that patronage gains of around 5-7% should be possible, even without major investment or legislative change. In conclusion, seven key features of good practice are identified that need to be part of developing bus services to serve sustainable transport policies. These are customisation, co-operation, clear vision, clarity (to the user), core market, culture, and continuity.

DE infrastructure planning; transport management; transport planning
AB Concerns about the impact of the car on the environment, on quality of life and on congestion levels have led to increased recognition among transport engineers that alternatives to the car must be promoted. This means that public transport has to form a core part of any sustainable transport system. One form of public transport that is seen as an alternative to the car in towns and cities is light rail. However, there are problems involved with promoting these systems and in anticipating their impacts on travel behaviour. In the past, forecasts of the patronage figures on these systems have been much higher than the actual patronage figures achieved. Transport experts must find a way to make these systems more successful by discovering what the public want from the systems. This paper describes a series of interviews carried out with potential users of Croydon Tramlink. It outlines their attitudes and the concerns they held about using Tramlink. In particular, the surveys examine the impact that publicity from the relevant authorities had on people's modal choices. The paper shows that people were very unimpressed by the publicity and in some cases it had a negative impact on their decisions. The conclusions of the paper have some interesting implications for transport policy and public transport promotion. Suggestions are made on how the lessons learned about people's decision-making processes regarding new light-rail systems could be used to more effectively promote future systems.

AB Transport by conventional means involves energy use, resource use and emission output which cannot be regarded as sustainable. Current transport is dominated by the car. This provides the flexible personal transport required by modern forms of cities, but is widely recognised as unsustainable. Current public transport is poorly accepted. Unfortunately, analysis also shows that current forms of public transport offer little, or even negative, benefit in sustainability over the car. A new transport system has been devised to meet the need for transport which is both effective and sustainable. ULTra (Urban Light Transport) is an innovative form of Personal Rapid Transit (PRT). In contrast to previous forms of public transport, there is no waiting, no stopping and no transfers within the system. In many circumstances, it can offer better transport than available by other means. ULTra has been designed to demanding sustainability requirements. Typically, ULTra provides a reduction by a factor of 3 in energy use and emissions output over existing forms of transport. ULTra is also complementary to existing forms of transport. By providing a network link to major rail or bus stations, it can improve the attraction of current transport services. Evaluations undertaken for the Department of Transport and supported by recent questionnaire studies, suggest that a comprehensive ULTra system could attract 25-30% of present car drivers. ULTra is now undergoing engineering development funded by the Department of Transport, Local Government and the Regions. Cardiff County Council has received funding commitments from the National Assembly of Wales which will lead to initial implementation of a system by 2005. It is believed that the system offers a new approach to public transport with a real prospect of significant gains in effectiveness and sustainability.

AB Policy-makers and planners concerned with sustainable transport systems have continuously advocated the use of alternative fuel vehicles as a means of reducing road vehicle emissions. The environmental benefits of one such type of alternatively fuelled vehicle, natural gas vehicles (NGVs), are well-documented. Despite the much-proclaimed environmental benefits of NGVs however, there has been little take-up of these vehicles in the UK. A review of current policies towards these vehicles and the ways in which they are promoted may therefore be necessary to encourage their market penetration. A stated preference survey was conducted among freight transport operators throughout the UK, which revealed that economic factors, namely vehicle capital costs and (fuel) operating costs, and fuel availability were of most importance to operators when considering the purchase of a new vehicle. Consequently, policies that not only make NGVs financially competitive but in fact also give them a financial advantage over conventional vehicles, complemented by measures to increase the supply of fuel, may prove most effective in encouraging the adopt on these vehicles among UK road freight operators. Obviously, the operators must be aware of these improvements and, as such, these policies must also be supported by a vigorous promotional and awareness campaign.

AB Public policy decisions taken over the last few decades give a strong impression that politicians, perhaps understandably, have been loath to adopt measures which run counter to what they believe people want. That is so even where this preference can be seen to be largely or totally inspired by the public's limited appreciation of the longer-term consequences of the decisions. This is particularly evident in the transport sector where the social, environmental and ecological damage can be considerable. This paper attempts to highlight a disturbing instance of this, where the incompatibility of policies catering for growth in this sector and those intended to deliver a sufficiently adequate response to the prospect of climate change from excessive use of fossil fuels is obvious.

AB Advances in technology have created an environment for a learning revolution. In the digital economy, technology enabled learning or e-learning is becoming an integral part of a larger system of practices and policies designed to prepare and support a high skilled workforce. The power of e-learning comes from the opportunity to leverage technology and information to alter the basic tenets of learning by eliminating the one-size fits all approach to instruction and customizing content to meet individual needs and learning styles.
   Because e-learning has the potential to significantly improve workforce development, the American Society for Training and Development (ASTD) and the National Governors' Association (NGA) convened leaders from business, government, and education to examine how e-learning can equip workers with the skills needed to succeed. The culmination of this effort is outlined in A Vision of E-Learning for America's Workforce. The report makes the social and economic case for creating a sustainable e-learning environment for America's workforce and identifies priority areas for action for the public and private sectors to implement jointly.

AB Achieving solutions to environmental problems that we face today requires long-term potential actions for sustainable development. In this regard. renewable energy resources appear to be the one of the most efficient and effective solutions. So clean, domestic and renewable energy is commonly accepted as the key for future life for Turkey. Turkey's geographical location has several advantages for extensive use of most of these renewable energy sources. Because of this and the fact that it has limited fossil fuel resources, a gradual shift from fossil fuels to renewables seems to be serious and the sole alternative for Turkey. This article presents a review of the present energy situation and sustainability, technical and economical potential of renewable energy sources and future policies for the energy sector in Turkey. Also, potential solutions to current environmental problems are identified along with renewable energy technologies. Throughout the paper several problems relating to renewable energy sources, environment and sustainable development are discussed from both current and future perspectives. The renewable energy potential of the country and their present use are evaluated here based on the available data. The present study shows that there is an important potential for renewables in Turkey. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The purpose of this paper is to review the case of a Mexican municipality in this field and highlight and identify critical gaps to be addressed. The paper seeks to explore intersectorial partnerships as a means to achieve sustainable solid waste management systems. Its point of departure is that, the highest level of service and maximum benefit is gained when a municipality sees its solid waste management mandates and handicaps clearly, uses the strengths of the other actors. The four main types of actors considered in this paper are: the municipal government, the formal private (commercial) sector, and the informal sector, which, includes individuals, small entrepreneurs, and micro-enterprises already working with discarded materials or having the potential to do so. Community based organizations (CBOs), either idealistically motivated or working for their own welfare, and non-governmental organizations (NGOs), usually in pursuit of their own idealistic goals are also a part of the informal sector.

AB The role that international trade plays in measuring sustainable development has come under recent scrutiny. We examine international resource flows using an input-output framework that is akin to 'ecological balance of payments' analysis. This framework allows us to use to calculate the derived demand for resources in the country of final use. The empirical section of this paper applies this model to data on global trade and natural resource depletion in 1980, 1985 and 1990. Our results provide a quantitative assessment of the significance of direct and indirect imports of resources required by Japan, the United States and the European Union. These results can also be disaggregated to permit an examination of trade relations vis-a-vis individual resource exporting countries. It is interesting to note that a number of these resource exporters appear to be unsustainable at least on the basis of the criterion that the savings rate net of asset consumption (i.e. genuine savings) should not be negative. These findings, in turn, could form the basis of policies to assist exporters in adopting prudent resource and public investment policies. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

SO REVIEW OF INDUSTRIAL ORGANIZATION

AB The music recording industry is a highly-concentrated five firm oligopoly. Much of the dominance achieved by larger firms in the industry results from control over the distribution and promotion of the products of the industry. Alexander (1994b), predicted that new compression routines would facilitate the efficient transfer of digital music across the internet. MP3 compression routines have made such transfers relatively simple and efficient. While smaller new entrants have not yet been able to exploit this new technology in terms of market share, an element of uncertainty exists regarding the sustainability of the prevailing structure, due to large scale non-sanctioned file sharing. Despite the industry's legal efforts to suppress non-sanctioned file distribution, peer-to-peer networks may render these efforts futile. However, peer-to-peer networks must overcome structural and institutional problems, in particular, free-riding.

AB The effect of isolated trees of baginha (Stryphnodendron guianense (Aubl.) Benth.) on some aspects of cultivated pasture ecosystems was studied in the Western Amazon of Brazil. Soil fertility, nutrients in the litter, soil water content, light transmission to sward, herbage availability, and chemical and morphological composition of the grasses (mixture of Brachiaria decumbens and B. brizantha cv. Marandu) were assessed under the canopies of baginha trees and in the adjacent open areas. The trees had positive effect on soil fertility, especially with respect to soil organic matter and nitrogen content, with the great deposition of litter rich in nitrogen being the main contribution. The shaded grass leaves were richer in N and K, and poorer in Ca, than the unshaded ones. The canopies of the baginha trees presented low density, allowing the transmission of 27% of the incoming photosynthetically active radiation at noon. The high ground cover (superior to 85%) and good herbage availability under the canopies of baginha trees, in addition to other attributes, confirms the potential of this legume as shade tree for pastures and as component of other kinds of silvopastoral systems in the humid tropics.

AB It was studied five management systems of native pasture, under grazing, from Rio Grande do Sul State: with biennial burning for more than 100 years, without burning for 32 years with or without mowing, and pasture improvement for 7 and 24 years. The forage accumulation and the senescent material detached from the plant, were evaluated using grazing exclusion cage. The experimental design was a completely randomized with three replications. The systems without burning were more productive and among these the fora e accumulation was similar among without burning and without mowing and the improvement treatments with annual accumulation higher than 9,000 kg/ha of green forage dry matter. The litter was higher with treatment without burning and without mowing, lower with burning, and intermediate with other treatments. The alternative management showed to be more productive and more sustainable as compared with burning practices.

AB The experiment was carried out at the experimental station of EMBRAPA/National Dairy Research, at Coronel Pacheco, in the Zona da Mata region of Minas Gerais, to evaluate the qualitative aspects of the nutrients recycling through the feces of grazing bovines. A 110 square meter plot was located in a previous established pasture of Brachiaria decumbens. There were significant differences on the nitrogen and magnesium concentrations of forage, for 10 weeks, apparently reflecting amounts in the forage. There were no variation of the other nutrients in the forage and feces. The average frequency defecation was of 9.84 defecations/animal per day and the average weight of the feces at each defecation was of 200.5 g dry matter. It was verified, by means of some data estimates, that the nutrients recycling in the feces, so 93.28% N, 76.68% P, 1.99% K, 72.93% Ca and 62.54% Mg, that was ingested by the animal returned to the pasture as feces, the same as 18.09% N, 35.46% P, 5.47% K, 30.26% Ca and 15.43% Mg, available as primary production, returned to the pasture through feces.

AB We test two sets of hypotheses concerning the association between gender and various structural and attitudinal variables, using data collected in two surveys (1979 and 1995-1996) from random samples of land-grant agricultural scientists. The first set of hypotheses centers on the expectation that the resources and rewards of agricultural science are distributed unequally by gender. We find significant gender differences in scientists' postdoctoral work experience, academic rank, employment of graduate students, rate of book publication, and links with private industry. Our second set of hypotheses, drawing on the literatures of feminist epistemology and Situated knowledge, focuses on the relationship between scientists' gender and perceptions of the goals of agricultural research. Our findings indicate that gender is unimportant in explaining differences in scientists' commitment to agricultural sustainability, environmental issues, and family farm preservation as important goals of land-grant research. Yet we find significant gender differences in attitudes toward biotechnology and the growing links between land-grant universities and private industry.

TI "Sustainable development" as collective surge
SO SOCIAL SCIENCE QUARTERLY
LA English
DT Article
AB The purpose of this article is to examine a surge in the sciences surrounding the use of the concept of sustainable development. Data come from the annual frequencies of publications in various disciplines that use the concept of sustainable development as well as from a content analysis of documents. The article concludes that the surge was characterized by the use by scientists of established concepts in a new way, a form of cultural emergence; a prevailing locus of interaction revolving around a professional ideology; the prevalence of the emotions of fear and hope of deliverance from the threat; and an international arena of discourse occurring over a period of years and bounded by class-professional identities. The article demonstrates that a newer understanding of fads as collective surges in the sociology specialty area of collective behavior helps describe the use in the sciences of the concept of sustainable development during the late 1980s and 1990s. The surge is relatively short-lived, coterminous with the use of different meanings and practices of sustainable development. It cannot be understood as a superficial, odd, inconsequential, or frivolous event. Rather, it had important, lasting consequences in a number of areas, from economic and social development to professions.

AB In the course of implementing plans for sustainable development, sociologists in developing countries use ideas from natural resource sociology rather than from environmental sociology. They draw upon these ideas as employees of nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) who manage integrated conservation and development programs (ICDPs). Beginning in the 1980s, donors provided funds for ICDPs, so scientists created NGOs to carry out the projects and hired colleagues to do the work. Because ICDPs aim to help poor people acquire, manage, and conserve natural resources, their design and implementation require that NGO staff engage with the core issues in natural resource sociology. Donors have not supported projects in areas like environment justice that draw upon the expertise of environmental sociologists, so NGOs that practice environmental sociology have not emerged. Urbanization and increased local-level mobilization around pollution issues may increase the opportunities for doing environmental sociology in the developing world in the near future.

AB In response to the Field et al. (2001) and Buttel (2001) argument that there are distinct patterns that distinguish natural resource and environmental sociology, I argue that this is typical of a thriving multiparadigmatic social science and is occurring across other ecological social sciences. In this article I briefly review current debates among anthropologists and human geographers to illustrate the transdisciplinary relevance of the natural resource and environmental sociology division and to suggest approaches that integrate this divide and also provide bridges to other ecological social sciences. The "bridging'' areas I discuss include political ecology, community conservation, and sustainable livelihoods. Natural resource/environmental sociologists have much to learn from engaging the works of each other and from other social and natural scientists.

   PARTICULATE; STABILITY
AB Understanding long-term management effects on soil properties is necessary to determine the relative sustainability of cropping systems. Soil physical, chemical, and biological properties were measured in a long-term cropping system study in the Western Corn Belt. Properties were evaluated after 16 yr in four crop sequences [continuous corn (zea mays L.) (CC), corn-soybean [Glycine max. (L.)] (C-SB), corn-oat (Avena sativa L.) + clover (80% sweet clover [Melilotus officinalis L.] and 20% red clover [Trifolium pratense L.])-grain sorghum [(Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench)-soybean (C-OCL-SG-SB), and corn-soybean-grain sorghum-oat + clover (C-SB-SG-OCL)] each at three N fertilization rates (ZERO, LOW, and HIGH) to a soil depth of 30.5 cm on a Sharpshurg silty clay loam (fine, smectitic, mesic Typic Argiudolls). Nitrogen fertilization had a greater impact on soil properties than crop sequence, with management effects most pronounced at 0 to 7.6 cm. Increased N rate resulted in greater organic C, total N, and particulate organic matter (POM), but lower soil pH. Increased N rate also reduced microbial biomass by similar to20% between the HIGH and ZERO N-rate treatments. The C-SB-SG-OCL sequence possessed more potentially mineralizable N (PMN) (57 vs. 46 kg ha(-1) for average of CC and C-SB) and a higher percentage of POM present as soil organic matter (17.1% for the C-SB-SG-OCL sequence vs. 13.9% for other sequences). Within the context of soil functions and cropping system performance, results from this study indicate the C-SB-SB-OCL sequence enhanced nutrient cycling efficiency, while N fertilization resulted in a trade-off between its positive effect on biological productivity and negative effect on nutrient cycling efficiency.

SO SOIL USE AND MANAGEMENT

DE soil compaction; logging; forest soils; forest machinery
ID FOREST SOILS
AB Forest soil sustainability and future crop productivity is at risk if mechanised harvesting operations cause soil damage. In UK upland forestry, soil protection is usually provided by placing harvesting residues (brash) over areas where machinery traffic is required. In this study, various thicknesses of brash mat were tested for their ability to reduce compaction of a surface water gley soil at Kielder Forest, Northumberland. Changes in penetration resistance and dry soil bulk density were studied after passes by forest harvesting and timber extraction machinery running on the brash.
   The study shows that normal harvesting operations caused some soil compaction. However, the brash mat system was shown as important in protecting the soil. Soil under brash mats experienced some compaction to at least 45 cm depth. The thickest brash mat, composed of residues from 10 rows of trees, was unable to prevent compaction completely. Nevertheless, the protective role of the brash mat system was clearly confirmed when compared to timber extraction over bare soil. The point at which compaction has a detrimental effect on the establishment and stability of future tree rotations remains uncertain.

DE ecology of time; environmental planning; gender; space; spatial
   planning; sustainable development; time; transition
AB In this article I discuss the significance of the temporal-spatial figure of transition in relation to spatial planning and environmental planning. This discussion is based on the theory that change and renewal can be found in intermediate spaces. I consider the positive value accorded to the spatial figure of transition in the discourses of ecology, environmental education and town planning. The integrative function of transition as a liminal space of possibility was highlighted early on in feminist planning debates. This function corresponds to the sustainable development model and is evidently inherent in the figure of transition. I therefore suggest that these debates should be used constructively in current research on sustainability, especially in the planning sciences.

DE AGNPS model; watershed management; soil loss control; GIS; modified

AB Thorough land use planning in a slope land watershed requires careful consideration of both natural and social conditions. A modified "simple-accurate" method was used to estimate a land use potential value for each terrain unit of a slope land watershed in Taiwan. Soil loss estimates based on erosion modeling served as a guide for determining the most suitable land use type. The social feedback to the proposed land use planning was assessed through on-site interviews with the land users. Results indicate large conflicts and differences between land use planning based on natural condition evaluation and social needs. For sustainable soil and water resource use, land areas with moderate to high land use potential value can only be released for human activities if adequate soil and water conservation practices are maintained. Land areas with less than moderate land use potential should be kept in their original natural stage. This recommendation should greatly improve the soil and water loss problems in the study area and ensure future sustainable development of soil and water resources in Taiwan.

AB Winter cover cropping on agricultural fields may improve rainfall infiltration and enhance soil water storage in areas such as California's Sacramento Valley, where the majority of precipitation occurs in the winter over a relatively short period of time in a series of heavy, rainfall events. Enhanced soil water storage within the root Zone on cover-cropped fields may benefit a grower by reducing the demand for surface water deliveries to meet the irrigation needs of subsequent crops. A study was conducted in the winters of 1998-1999 and 1999-2000 to determine afield's ability to conserve water for subsequent crops and to evaluate the effects of soil physical conditions on the water balance for three 4-year rotation farming systems within the Sustainable Agriculture Farming Systems (SAFS) Project at the University of California, Davis, Rainfall, runoff, and soil water content data was collected on two treatments using a winter cover crop and one treatment maintained fallow during the winter Runoff and soil water content measurements were significantly affected by farming systems.
   Cumulative event runoff from 10.67 m(2) infiltration test areas was consistently, higher on the fallow treatment than on the cover-cropped treatments. Winter 1999-2000 field water content measurements from 0-1.05 in depth were significantly higher in the cover-cropped systems than in the fallow treatment after field capacity, had been reached. A hydrologic model was developed using the measured data and lysimeter data for evaporation and evapotranspiration to track daily, water budget components (i.e., runoff, infiltration, evaporation, evapotranspiration, and soil water storage) and to assess changes in surface hydraulic conductivity,. Model simulations showed that optimized hydraulic conductivity decreased for all treatments with successive runoff, but was less pronounced in cover-cropped plots. The study, indicated that cover cropping can improve soil water storage for subsequent crops if the cover crop is destroyed before the additional soil water is lost as evapotranspiration.

AB Environmental equity considerations should be an essential ingredient or any sustainable transport strategy, Yet, it is unclear how environmental equity considerations can be incorporated into the sustainable transport discourse in a meaningful manner. The paper explores the multiple facets of the meaning of environmental equity in the case or transport. Then, the issues that need to be addressed in any analysis of each facet are delineated. On this basis it is suggested that the conventional environmental equity analysis, whereby the affected areas are compared to unaffected areas, is unlikely to render robust or meaningful results. Rather, the focus of research should be on the equity implications of policies geared to mitigate transport systems' environmental externalities, and on comparisons of users of the different transportation systems to those exposed to the negative environmental externalities of these systems. The results of such studies could provide direct inputs into comprehensive balanced policy packages within a sustainable transport strategy. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The mangrove vegetation occupies a key position in the livelihood of the people of Zanzibar. About 45% of the total population live along the coast and the majority are involved in the extraction of mangrove wood products and fishing. Between 80% and 90% of the local fishing is concentrated in waters close to mangrove-vegetated areas, creeks and bays. The area under mangrove vegetation, approximately 20,000 ha, is nevertheless only 6% of the total land area and necessarily needs to be used in a sustainable way. Recent efforts to link research findings from studies of aspects of the biology and ecology of the mangroves of Zanzibar and the dependent fisheries, with public awareness programs designed to educate and sensitize the local community, have generated a lot of positive interest in participatory management of the mangrove resources. Awareness of the ecological links between mangrove ecosystems and resources such as fish is key to winning management support. The instillation of a sense of ownership of the resources by the local population and their legal empowerment so that they are able to institute and execute control measures on their resources are also essential components in the process aimed at achieving full community support for the sustainable utilization and management of common resources. Local communities, for example at Kisakasaka village, are beginning to protect and to plan better ways of exploiting their mangrove resources. Based on biological knowledge gleaned through awareness campaigns, they are carrying out mangrove restoration programs with positive results. This short overview discusses some aspects of the biology and ecological roles of the mangroves of Zanzibar and what has happened to help change the attitude of the local coastal community towards the mangrove resources.

AB The aim of this research is to analyze the situation of mangroves in Myanmar, including their formation and their economic and ecological importance. Economic importance includes fisheries, fuel-wood, charcoal production, construction materials and medicine, while ecological importance includes shoreline stabilization, protection from wind and storms, coastal ecosystem stability and biodiversity protection. Myanmar's coastal areas were in good condition until 30 years ago. However, population increase and political instability have caused environmental and economic damage and threaten recovery. Awareness of the importance of the biodiversity of the coastal ecosystem and its endangered situation has led to the implementation of measures to ensure sustainable development and conservation.

AB Mangroves are important wetlands along tropical and subtropical coasts that have been seriously damaged due to excessive exploitation. The need to conserve mangroves has been recognized since the 1970s. The degree of mangrove conservation ranges from rigid ecological conservation (for "posterity") to sustainable exploitation (for "prosperity"), dependent on the needs and requirements of different regions. In Hong Kong, mangrove resources were rapidly destroyed in the last decades due to massive reclamation and infra-structural developments. To conserve the remaining mangroves in Hong Kong, a comprehensive ecological study was conducted in 1994-1997 to understand the ecological characteristics and current status of mangrove swamps, and 44 remaining swamps were classified into five categories according to overall conservation values. The conservation of Hong Kong mangroves is generally more towards "posterity" with strong emphasis on protecting biodiversity and maintaining ecological processes. Different conservation strategies have been recommended and promoting public awareness is one of the most important strategies. The possibility of using mangrove wetlands to remove pollutants appeared to be an attractive way to increase public awareness and educate the community. However, more research is needed to obtain a better understanding of pollutant assimilative capacity, long-term effects of wastewater-borne pollutants, costs and life span of such a mangrove wastewater treatment facility.

AB UNESCO has been required by its Member States to assist in implementing the recommendations of the World Conference on Science, held in Budapest in June 1999. In particular, UNESCO should identify national strategies for biodiversity protection in biosphere reserves and similarly managed areas, with special emphasis on coastal areas, small islands and mangroves, South-South technology transfer and intensive training for the management of renewable natural resources in selected case studies throughout specific developing countries. With generous support from the Government of Japan. UNESCO is now implementing the ASPACO project from January 2001 to December 2003, in close collaboration with MAB-Japan, ISME and the UNU. The project emphasises the role of biosphere reserves as catalysts for both conservation and development. The complementary roles of UNESCO, ISME and UNU in scientific issues of nature preservation and sustainable use of natural resources are eminent for action in (1) integrated management and sustainable development of coastal areas, including economic zones, and the preservation of natural and cultural heritage via "ethical tourism"; (2) mangrove forest environmental protection, (3) sustainable use and conservation of renewable natural resources under national jurisdiction; and (4) strengthening international, including regional, co-operation and co-ordination. This project will pay particular attention to those countries having or planning biosphere reserves and to those countries whose governments have strong relations with the MAB of UNESCO. Training, capacity building and increase of local capabilities for research and management of sustainable use of renewable natural resources are key elements of the project. In particular, through the involvement of ISME, the project will promote exchange of information, research results and scientists with respect to preservation and sustainable use of biodiversity. It will help to disseminate knowledge of comparative research through publications and/or network databases. Within the framework of action for poverty eradication, the project will try to identify how to improve living conditions for the inhabitants of concerned areas as a basic requirement for human security, with special attention to food and fodder production and the rational use of biodiversity for the benefit of local populations. Capacity building for the development of biosphere reserves will be through North-South exchanges; exchange of experience by training of biosphere reserve managers will be through South-South exchanges. This includes strengthening of existing capacities and increase of local capacity for carrying out management, natural resources assessment, research and training, with special emphasis on the education of young women. Project activities will be located in selected countries of the Pacific region, including small islands of the Pacific and the West Coast of Latin America.

AB There is limited information available on the status of and threats to mangroves in developing countries in the Asia-Pacific region. In the recent years, there has been a significant increase in scientific and volunteer surveys. However, this information is usually not well integrated with information on human activities that have the potential to contribute to the degradation of these ecosystems. A project "Coastal Habitats at Risk" is being developed jointly by the United Nations University (UNU) and the World Resources Institute, and in partnership with UNESCO and the International Society for Mangrove Ecosystems (ISME), in an effort to ameliorate this situation through standardized assessment of anthropogenic threats to mangroves in East and Southeast Asia. The geographic focus of the project includes Brunei, China, Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam. Threats from pollution, over-harvesting, aquaculture development, boating/shipping, flooding/freshwater input, siltation and other coastal development are examined with this map-based analysis. The study particularly emphasizes information regarding the human element of these ecosystems, with an eye towards community-based management and action. A geographic information system (GIS)-based tool will be developed to examine different coastal development and management scenarios and their implications for mangrove health, diversity and value. The results will serve as an indication of the threats to these ecosystems, not as an actual measure of degradation. This information generation can be seen as a first step toward assessing global needs for the world's mangrove ecosystems that to date remain largely unassessed. The analysis is intended to recommend policies, participatory approaches and management strategies to promote integrated coastal ecosystem approaches. It will help fill an information void through much-needed policy guidance on management and priority setting.

AB This study was conducted in Masaba and Masafu Sub-counties, Busia District, Uganda to assess the effect on the tsetse fly population of first treating all cattle with 1% w/v deltamethrin pour-on for a few months, followed by treating 10% of the cattle population. Treatment of all cattle for 6 months resulted in a significant reduction in the density of tsetse flies from 6.3 to 0.1 flies/trap/day (FTD), a 98.4% reduction. During the same period, the point prevalence of bovine trypanosomosis dropped from 37.7% to 2.9% (a 92.3% reduction). Treatment was resumed six months later, but this time only 10% of the cattle population received the pour-on treatment at three week intervals for a period of one year. This treatment maintained the tsetse fly density between 0 and 0.5 FTD and the prevalence of bovine trypanosomosis generally remained below 10%. In conclusion, under the local prevailing conditions, treatment of all communally grazed cattle with deltamethrin pour-on effectively suppressed the Glossina fuscipes fuscipes population. However, subsequent treatment of 10% of the cattle probably failed to control the tsetse fly population at a level sufficient to reduce trypanosomosis to acceptable levels.

AB In this article, flood protection is considered in the context of sustainability. On the one hand, floods destroy human heritage and jeopardize sustainable development, which can be defined as 11 non-decreasing quality of life. " On the other hand, following the most common interpretation of sustainable development, one should not choose flood protection policies that could be rated by future generations as inappropriate options of flood defense. This is how several large structural flood defenses are often viewed. Non-structural measures are in better agreement with the spirit of sustainable development, being more reversible, commonly acceptable, and environment-friendly. Among such measures are source control (watershed/landscape structure management), laws and regulations (including zoning), economic instruments, an efficient flood forecast-warning system, a system of flood risk assessment, awareness raising, flood-related data bases, etc. As flood safety cannot be reached in most vulnerable areas with the help of structural means only, further flood risk reduction via non-structural measures is usually indispensable, and a site-specific mix of structural and non-structural measures seems to be a proper solution. Since sustainabiliiy requires thinking about the future generations, the climate change issue becomes important. Non-structural measures lend themselves well to application in climate change adaptation strategies. As uncertainty in the assessment of climate change impacts is high, flexibility of adaptation strategies is particularly advantageous.

ID DECISION-SUPPORT SYSTEMS; WATER-RESOURCES
AB Modern flood mitigation is increasingly non-structural. Well-established, traditional non-structural measures such as zoning, building codes, flood proofing, early detection and warning, emergency, planning, flood insurance, etc., appear today as indispensable complements to structural engineering solutions. Advancement of computer sciences and communications provides an opportunity, for further broadening of the context of non-structural flood mitigation. Two new concepts, a flood management virtual database and a flood management decision support system, are presented in the paper. Their benefits are demonstrated through the development of prototype systems for the Red River basin in Manitoba, Canada. First, it is shown that the Internet technology is mature enough to support the development of virtual database for a complex domain such as flood plain management. It is also quite clear that this mode of support has many advantages when compared to more traditional centralized database model. Secondly, we concluded that the decision support system approach provides an opportunity to meet the expressed needs of residents living in flood-prone areas for improvement in the flood management and a major change in the decision-making process. A decision support system is envisioned as a tool for analyzing alternative mitigation and recovery strategies. It is proposed in this work as a way of making flood management process more transparent and efficient in reducing future economic, environmental, and social flood damages.

   sustainability; cost recovery
ID PRICE
AB In certain circles, demand management is seen as one and the same thing as economic pricing. This thinking is stimulated by the Dublin principle that water should be considered an economic good. But is this reasoning correct? Is economic pricing an adequate means to reach more desirable levels of demand? There is considerable misunderstanding about what the concept of water as an economic good implies. In this paper it is argued that water pricing should primarily serve the purpose of financial sustainability through cost recovery. Moreover, in water pricing, adequate attention should be given to equity considerations through, for example, increasing block tariffs. Instead of economic pricing there is a need for defining a reasonable price, which provides full cost recovery but which safeguards ecological requirements and access to safe water for the poor. Giving a reasonable price to water has the additional benefit that it sends out a clear signal to the users that water should be used wisely, but the prime target of water pricing remains cost recovery. A major argument of neoclassical economists is that economic pricing of water will facilitate the re-allocation of water from sectors with lower added value (such as agriculture) to sectors with a higher added value (such as urban water use). However, the value of alternative uses of irrigation water is often grossly over-estimated. Adequate and effective regulations may suffice in order to achieve the optimal allocation of water resources.

AB This paper explores the question of whether it is possible to arrange sustainable flood insurance coverage for domestic properties in Canada and elsewhere and whether it should be public or private insurance. It considers the essential requirements for a sustainable insurance market, including the importance of adverse selection and the vicious circle, with particular regard to flood risks. Based on a critical overview of the different private and public insurance solutions to flood risks around the world, the conclusion is drawn that the "bundled" system of private insurance would have the best prospects of success and would provide the best value for money for the community. However, for private flood insurance to be sustainable, the State would need to make a conscious decision not to provide any further compensation to flood victims. Instead it should concentrate on renewing infrastructure and working in partnership with insurers on issues such as building codes and planning matters. Some suggestions are made about how such a private insurance system might be established. Support for a private insurance system could be a potentially sensitive political risk for the government, if its citizens regard the provision of flood compensation as a social duty. Some consideration is therefore given to ways in which the insurance industry has demonstrated social responsibility in connection with other issues, such as climate change and the United Nations Environment Program. Insurers can bring data, expertise on risk management, risk transfer, and claims handling expertise to the table, The State can establish the conditions for a sustainable market in the face of a growing risk. The key to success is partnerships.

AB In 1995, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service adopted a protocol for the adaptive management of waterfowl hunting regulations (AHM) to help reduce uncertainty about the magnitude of sustainable harvests. To date, the AHM process has focused principally on the midcontinent population of mallards (Anas platyrhynchos), whose dynamics are described by 4 alternative models. Collectively, these models express uncertainty (or disagreement ) about whether harvest is an additive or a compensatory form of mortality and whether the reproductive process is weakly or strongly density-depenclent. Each model is associated with a probability or "weight," which describes its relative ability to predict changes in population size. These Bayesian probabilities are updated annually using a comparison of population size predicted under each model with that observed by a monitoring program. The current AHM process is passively adaptive in the sense that there is no a priori consideration of how harvest decisions might affect discrimination among models. We contrast this approach with an actively adaptive approach, in which harvest decisions are used in part to produce the learning needed to increase long-term management performance. Our investigation suggests that the passive approach is expected to perform nearly as well as an optimal actively adaptive approach, particularly considering the nature of the model set, management objectives and constraints, and current regulatory alternatives. We offer some comments about the nature of the biological hypotheses being tested and describe some of the inherent limitations on learning in the AHM process.

AB To what extent can external technical assistance develop the capacity or counterparts, whether in government or in local nongovernmental organizations (LNGOs) in an aid-dependent economy? Cambodia's experience since 1993 suggests that most projects in such a situation are donor-driven in their identification, design and implementation, to the detriment of capacity development. Connected with this is the chronic underfunding of government in such an economy, which hinders implementation of projects and threatens post-project financial sustainability. Unless donors develop a coherent strategy (rather than competitive, project-related salary supplementation) to deal with this situation, the record of technical assistance in developing capacity will continue to be disappointing, and an escape from aid dependence will be postponed.

SO WORLD DEVELOPMENT

ID ECONOMIC TRANSITION; COST
AB Reallocation of agricultural labor during transition differs widely between regions and countries. Our analysis shows that agricultural labor reallocation in Poland is determined by: (a) the dramatic adjustment of prices and production costs caused by price liberalization and subsidy cuts; (b) regional differences in farm organization and the impact of institutional reforms on these organizations; (c) structural problems constraining intersectoral mobility. The latter limit the benefits from the institutional reforms. Long-term efficiency gains and sustainable rural development are conditional upon reducing such structural constraints and improving the functioning of the labor market.

AB Steady-state trophic flow models of four benthic communities (seagrass, sand-gravel, sand and mud habitats) were constructed for a subtidal area in Tongoy Bay (Chile). Information of biomass, catches, food spectrum and dynamics of the commercial and non-commercial populations was used and the ECOPATH II software of Christensen and Pauly [Ecol. Modell. 61 (1992a) 169] was applied. The sea star Meyenaster gelatinosus and the crabs Cancer polyodon, C. porteri and Paraxanthus barbiger were found to be the most prominent predators in the benthic system. The scallop Argopecten purpuratus as well as other bivalves represented the principal secondary producers in the seagrass, sand-gravel and sand habitats, while the Infauna dominated the mud habitat. The highest total biomass and system throughput (33579.3 t/km(2)/year) was calculated for the sand-gravel habitat. The sand habitat had a negative net system production due to the amount of primary production imported from deeper waters to satisfy the food requirements of the large beach clam (Mulinia sp.) populations. The mean trophic level of the fishery varied between 2.06 (sand-gravel) and 3.92 (sand) reflecting the fact that the fishery concentrates on primary producers (i.e. algae and filter feeding), and on top predators (i.e. snails and crabs). Fishery is strongest in sand-gravel habitat, where annual catches amount to 122.05 g/m(2). Low values of the relative Ascendency (A/C) (from 27.4 to 32.7%) suggest that the systems analysed are immature and highly resistant to external perturbations. Manipulations of the input data for the exploited species suggest that seagrass and sand-gravel habitats have a potential for a similar to 3 times higher than the present production of scallops and the red algae Chondrocanthus chamissoi. Preliminary results of Mixed Trophic Impacts (MTI) analysis suggest that any management policy aimed at a man-made increase in the standing stocks of A.

AB Waste disposal practices associated with military production of weapons, especially before and during World War 11, have resulted in significant contamination of soils and ground water with high explosives such as TNT, RDX and HMX. Development of remediation and risk management strategies for these contaminated sites as well as development of approaches for sustainable use of active training and weapons testing sites require an understanding of how the energetic compounds interact with the environment. Factors affecting leaching and transport, microbial degradation, phytotoxicity and plant uptake, and invertebrate and vertebrate toxicity are determinants of ultimate environmental fate and hazard potential. In this article, we will summarize our current understanding of these interactions, identify significant data deficiencies, and briefly discuss the drivers of future research in this area.

AB Long term growth and well being of the chemical industry requires economically and ecologically conscious process engineering. Traditional process engineering methods fall short of meeting this need due to their treating the environment as being secondary to economic objectives. Life cycle assessment and design methods broaden the scope of traditional methods, but focus primarily on the environmental impact of emissions while ignoring the contribution of ecological products and services. Taking nature for granted could provide misleading results since natural products and processes are a significant contributor to all industrial products and processes. Methods from systems ecology do account for ecological inputs, but ignore the impact of emissions. This paper presents an original approach for the joint analysis of industrial and ecological systems. This approach considers inputs from both ecological and economic resources, as well as the impact of emissions. It uses thermodynamics to exploit the synergy between methods from process systems engineering, systems ecology, and life cycle assessment to overcome the shortcomings of methods from each field. The approach is based on the fact that growth and sustenance of both industrial and ecological processes are limited by the available energy and its conversion to useful work. Thus, the embodied energy (emergy), that is, the energy used directly or indirectly to make a product or service is a thermodynamic measure of ecological investment or cost, while exergy loss provides a holistic measure of the impact of emissions. Together, emergy and exergy analysis can provide insight into the environmental performance and sustainability of the industrial process or product. The proposed framework is broadly applicable to assist decision making in chemical and other engineering tasks, Challenges and research opportunities for making this framework practical are identified.

AB Sustainability and sustainable development are catchwords that dominate today's environmental science and policy discourse. It is easy to demonstrate that most of the activities of today's industrial society are unsustainable. Unfortunately, much of the talk about sustainability lacks a basic understanding of what truly sustainable activity would be. To set sustainability as a target or goal for our industrial society, we must be able to quantify that target or goal. We propose four basic steps to begin this process for one aspect of sustainability, the rate of use of resources: (i) establish the available supply of the chosen resource; (ii) allocate the annual permissible supply according to a reasonable formula or market process; (iii) establish the recaptureable" resource base; and (iv) derive the sustainable limiting rate of use and compare to the current rate of use. We apply these sustainability measurement methods to three common materials in industrial society: zinc, germanium, and greenhouse gases. These examples demonstrate that with some basic (although potentially controversial) assumptions, quantitative sustainable use goals can be set and current performance relative to those goals can be evaluated. The assumptions and approximates we have used are meant to stimulate thought and debate, beginning a long conversation on the measurement of sustainability.

AB The rural road network suffers continually from ambiguity. On the one hand, the presence of this network and its traffic flows offer accessibility and make a contribution to economic development. While on the other. its presence and its traffic flows cause fragmentation. The actual ecological impact of this fragmentation depends on several variables such as species and road characteristics. This paper focuses on minor rural roads. The spatial concept developed to address this, 'traffic calming rural area' (TCRA) is intended to address both accessibility and sustainable environment. It does this by concentrating the current diffuse traffic flows on a few rural highways, thus, creating rural residential areas within the region. This paper presents some formulae to quantify the resulting fragmentation. A more practical method compares the sizes of continuous landscape units. Both the formulae and the method have been used for two pilot studies. The results indicate that implementing the TCRA concept leads to larger continuous landscape units, thereby helping to reduce fragmentation effects. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB In The Netherlands. a debate continues to take place on how to allocate the available space among several types of land use. The rural area is under constant pressure from urban developments. Multi-purpose land use is becoming more and more important.
   Land-use allocation problems can be identified as complex planning problems, with a large number of stakeholders involved. Therefore the decisions made with respect to land use must be clear and transparent to these stakeholders. Various methods have been developed to support land allocation issues. Typically, however. the analysis of topological relationships, initiated by biophysical and socio-economic processes, and the spatial configuration of different land uses, is often neglected, especially for agricultural planning. Neglecting the spatial configuration and these relationships can result in spatial fragmentation of land use, thus endangering sustainable land use.
   This paper focuses on a method to address land-use allocation issues where the topological relationships are taken into account. The method is implemented in a Geographical Information System (GIS). Two cases for Dutch agriculture are discussed. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper discusses the modelling of two strategies for conservation planning in human-dominated landscapes: the enlargement of existing reserve sites and the allocation of stepping stones between these sites. We developed two spatial allocation models that plan new habitat according to these strategies, considering simple ecological rules of thumb to meet the requirements for population sustainability and the suitability of the land for competing land use. The model ENLARGE enlarges the existing sites. The model MENTOR modifies the spatial arrangement of patches by adding new patches that may act as stepping stones between reserve sites. These two models result in different habitat configurations. Both the allocation of stepping stones and the enlargement of existing sites provide a higher percentage of occupied habitat. These models may help to address the question under which conditions either the allocation of stepping stones or the enlargement of existing sites is preferred as strategy for conservation planning in human-dominated landscapes.

AB Selecting indigenous mycorrhizal fungi that enhance plant water status is important in Mexico for sustainable production systems of Chile ancho pepper (Capsicum annuum L. cv. San Luis). To determine mycorrhizal enhancement of drought resistance, plants were either non-inoculated (NonAMF), or inoculated with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF): Glomus fasciculatum and a mixed Glomus spp, from Mexico (ZAC-19). Plants were then exposed to a 20-day drought cycle. To equalize growth and minimize tissue-P differences, NonAMF plants received higher P than AMF plants. Drought reduced leaf water potential tissue relative water content (RWC), stomatal conductance (g(s)), whole plant transpiration (mg H2O m(-2) s(-1)), leaf transpirational surface area and plant biomass. Only plants colonized with ZAC-19 had enhanced drought resistance, as indicated by higher Psi(leaf) and fewest plants with visible wilting during peak drought stress. A higher root/shoot ratio occurred with ZAC-19 plants (despite equal total plant biomass among droughted plants), which may have also contributed to drought resistance. Drought enhanced arbuscule formation and hyphae development of ZAC-19, while reducing colonization of G. fasciculatum. Tissue P was not a contributing factor to drought resistance. AMF did not enhance water-use efficiency (WUE) as-determined gravimetric ally on a whole plant basis (g carbon/kg H2O) or by carbon isotope discrimination (Delta). (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Populations of red deer that are limited by food, like those of many other ungulates(1-3), commonly include more females than males(4-7). We assessed the contribution of variation in sex- and age-specific rates of mortality and emigration to density-dependent changes in the adult sex ratio, using long-term observations and demographic experiments involving the red deer population on Rum, Scotland(4,5). We incorporated these effects in a stochastic model of local populations under different management regimes to show here that, when female numbers are allowed to increase to more than 60% of the ecological carrying capacity, the sustainable annual harvest of males from local deer populations will fall. Because males are typically culled by fee-paying hunters and generate more income than females(5,8,9), income will decrease as the male harvest falls. Because numbers of female deer throughout much of the Highlands probably exceed the threshold at which male density starts to be affected(5), many managers might be able to raise income from local deer populations by reducing female numbers, with potential benefits to the vegetation of Scottish Highland environments(10).

AB In the southern coastal region of southwestern Australia with a Mediterranean-type climate, rising water tables prompted the owner of the farm, 'Laurinya', near Jacup, Western Australia (34degreesS. 119degreesE), to extend small plantings of lucerne near saline streams to large areas of the farm. In recent years, the area under lucerne has increased from 20 to 800 ha. The aim is to ultimately have all pasture on the property as lucerne-based perennial pastures. The lucerne is sown with a no-till seeder in rows 250 mm apart. In two contiguous rows in every five rows, barley is sown with the lucerne to provide protection to the young lucerne plants from sand particles carried by high winds in the sandy-surfaced soils of the region. The barley also provides an income stream in the year of establishment of the lucerne. The lucerne-based pastures are the foundation of a phase-farming system. A period of lucerne varying in length from 2 to 10 years is followed by a cropping phase of 3-10 years. The lucerne pastures are rotationally grazed for 1-2 weeks with 5-6 weeks between grazing. The lucerne provides nitrogen to subsequent crops and assists with the control of volunteer grasses and summer weeds. It also uses water that otherwise would leak past the root zone and lead to rising water tables and secondary salinity. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

ID FARMING SYSTEMS; PROFITABILITY
AB Much of the hoped-for success of deep-rooted perennials in reducing the eventual extent of dryland salinity in Australia will depend on the farm-level economic performance of the available perennial-based farming systems. A diverse range of factors contributes to this economic performance, including short-term production-related issues, dynamic factors, sustainability factors, risk factors and whole-farm factors, Although some examples of profitable perennial-based farming systems can be identified, they are limited to particular niches in particular regions, which tend to be higher rainfall regions. For the great majority of land that is at risk of salinisation, no profitable perennial plant options are currently available, The benefits of perennials for on-farm salinity prevention are likely to be of secondary importance in determining their economic attractiveness to farmers. A case study is presented for lucerne (Medicago sativa L.) in the southern region of Western Australia. Lucerne appears likely to be profitable in suitable environments, even without considering salinity-related benefits. However, further improvements to its economic performance are needed if it is to be adopted voluntarily on a scale that would address the bigger, catchment-level problems such as river salinity and flooding risk. Policy implications of these findings are discussed. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Crop production has increased in the high rainfall (400-700 mm annual rainfall) areas of southwestern Australia in response to prolonged poor prices for wool relative to improvements in grain production technology and a desire by farmers to diversify their enterprise mix. The paper defines the higher rainfall region and suggests that approximately 70% of the area is potentially arable. Economic analysis indicates that for a range of grain and wool prices, profitability is maximised if 20-40% of the farm is cropped. So, cropping is likely to remain an important part of the farming system in this region.
   In southwestern Australia, water draining below the root zone causes saline groundwater to rise and leads to the development of dryland salinity. It is, therefore, important to develop cropping systems that minimise leakage of water past the root zone. The paper concludes that 30% of the farm needs to be in perennial pasture such as lucerne to minimise deep drainage. A rotation of 3 years of lucerne and 3 years of crop over 60% of the farm would meet this target and allow up to 30% of the farm to be cropped.
   The strategic introduction of trees in cropped areas increases the potential arable area that can be in crop without a rise of salinity. It is concluded that with careful arrangement of annual crops with perennial vegetation, sustainable crop production is achievable in the high rainfall areas of southwestern Australia.

AB In this study, we investigate a central tenet of the resource-based view of the firm-that tacit knowledge often lies at the core of sustainable competitive advantage-and attempt to articulate it with greater theoretical precision than has been done previously. Using data from the National Basketball Association, we find support for a predicted positive relationship between shared team experience and team performance that declines as shared experience grows, eventually becoming negative. The implications of this study for non-sports-related firms are discussed along with suggestions for future research.

AB Sulphur (S) cycling and implications on S fertilizer requirement in sheep-grazed pastures receiving three levels of S fertilizer at rates of 0, 30 and 60 kg S/hm(2) in 1995 and 1996 were studied using a mass-balance approach which accounted both for S inputs to and outputs from the soil-plant-animal system. Results indicated that S fertilizer increased by 50% of herbage S uptake and 15% or more of S bio-cycling rate in grazing system. The total S recovery of 30 and 60 kg S/hm(2) treatments from 1995 to 1996 was 74.0% and 37.6% respectively. Mineralization of organic S may be an important source of S for pasture when other S sources are low, accounted for 70% of die total S inputs without S fertilizer. The grazing sheep has all important ecological function, the feature of S cycling in grazed pastures was that 90% of herbage S ingested by grazing sheep was returned to soils as excreta. The amount of S released by sheep excreta accounted about 30% of the total released S through S bio-recycling. Loss from soil S leaching beyond the major plant ranting zone was die main S output from grazing system. However, urinary and fecal S losses, including transfer and leaching losses, also affected S budgets of grazing system. It is therefore important to investigate the recycling rate of both urinary and fecal S under field conditions. Based on the mass-balance principle, at least 10 kg S/hm(2) per year may be necessary for Sustainable development of grazing system.

AB The natural systems agriculture (NSA) idea was developed at The Land Institute in 1977 and was published in 1978. Less than 20 years later, research efforts at The Land Institute and by other researchers familiar with research questions had satisfactorily answered the difficult biological questions launching the possibility of a new agricultural paradigm toward fruition. This new paradigm features an ecologically sound perennial food-grain-producing system where soil erosion goes to near zero, chemical contamination from agrochemicals plummets, along with agriculture's dependence on fossil fuels. NSA is predicated on an evolutionary-ecological view of the world in which the essential's for sustainable living have been sorted out and tested in nature's ecosystems over millions of years. From numerous studies, evolutionary biologists and ecologists have learned much about how ecological bills are paid by ecosystems which hold and build soil, manage insects, pathogens and weeds. A primary feature of NSA is to sufficiently mimic the natural structure to be granted the function of its components. Domesticating wild perennials and increasing seed yield and at the same time perennializing the major crops to be planted as domestic prairies is a major goal. For the first time in 10,000 years, humans: can now build an agriculture based on nature's ecosystems. As a prototype this means we explore in-depth how the never-plowed native prairie works and then develop a diverse, perennial vegetative structure capable of producing desirable edible grains in abundance including perennializing the major grain crops. A paradigm shift of relatively easily manageable proportions is available to solve the problem of agriculture and is antithetical to solving problems in agriculture. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Interest in the quality and health of soil has been stimulated by recent awareness that soil is vital to both production of food and fiber and global ecosystems function. Soil health, or quality, can be broadly defined as the capacity of a living soil to function, within natural or managed ecosystem boundaries, to sustain plant and animal productivity, maintain or enhance water and air quality, and promote plant and animal health. Soil quality and health change over time due to natural events or human impacts. They are enhanced by management and land-use decisions that weigh the multiple functions of soil and are impaired by decisions which focus only on single functions, such as crop productivity. Criteria for indicators of soil quality and health relate mainly to their utility in defining ecosystem processes and in integrating physical, chemical, and biological properties, their sensitivity to management and climatic variations, and their accessibility and utility to agricultural specialists, producers, conservationists, and policy makers. Although soils have an inherent quality as related to their physical, chemical, and biological properties within the constraints set by climate and ecosystems, the ultimate determinant of soil quality and health is the land manager. As such, the assessment of soil quality or health, and direction of change with time, is the primary indicator of sustainable management. Scientists can make a significant contribution to sustainable land management by translating scientific knowledge and information on soil function into practical tools and approaches by which land managers can assess the sustainability of their management practices. The first steps, however, in our communal journey towards sustainable land management must be the identification of our final destination (sustainability goals), the strategies or course by which we will get there, and the indicators (benchmarks) that we are proceeding in the right direction. We too often rush to raise the sails of our 'technological' ship to catch the wind, before knowing from where it comes or in property defining our destination, charting our course, and setting the rudder of our ship. Examples are given of approaches for assessing soil quality and health to define the sustainability of land management practices and to 'translate our science into practice'.

ID FRAMEWORK
AB Existing definitions of "soil quality" and "sustainable land management" are analysed to derive a procedure for defining land quality (LQ) indicators of sustainable land management. Land - rather than soil qualities are considered to reflect the impact of the climate on soil behaviour. LQ is different for different types of land use and attention is arbitrarily confined here to agriculture. Simulation modelling of crop growth and solute fluxes is used to define LQ as the ratio between a conditioned crop yield and potential yield x 100. The actual agro-ecological condition and its potential, both expressed by LQ for a given piece of land, is considered here as independent input into broader land-use discussions which tend to be dominated by socio-economic and political considerations. Agro-ecological considerations should not be held hostage to actual socio-economic and political considerations which may change in the near future while the LQ has a much more permanent character. The proposed LQ reflects yields, risks of production as simulations are made for many years, and soil and water quality associated with the production process. The latter are expressed here in an exploratory manner for seven tropical soils and in more detail for Dutch conditions in terms of the probability that groundwater is polluted with nitrates, reflecting the most dominant current LQ problem. The proposed procedure requires the selection of acceptable production and pollution risks by the user before a LQ value can be obtained. Existing definitions implicitly emphasise the field and farm level. However, LQ is also important at the regional and higher level which, so far, has received little attention. Then, again, an agro-ecological approach is suggested when defining the LQ as input into the planning process, emphasising not only an independent assessment of the potential for agricultural production, but also of nature conservation.

ID MICROBIAL DIVERSITY
AB In countries around the Mediterranean basin, the degradation of soil and water resources is a serious threat for the human welfare and the natural environment as a result of the unique climate, topography, soil characteristics, and peculiarities of agriculture. The detrimental effects of agricultural practices on soil quality include, erosion, desertification, salinization, compaction, and pollution. The resultant impacts on water resources include pollution due to nutrient and pesticide leaching and intrusion of seawater into aquifers. In order to select the appropriate sustainable strategies for preventing those impacts, research should focus on development of an accurate soil quality monitoring system at multiple scales based on a functional evaluation of soils. The objectives of this work are: (a) to point out the peculiarities of the Mediterranean region; (b) to underline the most important impacts of agricultural practices on soil and water quality, in respect to the above peculiarities; and (c) to propose a simple and cost effective methodology for the assessment of soil quality at a watershed scale, based on zones of specific functional interest. The proposed assessment methodology would provide information about the status of the soil resources, correlate soil quality with management and aid with the development of sustainable management practices.

AB Biological control can contribute to the sustainability of crop/land management systems by reducing the inputs currently derived from non-renewable fossil energy sources. Biologically based technology will have to be developed and gradually integrated into management systems that will include sorne chemicals for a long time to come. A researchable paradigm is presented: using "weed-suppressive soils" for biological Control of weeds in crops. This example requires extensive knowledge of the ecology of soil microflora and how various populations are affected by management strategies. These management strategies are structured to foster microbial populations in soils that will provide timely suppression of early flushes of annual weeds. Biological seed treatments using microbial antagonists will have to be developed to "safen" the crop against the active biological factors in the "weed-suppressive soils". As these and other biological alternatives are adopted, the concept of "sustainability" will move closer to reality. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The maintenance of soil quality is critical to environmental sustainability. Although, several papers have been published on this subject, progress in soil quality monitoring has been slow: Knowledge and assessment of changes (positive or negative) in its status with time is needed to evaluate the impact of different management practices. Selection of key indicators and their critical limits (threshold values), which must be maintained for normal functioning of the soil, are required to monitor changes and determine trends in improvement or deterioration in soil quality for various agro-ecological zones for use at district, national and global levels. Many soil indicators interact with each other, and thus, the value of one is affected by one or more of the selected parameters. Interdependence of pH and nutrient availability, electrical conductivity and infiltration, etc. has been well documented by many researchers. Some researchers have proposed procedures for evaluating soil quality functions by combining and integrating specific elements into soil quality indices. These procedures allow for weighting of various functions, depending upon the user goals and socio-economic concerns.
   Although, selection of soil indicators will vary with societal goals, the followings seem to be suitable indicators for crop production in most cases: organic matter, topsoil-depth, infiltration, aggregation, pH, electrical conductivity, suspected pollutants and soil respiration. Crop yield can be used as an integrator of the foregoing soil indicators. A minimum set of data on soil indicators must be identified to develop meaningful soil quality assessment. Also, monitoring soil indicators needs to set up sampling strategies allowing assessment of changes in soil quality which might be hidden by soil heterogeneity, by seasonal fluctuations or by analytical uncertainties. This paper describes the guidelines that can be followed to identify critical limits for the key indicators and the procedure for monitoring changes in soil quality trend.

AB An understanding of the nature of soils in natural and human influence ecosystems is essential if progress is to be made in the determination and monitoring of soil quality. This paper briefly discuss the changing circumstances which have resulted in the increased awareness of the importance of soil as a key component of both natural and human influenced environmental systems. These changed circumstances and the recognition of the often crucial role that soils play within these systems has resulted in a demand for measures of soil quality, similar to those used in the characterisation of water and air. Whilst it is relatively straightforward to quantify the fitness to breathe of air, or the fitness to drink with respect to water, it is considerably more difficult to identify similar criteria to be applied to soil. In part this arises because of the wide range of uses to which soils are put and in part because of the complexity of the soil system and the possibility that changes in the soil may be slow and possibly only occur when some threshold is reached. The paper stresses that any index of soil quality must consider soil function, and these functions are varied and often complex. A soil which is considered to be of high quality for one function may not be so for other functions. As a consequence there are potentially many soil properties which might serve its indicators of soil quality, and research is required to identify the most suitable. It may also be questioned whether it is appropriate to pursue this notion of a limited number of soil quality indicators. If an indicator is chosen comparisons between sites and results from different investigators are not possible unless the methods of analysis are given. Standard methods of soil analysis must be developed. These standard methods are distinct from national standard values, or indicator values frequently set by national governments or regulatory agencies. The International Standardisation Organisation (ISO) has developed a programme for the development of standard methods of soil analysis across a range of possible properties including visible, biological, physical and chemical properties. If it is decided that soil quality indicators are required and progress is to be made on developing acceptable indicators of soil quality with agreed standard methods of determination there is need for co-operation amongst soil scientists and those involved in determining appropriate and sustainable use of the soil.

AB Development of sustainable agricultural management systems will depend, in part, on the ability to better use renewable resources, such as animal manure, and to synchronize the levels of soil available N with crop plant needs during the growing season. This study was conducted at the US Meat Animal Research Center in the central USA to determine whether differences in electromagnetic (EM) soil conductivity band available N levels over a growing season can be linked to feedlot manure/compost application and use of a green winter cover crop. A series of soil conductivity maps of a research cornfield were generated using global positioning system (GPS) and EM induction methods. The study site was treated over a 7-year period with manure and compost at rates matching either the phosphorus or the nitrogen requirements of silage corn (Zea mays L.). The plot was split for sub-treatments of a rye (Secale cereale L.) winter cover crop and no cover crop. Image processing techniques were used to establish electrical conductivity (EC) treatment means for each of the growing season surveys. Sequential measurement of profile weighted soil electrical conductivity (ECa) was effective in identifying the dynamic changes in available soil N, as affected by animal manure and N fertilizer treatments, during the corn-growing season. This method also clearly identified the effectiveness of cover crops in minimizing levels of available soil N before and after the com-growing season, when soluble N is most subject to loess. The EM method for assessing soil condition provides insights into the dynamics of available N transformations that are supported by soil chemical analyses. This real-time monitoring approach could also be useful to farmers in enhancing N use efficiencies of cropping management systems and in minimizing N losses to the environment.

AB Global freshwater resources are being increasingly polluted and depleted, threatening sustainable development and human and ecosystem health. Utilizing case studies from 4 different watersheds in the United States, Japan, Switzerland, and Brazil, this paper identifies the most relevant sustainability deficits and derives general vectors for more sustainable water management. As a consequence of the demographic and economic developments experienced in the last few decades, each watershed has suffered declines in water quality, streamflow and biotic resources. However, the extent and the cultural perception of these water-related problems vary substantially in the different watersheds, leading to specific water-management strategies. In industrialized countries, exemplified by the US, Switzerland, and Japan, these strategies have primarily consisted of finance- and energy-intensive technologies, allowing these countries to meet water requirements while minimizing human health risks. But, from a sustainability point of view, such strategies, relying on limited natural resources, are not long-term solutions. For newly industrialized countries such as Brazil, expensive technologies for water management are often not economically feasible, thus limiting the extent to which newly industrialized and developing countries can utilize the expertise offered by the industrialized world. Sustainable water management has to be achieved by a common learning process involving industrialized, newly industrialized, and developing countries, following general sustainability guidelines as exemplified in this paper.

AB Background: While the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommends a standing order as the most effective mechanism to increase pneumococcal and influenza vaccination rates, Georgia's Medical Practice Act does not authorize nurses to screen, order, and administer adult vaccines in inpatient settings.
   Methods: The setting was a 1000-bed public teaching hospital in metropolitan Atlanta. A 1-month intervention (INT1) included four wards randomized to intervention or control. A 5-month hospital-wide intervention (INT2) followed INT1. The intervention used was provider reminder with in-service training. Chart review was the measure used. The main outcome was pneumococcal vaccination prior to discharge.
   Results: During INT1, 534 patients (296 intervention and 238 control) were discharged. Of the 534 patients, 475 (89.0%) were African American, 188 (35.2%,) were uninsured, and the median age was 48 (range 19 to 96). Of the 205 intervention patients with vaccine indications and no contraindications, 78 of 205 (38%) were vaccinated compared to 7 of 143 (4.9%) of the control patients (P<0.001). During INT2, 879 patient charts were reviewed. Patient demographics were similar to INT1. However, of 554 eligible patients, 16% were vaccinated, significantly higher than control floors during INT1 (p<0.001). Although nurses initiated the form almost 70% of the time, physicians assessed fewer than 35% of patients with indications.
   Conclusions: Significantly higher proportions of high-risk patients were vaccinated through the use of a preprinted nurse screening and physician order form. However, a significant percentage of patients did not receive the vaccine owing to the physician's failure to order it. In these cases, use of standing orders would have further increased vaccination rates while also promoting a more sustainable program.

AB Sustainable fisheries development requires sound fisheries management. Area licence limitation programmes may form the cornerstone for most tropical multispecies fisheries management programmes. An empirical analysis of Peninsular Malaysian fishing trawlers is used to design an area licence limitation programme that conforms to the multiproduct production technology, and cost and revenue structures to best accommodate condtions of asymmetric information between the regulator and fishing vessels.

AB A model is proposed that can contemporaneously determine the optimum techno-economic working trajectory of any cogenerative plant and achieve the successive thermodynamic and environmental comparison. By means of the introduction of suitable coefficients, based on aspects of an energy and environmental nature, an engineering approach to the concept of sustainable development is provided. Moreover, the model enables the recording, for every technological solution, in optimum running and planning conditions, of the working moments and the load diagrams of the primary engine and of the possible auxiliary boiler. From a study of the results obtained from the application of the proposed procedure to a real case, using plant solutions with differing degrees of technological maturity, it emerged that the analysis of economic convenience, despite often being a decisive factor in the choice of a cogenerative system, does not necessarily provide a complete evaluation of the said system.

AB Field experiments were conducted to examine the effects of organic and synthetic soil fertility amendments on soil microbial communities and soil physical and chemical properties at three organic and three conventional vegetable farms in Virginia and Maryland in 1996 and 1997. Two treatments, including either an alternative organic soil amendment (composted cotton-gin trash, composted yard waste, or cattle manure) or synthetic soil amendment (fertilizer) were applied to three replicated plots at each grower field location. Production history and time affected propagule densities of Trichoderma species which remained higher in soils from organic farms. Propagule densities of Trichoderma species, thermophilic microorganisms, and enteric bacteria were also detected in greater numbers in soils amended with alternative than synthetic amendments, whereas propagule densities of Phytophthora and Pythium species were lower in soils amended with alternative than synthetic fertility amendments. Concentrations of Ca, K, Mg, and Mn were higher in soils amended with alternative than synthetic fertility amendments. Canonical correlations and principle component analyses indicated significant correlation between these soil chemical factors and the biological communities. First-order canonical correlations were more negative in fields with a conventional history, and use of synthetic fertilizers, whereas canonical correlations were more positive in fields with a history of organic production and alternative soil amendments. In the first year, yields of corn or melon were not different in soil amended with either synthetic or organic amendments at four of six farms. In the second year, when all growers planted tomatoes, yields were higher on farms with a history of organic production, regardless of soil amendment type. Alternative fertility amendments, enhanced beneficial soil microorganisms reduced pathogen populations, increased soil organic matter, total carbon, and cation exchange capacity (CEC), and lowered bulk density thus improving soil quality.

AB The availability of energy is not only a political and economic question, but is of vital importance to mankind as a whole. Global challenges therefore require energy policy to be seen not as an isolated national topic but in its European and global dimensions, with the proper responsibilities attached.
   For this reason, an energy policy oriented towards the future and taking into account developments worldwide must be guided by four elementary principles: (1) the requirements of sustainability,
   (2) global and European responsibility,
   (3) ecological and economic efficiency,
   (4) being open to the future.
   This calls upon the government to support the necessary technical progress and innovations in all sectors, create proper framework conditions, and ensure continuous and flexible energy research open to any kind of technology.
   Banning one form of technology, such as nuclear power, is untenable for reasons of economic viability, continuity of supply, and protection of the climate.
   On the whole, a balanced energy mix with all options guided by competition is to be sought. This is true both from the point of view of the international responsibility of Germany and in the interest of securing the role of Germany as an industrial location.
   Against the background of the decisions to be taken at the end of this decade about building new nuclear generating capacity, especially the nuclear option should be preserved.

The possibilities open for national action are determined by the framework conditions of globalization and liberalization, and by the contribution of Germany to the implementation of the sustainability goals.
   Liberal policies take into account the protection of the environment and of the climate. Levies imposed to protect the environment and the climate must serve specific purposes; the present eco-tax has no controlling function whatsoever. Political measures must not seek to impose government conditions, but rather strengthen public awareness of sustainable action.
   Liberal research policy focuses on the four areas of fossil energy sources, nuclear fission and nuclear fusion, renewable energy sources, and new technologies. A balanced energy mix as seen by the FDP constitutes the basis of sufficient, safe, non-polluting, and low-cost energy supply. Nuclear power is, and will continue to be, a component of this energy mix.

TI Morphological variation of the saker (Falco cherrug) and the
   implications for conservation
SO BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION
LA English

DE Arabic falconry; conservation; gyrfalcon; morphology; saker
AB The saker (Falco cherrug) is a traditional and valued bird of Arabic falconry. Harvesting birds from the wild raises questions of its conservation status and sustainability. The external morphology of this species is highly variable and the Arabic system of classification identifies over 11 saker 'types', some of which are more favoured among Arab falconers than others. Our study assessed morphological variation of birds chosen for known natal origin. Although most variation was between individuals-within-regions, the remaining variation in size and plumage characters may be appropriately described as a gradual cline between small dorsally uniform brown sakers from western lowland regions (e.g. lowland Kazakstan, and south-west Russia) to large, dorsally barred russet, dark brown and grey coloured sakers from eastern highland regions (e.g. south-east Russia, Mongolia, and China). Between these extremes exists a plethora of highly variable and contiguous populations. Although preferred falconry types may originate from any of these populations, the preferred 'jarudi' and 'sinjari' sakers from northeastern Altai, Tuva, and Sayan populations, and the large sakers from eastern populations may be over exploited through trapping. The demand for wild sakers, however, may be substituted by an increasing number of captive bred falcons used for Arab falconry.

AB Understanding the spatial and temporal dynamics of desiccation cracks and related hydro-geomorphologic processes is a key component for the sustainable management of water resources in Vertisols. The contribution of shrinkage cracks to infiltration of runoff and sediments was studied during natural and simulated rainfall experiments in Vertisols of the semi-arid plains of northeastern Mexico during the summer of 1998. Surface runoff amounted to 10.7% of the total applied rainfall, but it increased from 2.3 to 18.3% during the first and last applied rainfall. Soil cracks partially filled with transported sediments in surface runoff, but never sealed by swelling or by sedimentation during the sprinkling of 180 mm of rainfall applied in three installments during I wk. However, cracks observed in 1999 closed during natural rainfalls with a total depth of 450 mm, distributed in 10 storms during 3 mo. The development of soil cracks and their contribution to promote short-circuit flow are highly variable processes in tine and space.

AB Soil fauna play a key role in soil fertility and productivity of forest ecosystems and represent an important base of terrestrial food chains. The impact of forest management on soil fauna should be considered when sustainable forest management and conservation of biodiversity are desired. We evaluated the impact of selective cutting and strip clearcutting on soil fauna abundance in a northern hardwood forest of the Lower Laurentians of Quebec. Twelve years after strip clearcutting, the abundance of carabid beetles (Coleoptera: Carabidae), collembolans (Hexapoda: Collembola) and snails (Stylommatophora: Sigmurethra) was greater in the strip clearcuts than the adjacent undisturbed strips. Snails and millipedes (Polydesmida: Polydesmidae) were more abundant in the selective cuts 6 to 8 yr after treatment. Spiders (Arachnida) were the only organism whose abundance was lower in the selective cuts than in the adjacent undisturbed forest. No significant negative effect of the silvicultural treatments was noted for the abundance of other caught organisms. This one-season sampling suggests there are few negative impacts associated with low intensity selective cutting and strip clearcutting on the abundance of soil fauna in this northern hardwood forest stands 6 to 12 yr after harvest.

ID SUBSTANCES; SYSTEMS
AB Extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) are biopolymers of microbial origin and consist mainly of polysaccharides, proteins, lipids and nucleic acids. The EPS mediate adhesion to surfaces and form a hydrogel matrix for biofilms and other microbial aggregates. This matrix can be considered as "house" of the microorganisms which allows for the formation of stable communities ("microconsortia") of synergistic strains and enables them to degrade recalcitrant substances. EPS retain water and prevent desiccation. Cohesion and adhesion are provided by a network of fluctuating adhesion points. External pressure can change the structure from a gel to a highly viscous liquid. Due to their sorptive properties, dissolved nutrients from the water phase are accumulated and increase the survival chances of biofilm organisms in oligotrophic environments. The matrix facilitates gene exchange and regulation processes via signalling molecules. It provides a template for extracellular enzymes and prevents that they are washed out. Thus, it is of great importance for the degradation of solids and particles. Remnants of lysed cells are retained and can be utilized as food source. Thus, biofilms can be considered as a natural example for sustainable use of nutrients. Some EPS are biotechnologically employed as additives for food, drilling fluids and as biosurfactants.

DE children's rights; local communities; Norway; participation
AB As a participant at the UN Conference on Environment and Development in Rio de Janeiro in 1992, Sharon Stephens highlighted her experiences of children's participation at the conference: 'Many of the young people at the conference expressed frustration with the official convention negotiations and felt that, while their presence was desired as a sign of the importance conference organizers placed on the participation of children and youth, in fact their views were not really taken seriously.' Her sensitive observations highlight the importance of analysing discourses on 'children and participation' in a historical cultural context, and question the current, flourishing interest in those discourses. The aim of this article is to contribute to a discussion on how discourses on 'children and participation' are deeply embedded in discursive fields other than children and their rights. Studies of participatory projects in Norway illuminate in particular an interrelatedness between constructions of childhood and constructions of sustainable local communities in Norway in the 1990s.

ID SEVERE RAINSTORM ACTIVITY; SURFACE AIR-TEMPERATURE; NORTHERN INDIA;
   VARIABILITY; FEATURES; ZONES
AB Paralleling the Southern Himalayan Province, the Indo-Gangetic Plains region (IGPR) of India (geographical area similar to6,00,000 km(2)) is very important for the food security of South Asia. Due to numerous factors in operation there is widespread apprehension regarding sustainability of fragile ecosystems of the region. Literature provides detailed documentation of environmental changes due to different factors except climatic. The present study is intended to document the instrumental-period fluctuations of important climatic parameters like rainfall amounts (1829-1999), severe rainstorms (1880-1996) and temperature (1876-1997) exclusively for the IGPR. The summer monsoon rainfall over western IGPR shows increasing trend (170 mm/100-yr, significant at 1% level) from 1900 while over central IGPR it shows decreasing trend (5 mm/100-yr, not significant) from 1939 and over eastern IGPR decreasing trend (50 mm/100-yr, not significant) during 1900-1984 and insignificant increasing trend (480 mm/100-yr, not significant) during 1984-1999. Broadly it is inferred that there has been a westward shift in rainfall activities over the IGPR. Analysis suggests westward shift in the occurrence of severe rainstorms also. These spatial changes in rainfall activities are attributed to global warming and associated changes in the Indian summer monsoon circulation and the general atmospheric circulation. The annual surface air temperature of the IGPR showed rising trend (0.53degreesC/100-yr, significant at 1% level) during 1875-1958 and decreasing trend (-0.93degreesC/100-yr, significant at 5% level) during 1958-1997. The post-1958 period cooling of the IGPR seems to be due to expansion and intensification of agricultural activities and spreading of irrigation network in the region. Lateral shift in the river courses is an environmental hazard of serious concern in the IGPR. In the present study it is suggested that meteorologic factors like strength and direction of low level winds and spatial shift in rainfall/climatic belt also play a significant role along with tectonic disturbances and local sedimentological adjustments in the vagrancy of the river courses over the IGPR.

AB Purpose: Prostate cancer consistently remains a difficult clinical problem. The development of novel therapy strategies for effective control and treatment of prostate cancer is essential. The prostate represents a unique site for immunotherapy, in part because prostate-specific immunity would most probably be without significant long-term sequellae. Antibodies and cell-mediated immunity, induced by either active or passive immunization, represent potential means to specifically target prostate tumor cells.
   Experimental Design: The serum IgG response to cell surface antigens expressed on LNCAP [prostate-specific antigen (PSA)-positivel and PC-3 (PSA-negative) were analyzed in individuals with advanced disease receiving vaccinia- or fowlpox-expressed PSA (v-PSA or f-PSA, respectively) by flow cytometry.
   Results: Sera from all seven patients in a Phase I study of v-PSA, collected prior to the third immunization, reacted with both prostate tumor cell lines. The majority of individuals (n = 12) in a Phase II trial of v-PSA and f-PSA developed sustainable antibody responses to cell surface antigens on the prostate tumor cell lines. The magnitude and kinetics of these responses were dependent on the immunization schedule. Of importance, the baseline serum of only one of nine patients tested had reactivity with nonprostate tumor cell lines. Sera from three normal males also lacked reactivity with prostate tumor cells.
   Conclusions: PSA vaccine constructs are immunogenic and induce antibody responses to a multitude of surface antigens on prostate tumor cell lines by epitope or determinant spreading after stimulation of the immune system by PSA immunization.

AB The sustainable management of forests for multiple uses requires fine-scale resource information for a range of attributes. Remotely sensed imagery, if appropriately interpreted, can provide detailed, quantitative data for deriving forest information. This paper describes the tree identification and delineation algorithm (TIDA), an image analysis toot designed to delineate tree crowns automatically in high spatial resolution digital imagery. The (local) radiometric maxima and minima are the primary image features used for the crown delineation process, being indicative of crown centroids and boundaries, respectively. TIDA was developed for application to imagery of native Eucalypt forests in Australia, and uses a 'top-down' spatial clustering approach involving key steps designed to reduce the effects of crown segmentation. The assumptions and fundamental processes of the algorithm are described, examples of the output and performance considerations are given, and possible limitations are discussed.

AB Sustainable bunting, the extraction of game without reducing its density is a desirable approach to the use of wildlife. Assessment of sustainable extraction in many parts of the world is difficult; it has recently been done by a method proposed by Robinson and Redford (1991): a maximum number of animals that can be extracted per unit area is calculated based on life-history parameters and density estimates. If extraction is higher than that maximum number, it is deemed unsustainable. We extended the method by adding spatial and stochastic components through an individual-based model of a population of female tapirs (Tapirus sp.) and conducted a sensitivity analysis to evaluate the importance of spatial and life-history parameters. Our analysis suggests that spatial factors, such as the shape of the hunted area and the size of the surrounding population, may be important in determining the sustainability of extraction. For long-lived, slow-reproducing mammals such as tapirs, survival to age of last reproduction is the most critical parameter, but the shape of the bunting zone and population density can be critical, especially in unsustainable hunting scenarios. We advocate long-term studies of tapirs to collect information on spatial movements and survival rates that could then be used for development of proper management plans.

ID NEOTROPICAL FOREST; POPULATION-DENSITY; NATURAL INCREASE; INTRINSIC

AB We calculated extraction and production rates of bushmeat species in two main tropical, moist-forest regions, the Amazon and Congo basins. Extraction was estimated from the average number of animals consumed per person per year from anthropological studies that reported animal kills brought into settlements in the regions. W e calculated extraction rates (kg/km(2)/year) for 57 and 31 mammalian taxa In the Congo and Amazon, respectively. We then examined the sustainability of these extraction rates by basin and by taxa, using extraction-to-production (E:P) mass-balance equations. Production (tonnes/year) was calculated as the product of r(max)(the intrinsic rate of natural increase), mammal biomass, and total area of forest in each region. Species exploitation rates at specific body masses were significantly greater in the Congo than in the Amazon. The E:P ratio for the Congo was 2.4, 30 times the Amazon's ratio of 0.081. Thus, Congo Basin mammals must annually produce approximately 93% of their body mass to balance current extraction rates, whereas Amazonian mammals must produce only 4% of their body mass. We calculated sustainability levels derived from Robinson and Redford's harvest model for each taxa. On a basin-wide level, 60% and none of the mammal taxa in the Congo and Amazon basins, respectively were exploited unsustainably. To evaluate the effect of error on the estimates of E:P, we conducted a sensitivity analysis, which suggests that the mass-balance was most sensitive to error in standing stock but that our results are robust. We estimated that over 5 million tons of wild mammal meat feed millions in Neotropical (0.15 million) and Afrotropical (4.9 million),forests annually. Our Congo basin estimates are four times bigger than those calculated for the region by other workers, and we conclude that the current situation of bushmeat extraction in African rainforests is More precarious than previously thought.

AB We study two issues relating to the conduct of environmental policy in developing countries (DCs). First, when faced with a self-financing constraint, should an environmental authority (EA) raise/lower pollution taxes over time or should it run a deficit/surplus? Second, given recent findings about the dynamic inconsistency of optimal environmental policy, should an EA make its preferences about the relative benefits of environmental protection versus production public, or should it keep its preferences private? Our analysis reveals that when faced with a self-financing constraint, it is optimal for the EA to run a deficit/surplus. Second, social losses are lower when this EA keeps its preferences private.

AB Understanding how life histories influence reproductive success under uncertain conditions is necessary to predict population dynamics. For many organisms, protracted reproduction may increase expected offspring recruitment in variable environments, requiring that temporal patterns of reproduction be considered when developing management or conservation strategies. We explored the interrelationships among birth date, production of embryos on nests, survival of larvae to the open-water stage, and survival of juveniles through the first fall and winter of life for bluegill and pumpkinseed sunfish (Lepomis macrochirus and L. gibbosus) in Lake Opinicon, Ontario, during May 1998 through May 1999. Age-0 sunfish were sampled with nesting surveys for embryos, surface tows for free-swimming larvae, and seining/trawling for juveniles. Age of juveniles (days post swim-up) was quantified using otoliths. The abundance of embryos on nests and the density of open-water larvae were unrelated across all dates and sites. Although 40% of larvae had appeared in the open water by 12 June, most juveniles sampled in the fall were produced after that time, suggesting that high mortality of early produced larvae occurred. Larval survival to the juvenile stage was generally unrelated to the abundance of edible zooplankton taxa during swim-up from nests. Larval survival was often highest at temperatures >23.5degreesC. Fall length of age-0 sunfish increased with increasing age. Both age-specific length and mean lengths shifted positively between October 1998 and May 1999, suggesting that growth of all individuals and perhaps selective mortality of small juveniles occurred.
   Although early reproduction may increase sizes reached by fall and thereby improve overwinter survival, early hatched larvae are subject to variable environmental factors that may reduce survival. Late-hatched larvae may reach relatively smaller sizes by fall, but have higher survival probabilities during this life stage. Protracted reproduction appears to be a response to variable environmental factors influencing growth and survival across multiple life stages. As such, all reproducing adults, rather than those perceived to produce offspring during typically favorable times, must be protected from exploitation or other human-induced perturbations.

AB Stochasticities in population dynamics as well as uncertainties in parameters often make it difficult to obtain reliable predictions of future population fluctuations. Here we use a long-term data set to model the fluctuations of a Willow Ptarmigan (Lagopus lagopus) population in Central Sweden, We use this model to examine how different hat-vest strategies affect mean annual yield, and how these results are influenced by uncertainties in parameter estimates. Restricted proportional harvest (each hunter is allowed to shoot only a limited number of grouse per day) gave slightly higher mean annual yields than proportional threshold harvesting (harvesting only a fixed proportion of the difference between the estimated population size and the threshold when this difference is positive). However, variance in annual yield was reduced by restricted proportional harvesting because periods with low population size became shorter. Uncertainties in population parameters did not affect which strategy was optimal although those uncertainties strongly influenced the expected yield and the uncertainties in the hunting statistics. Inaccuracies in population projections are therefore important to estimate and to model when developing sustained harvest strategies for fluctuating populations.

AB This paper studies urban sustainability from the perspective of externalities. We develop a general spatial equilibrium model of a monocentric city, in which two types of externalities occur. On the one hand, pollution in the industrial center leads to a spatially differentiated deterioration of the environmental quality in the residential area. On the other hand, the existence of the city is explained by agglomeration economies, represented as simple Marshallian external benefits in production. We investigate free-market versus first-best and second-best optimal spatial equilibria, and conclude that the pursuit of environmental goals may sometimes come at the expense of reduced agglomeration economies, but may actually sometimes also stimulate these economics.

   empirical evidence from Italy
SO ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS

DE urban growth; urban externalities; urban sustainibility
AB The importance of urban size for urban sustainability is well known it plays an important role in the possibility of shaping the quality of urban living conditions. For this reason. it is important to study urban dynamics in connection with the issue of environmental quality. Moreover. awareness of the existence of cyclical patterns in urban dynamics, which we stress in this paper. can be useful for the formulation of environmental policies enabling a steady state equilibrium to be reached in terms of sustainability by flattening out the cyclical waves. A number of more quantitative models for the interpretation of urban growth has been provided; these models are related to the well-known ecological prey-predator model of Lotka-Volterra, and provide a good interpretative framework of the territorial phenomena, characterised by strong feed-back mechanisms. Recently, a pure economic model, linking the per-capita income and the urban rents has been suggested as a possible interpretative model of urban growth which is characterised by two main advantages: (a) its capacity to overcome some of the limits of the previous prey-predator models, like the necessity to apply the concept of an urban carrying capacity; (b) its pure economic feature. The present paper presents the model and the logic behind it and provides an empirical analysis of the model based on the Italian case. An econometric model is presented on the relationship between urban population growth and urban rent, based on a database of 95 Italian cities in time series from 1963 to 1996: the feedback mechanisms between the two variables emerge. This work represents the first attempt to provide an estimate of the prey-predator model based on real data. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Urban mobility and urban form: the social and environmental costs of
   different patterns of urban expansion

DE urban expansion; urban form; urban sustainability; public transport
AB The question of the environmental or social costs of urban form is increasingly attracting attention in spatial policy, but scientific debate in this field is often marred by prejudices and abstract visions; empirical analyses are very rare. The present study aims at establishing, in the metropolitan area of Milan. whether different patterns of urban expansion could be associated with specific environmental costs-in particular, for land consumption and mobility generation. Different typologies of urban expansion were defined, and an impact index weighting differently journey-to-work trips with reference to mode and time length was built at the municipality level. The statistical analysis confirmed the expected "wasteful" character of sprawling development patterns in terms of land consumption, though suggesting that recent urban development is becoming relatively 'virtuous' with respect to the past. With reference to the mobility generated, higher environmental impacts were proved to be associated with low densities, sprawling development, more recent urbanisation processes and residential specialisation of the single municipalities. Public transport seems to be strongly influenced, both in terms of efficiency and competitiveness, by the structural organisation of an urban area: the more dispersed and less structured the development, the lower its level of efficiency and competitiveness and consequently its share of the mobility market. On the contrary, trip times for private transport appear to be correlated not so much to urban dimension or density as to the presence of recent housing development, indicating the emergence of new models of lifestyle and mobility which are very different from those of the past.

DE urban development; city management; feedback mechanism
AB Cities are complex and dynamic entities. They are also nodes in spatial economic, social and political geographical networks. They are focal points for many of the concerns that underlay current debates about sustainable development. The aim of this paper is to focus on the local environmental effects of urbanization and to consider ways in which they may be effectively treated within the confines of an isolated city context and more generally when urban areas are seen as part of a wider economic system. Particular attention is focused on information systems of all types and on feedback mechanisms (including automatic mechanisms) which help, in particular, the integration of economic and environmental considerations at the urban level. The underlying question being posed is that of deciding on the role that urban indicators (both economic and environmental) can play in assisting to improve the management of cities. The points made are general and conceptual rather than being of a quantitative and empirical nature. There is no effort to try and provide comment on the existing indicators which various urban actors use in their efforts to manage urban affairs. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

DE sustainable city planning; brownfield development; urban area
ID LAND; QUALITY
AB In the context of sustainable city planning, we observe in recent years an increasing policy interest in urban environmental quality management in relation to land use. The potential for sustainable land use solutions in urban areas is often severely hampered by the existence of unacceptably high levels of soil pollution. The present paper aims to identify the critical success factors for an effective clean-up policy for these areas. After a review of issues, backgrounds and prospects. the paper attempts to offer a qualitative impact assessment model, which encapsulates an expert system for brownfield development in relation to clean-up targets for polluted sites. Next, a case study approach to various soil pollution cases in The Netherlands is carried out to test the feasibility of the above-mentioned analytical framework. A subsequent step consists of the use of modern meta-analytic techniques for comparative research and research synthesis in order to trace the drivers of failure or success in brownfield development policy in urban areas. The particular method employed here, rough set analysis, appears to be able to identify the conditions-in terms of packages of drivers-under which such urban policies are likely to be successful.

AB The article represents an attempt to integrate long-term forest ecosystem modelling with modern techniques of exploratory data analysis. The idea of the integration was to build up a prototype system for forestry decision-making at landscape (forest enterprise) level to support the spatially oriented tasks arising from Criteria & Indicators (C&I) of Sustainable Forest Management (SFM). A model test was performed on a small forest plot consisting of various stands (forest inventory compartments) with two scenarios of silvicultural regimes. A combined spatially explicit forest simulation model EFIMOD 2 and the DESCARTES software system designed to support visual exploration of spatially referenced data were used in the experiment. The visualisation of simulation results on a sequence of interactive maps. It also allows direct representation of time series and spatial patterns of forest dynamics in a graphical form, and analysis of the dynamical trends under various silvicultural regimes. The diversity of ecosystem reactions in various stands was explored, and the possibilities for spatial combination of various strategies and zoning of the forest area were tested. We are sure there is a need to create a new, user-friendly modelling system integrating forest ecosystem models with exploratory data visualisation for methodologically easy and expressive decision-making based on expert evaluation and a long-term simulation at the forest enterprise or landscape level.

AB Russias economic adjustment to the fall of communism has been noturiously. troubled, The output recovery since 1998 is widely judged to be fragile. What is less often noted is that Russia is far from unique in its 'transition' troubles. In this paper the main hypotheses put forward to account Cur Russia's transition difficulties arc reviewed in the context of economic change in all ex-communist countries. Accounts relying on (unexplained) mistakes in economic policy arc inadequate. T No accounts may be sustainable in the light of evidence from other ex-communist countries: one based on inherited economic structure and one based on Cultural factors, The latter hypothesis is shown to be susceptible to testing.

DT Article
AB The paper considers the main components of energy policy, in particular the challenges of network security of supply, long-term contracts and the environmental constraints. It is argued that policy should take account of multiple market failures and context dependent. Given energy liberalisation in the 1980s and 1990s, interventions based upon market-based instruments should be given greater prominence. Institutional reform to reflect the shift in focus towards investment in non-carbon technologies and the security issues associated with networks is proposed, notably the creation of an energy agency.

AB In this paper, we analyze the effects of population aging on economic growth and the environment in a two-period overlapping generations model of growth, aging, and the environment. We show that aging may be beneficial to economic growth and the environment under perfect annuitisation, while possibly harmful under imperfect annuitisation. We also discuss the implications of our results for environmental policy in an aging economy.

ID GROWTH THEORY; PRESERVATION; RESOURCES; SYSTEMS
AB The neoclassical economic growth model and its extensions in the fields of environmental economics and endogenous growth theory typically represent welfare as a single argument function of consumption when the models are analytically solved. This simplified welfare specification is narrower than those described in the quality-of-life literature and emphasized by proponents of sustainable development. The purpose of this paper is to analytically solve for the properties of a growth model based on a broader quality-of-life measure. The welfare measure includes two arguments, consumption and the stock of nature capital. This formulation enables an analysis of the consequences of the dynamic tension between conventionally defined economic growth and nature capital preservation. We find that a static model without technical progress yields diverse steady states, stability properties, and comparative statics, while a model with exogenous technical progress exhibits unusual comparative dynamics and balanced growth paths. These unusual outcomes have a number of policy-relevant implications for sustainable development.

AB Populations of endemic soil entomopathogens (nematodes and fungi) were monitored in vegetable production systems incorporating varying degrees of sustainable practices in Fletcher, NC. Two tillage types (conventional plow and disk versus conservation tillage), two input approaches (chemically versus biologically based), and two cropping schedules (continuous tomato versus 3-yr rotation of corn, cucumber, cabbage, and tomato) were employed in large plots from 1995 to 1998. A Galleria mellonella (L.) trap bioassay was used to identify and monitor activity of Steinernema carpocapsae, Heterorhabditis bacteriophora, Beauveria bassiana, and Metarhizium anisopliae populations during the vegetable growing season (April-September). Seasonal detection of entomopathogens was significantly higher in conservation compared with conventional tillage systems. The strip-till operation did not affect levels of detection of S. carpocapsae. Pesticide use significantly reduced detection of entomopathogenic fungi. Type of ground cover significantly affected temperature in the upper 12 cm of soil; highest soil temperatures were observed under black plastic mulch and bare ground, whereas lowest temperatures were observed under rye mulch and clover intercrop. The high soil temperatures associated with certain ground covers may have reduced entomopathogen detection or survival. Although type of tillage appeared to be the primary factor affecting survival of endemic soil entomopathogens in our system, other factors, such as pesticide use and type of ground cover, can negate the positive effects of strip-tillage.

AB Integrated catchment management represents an approach to managing the resources of a catchment by integrating environmental, economic, and social issues. It is aimed at deriving sustainable benefits for future generations, while protecting natural resources, particularly water, and minimizing possible adverse social, economic, and environmental consequences. Indicators of sustainable development, which summarize information for use in decision-making, are invaluable when trying to assess the diverse, interacting components of catchment processes and resource management actions. The Driving-Forces-Pressure-State-Impact-Response (DPSIR) indicator framework is useful for Identifying and developing indicators of sustainable development for catchment management. Driving forces have been identified as the natural conditions occurring in a catchment and the, level of development and economic activity. Pressures include the natural and anthropogenic supply of water, water demand, and water pollution. State indicators can be split into those of quantity and those of quality. Impacts include those that affect the ecosystems directly and those that impact the use value of the resource. It core indicators are identified within each of the categories given in the framework, most major catchment-based management issues can be evaluated. This framework is applied to identify key issues in catchment management in South Africa, and develop a set of indicators for evaluating catchments throughout the country.

DT Article
AB Soil fertility management is considered with respect to its determinants-delimiters (resource-related, biological, ecological, and economic). Four modules are suggested for soil fertility management: spatial and functional structure of an agroecosystem, regulation of interactions within the plant-soil system, system of soil cultivation, and the system of fertilization and plant protection. The fertility management objective is to ensure food security as an essential condition for creating a sustainable society.

AB Society is faced with environmental issues that exceed the level of local governments, but which need to be dealt with at international or even global scales. These issues include nature conservation and management, development of a more sustainable agriculture, effects of environmental pollution, biodiversity, and effects of global change. The development of political and technical protocols necessary to control the future state of such environmental issues requires a detailed knowledge of the structure and functioning of the world's ecosystems. Studies that integrate the interpretation of results from (detailed) community and ecosystem process and pattern studies and that, moreover, include social and economic aspects might be defined as 'integrated ecosystem studies'. Four examples of integrated ecosystem studies are presented, and it is concluded that a full understanding of the contribution of soil zoology to such studies requires detailed analyses of interactions of fauna with other system components. If not, analyses can result in superficial conclusions that possibly underestimate the vulnerability of ecosystems to disturbances or their sensitivity to management.

DE Aporrectodea spp.; competition; earthworms; pastures; southern Australia
AB Pastures in southern Australia are dominated by endogeic earthworms such as Aporrectodea caliginosa (Sav.). Introductions of the anecic earthworm, A. longa (Ude), which is mostly restricted to Tasmania at present, are likely to increase the functional diversity of local communities and thereby enhance plant production and agricultural sustainability. However, the potential impact of A. longa on resident earthworm communities first needs assessing. Glasshouse and field experiments reported here suggested that A. longa can reduce the abundance and biomass of A. caliginosa, but that these effects are likely to be offset by overall increases in worm abundance. There was no evidence to suggest that species richness was reduced by A. longa introduction. (C) 2002 Editions scientifiques et medicales Elsevier SAS. All rights reserved.

AB Permanent grasslands represented a common type of land use in northern Italy traditional agriculture, but its area has been constantly declining over the last 50 years. Three permanent grasslands of the Po valley (northern Italy) were characterized in terms of biodiversity and soil quality and were compared with other agricultural land uses. Two indicators of biological soil quality (BSQ-ar, BSQ-c) were also applied and validated. Results demonstrated the importance of permanent grasslands as biodiversity 'hot spots' within the intensive agroecosystems. The quality of soils was higher in permanent grasslands with respect to the arable lands, as evidenced by the standard soil quality indicators (organic carbon, aggregate stability) and confirmed by BSQ. This research proposes BSQ as a synthetizing soil quality indicator. (C) 2002 Editions scientifiques et medicales Elsevier SAS. All rights reserved.

AB An analytical age-structured production model is used to explore the equilibrium yield-curve properties, and management-related quantities, for the Chilean jack mackerel (Trachurus symmetrieus murphyi) fishery. The objective is to summarize management-related quantities for the jack mackerel fishery according to uncertainties in both the unexploited spawning stock biomass (SO) and the functional shape of the stock-recruitment relationship. The age-structured model includes age-specific weights, selectivity, maturity, and natural mortality rate, which permit yield-per-recruit (YPR) and spawning biomass-per-recruit (SPR) to be determined as a function of the fishing mortality rate (F). Equilibrium yield (Y-e) curves were obtained by combining YPR, SPR and the stock-recruitment (S-R) relationships of Ricker, and Beverton and Holt. The parameters of the S-R models are reparameterized in terms of the unexploited spawning stock biomass (SO) and a factor that permits the slope of the S-R models to be guessed as a function of the unexploited spawning biomass-per-recruit, i.e. SPR at F = 0 (SPRF=0). The Ye curves derived using the Ricker S-R model were slightly symmetric as functions of F and S, while asymmetric equilibrium yield curves were derived using the S-R model of Beverton and Holt. The maximum sustainable yield (MSY), the spawning biomass at MSY (S-MSY), the fishing mortality at MSY (F-MSY), and the fishing mortality at collapse (F-crash) were the management-related quantities, which were analyzed in relative terms (e.g. MSY/S-0). In the case of the Ricker S-R model, it was found that MSY fluctuated between 10.9 and 24.4% of S-0, while F-MSY ranged between 0.8 and 1.6 times the natural mortality rate (M = 0.3 yr(-1)). In the Beverton and Holt S-R model, MSY ranged between 6.2 and 11.5% of S-0, and F-MSY fluctuated between 0.44 and 1.74 times M. The quantity F-crash was about 2.3-2.4 times F-MSY by considering the S-R model of Ricker, but in the case of Beverton and Holt recruitment model F-crash ranged between 2.7 and 9.4 times F-MSY due to the asymmetric yield-curve. The values for F-MSY and F-crash were independent of S-0 for each S-R model, but these mortalities were dependent of the slope at the origin of the S-R relationship. It is now necessary to clarify the shape of the S-R relationship for Chilean jack mackerel because the results were very sensitive to this uncertainty. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB The performance of two new heuristics that combine tabu search with a genetic crossover technique was examined for their usefulness in solving spatially constrained harvest scheduling problems. One heuristic utilized tabu search with I-opt moves and a genetic crossover technique (TS/GA), and the other utilized tabu search with both I-opt and 2-opt moves and a genetic crossover technique (TS2/GA). The heuristics were tested on four problems. Three problems used the simple unit-restriction model (URM) to portray greenup constraints, allowing them to be solved with mathematical programming techniques and thus providing a benchmark to compare against the solutions produced by the heuristic techniques. These were considered hypothetical problems, since the datasets were grids, and the age classes were assigned with three different rules. The fourth problem uses an operational dataset and includes both a maximum opening size constraint, which limits the size of an individual opening, and a maximum average opening size constraint, which represents the greenup constraint contained in the American Forest and Paper Association (AF&PA) Sustainable Forestry Initiative (AF&PA 2000). The greenup constraints contained in these problems accurately portray the greenup constraints facing the forest industry in the United States. For the three hypothetical problems, the TS/GA technique found solutions with an objective function value between 96.6% and 99.1% of an estimated optimal value, and between 93.4% to 94.4% of a relaxed linear programming value. The TS2/GA found better solutions for all three hypothetical problems, with the objective function values between 98.2% and 99.7% of the estimated optimal value and the 96.3% to 97.2% of the relaxed linear programming value. Compared with a general tabu search technique that used I-opt moves (TS), adding the genetic crossover technique resulted in a 2% increase in the objective function value, and adding the 2-opt intensification capability resulted in a further 1.5% improvement. A similar pattern was observed when the problem using the operational dataset was solved. The addition of the genetic crossover technique did not increase the time required to produce a solution to any particular problem, yet the addition of the 2-opt procedure did, TS2/GA required about twice as much time as did TS or TS/GA when applied to the three hypothetical datasets, and 67% more time when applied to the problem using the operational dataset.

AB Conflicting opinions from environmental advocates and economic interests on the best strategy for management of public lands often leaves land managers in a difficult position. Since ecosystem sustainability is in the long-term interest of each group, the establishment of nature reserves could simultaneously address both views. To promote sustainability, fragmentation of existing natural habitats should be avoided, since it is commonly recognized as being disruptive to the species adapted to these habitats. Therefore, when designing an efficient nature reserve, the compactness and contiguity of the land reserved is an essential consideration. A new formulation of the reserve selection problem is presented that explicitly addresses these issues; specifically, the model minimizes a weighted combination of compactness and contiguity measures subject to constraints on the minimal representation of each habitat class.
   Motivated by the ongoing reserve efforts in the large and diverse Klamath-Siskiyou region of southwestern Oregon and northwestern California, common heuristic search techniques are implemented and results compared on various simulated test problems. From these findings a new heuristic is developed that reduces solution time and increases solution quality. When applied to the Klamath-Siskiyou region, results are promising.

AB Changes in management practice are reflected by soil carbon and nitrogen status, in particular by the proportion of soil organic matter (SOM) being easily transformed (active SOM). We describe SOM quality for three management practices, Organic Farming system (OF), Integrated Crop Production (ICP) and pasture sites (G), which intend to achieve sustainable management practice. The experimental sites were conventionally farmed until 1992. SOM quality was examined by describing active SOM pools, such as the decomposed 'young soil organic matter' (YSOM), ratio of microbial biomass carbon (C-mic) to organic carbon (C-org), ecophysiological status of the microbial biomasss (qCO(2)), and the ratio of light particulate organic matter (POM-LF) to C-org. Ratios of soil microbial biomass (C-mic/C-org) and POM-LF (POM-LF/C-org) and the amount of decomposed YSOM were relatively similar to each other, despite differences in management practice and soil texture. Soil microbial parameters (C-mic, C-mic/C-org and qCO(2)) were significantly (p < 0.05) affected by the amount of decomposed YSOM and the silt content in the OF. In the ICP, soil microbial parameters depended only on the amount of decomposed YSOM, which was considered to be a consequence of the more heterogeneous texture at the OF-sites. Management effects were detectable for no-tillage in the ICP leading to an accumulation of active SOM in the surface soil (0-10 cm). The ratio POM-LF/C-org showed no difference between G and OF despite markedly higher C-org-contents at the G-sites. Conclusively, all methods used indicate comparable SOM qualities for the three management systems, despite differences in soil texture and soil management during 7 years. Management practices seem to be well adapted to the site conditions. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

   organic farming system (OF)
ID TRANSPORT; SOIL
AB Modern agricultural production systems need to reduce their environmental contamination potential. Within the test site of the FAM Research Network on Agroecosystems, the existing agricultural system was modified from intensive to sustainable land use practices. The aim of this study was to quantify the long-term effects of these new practices on the surface and subsurface water quality at the Research Station Scheyern in Bavaria, Germany. Nutrient concentrations in soil water and ground water were monitored by soil hydrological stations and in multilevel wells. Water and material fluxes were observed in a brook and in the tile drain system over a 4-year period,
   Nitrate concentrations in soil water were affected by soil types, relief position and fertilization (farming system). Highest concentrations were found in soils under potatoes and integrated crop production (ICP), lowest under organic farming (OF). Since monitoring began in 1994, nitrate concentrations below the root zone decreased continuously from 25-50 to 5-30 mg NO3- l(-1). Temporal variable concentrations within the root zone were stabilized by plant uptake and lateral subsurface flow in deeper soil horizons. Lower material inputs to soils were confirmed by decreasing nitrate and chloride concentrations in drain water and diffuse lateral input to the Brook West. Nitrogen loading into the brook decreased up to 50% whereas in the upper regional ground water, values greater than 50 mg NO3- l(-1) still reflect former nutrient loads. Surface water phosphorous load was also strongly affected by agricultural practice. The lateral inputs area into the brook from the farm showed that phosphate loading decreased up to 25% (from 0.37 to 0.09 kg P ha(-1) a(-1)). However, concentrations of dissolved reactive ortho-phosphate (DRP) remained high, due to remobilization from the brook's sediment. Our results have shown that adapted land use practice can reduce groundwater and surface water loads effectively. The anti-erosion program (mulching, minimum tillage, fallow strips and others) minimized lateral loads to the surface water and optimized fertilization and intercropping, whereas ecofarming mainly reduced the leakage potential of soils. The slow response in the groundwater is strongly affected by the mean transit time, whereas lateral subsurface flow and buffering effects of soils and sediments determine the dynamics within brooks and ponds.

AB Top-down control is an important type of interspecies interactions in food webs. It is especially important for aquatic ecosystems. Phytoplankton grazers contribute to the top-down control of phytoplankton populations. The paper is focused on the role of benthic filter feeders in the control of plankton populations as a result of water filtering and the removal of cells of plankton from the water column. New data on the inhibitory effects of surfactants and detergents on benthic filter-feeders (Unio tumidus, U. pictorum, Mytilus galloprovincialis, M. edulis and Crassostrea gigas) are presented and discussed. Importance and efficiency of that approach to the problems of eutrophication and water self-purification is pointed out. Chemical pollution may pose a threat to the natural top-down control of phytoplankton and water self-purification process. The latter is considered an important prerequisite for sustainable use of aquatic resources.

AB This paper attempts to clarify key biophysical issues and the problems involved in the ethics of socio-ecohydrological catchment management. The issue in managing complex systems is to live with unavoidable change while securing the capacity of the ecohydrological system of the catchment to sustain vital ecological goods and services, aquatic as well as terrestrial, on which humanity depends ultimately. Catchment management oriented to sustainability has to be based on ethical principles: human rights, international conventions, sustaining crucial ecological goods and services, and protecting ecosystem resilience, all of which have water link-ages. Many weaknesses have to be identified, assessed and mitigated to improve the tools by which the ethical issues can be addressed and solved:
   a heritage of constraining tunnel vision in both science and management',
   inadequate shortcuts made in modern scientific system, analyses (e.g. science addressing sustainability issues),
   simplistic technical-fix approaches to water and ecosystems in I and/water/ecosystem management,
   conventional tools for evaluation of scientific quality with its focus on "doing the thing right" rather than "doing the right thing". The new ethics have to incorporate principles that, on a catchment basis, allow for proper attention to the hungry and poor, upstream and downstream, to descendants, and to sites and habitats that need to be protected.

AB The steady-state First-order Acidity Balance (FAB) model for calculating critical loads of sulphur (S) and nitrogen (N) is applied to 609 Norwegian soft-water lakes to assess the future nitrate (NO3-) leaching potential under present (1992-96) S and N deposition, The lakes were separated into five groups receiving increasing levels of N deposition (<25, 25-49, 50-74, 75-99 and 100-125 meq m(-2) yr(-1)). Using long-term sustainable N sink rates presently recommended for FAB model applications, N immobilisation, net N uptake in forests, denitrification and in-lake N retention were estimated for each group of lakes. Altogether, the long-term N sinks constituted 9.9 +/- 3.2 to 40.5 +/- 11.4 meq m(-2) yr(-1) in the lowest and highest N deposition categories, respectively. At most sites, the current N deposition exceeds the amount of N retained by long-term sustainable N sinks plus the NO3- loss via the lake outlets. This excess N, which is currently retained within the catchments may, according to the FAB model, leach as acidifying NO3- in the, future. If these predictions are fulfilled. NO; leaching at sites in the various N deposition categories will increase dramatically from present (1995) mean levels of 1-20 meq m-2 yr-1, to mean levels of 7-70 meq m(-2) yr(-1) at future steady state. To illustrate the significance of such an increase in NO; leaching, the mean Acid Neutralising Capacity (ANC) at sites in the highest N deposition category may decrease from -18 +/- 15 mueq L-1 at present, to -40 +/- 20 mueq L-1. Under present S and N deposition levels, the FAB model predicts that 46% of the Norwegian lakes may experience exceedances of critical loads for acidifying deposition, In comparison, the Steady-State Water Chemistry model (SSWC), which considers only the present N leaching level, estimates critical load exceedances in 37% of the lakes under the same deposition level. Thus far, there are great uncertainties regarding both the time scales and the extent of future N leaching, and it is largely unknown whether the FAB model predictions will ever be fulfilled. Hence, long-term monitoring and further studies on N immobilisation processes under varying N deposition levels and ecosystem types seem necessary to maker better predictions of future NO3- leaching.

AB Core competencies are the crown jewels of a company and, therefore, should be carefully nurtured and developed. Companies can determine their future business directions based on the strengths of competencies. However, because generalized terms such as resource, asset, capability, and competence are not clearly explained in connection with competence theory, these posing difficulties in understanding many contemporary management concepts.
   In this paper, we provide a summary of the recent management theories by comparing their salient features. We then propose a linking mechanism between assets, resources, capabilities, competencies, and core competencies. We provide a methodology to identify core competencies by isolating unique and flexible capabilities of the firm. We use this framework to identify the core competencies of a U.K. manufacturing company. The results of our analyses is to help the company to make more informed strategic management decision regarding capability development, outsourcing, focusing, or diversification, with regards to new products, services, or markets. The framework is generic in nature and is applicable to benchmark a manufacturing, public, or service sector organization.

AB This paper describes the prevailing problems pertaining to oral care in non-established market economy (non-EME) countries. The current situation with large numbers of untreated cases of oral diseases, the inequality in delivery systems and the virtual non-existence of an adequate community oriented prevention calls for action. What is needed is a turn towards an oral care system that meets the principles of primary health care (PHC). This implies an oral health care system which makes use of the existing health care infrastructures and which applies an appropriate technology with emphasis on community oriented prevention directed to all at an affordable price. Four components of oral care are proposed as priorities in basic oral care, aiming to achieve the objectives of the PHC philosophy. These four components are: emergency care; exposure to fluoride; oral health education (OHE); atraumatic restorative treatment (ART). These components should be available for all. The exact content and extent of each component in various countries depends on local existing supporting conditions and on the level of development as well as on specific perceived needs of the population. Therefore, small-scale demonstration projects containing one or more of the described components should firstly be launched in various countries to evaluate the acceptability, effectiveness and sustainability of the proposed basic oral care programme.

AB In 1990, the Fast Track Project was initiated to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of a comprehensive, multicomponent prevention program targeting children at risk for conduct disorders in four demographically diverse American communities (Conduct Problems Prevention Research Group [CPPRG], 1992). Representing a prevention science approach toward community-based preventive intervention, the Fast Track intervention design was based upon the available data base elucidating the epidemiology of risk for conduct disorder and suggesting key causal developmental influences (R. P. Weissberg & M. T. Greenberg, 1998). Critical questions about this approach to prevention center around the extent to which such a science-based program can be effective at (1) engaging community members and stakeholders, (2) maintaining intervention fidelity while responding appropriately to the local norms and needs of communities that vary widely in their demographic and cultural/ethnic composition, and (3) maintaining community engagement in the long-term to support effective and sustainable intervention dissemination. This paper discusses these issues, providing examples from the Fast Track project to illustrate the process of program implementation and the evidence available regarding the success of this science-based program at engaging communities in sustainable and effective ways as partners in prevention programming.

AB International government and corporate corruption is increasingly under siege. Although various groups of researchers have quantified and documented world-wide corruption, apparently no one has validated the measures. This study finds a very strong significant correlation of three measures of corruption with each other, thereby indicating validity. One measure was of Black Market activity, another was of overabundance of regulation or unnecessary restriction of business activity. The third measure was an index based on interview perceptions of corruption (Corruption Perceptions Index or CPI) in that nation. Validity of the three measures was further established by finding a highly significant correlation with real gross domestic product per capita (RGDP/Cap). The CPI had by far the strongest correlation with RGDP/Cap, explaining over three fourths of the variance. Corruption is increasingly argued to be a barrier to development and economic growth. Business students often do not see ethics courses as being as relevant as other value-free disciplines or core courses. The data in this study suggests otherwise. Sustainable economic development appears very dependent on a constant, virtuous cycle that includes corruption fighting, and the maintenance of trust and innovation, all reinforcing each other.

AB This article clarifies the relationship between profits and principles by distinguishing four alternative perspectives: the win- win perspective in which ethical behaviour generates the highest profits; a licence-to-operate perspective in which a minimum ethical performance is required to receive legitimation from the society; an acceptable profits perspective, in which an acceptable profitability is required to assure the financial continuity; and an integrated perspective. These four perspectives are illustrated by statements from Shell reports and from interviews with managers of a large European retail company.

ID LIQUIDITY CONSTRAINTS; CONSUMPTION
AB The empirical failure of the Permanent Income Hypothesis has prompted researchers to investigate models in which consumers are 'liquidity constrained'. As shown in Deaton (Econometrica 59(5) (1991) 1221), 'liquidity constrained' consumers might choose to exhaust their borrowing capacity from time to time. Yet, due to technical limitations, the conditions under which this behavior arises have not been investigated. The present paper extends the class of solvable models in a way that allows this issue to be dealt with. It turns out that under the loosest sustainable borrowing constraint, the agent might systematically avoid exhausting his borrowing capacity. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a major global health concern and is the most common cause of chronic liver disease worldwide. The natural history and clinical outcomes of chronic HBV infection are determined by the viral replication cycle and the host immune responses. Treatment of chronic hepatitis B is directed at interrupting the natural history by suppressing HBV replication before development of any significant irreversible liver cell damage. Effective antiviral therapies should be followed by sustained suppression of HBV-DNA, normalization of transaminases levels and a stable stage of HBeAg seroconversion with persistence of circulating anti-HBeAg antibodies. Two major classes of antiviral therapeutic agents that have been approved for treatment of chronic hepatitis B are immunomodulating agents (i.e. interferon) and the nucleoside analogs (i.e. lamivudine). A 4-6 month course of interferon-alpha has resulted in improvement of survival in 20%-30% of patients with chronic hepatitis B who had elevated serum ALT levels without hepatic decompensation. Interferon-alpha therapy is associated with HBeAg seroconversion; normalization of ALT levels, reduced hepatic inflammation, and possibly reduced disease progression to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Interferon can also be used with caution in patients with early compensated cirrhosis. A 12-month course of lamivudine has been shown to be well tolerated and effective. Lamivudine can be used in decompensated cirrhosis and immunosuppressed patients and for prevention of recurrent HBV infection after liver transplantation The response rates after 3 years of lamivudine therapy account for 40-65%. A major problem of antiviral treatment is the emergence of drug resistance conferred by mutations in the YMDD motif of HBV reverse transcriptase. The prevalence of YMDD mutations increases with longer durations of antiviral therapies and this has been detected in 20% of immunocompetent patients receiving lamivudine per year. Contentious issues remain when to stop the treatment if HBeAg seroconversion does not occur. Many new immunomodulatory therapies and antiviral agents are in various stages of clinical development and have shown some promise. Among newer HBV antivirals, adefovir dipivoxil, entecavir, emtricitabine, DAPD and clevudine appear to be at least as potent as lamivudine in suppressing HBV replication. In vitro studies have shown that YMDD mutations confer cross-resistance between lamivudine and emtricitabine. However, adefovir, dipivoxil, lobucavir, DAPD and possibly clevudine suppress replications of both YMDD mutants and wild types of HBV. Immunomodulatory approaches for treatment of chronic hepatitis B are conceptually attractive, but newer agents used to date (thymosin-alpha, interleukin-12, therapeutic vaccines) have not demonstrated sufficient efficacy for widespread use. Combinations of an immunomodulatory agent and nucleoside analog may improve the therapeutic efficacy and reduce the emergence of drug resistance. Nevertheless, combinations of interferon and lamivudine therapies do not confer such additional benefits. The next challenge for HBV treatment is to use antivirals in combination and/or in cyclical therapy to minimize the emergence of drug resistance and increase efficacy, particularly to achieve sustainable post-treatment suppression of HBV. Randomized prospective control trials of combined antiviral therapies given simultaneously or sequentially are needed to establish safe and effective combined regimens that can be recommended for future treatment strategies.

TI Taking the future seriously: On the inadequacies of the framework of
   liberalism for environmental education
SO JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY OF EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
AB International reports on environmental policy promote 'education for sustainable development' as an instrument for realising environmental awareness, values and attitudes consistent With the liberal concept of 'sustainable development'. In this paper the ethical and political-philosophical assumptions of (education for) sustainable development will be criticised. First, it will be argued that (Rawlsian) liberal ethics cannot include obligations towards future generations. Second, the commentary focuses on the economic perspective underlying this liberal framework, its anthropocentric bias and the hierarchical distinction between public and private spheres. Third, to offer a more adequate framework for environmental education, some fruitful ideas within neo-republicanism will be examined.

TI The economic issues of agricultural natural resources and environment in
   Vietnam
SO JOURNAL OF THE FACULTY OF AGRICULTURE KYUSHU UNIVERSITY
LA English
DT Article
AB The Vietnamese economy has undergone great changes in the last two decades, particularly since the implementation of the "doi moi" (renovation) reform in 1986. Positive achievements include the national GDP growth rate of 7.8% and agricultural GDP growth rate of 5.4% per annum, the increase of foreign investment and improvement of people's living standard. However, like many other developing countries, Vietnam is currently facing serious problems because of the degradation of its naturals resources and resulting decline in environmental quality. Water and air pollution, deforestation, degradation of land resources, soil erosion, over-exploitation of natural resource, threats to ecosystems and depletion of genetic resources are among the most alarming challenges! The strategy for sustainable agricultural development in accompanies with environmental protection of Vietnamese Government includes issues as follows: 1) Protecting and improving the environmental quality. 2) Protecting the natural resource., 3) Strengthening management capacity for agricultural environment. 4) Ensuring the safe water supply and rural environmental sanitary. 5) Preventing and resolving the pollution in agriculture and other industries in rural areas. 6) Developing the economic-ecological farm models.

AB The extreme shortage of public water supplies in most countries of the Middle East has steadily commanded a great political importance. Regional disputes over the riparian rights relevant to the it is opportune to plan transboundary surface and groundwater resources are imminent. Therefore, for feasible, affordable, and sustainable measures such as conservation, wastewater reclamation, artificial recharge, and particularly utilization of deep groundwater and submarine springs. Chekka Bay, in the north of Lebanon, is well known for its freshwater springs. A general objective of the study was set at evaluating the feasibility of exploiting the submarine springs in the Chekka Bay taking into consideration the technical, economic, social and environmental aspects of such a project. The study has been subdivided into three parts, namely hydrogeological, marine and socio-economic. Off-shore exploitation of the submarine springs could face implementation problems as it is technically difficult, financially expensive, and yields a qualitatively unacceptable water. A more suitable alternative would be to tap the submarine springs inland through wells of differing depths. The financial feasibility of the latter alternative has been confirmed through a cost-benefit analysis.

TI Adoption and maintenance of contour bunds and hedgerows in a dynamic
   environment - Experience in the Philippine uplands
SO MOUNTAIN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

DT Article
AB The widespread adoption of soil conservation technologies by farmers (notably contour hedgerows) observed in Guba, Cebu City, Philippines, is not often observed elsewhere In the country. Adoption of these technologies was because of the interaction of such phenomena as site-specific factors, appropriate extension systems, and technologies. However, lack of hedgerow maintenance, decreasing hedgerow quality, and disappearance of hedgerows raised concerns about sustainability. The dynamic nature of upland farming systems suggests the need for a location-specific farming system development framework, which provides farmers with ongoing extension for continual promotion of appropriate conservation practices.
