AB Concerns about the ecological and economic sustainability of industrial forestry led to the revival of community forestry (CF) in the developing countries.  Recently, the developed countries are also examining the feasibility of CF as a land management alternative for the similar reasons.  This paper compares the opportunities and challenges of CF in the developing and developed countries.  Particular emphasis is placed on the goals and objectives, participants and beneficiaries, land tenure, size and management, ecology and economics of CF.  In the developing countries CF is generally small, labour intensive and geared to meeting the basic needs of the community people.  By contrast, CF in the developed countries is large, capital intensive and market oriented.  Notwithstanding the differences, CF provides an opportunity for ecosystem management to maintain community stability and ecological integrity in both developing and developed countries.

DE TROPICAL AGROFORESTRY; SUSTAINABILITY; NITROGEN; PHOSPHORUS; ROOT

AB Experiments were established on fertile soil in the humid lowlands of Costa Rica to examine the effects of complementary use of resources between species and stand turnover time on sustainability.  The experimental plantations are dominated by perennial plants of the two most successful life forms in this biome, dicotyledonous trees and self-supporting monocots, and are harvested and replanted at intervals of 1, 4, and 16 years.  Three main categories of responses are under study, including soil fertility, plant-pest interactions, and productivity.  Nitrogen is abundant in the study-site soil; nitrogen mineralization rates are about 0.85 kg ha-1 day-1 and nitrification rates are about 1.0 kg ha-1 day-1.  Phosphorus is also abundant (30 to 70 mug/g, Olsen extractable), and preliminary data indicate that much of the organically bound phosphorus is under microbial control.  Root systems of the three main tree species under study differ greatly, ranging from a dense, compact mass of roots (in Hyeronima alchorneoides) that thoroughly exploit a modest soil volume, to sparse roots that extend very far from the base of the tree (in Cordia alliodora), to massive starch-rich roots that enable the tree to respond to herbivore attack (in Cedrela odorata).

SO JOURNAL OF CLIMATE

DT Article
ID SOUTHERN OSCILLATION; EL-NINO; SIMULATION; RESOLUTION; EVENT; GCM
AB A linear perturbation, coupled ocean-atmosphere model is revisited for further insights into the Fl Nino-Southern Oscillation phenomenon. The model oscillates as a slow, eastward propagating mode interpreted as a divergence mode, whose energetics are controlled by the ocean. Growth requires that the work performed by the wind stress minus the work required to effect the ocean divergence exceeds the loss terms. The intrinsic scale of the atmosphere relative to the basin width is important. For sustainable oscillations, the ocean basin must be large enough so that oppositely directed divergence can develop on opposite sides of the basin. The global aspect of the atmospheric pressure field suggests that continental heating may provide either a direct source affecting adjacent oceans, or a connection between oceans. The important model parameters are the coupling and warming coefficients and the ocean Kelvin wave speed. The importance of the Kelvin wave speed derives from its specification of the background buoyancy state for the ocean. Upon further simplification, an analytical solution gives similar parameter dependence as found numerically and shows that growth requires both large zonal wavelength and a zonal phase lag between the anomalies of wind stress and SST.

TI PROTECTING FOREST RESOURCES - THE NEED FOR EXPERTISE IN PATHOLOGY AND
   ENTOMOLOGY
SO JOURNAL OF FORESTRY
LA English
DT Article
AB Forestry students frequently ask why entomology and pathology are important to a forester's education.  The answer is simple.  Fungi, insects, and other arthropods represent two-thirds of the more than 1.3 million known species.  How can foresters expect to manage an ecosystem if they have little or no knowledge of two-thirds of its occupants?  Forestry students must recognize that the majority of organisms within an ecosystem are beneficial to it; even pests and pathogens serve vital functions.  A forest manager manages an ecosystem to minimize the possibility that pests/pathogens will attain destructive status and thus prevent damage to the overall system.  A thorough grounding in forest entomology and pathology and forest biology is essential to a forestland manager's education, particularly as forestry emphasizes forest health, ecosystem management, biodiversity, and sustainable production of various values.

AB The long-term sustainable management of our forests may be most attainable when we determine their original, natural conditions.  ''Ecosystem management'' is guided by information on spatial variability of forest landscape patterns over time and how human influence has affected that variability.  Such information is critical for developing timber-harvest plans, maintaining biodiversity, and designing future landscapes.  Ecosystem management plans can be developed to maintain and/or create forest landscape patterns within the range of those that existed before European settlement.

AB I studied snow leopards (Panthera uncia) and blue sheep (Pseudois nayaur) in Manang District, Annapurna Conservation Area, Nepal, to estimate numbers and analyze predator-prey interactions.  Five to seven adult leopards used the 105-km2 study area, a density of 4.8 to 6.7 leopards/100 km2.  Density of blue sheep was 6.6-10.2 sheep/km2, and biomass density was 304 kg/km2.  Estimated relative biomass consumed by snow leopards suggested that blue sheep were the most important prey; marmots (Marmota himalayana) also contributed significantly to the diet of snow leopards.  Snow leopards in Manang were estimated to harvest 9-20% of total biomass and 11-24% of total number of blue sheep annually.  Snow leopard:  blue sheep ratio was 1:114-1:159 on a weight basis, which was considered sustainable given the importance of small mammals in the leopard's diet and the absence of other competing predators.

AB As worldwide competitive pressures create the need for metal forming part producers to increase production, many metal forming applications are being increased in production speed, sometimes without full consideration of the potential risks to long term equipment reliability, manufactured part quality, and long term sustainable productivity.  This article discusses several identified ''Dynamic Effects'' phenomena associated with metal forming processes and tooling peripherals, which can create significant increases in the load and vibration levels experienced by the press and dies, and can actually result in loss of productivity, loss of long term reliability, and reduction of part quality, if not carefully evaluated, monitored, and controlled.  This article also suggests how usage of the patented concepts and methods of ''Vibration Severity Prediction and Monitoring'', and ''Metal Forming Process Dynamic Effects Analysis and Monitoring'' can be used for evaluation of both new and existing dies, before they are run at high speeds, thus assuring containment of the dynamic risks, and resulting in attainment of real and sustainable long term press/die reliability, long term productivity increases, and long term part quality improvements.

AB Knowledge about mechanisms of water stress tolerance, growth, and developmen of forages are important in development of management practices and in germplasm improvement.  Plants of crested wheatgrass [Agropyron desertorum (Fischer ex Link) Schultes] and western wheatgrass [Pascopyrum smithii (Rydb.) Gould] were field grown at 3 soil water levels (50, 100, and 150% of average rainfall) and 2 N levels (10 and 110 kg N ha-1) and sampled to determine proline, water soluble carbohydrate, and abscisic acid concentration from about the 4-leaf through heading stages of development.  Proline concentration increased in both species as water stress increased.  Proline decreased in crested wheatgrass but increased in western wheatgrass as plant development advanced.  Abscisic acid concentrations increased in both species as water stress increased.  Western wheatgrass contained about 1.7 times higher abscisic acid concentration than crested wheatgrass.  Carbohydrate concentrations increased with water stress and were higher in crested than western wheatgrass.  Increasing proline and abscisic acid concentrations in western wheatgrass and the decreasing concentrations in crested wheatgrass at later stages of development suggest that the stress response mechanisms that enhance proline and abscisic acid may be more operative in western than crested wheatgrass.  These results suggesting that western wheatgrass is more tolerant of water stress under field conditions than crested wheatgrass should be useful in developing sustainable management practices.  Also, proline concentration changes with plant development suggesting that germplasm sampling should be performed over time.

AB The concept of ''sustainability'' has been increasingly invoked in scholarly and public policy debates. Discussion has been hampered, however, by uncertainty and lack of uniformity in the meaning of sustainability. This paper seeks to identify some common ground among economists, ecologists, and environmental ethicists. Two issues seem salient: requirements for intergenerational equity and the definition of ''social capital'' to be provided to future generations. A concept of ''safe minimum standard,'' which has received at least some recognition in the ecology, philosophy, and economics literatures, may provide the beginnings of a common ground for debate about sustainability.

AB The central message of this paper is that natural forests have multiple uses and multiple users. The paper describes the crisis in Asian forestry and four failures which lie behind the crisis. The first failure is related to economic policy which has consistently underpriced timber, not accounting for the true cost of replacing the felled trees or the value of non-timber goods and services (including environmental services). The second failure stems from the lack of community involvement in managing forests. The third failure is that of forestry institutions which have not been able to adapt to changes required to meet new challenges - away from timber extraction towards environmental services and social forestry. The fourth failure arises from technological constraints, including difficulties in carrying out long-term research (to cover the 20-40 year time horizon in the forestry sector) and ineffective application of research results. A number of specific suggestions for moving toward sustained yield management in Asia are presented. The sustainable management of forests in Asia is crucial not only for indigenous peoples, the environment and economies of the countries of Asia, but also for the biodiversity and health of the global environment.

TI SUSTAINABILITY IMPLICATIONS FOR WATER-RESOURCES PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT
SO NATURAL RESOURCES FORUM
LA English
DT Article
AB Sustainability has proved to be a unifying concept that emphasizes the need for us to consider the impacts of what we do in our generation on those who follow us in future generations.  While we cannot know with certainty what these impacts may be, or what future generations will want or value, we can attempt to include what we think they will want or value in our current planning and management models.  In this way we may at least estimate what they would like us to do today to allows them to better satisfy their needs and desires in the future.  This then becomes a multiple objective planning problem, where if conflicts exist, trade offs can be identified and debated.  This paper presents some approaches for doing this, and discusses how they may be applied in practice in the water resources sector.

TI ENVIRONMENTAL-POLICY FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT OF NATURAL-RESOURCES -
   MECHANISMS FOR IMPLEMENTATION AND ENFORCEMENT
SO NATURAL RESOURCES FORUM
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper describes new environmental policies and expanded administrative agencies which in recent years have been adopted by many governments faced with a continuing decline in the quality of their environments.  In a number of developed and developing countries, devising a far reaching environmental policy for sustainable development of the natural resources sector is a national priority.  Specific environmental policies may be classified according to objectives, timeframe, mechanisms for implementation, whether or not they are binding, and the nature of sanction.  This paper provides some generalizations about certain features common to most environmental policies.  In the first section an examination is made of some of the most pressing problems which environmental policies relating to natural resources seek to address.  The second section discusses environmental policies themselves.  The third section, which makes up the main body of the paper, assesses the strengths and weaknesses of a variety of mechanisms available for implementing environmental policies to promote sustainable development in the natural resources sector.

AB While agriculture made civilization possible, destructive agricultural practices have destroyed many civilizations, making it clear that without a truly sustainable agriculture civilization will not be sustainable.  Neither ''organic'' nor industrial agriculture can sustain civilization on the basis of all evidence before us and thus a new form of agriculture has to be developed.  New discoveries and thinking, in both agriculture and economics, are beginning to point the way to the development of such a new agriculture.

TI SELF-SUSTAINABILITY OF SUBSIDIARY HOUSEHOLD PLOTS - LESSONS FOR
   PRIVATIZATION OF AGRICULTURE IN FORMER SOCIALIST-COUNTRIES
SO POST-SOVIET GEOGRAPHY
LA English
DT Article
AB A paper devoted to subsidiary household (private) plots in the former socialist countries of Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union explores issues surrounding their economic viability during the current period of economic transition and agrarian reform, using Russian farms as the main example.  Considerable emphasis is placed on the continuing strong linkages between subsidiary household plots and the system of collectivized agriculture, one of several factors that serves to differentiate this type of agriculture from the private (peasant) farms receiving so much attention recently as an indicator of agrarian reform.  A key argument of the paper is that the performance of subsidiary household farms is not a good indicator of prospects for success of private farming in Russia, because subsidiary farms are closely linked to collectivized agriculture in terms of sources of inputs and channels for outputs, and therefore are not inherently ''private.''

DE BIOTECHNOLOGY; ENVIRONMENTAL BIOTECHNOLOGY; SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
AB In a number of countries, R&D programmes on environmental biotechnology show a greater emphasis on the development of recycling and prevention techniques than formerly.  Biotechnology is considered as one of the key technologies in reaching a sustainable development within twenty years.  Nevertheless, most countries still consider innovative biological end-of-pipe and remediation techniques worth taking action on.  Especially in this field more cooperation between the different countries could be of mutual interest.  It would make a more soundly based choice of priority research areas possible.  These are the conclusions of a report on a study of international developments in R&D programmes in environmental biotechnology, recently published by the Dutch National Institute of Public Health and Environmental Protection.  The goal of the study was to compare the most important strategies and priority research areas in the different national R&D programmes on environmental biotechnology.  Countries playing a leading role in research in environmental technology were approached in writing and some of them were visited.

TI MANAGEMENT OF THE ZINC CHAIN

LA English
DT Article
DE SUBSTANCE CHAIN; ZINC CHAIN
AB In this study, a substance chain approach as a tool contributing to a sustainable development has been tested by applying it to zinc.  An analysis of the western world zinc substance chain has been made in order to identify the main routes of zinc losses from the chain.  Technologically feasible options to improve the management of the chain have been selected and applied to a modelled chain.  With the emphasis on resource management, the model has been designed to evaluate the impact of options on the input of primary zinc into the chian.  The consequences of the options for the energy resources have been analyzed.
   Redesigning the global zinc chain using the chosen technologically feasible options has lead to a lower primary zinc input when compared to the present chain, but a 45% primary zinc input is still needed, while the improved chain requires 8% less energy.  To obtain a further decrease of primary zinc input in the chain, research should focus on emission abatement during zinc usage, where especially corrosion of galvanized steel forms a problem, and on the prevention of mixed-product waste streams with a low average zinc concentration.  The energy analysis shows that options to improve the zinc chain should be carried out carefully, avoiding extra demands on the energy resources.
   The study indicates that designing a substance chain, along with even simple modelling, results in a good tool to calculate the impact of different kinds of options on the total chain.

AB The three countries that have signed the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) have focused particular interest and concern on the potential impact that this agreement will have on the environmental health, based on the premise that economical development should not detriment neither the environment nor the human health. In this paper, the NAFTA is presented as an opportunity to improve environmental and occupational health in Mexico and assumes that the study of the potential impact of NAFTA could help to find the solutions of the former and actual environmental health problems. From this perspective, the north-border maquila industry is analyzed as a case study for the purpose of identifying and predicting the impact of NAFTA on environmental and the occupational health. Preventive as well as control measurements are suggested. The general characteristics of the U.S.-Mexico border and the maquila industry are presented. The lack of both social investment and urban planification along with population and economical growth are described. An explanation of the impact that these factors have had on the environmental and occupational problems is discussed. Special emphasis is given to the human health problems including that of water, air and soil contamination by industrial toxic residues. Also, some possible health impact of NAFTA are outlined. Finally a sustainable developmental intervention is suggested, based on NAFTA as an opportunity to take advantage of coming structural changes that will improve the environmental health conditions at the northern-border and in the entire country.

TI HEALTH DELIVERY STANDARDS - VESTED INTERESTS IN HEALTH-PLANNING
SO SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
DE HEALTH DELIVERY; HEALTH PLANNING; VESTED INTERESTS; HEALTH CARE;
   COMMUNITY HEALTH
AB The thread of this paper is that vested interests prevail consistently in the formulation of health policy and provision of health services.  Several African countries illustrate how the health care standard becomes an end in itself, however ineffective it becomes as population and needs change.  Policy is not an exclusive prerogative of governments.  Industry of all sorts, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and development agencies use policies to determine, guide and shape investments and, in the case of the private sector, prevail favourably in competition.  With a few exceptions, planners plan to depict and alter a particular situation, to improve conditions according to a particular mode, ideology or belief.  The planner, like the policy maker, assumes that certain changes will occur if certain decisions are made or actions are taken.  In reality, however, policy makers and planners are seldom satisfied with the status quo.
   The policy maker decides on the basis of available information, albeit incomplete or inconclusive, and believes one option is better than another or that it will achieve the desired goal optimally and at least cost.  To formulate policy is to choose a course of action and to plan is to pursue a particular interest.  However implicity, vested interests are entrenched in every policy action.  There seems to be four main, but related reasons for any specific health policy:  availability of adequate health care; equity of access; cost; and effectiveness/relevance of the system under the prevailing technology.  While concerns differ, sometimes quite widely, concern for an effective health system is always paramount.  Less than two decades ago, African countries had more robust economies than they have today.  They developed a sprinkling of health care structures which are no longer sustainable.  The under-served continue to multiply faster than resources so that the need and demand for more and better health care concomitantly follow.  Hospitals require specialized personnel, equipment and higher level drugs that the treasury cannot afford.

AB Newfoundland has historically relied on its natural resources, without broader industrialization.  Exploitation and population growth have now exceeded these resources' sustainable yields.  With fisheries a disaster, and mining and forestry in decline, Newfoundland's government places hope on offshore oil development.  A survey of rural Newfoundland high school students finds that few plan oil industry careers, however.  More often, they expect public sector or service employment.  The profile of oil-interested students resembles profiles of students interested in mining, forestry, and fishing.  Students with college and professional goals do not aspire to resource occupations; instead, many plan to leave Newfoundland.  Students' low expectations regarding resource-sector jobs reflect recent historical experience, but hopes for public-sector employment could perpetuate Newfoundland's economic dependency.  Our data depict an extractive society experiencing early stages of overshoot.  Other North Atlantic societies may be moving in a similar direction.

TI OPTIONS FOR SPACE - PROPOSAL FOR A PROGRAM
SO SPACE POLICY
LA English
DT Article
AB Because of the physical scale of human operations at present, we need to extend them into the Solar System for sustainability and into interstellar space for knowledge.  Stabilizing the population on Earth, as well as reducing poverty, is vital, as is a more environmentally appropriate demographic transition than the historical one.  Space assets can contribute most to strategic threats in areas like power and minerals and can also assist global education.  Such public interest is important as education, but it is vital to remember that a certain level of precision in materials and engineering is needed before ideas become realizable.  The crucial step is to turn the space environment to an open market and override the present government monopoly constraint.  As a start, a Center for International Space Industrialization Research (CSIR) is to be set up as a model for the better understanding of the issues involved, thus making a case for strategic investment for space assets.

TI BEFORE AND AFTER DEREGULATION - MARKET RENTING IN GLASGOW AND EDINBURGH
SO URBAN STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
AB In this paper, newspaper adverts are used to investigate the effects of the deregulation of private renting in the UK.  The paper contrasts newspaper adverts in 1988 (before deregulation took force) with 1992 for the market furnished sectors of Glasgow and Edinburgh.  The methodological issues of using such data are discussed, as well as the partial nature of such an analysis.  It turns out that there is some limited evidence of more competitive market conditions and an expansion of supply can be inferred in Glasgow.  OLS rental regressions implied significant changes in the implicit prices of the determinants of marginal rents in both cities.  The paper concludes on a note of caution emerging from the absence of a sustainable supply subsidy to encourage the further development of commercial rental housing.

TI FINANCING HOUSING IN DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES - A REVIEW OF THE PITFALLS AND
   POTENTIALS IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF FORMAL HOUSING FINANCE SYSTEMS
SO URBAN STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
AB Effectively addressing the existing and continuously growing enormous demands and needs for shelter depends critically on the availability of long-term housing finance on a fairly large and sustainable scale.  Policy approaches to realise this situation are still issues of continuing debate in professional circles.  The central issues of focus are sustainable availability, affordability and accessibility of housing finance to households.  Evidence currently indicates that a dominant proportion of housing in developing countries is accounted for by informal non-institutional sources but it has been increasingly strongly argued that development of a formal institutional housing finance system is indispensable for effectively addressing the quantitative and qualitative housing inadequacy problem.  One of the most strongly canvassed strategies is for housing finance to be integrated into the larger national financial system and for its operation to be based on pure market pricing mechanisms, free of government interference.  This paper attempts to identify, review and synthesise from available experiences and literature, the issues involved in this debate, having regard to the general state of institutional development and the prevailing macroeconomic (including financial) climate in most developing countries.  Inferences from the review indicate that, all things considered, an informal housing financing system will remain a viable option and that, in the circumstances of developing countries, the long-term development of sustainable institutional housing finance systems requires continued discrete and prudent roles for government to establish and to enforce an effective system of rules, regulations, safeguards and supervisory functions to monitor and to prevent abuses.  Some degree of support (subsidy) and incentives, albeit indirect, may even be necessary and advisable.  While integration of housing finance into the national financial system and market sourcing and pricing may be the desired goals, these will be very much in the long term.

ID IRRIGATION
AB Establishment of tradable water rights could play an important role in improving the efficiency, equity, and sustainability of water use in developing countries. Well-defined tradable rights formalize and secure the existing water rights held by water users; economize on transactions costs; induce water users to consider the full opportunity cost of water; and provide incentives for water users to internalize and reduce many of the negative externalities inherent in irrigation. The institutional requirements, potential and feasibility of developing markets in tradable water rights should receive increased attention from researchers and policy makers.

AB Polycrystalline AISI 316L stainless steel has been cycled at intermediate strain amplitudes. Cyclic response was analyzed in terms of the cyclic stress-strain curve (CSSC), softening behavior, the friction stress and the back stress. Dislocation structures were determined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). It was found that cyclic softening behavior occurred and this has a significant influence on the dislocation structures by stimulating the activity of cross slip. The cross slip system becomes the second most important slip system, and causes the development of dislocation wall structure. Compared with the cyclic response of 316L single crystals, which are planar in slip character, polycrystals show a tendency towards wavy slip, despite the low stacking fault energy and high friction stress. It is concluded that grain boundaries, together with dislocation ''starvation'', have a major influence on the fatigue behavior of polycrystals by increasing the tendency to multi-slip, decreasing the capacity of strain transfer from grain to grain and from band to band, and changing the limit of stress or strain sustainable by a given dislocation structure in the sequence that occurs.

   LEGITIMACY; EVOLUTION
AB New organizations are always vulnerable to the liabilities of newness, but such pressures are especially severe when an industry is in its formative years.  We focus on one set of constraints facing entrepreneurs in emerging industries-their relative lack of cognitive and sociopolitical legitimacy.  We examine the strategies that founders can pursue, suggesting how their successful pursuit of legitimacy may evolve from innovative ventures to broader contexts, collectively reshaping industry and institutional environments.

TI GEOGRAPHY AND LAND-USE RESEARCH - A UK HISTORICAL-PERSPECTIVE
SO APPLIED GEOGRAPHY
LA English
DT Article
AB The paper recognizes three 'windows of opportunity' for UK geographers in the development of land-use research, arising from advances in concepts, techniques and relevance to current rural land-use issues.  They are the period of the Land Utilisation Survey of the 1930s, the changes in the organization of government and science of the 1960s, and the current debate as to the future use of the UK countryside and wider concern for global sustainability.

TI Growth responses of paddy rice to an ammonia-excreting mutant
   cyanobacterium at elevated CO2 concentration
SO APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID CARBON-DIOXIDE; PLANT; NITROGEN
AB An ammonia-excreting mutant strain of Anabaena variabilis (strain SA-1) was studied as a N supplier for the growth of rice (Oryza sativa L., cultivar ' IR-30') plants at near ambient (330/mu mol mol(-1)) and elevated (660 mu mol mol(-l)) carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations. Rice performance with N supplied by the mutant cyanobacterium was compared with that of three other N treatments: rice plants inoculated with the parent strain (A. variabilis, strain SA-0), plants fertilized with 75 kg N ha(-1) z as urea, or control plants (uninoculated, with no nitrogen fertilization). Plants at elevated CO2 concentration had a higher dry matter content and accumulated more nitrogen than at near ambient CO2. At either CO2 concentration, the mutant strain enhanced the shoot and grain dry matter accumulation more than did the parent strain. Total N concentration of the shoot and grain fractions was significantly greater (P < 0.05) in plants inoculated with the mutant than with the parent strain of the cyanobacterium. The benefit of inoculation with the ammonia-excreting mutant strain was equivalent to or greater than the response observed in plants receiving 75 kg N ha(-1). A combined response of both the rice plants and the cyanobacterium to high CO2 levels probably accounted for the higher dry matter and N at the elevated than at the ambient CO2 concentration. The potential of the ammonia-excreting mutant cyanobacterium as a N source for sustainable, low-input rice production in the predicted high CO2 atmosphere of the next century is promising.

AB Earthworm populations were measured over a 7 year period in areas of a kiwifruit orchard with two different managements, (1) completely undisturbed and (2) organically managed, i. e. commercially, with only organic fertilisers and no synthetic biocides.
   Earthworms present were Aporrectodea caliginosa, Aporrectodea longa, and Lurnbricus rubellus with an initial population of 400-500 m(-2). After 7 years, the earthworm population in the undisturbed plot was zero; there was no significant reduction on the managed plot.
   After 7 years, water infiltration and air permeability were greater within the vine rows in the managed than the undisturbed plot, and smaller where the soil had been compacted by traffic, soil respiration was least in the undisturbed orchard.
   After 7 years, surface venting soil macropores were absent in the undisturbed plot. On the managed plot macropores tended to be vertically aligned in the sward between the vine rows and horizontally aligned within the vine rows.
   Soil chemical properties, measured four times during the 7 years, were similar in both managed and undisturbed plots. The importance of using measurements of biological, physical and chemical soil properties when describing a soil is discussed. Dependence only on assessment of chemical fertility in decision making may result in early stages of soil degradation being unnoticed.

AB There is an increasing need to find a suitable means for disposal of coal combustion byproducts because of the increasing world-wide production of these byproducts.  This need has prompted interest in the use of land disposal, but there are concerns that this use may degrade the quality of soil.  To determine the influence of coal combustion byproducts on the transformation and fate of soil N and assess the potential impact of land disposal on soil quality, we studied the effects of two combustion byproducts (fly ash and bed ash) applied at rates of 22.5, 45, 90, and 180 Mg ha-1 on mineralization and volatile loss of N from soil.  Studies comparing the influence of the byproducts on these processes showed that whereas fly ash had little influence on the fate of soil N, bed ash caused substantial mineralization of organic soil N and volatile loss of this N as NH3.  Studies monitoring the pH of soils treated with bed ash showed that soil pH increased immediately after this treatment, with values reaching as high as 12.8.  These studies indicated that such extreme alkaline conditions caused chemical degradation and volatile loss of as much as 10% of the organic N in soil, and they provide strong evidence that the improper disposal of bed ash on land can have a substantial negative impact on soil quality.

TI EVALUATION OF SAINFOIN-ALFALFA MIXTURES FOR FORAGE PRODUCTION AND

AB Alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) is an adapted pasture legume for the semi-arid region of western Canada but its use is restricted because of ruminant bloat hazard. Sainfoin (Onobrychis viciifolia Scop.) is a non-bloat-inducing forage legume that yields less forage than alfalfa in this region. Mixture of these legumes may mitigate respective weaknesses by combining their strengths. The objective of this research was to determine the stability of seed-mixture (two legumes seeded in the same row) compared to legume monoculture and alternate row seeding (two legumes seeded in separate but adjacent rows). Three trials were seeded on dryland sites at Swift Current, Saskatchewan, in 1977, 1986, and 1987. Treatments varied from the first trial to the last three but all trials allowed comparison of seed-mixture seeding to monoculture and alternate row swards. In the first and second trials, seed-mixture species composition shifted to alfalfa domination(> 90% alfalfa) over 5 yr more quickly than alternate row, presumably due to interspecific competition. In the other trial, seed-mixture was dominated by alfalfa within 2 yr after seeding due to drought stress. We concluded that sainfoin-alfalfa mixtures are not stable or sustainable in this semi-arid environment.

ID DEFORESTATION; ENVIRONMENT
AB This article examines a number of factors which facilitate the adoption and success of policies and projects to promote grassroots sustainable development - that is, the sustainable, multiple use of forests at the community level, including aspects of local self-reliance and control of economic resources. I will argue that the extractive reserve legislation in Brazil and community Forestry projects in Mexico and Peru depended on the formation of pro-grassroots development coalitions. The exact make-up of those coalitions depended on three factors: (1) the initial disposition of key governmental and dominant class actors to such policies; (2) the intensity of local conflicts and the extent of community organization; and (3) the involvement of international actors. The cases suggest that in the absence of serious government or upper class opposition, the adoption and durability of such policies and projects can be promoted by the formation of a coalition of organized communities, domestic non-governmental organizations (NGOs), some allied government agencies, and support from international actors. However, when key government agencies and socio-economic elites are fundamentally opposed to sustainable development initiatives at the grassroots level, much higher levels of community organization, conflict, and domestic and international support appear to be necessary.

AB This article analyses the interrelations between environment, employment and technology in the process of development. A new concept of sustainable development is introduced which makes a distinction between environmental problems associated with high income levels and technological progress and those related to underdevelopment and technological stagnation. The latter category accounts for a major proportion of environmental problems facing poor agrarian economies which are undergoing a process of forced environmental degradation. It is argued that in these types of economies there is a complementarity between economic development and employment generation and the preservation of the environment. It is further shown that in such economies, where the ultimate causes of environmental degradation may be far removed from the immediate environmental issues, conventional environmental policies may be counterproductive.

AB The resource management practices of the Akamba farmers in the Machakos District in Kenya contradict Thomas Malthus's theory that, unchecked, population tends to increase faster than Earth's resources increase to provide for that growth. A study of the Akamba's farming practices from 1930 to 1990 shows that, despite increasing population density, the farmers were able to reverse land degradation, conserve and enhance their livestock, invest in their farms, and improve their productivity. The technological achievements in Machakos were neither a miracle nor an accident; rather, they resulted from an endogenous process whereby the Akamba selected and adapted new ideas from multiple sources.

DT Article
AB The primary purpose of a water supply and sanitation project is to achieve an effective and sustainable improvement of the community environment. This paper presents the experiences gained in the evaluation of a water supply and sanitation project in a settlement in Dhaka where improved water supply, sanitary latrines and hygiene education were provided by a reputed international non-governmental organization. Water and latrine use practices by adults improved but latrines were maintained so poorly that concentrated pollution created a problem within the community. The people from the community were not provided with appropriate knowledge or a system of maintenance. Even though water supply and sanitation were given priority status, since they were not planned with a view to being sustainable, they failed to interrupt the environmental contamination process.

TI THE ROLE OF AGRICULTURE AND ITS PREREQUISITES IN ECONOMIC-DEVELOPMENT -
   A VISION FOR FOREIGN DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE
SO FOOD POLICY
LA English
DT Article
DE FOREIGN AID; DEVELOPING COUNTRIES; AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT
ID GROWTH
AB The aim of this paper is to establish a vision for foreign development assistance based upon the evolution of thought and empirical evidence found in the development literature.  The paper spotlights the agricultural-led approach.  The empirical record shows that agricultural growth had a more pronounced impact on increases in developing-country income than did growth in the nonagricultural sector.  The reason for the differential impact is that developing countries focusing on agricultural development experienced more broad-based income growth and increases in the demand for domestically-produced goods; whereas the developing countries promoting rapid industrialization experienced narrow-based income growth, with a demand pattern oriented toward nonfood and capital-intensive products.  A precondition for agriculture to play its proper role is the existence of a conducive environment in which private enterprise can flourish.  Developing-country governments need to assume responsibility for the creation and maintenance of essential institutions.  Government investments are required in education, infrastructure, and other areas where the commercial market is not capable of delivering critical services.  Finally, governments must responsibly manage the macroeconomy, pursuing sustainable pricing policies and fiscal and monetary policies that are consistent with real equilibrium exchange rates.

AB The boreal mixedwood forests of northern Alberta, Canada, are now being brought under management for pulpwood production. A simulation modelling exercise was undertaken to evaluate the sustainability of planned logging operations, and to explore their potential effects on wildlife habitat. Model inputs include the species composition and age structure of the forest, annual coniferous and deciduous volume requirements, and descriptions of natural stand mortality and regeneration, operational constraints, and silvicultural policies. Simple habitat suitability submodels simulate the effect of changes in forest composition on wildlife species. The model was used to explore the implications of a variety of management policies over a 73 000 km(2) forest estate in the mixedwood region. Simulations of current harvesting plans indicate that projected levels of harvesting may be sustainable, but many wildlife species will lose substantial amounts of preferred habitat. Harvesting can probably not be sustained without converting most of the region's characteristic mixed-species stands to production of single species. Alternative plans which maintain unharvested reserve areas can protect habitat (areas of mixed stands in particular) for some wildlife species, but may entail significant increases in operating costs or reductions in harvest levels. Furthermore, the reserve strategies we considered are able to maintain only between 12% and 41% of high-quality habitat for species dependent upon older stands of commercially valuable timber. Because species have different habitat requirements, increased protection for some species may exacerbate habitat losses for others.

AB Performance improvement is the systematic evaluation of processes to ensure that customers' expectations are met in the most cost-effective manner.  When customers' priorities regarding cost, quality, and timeliness are understood, improvement can begin on processes that deliver products and services.  Changes can be strategic or tactical and fast or structured.  Methods include focused improvement, continuous improvement, restructuring, and process innovation or reengineering.  To achieve sustainable results, utility employees should be involved in the process change.  By monitoring and evaluating outcomes, the utility can measure change, recognize progress, and set new goals.

AB Objectives. We sought to investigate whether reduced respiratory muscle endurance contributes to increased dyspnea and decreased exercise capacity in patients with chronic heart failure.
   Background. In patients with heart failure, the sensation of dyspnea may be related to abnormalities of respiratory muscle function, such as diminished strength or endurance, or both.
   Methods. Respiratory muscle endurance was assessed by measuring maximal sustainable ventilatory capacity in 15 patients with congestive heart failure and 8 normal subjects using progressive isocapnic hyperpnea. Near-infrared spectroscopy of an accessory respiratory muscle, Borg scale recordings of perceived dyspnea, time in inspiration, time per breath and minute ventilation were measured. Exercise testing with measurement of oxygen consumption was also performed.
   Results. Maximal voluntary ventilation (normal subjects 167 +/- 40, heart failure group 89 +/- 31 liters/min) and maximal sustainable ventilatory capacity (normal subjects 90 +/- 23, heart failur e group 53 +/- 22 liters/min) were significantly reduced in patients with heart failure (both p < 0.05). No significant accessory respiratory muscle deoxygenation was observed in either group. Borg scale recordings at maximal sustainable ventilatory capacity were comparable in both groups. At rest, the inspiratory duty cycle (i.e., time in inspiration divided by the time per breath) was comparable in the two groups (normal subjects 0.34 +/- 0.09, heart failure group 0.37 +/- 0.12, p = NS). However at maximal sustainable ventilatory capacity, only normal subjects had a significant increase in the inspiratory duty cycle (normal subjects 0.49 +/- 0.04, heart failure group 0.36 +/- 0.10, p < 0.05). This finding suggests obstruction to airflow in patients with congestive heart failure. Values for peak exercise minute ventilation did not differ significantly from values in maximal sustainable ventilatory capacity in either group and were significantly correlated (r = 0.84, p < 0.0001).
   Conclusion. Respiratory muscle endurance as assessed by maximal sustainable ventilatory capacity is reduced in patients with heart failure.

AB Significant changes to the existing European Community (EC) legislation for the protection of the aquatic environment are being contemplated by the EC Commission. In addition, the emphasis on sustainable development in the Fifth EC Environmental Action Programme will focus attention on economic instruments to be applied in support of legislation. The EC eco-labelling and auditing schemes, although voluntary, will lead to more environmentally acceptable products and processes. The paper discusses the likely future EC regulatory system for the protection of the aquatic environment and how the supporting EC initiatives will contribute to environmental improvements

AB Marten (Martes americana) are susceptible to overharvesting, and forestry practices may compound this problem by reducing habitat quality and increasing accessibility of trappers via forest roads.  From May 1989 through December 1991, we estimated age- and sex-specific survival of marten in a logged area with road access.  We tested for age- and sex-specific differences in survival, combined estimates of survival with published natality rates to evaluate whether harvests were sustainable, and simulated population response to management options.  Trapping accounted for 90% of all documented mortalities (n = 49) among 38 radio-collared female (26 ad, 12 juv) and 36 radio-collared male (24 ad, 12 juv) marten.  Most (93%) trapping-caused mortality occurred during the first 14 days of the season, during which vulnerability of adult females to trapping was 1.45-1.75 times less (P < 0.01) than for other age-sex classes.  Survival from 1 May to 15 December was higher (P = 0.03) for adult females (0.39) than adult males (0.12).  Harvests of female marten were not sustainable, and shortening the trapping season from 6 to 2 weeks would be ineffective at achieving a finite rate of population change (lambda) greater-than-or-equal-to 1.0.  Unless immigration compensated for emigration and trapper-caused mortality, we estimated that survival of females would need to nearly double to sustain the population.  Access by trappers via logging roads increases the potential for declines in marten populations.  Regulations to reduce trapping-caused mortality may be needed to maintain viable marten populations in landscapes with extensive forest harvesting and intensive trapping.

TI SMALL-SCALE IRRIGATION IN DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES
SO LAND USE POLICY
LA English
DT Article
ID WEST-AFRICA; ARAL SEA; WATER; CONSERVATION
AB This paper introduces the issue of small-scale irrigation in the context of current international concern over the sustainability of development. It provides a background for the five more specialized papers which follow. A common theme is the distinction between the disappointing performance of externally imposed and managed schemes and the greater success of irrigation which is initiated and controlled by the farmers themselves. The importance of learning from past mistakes is stressed, both in developing new schemes and in rehabilitating old ones. Water is often not sufficiently valued; legislation to ensure more equitable distribution and to increase efficiency and sustainability of use is widely needed. The question of whether irrigation development is necessary is discussed; improving rainfed farming or introducing supplementary irrigation for critical periods may be preferable. Where indigenous irrigation already exists it is often of great importance, and would benefit from access to more information and assistance.

DT Article
AB Concepts of sustainability are discussed in relation to small-scale groundwater irrigation (SSGWI). The nature and important features of SSGWI are described, and the main endogenous and exogenous threats to the sustainability of this important farming activity are set out. The importance of groundwater monitoring and management, together with effective legislation and control, are highlighted. The potential conflict between promoters of rapid groundwater development for poverty alleviation and the proponents of a more cautious approach is discussed. The 'invisibility' and limited area of SSGWI in semi-arid, sub-Saharan Africa are contrasted with their importance in what are otherwise drought-prone dry-land environments.

TI GARDEN IRRIGATION FOR IMPROVING AGRICULTURAL SUSTAINABILITY IN DRYLAND

SO LAND USE POLICY
LA English

ID AFRICA
AB Agricultural practices in arid and semi-arid areas of Africa have been developed in response to an unpredictable climate. Farmers compensate for unreliable rainfall by cultivating large areas and/or by herding cattle and other livestock. These are reasonable strategies where population densities are low. However, with increasing population pressure and the possibility of climatic change, these practices are becoming increasingly hazardous. Small-scale or garden irrigation in conjunction with improved rainfed farming practices and livestock management can be used to improve agricultural sustainability in semi-arid areas. This paper discusses the role of garden irrigation as part of improved and integrated resource management at the catchment scale. Recent advances in developing groundwater resources for garden irrigation and in techniques to use this water more efficiently are also discussed. Particular emphasis is placed on garden irrigation in sub-Saharan Africa and research results from Zimbabwe.

ID SYSTEM
AB Small-scale irrigation systems (SSIS) support vital land use activities in many locations, often organized through specialized technical and institutional arrangements for water management. This paper first summarizes the challenges that SSIS can present to conventional irrigation design and then reviews national and international objectives behind assistance programmes to SSIS. It also describes how different ideological approaches to rural transformation have determined the type of agencies and assistance programmes used. New development objectives of economic growth with equity and sustainability are replacing older objectives of agrarian transformation. However, these do not fit easily with new planning ideologies emphasizing decentralization, market forces and the non-government sector. The paper sees few realistic attempts to develop new policies and programmes for SSIS which meet these new objectives, and it ends with a call for some new institutional development to ensure relevant representation and help for SSIS.

AB Furrow irrigation-induced soil erosion is a serious threat to sustainable irrigated agriculture globally.  Recent field studies have demonstrated that small concentrations of polymers dissolved in irrigation water appreciably reduce soil loss from irrigated furrows and increase net infiltration (total inflow - total outflow).  This paper summarizes polymer-related field studies conducted in Idaho on highly erodible silt loam soils (Durixerollic Calciorthids, Xerollic Haplargids, Haploxerollic Durargids).  A range of furrow lengths (163-264 m), slopes (0.5-7%), and inflows (15-38 L min-1) were included in the studies.  A moderate-charge-density anionic polyacrylamide (PAM), highly effective for controlling furrow sediment losses, was employed in the field trials.  Treatment efficacy depended primarily on application rate, PAM concentration in irrigation water, duration of furrow exposure, and inflow rate.  Nontreated furrow soil loss in 75% of the irrigations exceeded soil loss tolerance (T) for these soils, whereas only 13% of the PAM-treated irrigations exceeded T.  Those treatments that applied at least 0.7 kg ha-1 PAM (mean, 1.3 kg ha-1) reduced furrow sediment loss by 94% (range:  80-99%) and increased net infiltration by 15% (range:  -8-57%).  One of the most effective treatments applied PAM at 10 g m-3 in irrigation inflows during the furrow advance period.  This initial high-load treatment was nearly twice as effective as a continuous 0.25 g m-3 PAM application on these soils when slopes were 1-2%.  The initial high-load treatment protected furrows with slopes ranging from 0.5 to 3.5%.  PAM reduced total phosphorus (84% of control value), nitrate (83%), biochemical oxygen demand (72%), and sediment (57%) in treated runoff water.

AB Cereals grown under irrigated conditions in the Canadian prairies produce large amounts of residues and proper management of these residues is required to produce good crop yields and maintain soil quality.  Field studies from 1986 to 1990 assessed the effect of straw-tillage treatments on plant growth of irrigated cereals on a Dark Brown Chernozemic Lethbridge (Typic Boroll) loam in southern Alberta.  The crop sequence was wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)-wheat-oats (Avena sativa L.) wheat.  Straw was retained on the plots or removed by baling.  Tillage treatments were autumn mouldboard ploughing, spring mouldboard ploughing or direct seeding.
   Grain yield was greater in the autumn plough compared with the spring plough treatments (4336 kg ha-1 vs. 3763 kg ha-1, respectively) in 1 year (1989) out of 4.  Grain yield was greater in the no straw-spring plough than the straw-spring plough treatment (4242 kg ha-1 vs. 3791 kg ha-1, respectively) in 2 years out of 4.  Spring plough treatments had the advantage of ground cover over winter compared with autumn plough treatments.  The problems associated with straw incorporation in the spring could be alleviated by removing the straw by baling but this practice removed 16.0 kg N ha-1 year-1 and 1600 kg C ha-1 year-1 from the soil system.  Grain N concentration was decreased by 10% if straw was incorporated in the spring compared with autumn incorporation.  Straw N concentration was decreased with spring ploughing compared with autumn ploughing when straw was incorporated and also when straw was removed by bailing.  Total plant N was decreased by spring ploughing compared with autumn ploughing if straw was incorporated.  Incorporation of straw also decreased total plant N compared with removing the straw with spring but not with autumn ploughing.  Under a no straw-direct seeding treatment, grain yield and plant N uptake were generally less than in the no straw-tillage systems.
   Straw-tillage treatment effects on grain yield and plant N uptake were attributed to differences in seedbed quality and mineral N levels.  Lower spring and autumn soil NO3-N levels in the straw-spring plough and direct seeding treatments throughout the 4 crop years were attributed to great N immobilisation compared with the autumn plough and no straw-spring plough treatments.
   This field study showed that although spring incorporation of straw and direct seeding treatments encountered seedbed problems and lower N availability, these treatments with added N could be as productive and be more sustainable systems than other treatments as they enjoy advantages in terms of better soil conservation and less harmful environmental impact.

   FRAMEWORK
AB This paper explores two phenomena shaping processes of local institutional and organizational change in rural Africa. The first is the complexity of institutional layering and dissonance in which local organizations and institutions in rural Africa coexist. The second is the paradox often found in state local relations in Africa. Central governments encourage local communities to take on responsibilities which the center cannot manage. Should significant organizational strength emerge at the local level, however, central powers often move expeditiously to destroy it. Illustrative material comes primarily from Kenya and Zimbabwe and selectively from several other countries.
   We ask what new structures are emerging and what old ones are being adapted to new functions. We argue that local organizations are critical for addressing ecological decline and restoring the productivity and sustainability of rural Africa. Both localities and national governments have much to gain if the capacities of local organizations can become, themselves, a valued resource in the resource-scarce setting comprising much of rural Africa.

AB Four aspects of the life histories of the two populations of powan Coregonus lavaretus (L.) in Scotland are described:  growth (Eck powan are shorter and with greater year to year variance than Lomond); sexual maturation (Eck powan mature younger, but at similar weight to Lomond); spawning (timing in Eck varies, but is consistent in Lomond); and recruitment/mortality (fecundity, sex ratios, and mortality also vary in the short term).  Short term differences between the physiological ecology of the populations can be ascribed to the size and topography of the lochs.  Long term differences are more difficult to account for, and are more important in that they may signal changes in sustainability.  Conservation of powan must be considered in terms of their synecological relationships, not in isolation.

AB Relying more on biological N2 fixation has been suggested as a way to meet one of the major challenges of agricultural sustainability.  A N-15 study was conducted to compare the fate of applied legume and fertilizer N in a long-term cropping systems experiment.  Nitrogen-15-labeled red clover (Trifolium pratense L.) and (NH4)2SO4 were applied to microplots within the low-input and conventional cropping systems of the Farming Systems Trial at the Rodale Institute Research Center in Pennsylvania.  The N-15 was applied to soil and traced into corn (Zea mays L.) in 1987 and 1988.  Residual N-15 was also traced into second-year spring barley (Hordeum vulgare L.).  Legume and fertilizer N-15 remaining in soil was measured and loss of N was calculated by difference.  More fertilizer than legume N was recovered by crops (40 vs. 17% of input), more legume than fertilizer N was retained in soil (47 vs. 17% of input), and similar amounts of N from both sources were lost from the cropping systems (39% of input) over the 2-yr period.  More fertilizer than legume N was lost during the year of application (38 vs. 18% of input), but more legume than fertilizer N was lost the year after application (17 vs. 4% of input).  Residual fertilizer and legume N-15 was distributed similarly among soil fractions.  Soil microbial biomass was larger in the legume-based system.  A larger, but not necessarily more active, soil microbial biomass was probably responsible for the greater soil N supplying capacity in the legume-based compared with fertilizer-based system.

AB Tosyl arginine methyl ester induced bronchoconstriction in rabbit bronchial rings mounted in vitro with a calculated EC(50) of 5.6 X 10(-5) M as compared with acetylcholine which induced sustainable constriction with an EC(50) of 2.5 X 10(-6) M. Tosyl arginine methyl ester, however, had definite bronchoconstricting properties though less potent than acetylcholine. We concluded that our data support the hypothesis that tosyl arginine methyl ester could be a possible biochemical mediator of airway contraction.

SO ATMOSPHERE-OCEAN

DT Article
ID GENERAL-CIRCULATION MODELS; WESTERN UNITED-STATES; SCENARIOS
AB As part of a study on the effects of climatic variability and change on the sustainability of agriculture in Alberta, the modelling performance of the second-generation Canadian Climate Centre GCM (general circulation model) is examined. For the region in general, the simulation of 1 x CO2 mean temperature is generally better than that for mean precipitation, and summer is the season best modelled for each variable. At the scale of individual grid squares, DJF (December, January, February) (temperature) and JJA (June, July, August) (precipitation) are the seasons best modelled. The GCM-simulated increases in mean annual temperature resulting from a doubling of CO2 are of the order of 5 to 6 degrees C in the Prairie region, with much of this increase resulting from substantial warming in the winter and spring. Increases in mean annual precipitation are of the order of 50 to 150 mm (changes of +5 to +15%), with the greatest changes again occurring in winter and spring. As far as the limited GCM run durations allow, temperature and precipitation variance generally show no significant changes from a 1 x CO2 to a 2 X CO2 climate. Increased precipitation in winter and spring does not result in greater snow accumulations owing to the magnitude of warming; and significant decreases in soil moisture content occur in summer and fall. The resulting effects on the growing season and moisture regime have the potential to affect agricultural practices in the area.

DT Article
ID AUSTRALIAN ABORIGINES
AB The poor nutritional status of Aboriginal Australians is a serious and complex public health concern.  We describe an unusually successful health and nutrition project initiated by the people of Minjilang, which was developed, implemented and evaluated with the community.  Apparent community dietary intake, assessed by the 'store-turnover' method, and biochemical, anthropometric and haematological indicators of health and nutritional status were measured before intervention and at three-monthly intervals during the intervention year.  Following intervention, there was a significant decrease in dietary intake of sugar and saturated fat, an increase in micronutrient density, corresponding improvements in biochemical indices (for example, a 12 per cent decrease in mean serum cholesterol, increases in serum and red cell folate, serum vitamin B6 and plasma ascorbic acid), decrease in mean systolic and diastolic blood pressures, a normalisation of body mass index, and a normalisation of haematologic indices.  The success of this project demonstrates that Aboriginal communities can bring about improvements in their generally poor nutritional status, and that the store-turnover method provides a valid, inexpensive and noninvasive method for evaluating the resultant changes in community diet.  Although the project was undoubtedly effective in the short term, further work is in progress to assess individual strategies with respect to sustainability, cost-effectiveness and generalisability.

TI COMPARISON OF CATCH RATES AND SPECIES COMPOSITION FROM ARTIFICIAL AND

SO BULLETIN OF MARINE SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
AB The depletion of fish stocks and the widespread habitat destruction caused by inshore trawling along the coast of Kerala provoked artisanal fishworkers to construct (using ''materials of opportunity'') a number of small artificial reefs (AR's). The success of these AR's prompted research into low cost concrete and bamboo modular structures. This paper describes the catches of artisanal fishermen from three low cost, modular AR's and compares them with catches from nearby natural reefs (NR's). The cumulative total earnings made from each of the three AR's during the study period suggest that modular AR's are an economical viable option for artisanal communities wishing to create habitat for fisheries purposes. Comparable0 mean CPUE values with associated large variances were obtained from AR's and NR's in all three villages. The catch from the NR's in all three villages was dominated by Balistidae. Lutjanidae, Nemipteridae, Sepidae, and Synodonatidae were abundant in the catches from the AR's in two of the three villages, while in the third the catch was composed largely of Carangidae. The majority of fish caught from the NR's in all three villages were resident varieties, with lesser numbers of temporary and non resident fish respectively. Although no clear pattern of reef association was observed for fish caught from the AR's it is argued that three newly created habitats attract fish which could support an artisanal fishery sector. Developments in community management of AR's necessary to ensure that such a fishery is sustainable are briefly discussed.

ID CORAL REEFS; HAWAII; COMMUNITY
AB Artificial reefs used os submarine and dive tour sites receive less fishing pressure from the public because the high use patterns by dive tour firms preclude much of the fishing activity. Such reefs when used as part of a non-destructive ''eco-tourism'' dive package provide significantly greater economic return than when used for commercial fishery purposes. Annual gross revenue from the commercial fishery of one open-access dive tour artificial reef analyzed in this study is 4% of the annual pre-tax profit of dive tours operating on this same reef. Moreover, the daily estimated catch from this reef is equivalent to the estimated annual sustainable yield, suggesting that the fishery is capitalizing on fishes aggregating to the reef rather than in situ production. If the rationale for artificial reef development is economic gain and a viable tourist industry presently exists, reefs deployed for non-consumptive purposes may provide the best use, especially when fishery resources are in a state of decline.

AB Temporal changes in demography, population sustainability, and harvest rates support the hypothesis that overexploitation precipitated the commercial extinction of northern cod, Gadus morhua, off Newfoundland and Labrador in 1992. Annual estimates of realized population growth (r) indicate that the stock was rarely sustainable at the age-specific survival and fecundity rates experienced since 1962. A twofold decline in annual survival probabilities in the 1980s was concomitant with increased inshore and offshore fishing effort, declining catch rate, and spatial shifts in gillnetting effort from areas of low (inshore) to high (offshore) catch rates. We reject hypotheses that attribute the collapse of northern cod to environmental change. Water temperature was associated neither with juvenile nor adult abundance nor with adult distribution by depth. Harvests equivalent to those of the past decade were sustainable in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries in a considerably colder environment. An updated analysis of previous work indicates that salinity has little effect on recruitment. We conclude that the collapse of northern cod can be attributed solely to overexploitation and that population sustainability indices such as r provide a means by which the susceptibility and resilience of exploited populations can be assessed and their probability of commercial extinction reduced.

AB A deterministic dynamic programming formulation of the transition uneven-aged stand management problem is presented. Using a previously published northern hardwoods growth model, a forward recursive, discrete, two-state problem that maximizes the net present value of harvested trees at each stage is developed. State variables represent the total number of trees and the total basal area per acre. A neighborhood storage concept previously published is used to reduce the number of states considered at each stage. Two harvest allocation rules are used to assign the harvested basal area to individual diameter classes. Terminal end point conditions and stage to stage sustainability are not required. Results from four base runs of the model are presented and compared with previously published results. Each run produces significantly different optimal paths, with one showing a higher net present value than any previously published. Sensitivity runs illustrate the impact of changes in interest rates, width of neighborhood storage class, and initial conditions. Dynamic programming offers promise for analyzing uneven-aged stand management problems.

DT Article
ID CO2
AB The majority of developing nations continue to rely primarily of biomass energy sources even as they endeavor to modernize and industrialize their economic base. The implications of this dependence include a strong linkage between pre-industrial conditions and future national development, as well as the need for environmental planning that explicitly recognizes the natural time-scales of ecological change. Environmental policy analysts consequently must work with this mix of resources and constraints as well as the political and managerial environment generated by recent concerns over global warming and change. To develop a framework for evaluating longterm environmental impacts, we first elaborate on an earlier time-line model of pre-industrial anthropogenic carbon emissions (Kammen and Marine, 1993). We then examine the implications of environmental decision making necessitated by natural time-scales of forest growth, the natural biogeochemical cycles, and the anthropogenic release of trace gasses. This perspective provides a number of insights into sustainable levels of land-conversion for agricultural activity and biomass utilization, and more generally sets natural time-horizons that must be integrated into the planning of strategies for development and economic growth.

DE MODEL; SUSTAINABILITY
AB A global model was developed to enable a comparison of different strategies for transfer of economic resources from industrialized countries to developing countries. The model is based on a part of the recent published model ''Beyond the Limits'', but distinguishes between the industrialized countries and the developing countries for comparison of different strategies for transfer of resources from the rich to the poor world. The model has 8 state variables: production capacity, population and agricultural production in both industrialized and developing countries, pollution level and resources. The model equations and the tested scenario arc presented in detail. Global models arc not able to make accurate prognoses, but provided that the most crucial relationships are qualitatively correct, our previous experience in global modelling has shown that it may be possible to a certain extent to assess the relative difference between the application of different strategies. The results of the various simulations. based on alternative strategies, are compared and it is found that a much more massive transfer of economic resources is needed to assure development towards better pollution abatement and a reduction in the population growth, i.e., more sustainable development. Furthermore, it seems extremely important that the rich world spends considerably more money on pollution abatement and allocates sufficient resources directly to the family planning program in the developing countries. This seems the only method to stop population growth before it goes ''beyond the limits'' and thereby prevents all possibilities for sustainable development.

DE INCOME MEASUREMENT
AB This paper discusses the controversy regarding adjustments needed to be introduced in National Accounts to determine sustainable income measures. The issue is presented separately for depletion and degradation costs in order to take into account inter- and intratemporal considerations. It is argued that the approaches proposed in recent literature to measure natural resources depreciation can be considered as special cases of a distinct sustainability hypothesis. Apart from these theoretical issues, sustainable income measurement also entails very difficult empirical questions.

AB Sustainability of the biosphere requires conscious and responsible management of available resources on a global scale. Up to now it has not been possible to deal with the full complexity of interaction between human society and nature. The complexity of tasks required to assure the base of human existence calls for means to overcome disciplinary fragmentation of knowledge. This paper discusses how modelling activities can contribute to interdisciplinary planning on a regional scale as parts of a global interaction network. Conceptual modelling workshops are advocated as the basis for a new type of institution elaborating management scenarios and political decision alternatives on the level of geographic landscape units. Interdisciplinary modelling, in its conceptualization phases, is seen as the basis for organizing such institutions to provide an interface between science and government, and achieve a more integrative science of holism to meet the needs of the next decades.

DT Article
ID EXHAUSTIBLE RESOURCES; EXTRACTION; COST
AB This paper presents a simple model of resource management that combines use of a non-renewable resource, such as oil, with eventual transition to a backstop substitute resource in infinite supply (e.g., solar energy). In the context of this model, we derive golden rules that govern efficiency in both the accumulation of capital and in the extraction of natural natural resources for use in production. These results supplement the Solow-Hartwick model of maximin consumption in helping to illuminate the notion of sustainable development.

TI ENVIRONMENTAL AND ECONOMIC DILEMMAS FOR FARM-HOUSEHOLDS IN AFRICA - WHEN
   LOW-INPUT SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE TRANSLATES TO HIGH-COST UNSUSTAINABLE
   LIVELIHOODS
SO ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION
LA English
DT Article
AB Calls for small-scale farmers to move away from the use of purchased inputs in order to make farming more environmentally sustainable are being increasingly voiced on the strength of ecological arguments. These arguments, backed up by technical information on natural resource-loss or degradation, and by descriptions of sustainable indigenous systems which use few external inputs, are often persuasive. However, they can also be simplistic and misleading.
   First the phrase 'Low-input, More Sustainable Agriculture', is misleading. To many farm-households this translates into 'High-cost, Less Sustainable Livelihoods'. To many resource-poor Swazi farm-households, abandonment of HYV technology would mean less food per labour unit and therefore a higher input of labour time to produce subsistence requirements. This means less labour time for other activities (market or non-market), lower welfare, higher risk of poverty, and a less sustainable livelihood, than otherwise.
   Second, it is simplistic to ignore the circumstances which have led to the adoption of current practices and the socio-economic as well as ecological implications of reversing past development trends. In Northern Province, Zambia, abandonment of hybrid Maize and fertilizers would result in an expansion of chitemene, with consequent reductions in fallows and nutrient recycling as well as household incomes.
   Third, technology choices are complex, even when restricted to a single enterprise and to simple labour and cash cost tradeoffs. As seen with the tillage technology in Zimbabwe, adoption of the tine had implications for other activities in the same enterprise, Furthermore, securing the resource conservation benefits of the tine technology seemed to require the introduction of herbicides, with attendant potential ecological disbenefits. There are likely to be many instances in which the introduction of input-intensive technology is necessary to persuade farm-households to adopt changes in their fanning methods which improve overall environmental sutstainability, but such adoptions should only be after detailed investigation locally.
   For resource-poor farmers, sustainable livelihoods come before sustainable environments, though mercifully it is possible to promote both. However, farm-households will only manage their resources in an environmentally sustainable way if it is in their economic interests to do so. The change to more environmentally sustainable farming methods will come about by altering current incentives for using present input combinations. This can be promoted through the introduction of new technology, or changing price-ratios or -regulation. Selection of the appropriate technology combinations, policies, and regulatory mechanisms, will require a good understanding of the historical development, current circumstances, and motives, of farm-household managers of natural resources. Blanket calls for these managers to adopt 'Low-Input Sustainable Agriculture' is neither very sensible, nor likely to have much of an impact.

AB This paper examines some of the impacts of Biosphere Reserve planning on the socio-economic conditions of rural communities in the United States. Through a review of the literature, it is argued that three broad types of problems can develop when Biosphere Reserve plans are put into effect. These include unexpected development shifts, shifts in the distribution of benefits and costs of economic development, and a loss of local governments' ability to provide public services. Though Biosphere Reserve planning has been cast as a strategy for experimentation in community and ecological sustainability, the planning and management process itself causes paradoxical local impacts.
   It is argued that problems resulting from Biosphere Reserve planning are similar to problems resulting from other types of land-use planning in developed countries. Several broad suggestions are offered for responding to these issues. They include an increased socio-historical appreciation among planners of the current conditions of rural communities, and an increase in evaluation research on the impacts of Biosphere Reserve management strategies.

TI THE SPREAD OF ECOTOURISM - SOME PLANNING IMPLICATIONS
SO ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION
LA English
DT Article
AB The idea of ecotourism is being promoted and supported, by growing numbers of people and groups in different parts of the world, as a major means of dealing with the damaging effects of tourism. Yet the meaning of the term varies among different people, projects, and places. Evidence from national parks, where this type of tourism has been promoted for many years, shows that such tourism can cause substantial long-term cumulative changes in environment. Concepts such as ecotourism, green tourism, and sustainable tourism development, are general in their nature and have to be described, planned, and assessed, in detail on the ground in terms of the socioeconomic and environmental conditions applying in different places. In this respect, careful planning and management procedures are needed not only for ecotourism but indeed for all forms of tourism.
   These procedures and conditions required for tourism planning include: 1) setting of goals and objectives; 2) research to provide a good understanding of relevant ecological and socio-economic systems; 3) concern for efficiency; 4) environmental education; 5) employee involvement; 6) codes of ethics; and 7) monitoring and assessment procedures.
   A basic principle is the involvement of all affected parties throughout the life-cycle of ecotourism or other tourism projects. This involvement can be aided by paying more explicit attention than hitherto to means of facilitating more comprehensive decision-making and especially to key processes such as understanding, communicating, assessing, planning, implementing, monitoring, and adapting to change. All concerned parties need to recognize such key steps or processes in decision-making in order to be prepared to participate efficiently and effectively along with other interested persons and groups.

ID WILDERNESS
AB Ideas of wilderness in North America are evolving toward some new configuration. Current wilderness ideology, among other weaknesses, has been charged with encouraging a radical separation between people and nature and with being inadequate to serve the protection of biodiversity. Sustainable development and ''wise use'' privatization of wildlands have been offered as alternatives to the Western wilderness concept. I review this wilderness debate and argue that critical distinctions between wildness and wilderness and self and other must be settled before alternatives can be considered. I look closely at arguments for sustainable development and argue that the limits on the human use of nature are discounted and technological management of wildlands is emphasized. I also argue that the ''wise use'' response to wilderness is a radically utilitarian option that does not contribute to evolving ideas of wilderness or sustainability and that replacing the sustainable development idea with sustainable landscape protection might better serve both wildness and human projects. Finally, I offer the ways of life of post-migratory ecosystem-based cultures as models of appropriate human behavior within a management framework of habitat protection for viable populations of all native species and conclude that our purpose in protecting wildness is not to preserve nature or to improve it, but rather to learn a sense of limits from it and to model culture after it.

AB Shrimp farming in mangrove areas has grown dramatically in Asia and Latin America over the past decade. As a result, demand for resources required for farming, such as feed, seed, and clean water, has increased substantially. This study focuses on semiintensive shrimp culture as practiced on the Caribbean coast of Colombia. We estimated the spatial ecosystem support that is required to produce the food inputs, nursery areas, and clean water to the shrimp farms, as well as to process wastes. We also made an estimate of the natural and human-made resources necessary to run a typical semiintensive shrimp farm. The results show that a semiintensive shrimp farm needs a spatial ecosystem support-the ecological footprint-that is 35-190 times larger than the surface area of the farm. A typical such shrimp farm appropriates about 295 J of ecological work for each joule of edible shrimp protein produced. The corresponding figure for industrial energy is 40:1. More than 80% of the ecological primary production required to feed the shrimps is derived from external ecosystems. In 1990 an area of 874-2300 km2 of mangrove was required to supply shrimp postlarvae to the farms in Colombia, corresponding to a total area equivalent to about 20-50% of the country's total mangrove area. The results were compared with similar estimates for other food production systems, particularly aquacultural ones. The comparison indicates that shrimp farming ranks as one of the most resource-intensive food production systems, characterizing it as an ecologically unsustainable throughput system. Based on the results, we discuss local, national, and regional appropriation of ecological support by the semiintensive shrimp farms. Suggestions are made for how shrimp farming could be transformed into a food production system that is less environmentally degrading and less dependent on external support areas.

   OPTIMALITY; SOCIAL DISCOUNT RATE; SUSTAINABILITY CONSTRAINTS;
   SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT; WELFARE MAXIMIZATION
AB It is argued that 'sustainable development' has been defined in such a way as to be either morally repugnant or logically redundant. 'Strong' sustainability, overriding all other considerations, is morally unacceptable as well as totally impractical; and 'weak' sustainability, in which compensation is made for resources consumed, offers nothing beyond traditional economic welfare maximisation. The 'sustainability' requirement that human well-being should never be allowed to decline is shown to be irrational. Welfare economics can accommodate distributional considerations, and, suitably defined, the concept of welfare can include the subjective effects of changes in - as well as the levels of - well-being. Hence there is no reason why welfare maximisation should not remain an overriding policy objective. Nor can sustainability be regarded as a 'constraint' on welfare maximisation unless there is a clear conflict between the two - which has yet to be demonstrated. This is not to deny the importance of intergenerational justice, nor the need for economic incentives to correct market imperfections if the environment is to be managed in a socially optimal manner. Apart from a few small developing countries heavily dependent on minerals or other finite primary products, the measurement of some wider concept of 'sustainable' GNP is a waste of time and such estimates as have been made are virtually worthless.

AB Primary legislation in Britain has enshrined the 'voluntary principle' at the centre of the working relationship between nature conservationists and other land-users. This paper examines the dilemma that arises from the application of the legislation to long-term land management strategies in support of nature conservation. In its historical context this approach does not sit easily with wider goals such as the land-use ethic of Aldo Leopold or the search for an ethic of sustainability.

AB Recent shifts in emphasis to preservation of biological diversity and establishment of large nature reserves have resulted in downgrading of the perceived importance of data at the population level.  These shifts in emphasis, while laudable, should not result in loss of focus on the fundamental importance of population information.  Suitable habitat, although a prime necessity, is not sufficient for wildlife preservation.  Species may not occupy otherwise suitable habitat because of internal (predation, interspecific competition, disease) or external (adverse climate, exploitation, disturbance, impact of exotic species, pollution and toxicants) factors.  Historical impacts may persist for many years, and may require active restoration.  Forest management plans must consider population data on a metapopulation scale.  Data for common species can be at the reconnaissance level whereas for threatened or sensitive species they need to be more detailed.  To evaluate sustainability, population data must be integrated with forest stand data in projection models to predict habitat-population mosaics at various times in the future.  These models must be developed and improved over time in an adaptive management approach.

AB This paper presents the relationships and development of forestry and wildlife management in Hungary during the past 70 years.  Current problems of coordination are rooted in the cardinal principle of Hungarian forestry that defines the purpose of forest management as ''sustainable and increasing wood production'', and regards recreational, educational, and wildlife management as secondary uses.  Forestry and game management share several common elements such as educational and scientific underpinnings, direction and regulation, and planning systems.  Nonetheless, poor coordination and profit-driven management have resulted in serious resource conflicts associated with extensive clearcutting, habitat destruction, diminished diversity in tree plantations, game damage to reforestation efforts, and other problems.  Scientific and professional cooperation are necessary to create an ecologically-sound basis to coordinate resource uses and to harmonize the objectives of timber production, nature protection, and wildlife management in Hungarian forests.

DE FOREST REPRODUCTION METHODS; DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEMS; SILVICULTURAL
   PRESCRIPTIONS; HARVESTING METHODS; STAND REGENERATION; STAND STRUCTURE
AB Once a decision to regenerate a particular stand is made at the forest level, a forester has to make critical decisions at the stand level as to the choice of cutting method for existing stands to regenerate the desired species and develop a stand of the desired structure.  Two related critical decisions in stand-level forest management are (1) selecting the best tree species to regenerate on a given site, and (2) selecting the appropriate method of cutting existing stands for both the regeneration of the desired species within a certain time and for maintaining or developing the desired stand structure.  This paper discusses the management factors and principles and criteria for choosing a cutting method to meet decision (2) (i.e., the reproduction method).  The four criteria used to guide the appropriate reproduction method are (1) maximum sustainable forest productivity, (2) stand reliability, (3) silvicultural feasibility, and (4) harvesting feasibility.  With these criteria in mind, a stand-level guide devised for coastal British Columbia is proposed.  This guide is in the form of a dichotomous key and is based on 13 selected ecological, stand, and management factors.  Combining this approach with principles, criteria and guidelines for tree species selection already practiced, regeneration and management objectives can be achieved both on a species-and site-specific basis.

AB This article divides the study of global environmental security into four interrelated analytic categories:  ecosystem health and threats from human activity; decision-making patterns (risk and interest calculations); the normative context (conceptions of related rights); and the effects of/on the international system on/of the above (especially, challenges to and from the transforming but stubborn institution of state sovereignty).  The article uses this framework to discuss what is certainly one of the most important issues of our time:  energy resources and planning in an age when sustainable development is imperative.  Although the international system limits our ability to deal with this issue in a long-term fashion, attempts to do so may also transform that system itself.

TI PARTICIPATORY HEALTH DEVELOPMENT IN RURAL NEPAL - CLARIFYING THE PROCESS
   OF COMMUNITY EMPOWERMENT
SO HEALTH EDUCATION QUARTERLY
LA English
DT Article
AB Community-based participatory development empowers villagers to develop community cohesion and confidence, increase their ability to identify, analyze, and priorize their own needs, and organize the resources to meet these needs.  An important first step in the process involves establishing a cohesive and functional community group.  The authors believe that this is best accomplished through villagers' critical examination of their experiences with development including their understanding of reasons for success or failure, and the gradual emergence of a model of working together that acknowledges and builds on participation and collective expertise.  This approach to development is demonstrating encouraging results in a rural area of western Nepal in a university affiliated Canadian/Nepali Health Development Project.  This paper describes two mini-projects to illustrate the evolution of group formation through reflection, analysis, and action, and identifies outcomes that could serve as indicators of community empowerment.  The paper also presents a generic model of empowerment, and offers lessons learned by the project through the application of the empowerment process to sustainable health development.

TI PARTNERSHIP IN RURAL WATER-SUPPLY AND SANITATION - A CASE-STUDY FROM
   BANGLADESH
SO HEALTH POLICY AND PLANNING
LA English
DT Article
AB A non-governmental organization (NGO) for drinking water supply and sanitation conducted a two-year rural Water Supply and Sanitation (WSS) project in wide areas of rural Bangladesh. The project provided handpumps, latrines, and hygiene education to rural people through NGO partners. Its performance was evaluated through interviews with women users, women pump caretakers and trainers from partner NGOs.
   Of 295 health NGOs (partners), 233 NGOs participated in the water supply programme and 153 of them participated in the sanitation programme. This multi-agency collaboration demonstrated the potential for reaching widespread underserved and unserved people in a logistically efficient way. About 100 000 people were provided with access to handpumps. The potential for revolving the financial assistance in sanitary latrine production/promotion was observed. The project, however, lacked the 'soft-ware' achievements, that is, community participation, personal hygiene practices and effective use and maintenance of the WSS provisions. This reconfirms the difficulties experienced in this field, even at multi-agency collaboration levels. Sustainable measures for 'hardware' as well as 'software' activities should be addressed appropriately at multi-agency levels also.

SO HUMAN ECOLOGY

ID ITURI FOREST; DEFORESTATION; HABITAT; AMAZON; ZAIRE
AB The rate of rain forest clearing throughout central Africa is of national and international interest because it affects both the region's contribution to global warming and impacts the sustainable productive capacity of its natural resource base.  The size and inaccessibility of much of central Africa makes remote sensing imagery the most suitable data source for regional land cover mapping and land transformation monitoring.  Present image availability is poor.  Most regional studies have had to rely on coarse resolution AVHRR 1 km data that fails to detect the small-scale agricultural clearings that are the primary cause of land cover change throughout the region.  This study demonstrates that higher spatial resolution Landsat MSS imagery, which comprises the most available, geographically comprehensive and longest time series dataset, is too coarse to map land cover in low population density areas typical of most of central Africa.  Furthermore, this study cautions that the use of high resolution imagery without detailed collateral field data on population density and land use practices while generating superficially plausible results, will most probably produce highly inaccurate estimates of land cover and land transformation.  Policies for future regional remote sensing surveys of central Africa should focus on acquisition of higher spatial, spectral, and radiometric resolution imagery and must be accompanied by detailed, systematic field data collection.

The treatments comprised cotton hybrids or varieties ['NHB 2, 'NHH 302', PH 93', 'LRA 5166' and 'PA 141' ('Namdeo')] as main plots and 5 N levels (0, 40, 80, 120 and 160 kg N/ha) as subplots.  Pooled data indicated that varieties 'PH 93 and 'LRA 5166' and hybrid 'NHH 302' performed well and gave higher seed-cotton yield than 'NHB 12' and 'PA 141'.  Variety 'PH 93' gave the highest monetary returns.  The performance of 'NHH 302' and 'LRA 5166' was also equally good.  The cost:  benefit ratio was highest from 'PH 93', followed by 'LRA 5166' and both varieties proved significantly superior to the others, indicating sustainability of G. hirsutum varieties over G. hirsutum x G. barbadense hybrid ('NHB 12') and desi variety ('PA 141').  Application of 160 kg N/ha enhanced the yield of seed-cotton yield compared with all the lower levels of N, so also the net monetary returns and cost:  benefit ratio except with 120 kg N/ha.

TI POPULATION - ITS CHALLENGE TO ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL-SCIENTISTS
SO INTERNATIONAL SOCIAL SCIENCE JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
AB The role of population growth in economic development, and more recently in sustainable development, is open to variable interpretations depending on the starting premises of the social scientists concerned. This article argues that it is fundamentally important in this perspective to distinguish between population growth and human capital growth. In particular, it finds a complex nexus between these variables - the policy regime and its stability, i.e. the incentives for a sustainable management of the resource base - and the resulting economic and social welfare. Necessary but far from sufficient conditions for sustainable development during periods of population growth are identified at the macro level. Adequate domestic savings and a policy mix that stimulates human capital formation and technological innovation is crucial to sustaining welfare when a population is growing. In line with this, at the micro level it appears that increasing emphasis should be placed on economic and social aspects closely related to removal of gender discrimination, provision of access to primary education, health, and job opportunities as key conditions for successful population policies irrespective of religious or cultural setting.

TI GENDER ISSUES AND POPULATION-CHANGE - TRADITION, TECHNOLOGY AND SOCIAL
   TURBULENCE
SO INTERNATIONAL SOCIAL SCIENCE JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
AB The purpose of this article is to enumerate some key gender issues in relation to population change in India in the wider context of the emancipation of women and social transformation. Unfortunately, the force of modernization reflected by modern technology, especially reproductive technology, has helped the perpetuation of traditional social norms such as a marked preference for sons. Far from helping the cause of women, such technology has put into operation a family planning programme which is insensitive to them. It is argued that the only way to promote sustainable women's development is to make a paradigm shift and focus attention on the new generation and in particular, girls in the 6-18 age group. A strategy to ensure 100 per cent literacy for women, a high level of secondary-level school enrolment for girls, and skill formation with a view to employment and income generation is advocated. In this context, the fulfilment of the basic needs of the people is of paramount importance. The article also sums up the main arguments advanced by leading women's organizations in recent years to focus attention on gender issues. It highlights the role of amniocentesis and pre-birth sex determination tests and argues that this unholy alliance between tradition and technology will lead to social turbulence on an increasing scale, unless corrective steps are taken and a bold action plan launched.

AB Total Quality implies an enterprise-wide continuous improvement strategy.  Most Batch Process manufacturing companies today, however, lack the information infrastructure that would enable total quality.  This paper addresses the technology related issues of implementing a sustainable total quality strategy.  We will show through examples how technology can be strategically aligned to the business plan through the logical stages of Vision, Strategy, Planning and Execution.  We will also present Models that relate information technology to the strategic and tactical aspects of Activity Based Management (ABM) and ISO 9000.  These models will show how SP88 is applied to flexible batch and simple batch manufacturing, highlighting architectural and operational differences.  We will show that, while SP88 does not dictate implementation, there are definite tradeoffs related to where the functional boundaries are placed between computers and PLCs.  A look at current information technologies and trends will offer companies insight toward making future decisions regarding plant floor system components.

TI TOWARD A SUSTAINABLE SOCIETY - WASTE MINIMIZATION THROUGH
   ENVIRONMENTALLY CONSCIOUS CONSUMING
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID RECYCLING BEHAVIOR; PROGRAM; CONSERVATION; COMMITMENT; ATTITUDES
AB The experiment was an educational intervention that promoted and described an ongoing environmental tagging program located in a chain of three local grocery stores.  Model Community, a nonprofit community organization, originated the environmental product tagging program that was present throughout the experimental educational intervention and was also responsible for sponsoring educational efforts in the local elementary schools and in the media.  Over the period of a year, the experimental intervention was expected to stimulate self-reported environmentally conscious consuming above the level generated by the tagging program alone and above the levels reported by shoppers who did not shop at the experimental stores.  Environmentally conscious consuming or precycling implies buying products packaged in recyclable materials, buying least waste packaged (bulk or minimally packaged) products, and buying ''safer earth'' (nontoxic or alternatives to harsh chemicals) products.  Contrary to expectations, there was no significant interaction effect of year (preintervention vs. postintervention) and group (experimental store vs. control group) on self-reported environmentally friendly consuming, implying that the experimental educational intervention did not have an effect.  An investigation of the significant main effect of shopping at the environmentally tagged stores showed a significant positive effect on purchasing less toxic products, knowledge about Model Community, and awareness of the environmental tagging program.  An examination of more aggressive educational campaigns in future studies is warranted because of more overall positive (although not significant) environmental shopping behaviors reported in 1990, when there was an active education program for Model Community, than in 1991, when the program ceased.

AB The effects of eight summer rotation crops on nematode densities and yields of subsequent spring vegetable crops were determined in field studies conducted in north Florida from 1991 to 1993. The crop sequence was as follows: (i) rotation crops during summer 1991; (ii) cover crop of rye (Secale cereale) during winter 1991-92; (iii) 'Lemondrop L' squash (Cucurbita pepo) during spring 1992; (iv) rotation crops during summer 1992; (v) rye during winter 1992-93; (vi) 'Classic' eggplant (Solanum melongena) during spring 1993. The eight summer crop rotation treatments were as follows: 'Hale' castor (Ricinus communis), velvetbean (Mucuna deeringiana), sesame (Sesamum indicum), American jointvetch (Aeschynomene americana), weed fallow, 'SX-17' sorghum-sudangrass (Sorghum bicolor x S. sudanense), 'Kirby' soybean (Glycine max), and 'Clemson Spineless' okra (Hibiscus esculentus) as a control. Rotations with castor, velvetbean, American jointvetch, and sorghum-sudangrass were most effective in maintaining the lowest population densities of Meloidogyne spp. (a mixture of M. incognita race 1 and M. arenaria race 1), but Paratrichodorus minor built up in the sorghum-sudangrass rotation. Yield of squash was lower (P less-than-or-equal-to 0.05) following sorghum-sudangrass than after any of the other treatments except fallow. Yield of eggplant was greater (P less-than-or-equal-to 0.05) following castor, sesame, or American jointvetch than following okra or fallow. Several of the rotation crops evaluated here may be useful for managing nematodes in the field and for improving yields of subsequent vegetable crops.

AB The successful operation of JET in the presence of beryllium target plates has been limited by overheating of the plates. Active cooling of these components is investigated as a way of solving this problem. Tests carried out at JET suggest that water-cooled components comprising beryllium clad to heat sinks have a safe margin of steady state operation up to 12 MW/m(2). Results from the irradiation of inertially cooled beryllium blocks suggest a limit of similar to 12 MW/m(2) to be sustainable by S65B beryllium without low-cycle fatigue cracking obtained for initial temperatures > 200 degrees C.

AB Environmental apects is a new topic for ISTVS and it was brought up as a keynote speech at the 11th ISTVS International Conference. Trafficability of forest soils has not received much attention by the ISTVS. It concerns mainly the forestry sector, but also military, construction works and not to forget recreational activities, and may have implications on general water quality. Over the last decade, concern regarding the preservation of forest environment has increased dramatically. At a European minister meeting in June 1993, an agreement was made on maintaining biodiversity and sustainability of the forests. The implications of these ''restrictions'' are increased awareness of damage on the ground and on remaining trees, site adapted operations and high demands on logging operation machinery and methods. Some of the consequences of these ''restrictions'' for the forestry sector are discussed in the article and possibilities for using environmentally friendly techniques and methods are assessed. It is pointed out that much more knowledge in the areas of forest-soil mechanics and techniques for handling large trees with relatively small machines will be needed to face future environmental challenges. In the last part of the article, papers submitted to the 11th ISTVS International Conference session on Environmental consideration are reviewed.

AB This paper presents a model for designing wormhole routing algorithms. A unique feature of the model is that it is not based on adding physical or virtual channels to direct networks (although it can be applied to networks with extra channels). Instead, the model is based on analyzing the directions in which packets can turn in a network and the cycles that the turns can form. Prohibiting just enough turns to break all of the cycles produces routing algorithms that are deadlock free, livelock free, minimal or nonminimal, and highly adaptive. This paper focuses on the two most common network topologies for wormhole routing, rt-dimensional meshes and k-ary n-cubes without extra channels. In such networks, just a quarter of the turns must be prohibited to prevent deadlock. The remaining three quarters of the turns allow routing to be adaptive. Adaptive routing algorithms are described for two-dimensional meshes, n-dimensional meshes k-ary n-cubes, and hypercubes. Simulations of adaptive and nonadaptive routing algorithms show which algorithm has the lowest latencies and highest sustainable throughput depends on the pattern of message traffic. For nonuniform traffic, adaptive routing algorithms generally perform better than nonadaptive ones.

AB Modern agriculture depends on high inputs of inorganic fertilizers and chemical pesticides for the maintenance of soil fertility and pest control and tends towards monoculture of cash crop varieties that require much inputs. The sustainability of modern agriculture has become a topic of great concern among policy makers, researchers and farmers in Taiwan. ?he researches on sustainable agriculture-were conducted by various research institutes in Taiwan. The problems encountered in implementing sustainable agriculture in Taiwan were discussed, basing on the data of experimental results with regard to the following factors: (1) soil nutrient management, (2) input of organic matter in soil, (3) crop rotation and interplanting, (4) green manure planting, (5)minimum tillage, (6) integrated pest management, (7) non-chemical pesticides, (8) weed management, and (9) quality of organic foods. In addition, the government policy and practice of organic farming by the farmers in Taiwan are also described.

AB Low External Input Sustainable Agriculture (LEISA) is receiving increased attention, both as a sustainable alternative to Green Revolution-like strategies making intensive use of external inputs, and as a strategy of sustainable agriculture in resource-poor environments where no or very few external inputs are used.  The evaluation of LEISA field-experiences in the Philippines and in Ghana shows that the potential of LEISA to improve ecological and/or socio-economic sustainability depends on site-specific factors in the first place.  In areas with a high production potential, LEISA can simultaneously improve ecological sustainability and farmers' socio-economic conditions by reduced use of external inputs.  In areas with a low production potential, LEISA can stabilise and restore the carrying capacity, but generally has limited potential to improve socio-economic conditions for growing populations, and an increased production may also result from a further depletion of natural resources, and by a limited number of farmers.  Other factors that can influence the potential and the applicability of LEISA are the production dip and the rehabilitation period involved, high labour requirements, land-ownership aspects, gender issues, constraints to implement a participatory technology development approach, macro-economic aspects, government influences and information dissemination.  Together with the site-specific conditions, these aspects should be considered in planning and evaluation of LEISA techniques.

AB The protection of the Wadden Sea has improved over the past 15 years. A series of national initiatives has been taken to protect the Wadden Sea. For more than ten years the Wadden Sea countries have been working together on the basis of the Joint Declaration on the Wadden Sea. In 1987 this co-operation was formalized and enforced by the establishment of a Common Wadden Sea Secretarial. The trilateral co-operation was intensified and was placed in a wider international context. The common policy was worked out in detail and the latest results were laid down in the Declaration of the Sixth Trilateral Governmental Wadden Sea Conference on the Protection of the Wadden Sea. The protection of the Wadden Sea is as yet not complete. We have to continue our efforts to achieve as far as possible a natural and sustainable ecosystem in which natural processes proceed in an undisturbed way. This is illustrated by the Quality Status Report of the Wadden Sea, in which the current ecological condition of the Wadden Sea is described and evaluated. The first step that should be taken now is to designate a coherent special conservation area and to agree on boundaries for this area on a common basis. In addition, a co-ordinated Management Plan will be drawn up including common ecological targets and accompanying measures. In this respect the new insights and recommendations of this symposium will be highly useful.

AB The development of ecological targets as a political and management tool is discussed. After the Wadden Sea has been recognised as an area worth conserving, aims and goals have been rather different both in time and space. In the Netherlands, a guiding principle was developed in which the choice was made for the conservation or where necessary the restoration of the Wadden Sea as a natural area. The development of sectoral management plans based on the guiding principle was the accepted policy. In Germany, the choice was for the establishment of national parks in which human impact was forbidden as far as possible. Because there was no clear goal, targets were developed. These range from aiming at a specified abundance of a number of selected species, to aiming for a natural development without a specific quantitative goal. Other targets are aiming at good background values, both chemical, physical and disturbance. The latest development is the use of descriptive targets and quantified background values. Each method has advantages and disadvantages and we will have to use a mix of them. It is clear that new indicators for sustainability should be developed. These should be structure and process parameters indicating the intrinsic values of ecosystems.

AB We exposed short-tailed field voles, Microtus agrestis, to transient decreases in ambient temperature to evaluate the limits of their sustainable metabolic rates. We predicted that voles exposed to transient low temperatures would elevate their food intake until they reached some alimentary limit and thereafter they would withdraw reserves. During short-term (24-h) exposure to temperatures below the lower critical temperature (25 degrees C) daily food intake actually decreased significantly to a minimum of 1.51 +/- 0.41 g at 10 degrees C but was greater at 5 degrees and -5 degrees C. Weight loss (g) increased significantly with decreasing temperature; however at -5 degrees C vole mass increased. During more prolonged exposure for 4 d, food intake increased significantly with the duration of cold exposure (5 degrees and 15 degrees C) to a maximum on days 3 and 4. In a separate experiment voles were randomly exposed for 3-d intervals to a range of temperatures from 20 degrees to 5 degrees C and were returned to 25 degrees C for 3 d between exposures. Both food intake and weight loss increased significantly with decreasing temperature; voles gained mass at 20 degrees and 25 degrees C. There was 40% mortality in voles exposed to -5 degrees C for 24 h (n = 10). When voles were exposed to 5 degrees C for 6 d before they were exposed to -5 degrees C, there was zero mortality at -5 degrees C for 12 d (n = 6). The basal metabolism (BMR) of voles before transient cold exposure, 1.71 +/- 0.41 mL . min(-1), was not significantly different from that of the same voles after transient cold exposure (2.17 +/- 0.71 mL . min(-1)). Maximum food intake at 5 degrees C (5.67 +/- 1.45 g . d(-1)) represented 1.7 times BMR, which is considerably lower than the limit on alimentary uptake of seven times BMR previously suggested. Our results suggest that the voles were using a strategy of energy minimization during transient cold exposure that combined increased energy intake with body reserve utilization. However, the duration of cold exposure had a profound effect on this strategy. The mortality data in this species at low temperatures combined with levels of food intake relative to BMR suggest that sustainable metabolic rate is not limited by constraints imposed centrally by the alimentary system but rather by constraints at the sites of energy utilization.

AB We investigated the extent to which the changes in basal metabolic rate (BMR), gut morphology, and food intake (FI) that typically occur during cold acclimation in small mammals can be explained by the concept of alimentary-mediated limits to sustainable metabolic energy expenditure. Adult short-tailed field voles (Microtus agrestis) were cold stressed by continuous exposure to 5 degrees C. Exposure for 10, 20, 50, and 100 d (n = 6 in all cases) produced significant changes in oxygen consumption (Vo(2)), mass, FI, and the dry weight of a variety of morphological parameters when compared with voles that were not cold exposed (n = 8). At 10 degrees, 20 degrees, and 25 degrees C, Vo(2) (mL.min(-1)) increased significantly with the duration of cold exposure. After 100 d cold exposure Vo(2) had increased by more than 50% at each test temperature. Food intake (g.d(-1)) increased significantly by 106% after 10 d cold exposure but did not increase further with increased exposure time. The ratio of FI (J.h(-1)) to BMR (J.h(-1)) was 1.2 in controls and increased to 2.7 after 10 d cold exposure. Thereafter the ratio decreased, and after 100 d cold exposure FI:BMR was not significantly different from control levels. The mass of cold-exposed voles increased significantly with duration of exposure. Masses of the following morphological parameters increased with increasing duration of cold exposure; whole body mass, carcass, skeleton, pelage, subcutaneous fat, liver, kidney, lung, and interscapular brown fat (BAT). There was no significant relationship between duration of cold exposure and the masses of muscle, large intestine heart,and brain. Using stepwise multiple regression analysis we showed that variation in BMR was linked mostly to changes in skeletal mass. However, when skeletal mass was removed as an independent variable from the analysis, BAT, muscle, and gut mass entered as significant predict ors, together explaining 55.5% of the variation in BMR. Although FI increased during cold exposure, the increase (106%) was apparently insufficient to precipitate a hypertrophic response in the gut. Nevertheless BMR did increase as duration of cold exposure increased, probably linked to an increase in BAT mass and thus thermogenic capacity. We cannot support the hypothesis that the changes that typically occur in BMR, food intake, and gut morphology during cold acclimation are a consequence of alimentary-mediated limits to sustainable metabolic rate.

AB The related terms, ''sustainable'' and ''sustainability,'' have become popular and are used to describe a wide variety of activities which are generally ecologically laudable. At the same time, the term 'compromise'' is heard more frequently because the needs of the environment often are in conflict with the needs of humans. A brief examination of the question of compromise shows that a series of ten compromises, each of which saves 70% of the remaining environment, results in the saving of only 3% of the environment. Judging from the ways in which the terms ''sustainable'' and ''sustainability'' are used, their definitions are not very precise, especially when compromises are involved. An attempt is made here to give firm definition to these terms and to translate the definition into a series of laws and hypotheses which, it is hoped, will clarify the implications of their use. These are followed by a series of observations and predictions that relate to ''sustainability.''

AB A review of the green national accounts literature shows that there is little agreement on whether to adjust gross or net product, or on the sign of some of the adjustments proposed.  A series of models is presented, following Weitzman, to examine the treatment in the national accounts of living resources, heterogeneous resource deposits, resource discoveries, environmental services, carbon emissions and defensive expenditures by households.  A key conclusion is that expanding the accounts to include non-market environmental services results in a measure of welfare rather than product (although net national product is the starting point), and that the level of environmental services is an integral component of this welfare measure.  These results are compared with the standard national accounts.  Greener measures of wealth per capita and savings rates will have more policy relevance in gauging progress towards sustainable development than adjustments to national product.

AB The development of conservation tillage in sub-humid to semi-arid climates originated from the need to conserve soil moisture and reduce soil erosion.  Descriptions of conservation tillage in the above climatic zones are generally based upon the degree of soil surface residue cover.  There is a need, however, to characterize conservation tillage for humid temperature climates, especially those with a cool season, subject to excessive precipitation and high levels of crop residue.  Appropriate conservation tillage practices for such regions may make judicious use of cultivation to address soil and climatic constraints, and use tillage for straw incorporation to avoid the adverse effects of excessive crop residues on the growth of the following crop.  Interaction between soil type and precipitation, in humid climates, emphasizes the need to group soil or land resources according to soil tillage requirement.  Major attributes of conservation tillage in humid climates would be the continuum of live soil cover especially in the non-crop period, use of mulches and residue incorporation, and speed and efficiency of crop establishment.  These attributes can be achieved through minimum tillage, rotational tillage, and attention to tillage timing.  Besides their ability to conserve soil, conservation tillage practices in humid regions should also address farming system sustainability in terms of energy conservation and nutrient management.

TI SUSTAINABILITY OF SOIL-STRUCTURE QUALITY IN RICE PADDY SOYBEAN CROPPING
   SYSTEMS IN SOUTH SULAWESI, INDONESIA
SO SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
DE CROP ROTATION; NONLIMITING AVAILABLE WATER; POROSITY; SOIL STRENGTH
AB In South Sulawesi, paddy rice (Oryza sativa L.) is generally double cropped with soyabean (Glycine max L.) in the dry season.  Decline in soya-bean yield and response to fertilisers after some years indicates that these cropping systems may not be sustainable in terms of soil structural properties.  We investigated the deterioration of soil structure by measuring penetration resistance, air-filled porosity, bulk density and plant available water content in rice paddy-soya-bean rotations of 10, 16 and 21 years duration.  These results were compared with those from a 21 year rotation in which rice was followed by grass fallow.  The non-limiting available water range was used to assess cropping system differences.
   Rice-soya-bean cropping systems were detrimental to soil physical conditions in the long term.  Bulk density and soil strength increased and air-filled porosity decreased significantly over a period of 21 years.  At this time, aeration porosity at the upper drained limit was below the critical value for adequate aeration, soil penetration resistance exceeded the limits for root growth within the plant available water content range, and the non-limiting range of plant available water was narrowed.  These results indicate that double cropping is unsustainable in terms of soil structure quality.  Shorter periods (10 years) of double cropping did not cause the same level of deterioration and the grass fallow system had no discernible limitation to available water as a result of poor aeration or high soil strength.  We conclude that grass fallow cropping systems appear to be more sustainable and in long-term double cropped systems, a period of grass fallow is probably required to restore soil structure to a favourable state.

TI MAINTAINING SOIL FERTILITY UNDER INCREASING LAND-USE PRESSURE IN THE
   MIDDLE MOUNTAINS OF NEPAL
SO SOIL USE AND MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB Nepal is facing a serious problem of being unable to maintain soil fertility in agriculture and forestry.  Land use practices initiated over the past 10-15 years have resulted in insufficient nutrient inputs, while biomass use and production have increased.  Changes in forest soil fertility have resulted from intensive use of forest biomass for animal feed and collection of forest litter for use in agriculture.  The agricultural fertility changes have resulted from intensifying annual crop rotations from 1.5 to 2.5 crops and insufficient inputs.  The removal of biomass from the forest has curtailed the natural organic cycle by virtually eliminating nutrient inputs.
   The soils are very acidic and have little C, N, P and exchangeable bases, but have large amounts of active iron.  Basic nutrients are not sustained in agriculture and differences in inputs and management between irrigated and rainfed agricultural systems are becoming visible.  Irrigated fields show the largest cation content because of input from irrigation water.  Rainfed agricultural sites, which receive the most nutrients (fertilizers and manure), have the highest pH values and C and N contents.  All soil fertility conditions are marginal and put into question the long-term sustainability of current levels of production.  Alterations in the cropping intensity are needed and the introduction of nitrogen fixing trees and crops seems to be the most viable option towards sustainability.

DT Article
DE MALE FISCHER-344 RATS; SUSTAINABILITY; REVERSIBILITY; CARCINOGENESIS
AB Ethyl acrylate (EA) is a known forestomach carcinogen in both rats and mice. Recent work in this laboratory indicated that carcinogenic doses of EA administered by gavage for 13 wk resulted in a sustained increase in forestomach epithelial hyperplasia as long as exposure to EA continued. However, hyperplasia regressed and no forestomach neoplasms were seen after a 19-mo recovery period. Current studies were designed to further investigate the time required for sustained hyperplasia to lead to neoplasia as well as the organ specificity of EA-induced cell proliferation/hyperplasia vs carcinogenicity. EA was administered at 200 mg/kg (po) to male Fischer-344 rats, 5 days/wk. Squamous cell proliferation/hyperplasia was observed in the forestomach of all rats that received EA for 6 or 12 mo. Treatment of rats with EA for 12 mo followed by 2 mo of recovery resulted in the development of forestomach papillomas in 2 of 5 treated rats. Furthermore, animals treated for 12 mo and allowed 9 mo of recovery exhibited an increase in forestomach squamous cell carcinomas and papillomas at a combined incidence of 4 in 13. In contrast, animals treated with EA for 6 mo and allowed 2 or 15 mo of recovery exhibited a time-dependent regression of cell proliferation and did not develop forestomach neoplasms, No significant elevation in liver cell proliferation or neoplasia was seen at any time in any of the rats included in the present study, further confirming the organ specificity in the relationship between EA-induced cell proliferation and carcinogenicity. In conclusion, EA resulted in increased cell proliferation in the target organ of carcinogenicity (forestomach) but not in nontarget organs such as the lives. This work indicates that cell proliferation, sustained for a sufficient period of time, results in the development of neoplasia despite cessation of chemical administration. Furthermore, a temporal relationship exists between EA-induced epithelial cell proliferation and forestomach carcinogenicity.

ID TRACHOMA; INTERVENTION; COMMUNITY; EPIDEMIOLOGY; RISK
AB A participatory strategy to increase face washing was designed and tested in central Tanzania. Changing children's face-washing behaviour is postulated to be important in preventing the transmission of eye disease, particularly blinding trachoma. The strategy used non-formal adult education techniques at neighbourhood level meetings to build a community consensus to keep children's faces clean for the prevention of eye disease. Men, women, schoolchildren, traditional healers and village social groups participated in the intervention. The strategy was evaluated by observing changes in numbers of clean faces of a sample of preschool children in the village. Clean faces increased from 9% to 33% over the course of a year. Factors which were related to sustained change in children's clean faces included distance to water, age of the child, and presence of a corrugated metal roof. Owning cattle was associated with lack of sustainable change in this population.

   PLANT COMMUNITY DYNAMICS
AB Douglas-fir seedlings on the Arcata District, Bureau of Land Management, U.S. Department of the Interior, in central coastal California, were planted in an effort to restore the natural forest to what was then pastureland.  Douglas-fir seedlings were released from a complex forb-grass-fern plant community by applying very large (10-ft square) and very small (2-foot square) durable mulches one month after planting.  The large mulches were installed directly over the existing plant community, and the small mulches were applied over a similar-sized scalp.  Two-foot-square scalps and and untreated control provided additional comparisons.  After five growing seasons, stem diameter (measured at 12 inches above mean groundline) of Douglas-fir seedlings with large mulches was 1.61 inches, and of seedlings with small mulches was 1.36 inches.  Only seedlings with large mulches were significantly larger than counterparts with small scalps (1.22 inches) or in the control (1.26 inches) after 5 years.  In spite of high cost, the promising role of large mulches for establishing fast-growing Douglas-fir seedlings on a harsh site and the increased stability and sustainability that the future trees will bring to the more natural plant community give large mulches a place in the toolkit of ecosystem managers.

TI INVOLVING WOMEN IN WATER AND SANITATION INITIATIVES - AN ACTION
   RESEARCH-PROJECT IN AN EGYPTIAN VILLAGE
SO WATER INTERNATIONAL
LA English
DT Article
AB It is now widely recognized that community participation, especially by women, is essential to the success of water and sanitation interventions in poor communities in the nonindustrialized world. Women are the major users of water systems in rural areas and have many ideas about how these could be improved. Because of cultural differences, especially in women's status and social power, there is no single prescription for women's participation in water and sanitation programs. What is needed are local studies as models. This article describes the experiences, in an Egyptian village in the Nile delta, of an action/research team that sought to facilitate improvements in water, sanitation, and environmental health by working with village women, and in association with a health education program. The women identified two problems that they then worked to correct, under the guidance of the research team: a malfunctioning standpipe and a highly polluted canal. The standpipe was repaired but it proved more difficult to take action aboiut the polluted canal. The article discusses the lessons learned from these activities. The model presented recognizes the importance of the participation of community members, women and men, but also that many interventions need the approval and support, not only of local community organizations, but of local and regional government authorities, if they are to be replicable and sustainable.

TI HAS THE GREEN-REVOLUTION BEEN SUSTAINED - THE QUANTITATIVE IMPACT OF THE
   SEED-FERTILIZER REVOLUTION IN PAKISTAN REVISITED
SO WORLD DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB Quantitative impacts of the Green Revolution on food production in the Punjab of Pakistan are reviewed and the effects of different technologies on wheat yields over the past two decades decomposed.  New quantitative evidence of sustainability problems in irrigated systems is presented.  The yield increases expected in the post-Green Revolution period from the further spread of modern wheat varieties, a tripling of fertilizer dosage, and the release of newer higher yielding varieties have been cancelled by problems resulting from increased cropping intensity, use of poor quality groundwater, low fertilizer efficiency, and increased weed and disease losses.  New directions in institutional policies and research and extension strategies are outlined to improve efficiency and sustainability in wheat production and prevent Pakistan from becoming a major food grain importer in the coming decades.

AB In an effort to identify an adequate and sustainable natural source of the recently described anti-HIV drug development candidate calanolide A, we undertook chemical and biological studies of the latex exuded from trees of the genus Calophyllum. Although we found that calanolide A was not present in latex from the original source species, C. lanigerum var. austrocoriaceum, we did observe that a related coumarin, costatolide, was abundant in latex of C. teysmannii var. inophylloide. Costatolide is currently being evaluated as a possible alternative to calanolide A for drug development.

AB The third generation synchrotron facilities such as the 7-GeV Advanced Photon Source generate X-ray beams with very high heat load and heat flux levels. Certain front end and beamline components will be required to sustain total heat loads of 3.8 to 15 kW and heat flux levels exceeding 400 W/mm2 even during the first phase of this project. Grazing geometry and enhanced heat transfer techniques in the design of such components reduce the heat flux levels below the 30 W/mm2 level, which is sustainable by the special copper materials routinely used in the component design. Although the resulting maximum surface temperatures are sustainable, structural stresses and fatigue issues remain important concerns. Cyclic thermal loads have a propensity to cause spallation and thermal striping. As such, the steady-state part of the problem is much easier to understand and handle than the time-dependent part. Ease of bonding as well as ultrahigh vacuum and radiation compatibility are additional constraints on material selection for these components. The two copper materials, which are very commonly used in synchrotron components, are the traditional oxygen-free high-conductivity copper (OFHC) and the newer dispersion-strengthened copper, Glidcop. New materials are also appearing in heat sinks or heat spreaders that are bonded to the base copper in some fashion. These are either partially transparent to X-rays and have engineered volumetric heating and/or are very thermally conductive to spread the thermal load in a preferred way. These materials are reviewed critically for high-heat-load or high-heat-flux applications in synchrotrons.

ID STABILITY; CAPSIZE
AB We study the capsize of model ships excited by the naturally propagating wavefront created by a laboratory wave maker that is suddenly switched on. Such a test is shown to give a good measure of the capsizability of a hull form, and the resulting transient capsize diagram is compared with earlier studies of premature transient capsize under stepped sinusoidal forcing. Some useful design observations are also made, based on the sustainable wave slope of a vessel under tuned, worst-case, beam-sea excitation. Realistic wind loading can give a 30% reduction in the sustainable wave slope. emphasizing that the capsizability of a symmetric, unbiased, vessel is an unreliable guide to its safety at sea.

AB Objective.-To implement simplified infectious disease surveillance and epidemic disease control during the relocation of Bhutanese refugees to Nepal.
   Design.-Longitudinal observation study of mortality and morbidity.
   Setting.-Refugee health units in six refugee camps housing 73 500 Bhutanese refugees in the eastern tropical lowland between Nepal and India.
   Interventions.-Infectious disease surveillance and community-based programs to promote vitamin A supplementation, measles vaccination, oral rehydration therapy, and early use of antibiotics to treat acute respiratory infection.
   Main Outcome Measures.-Crude mortality rate, mortality rate for children younger than 5 years, and cause-specific mortality.
   Results.-Crude mortality rates up to 1.15 deaths per 10 000 persons per day were reported during the first 6 months of surveillance The leading causes of death were measles, diarrhea, and acute respiratory infections. Surveillance data were used to institute changes in public health management including measles vaccination, vitamin A supplementation, and control programs for diarrhea and acute respiratory infections and to ensure rapid responses to cholera, Shigella dysentery, and meningoencephalitis. Within 4 months of establishing disease control interventions, crude mortality rates were reduced by 75% and were below emergency levels.
   Conclusions.-Simple, sustainable disease surveillance in refugee populations is essential during emergency relief efforts. Data can be used to direct community-based public health interventions to control common infectious diseases and reduce high mortality rates among refugees while placing a minimal burden on health workers.

DE TROPICAL DISEASE; WORKSHOP; SMALL GRANT; INTERDISCIPLINARY RESEARCH
AB In recent years, in an endeavour to increase social and economic nresearch in tropical diseases, WHO/TDR has used a number of alternative models to develop social science research capability in countries endemic for the designated tropical diseases. These have included small grants schemes to encourage junior researchers to gain familiarity with the subject area and methods, and protocol development and methodology workshops, either for specific research topics (e.g. adolescent women's health; community perceptions of schistosomiasis) or for any topic of interest to the participants. Participants have included medical researchers, social science researchers, and interdisciplinary teams (e.g. a medical researcher and a collaborating social scientist). This paper develops a typology and critically analyses these alternative approaches to developing research capability, and assesses their effectiveness in terms of cost, short-term effectiveness, and sustainability of the initiative.

TI REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH RESEARCH IN CHINA - THE FORD-FOUNDATION INITIATIVES

LA English
DT Article
DE REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH; SOCIAL SCIENCE RESEARCH; QUALITATIVE METHOD;
   EMPOWERMENT
AB Increasing demographic and epidemiological evidence shows that maternal health problems are widespread and are linked to social, cultural, and economic factors, in particular, to women's status in society. Thus, there is an urgent need to expand existing knowledge about these influences on reproductive health and to empower women to gain control over them. To this end, there is a need for a comprehensive, interdisciplinary approach with an emphasis on social science research and training. The Ford Foundation, after an extensive review of its work in population and development, embarked on a new, ten-year, comprehensive reproductive health program for the 1990s. This paper describes one component of that program, a partnership with the All China Women's Federation to sponsor a series of reproductive health research activities, It examines the development and evaluates the positive and negative outcomes of the project, which commenced in 1991, from the perspective of a consultant involved in the process. So far, the project has generated interest in reproductive health in at least twenty-one Chinese provinces and has fostered a real partnership between the sponsoring and the collaborating agency. Based on the immediate outcomes of a research competition designed to identify research projects and investigators, of participant evaluation of the methodology training course, and of the strategies aimed at building capabilities and strengthening institutions in order to ensure future success, I conclude that the Ford Foundation's reproductive health initiative in China is a worthwhile and sustainable project.

DE RESEARCH STRENGTHENING; FUNDING; SUSTAINABILITY; WHO; CAPS
AB The need to strengthen research capability has led organizations to provide research-oriented training programs, including various short courses and protocol development workshops, at the end of which it is anticipated that the participants will be able to carry out the research work. However, to do research needs more than just training; it also requires funds, a research infrastructure, technical back-up and other support. This paper compares two of these programs from the perspective of an attendant: WHO/TDR's Fieldlines program and the CAPS (Center for AIDS Prevention Studies) International Program. The paper also describes the experience of the approaches that have been used to get research funding. In addition, issues related to sustaining researchers in the field are discussed.

TI A NEW VIEW OF AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTIVITY IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS
LA English
DT Article
AB Agricultural productivity is widely recognized as a critical determinant of both rural welfare and economic growth in Sub-Saharan Africa. Despite this recognition, little is known about the issue. A few studies have presented rudimentary analyses of agricultural productivity in Africa, but the more analytically sophisticated studies of cross-country productivity have essentially ignored Africa. Part of the problem has been the lack of an appropriate output aggregate for African agriculture. In the present paper, I develop such an aggregate and present a new view of cross-country agricultural productivity in Africa. Contrary to previous findings, I find evidence of a notable recovery of African agricultural productivity during the 1980s, although the sustainability of that recovery is in question.

AB In his contribution, ''Guiding Principles for a Sustainable Energy System'', Klaus Meyer-Abich defines five ''criteria'' which a future energy system should meet.  These ''criteria'' must be examined for suitability in evaluating various energy options; some rewording may be necessary.  Criteria must not preclude technical feasibility.  Criteria must be based on technically feasible options and should not be guided by Utopian ideas.  Energy conservation is not a source of energy.  Only technology enables people to produce the energy they need for survival.  Risk minimization must be a goal in this process.

AB Laboratory experiments were conducted to evaluate organic C mineralization of various organic materials added to soils. A soil sample was mixed with organic material to approximate a field application of 9 g organic C kg(-1) soil (0.9% or 50 Mg ha(-1)). The organic materials used were four crop residues [corn (Zea mays L.), soybean (Glycine max L. Merr.), sorghum (Sorghum vulgare Pers.), and alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.)], four animal manures [chicken (Gallus domesticus), pig (Sus scrofa), horse (Equus caballus), and cow (Bes taurus)] and four sewage sludges [Correctionville (Imhoff tank), Charles City (holding tank), Davenport (secondary digester), and Keokuk (primary digester)]. The soil-organic material mixture was incubated under aerobic conditions at room temperature (20+/-2 degrees C) for 30 days. The CO2 evolved was collected in standard KOH solution by continuously passing CO2-free air over the soil. Results showed that, in general, the amounts of CO2-C released increased rapidly initially, but the pattern differed among the organic materials used. More than 50% of the total CO2 produced in 30 days of incubation was evolved in the first 6 days. Expressed as percentages of organic C added, the amounts of CO2 evolved ranged from 27% with corn to 58% with alfalfa. The corresponding percentages for animal manures ranged from 21 to 62% with horse and pig manures, respectively, and for sewage sludges they ranged from 10 to 39% for Charles City and Keokuk sludges. All CO2 evolution data conformed well to a first-order kinetic model. Potentially, readily mineralizable organic C values and first-order rate constants (k) of the organic matter-treated soils ranged from 1.422 g C kg(-1) soil with a k value of 0.0784 day(-1) to 6.253 g C kg(-1) soil with a k value of 0.0300 day(-1). The half-lives of the C remaining in soils ranged from 39 to 54 days for plant materials. The corresponding half-lives for the C remaining from animal manures and sewage sludges ranged from 37 to 169 days and from 39 to 330 days, respectively.

TI BAYESIAN AND RELATED APPROACHES TO FITTING SURPLUS PRODUCTION MODELS
SO CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES
LA English
DT Article
ID YIELD
AB The Schaefer surplus production model relates equilibrium yield to fishing effort and can be fitted using just information on catch and fishing effort. Sometimes, the fitted model predicts a maximum sustainable yield (height of the parabola) that is clearly unrealistic. In this case, one may wish to use prior information on maximum sustainable yield either to constrain the height of the parabola or to provide a prior distribution for Bayesian estimation. To construct a Bayes estimator, one would generally specify a noninformative prior on the residual error variance and, possibly, on the width of the parabola; the prior distribution for height could be obtained by examining fisheries for similar stocks or species on a per unit area basis. Another possibility is to use an empirical Bayes estimator when data from several fisheries (e.g., individual lakes) are available for several years. The methodology is illustrated on catch and effort data for bigeye tuna (Thunnus obesus) and Dungeness crab (Cancer magister). The approach can be extended to other fishery models, including nonequilibrium production models. The prior distribution parameters can be allowed to depend on covariates.

AB The environmental crisis is the greatest challenge in our time. The response must be the organization of a sustainable development. The basic requirement for this is the creation of a circulation economy. The following paper describes the end o the hitherto existing linear form of economy and formulates the conditions of a future cyclic flux of material.

DT Article
AB The fascination of natural cycles is caused by their seeming perfection and nearly complete utilization of byproducts.
   This fascination stimulates chemists to design technical processes from an ecological point of view aimed at imitating cycles in economy.
   As an important example we consider the natural carbon dioxide cycle and its imitation by improved gasification processes of biomass especially combined with other residual materials.
   The vision has to consist in the development of durable concepts for both energy and chemical production concerning the finiteness of natural resources (fossil raw materials).
   The design of ''sustainable processes'' should be included from starting technical developments also for combined recycling tasks.

AB Vancouver's high growth rate over the past decade has been accompanied by far-reaching transformational processes, including economic and social change ('restructuring'), the reshaping of metropolitan space ('reconfiguration'), and new trading and socio-cultural relationships ('reorientation'). Impacts of growth and change upon a uniquely fragile environment have led to the establishment of growth management as strategic planning priority both at the metropolitan and municipal levels. At the same time, there are legitimate concerns about Vancouver's economic prospects given the city's exposure to exogenous influences within a context of accelerating market integration. These circumstances suggest the urgency of exploring planning innovation incorporating principles and dimensions of sustainability (ecological, social and economic) within the Georgia Basin, Vancouver's bioregion and economic spillover zone.

AB Four myths threaten Canadian medical education and the health care system. These myths are: (1) that health care costs are out of control; (2) that physicians can stimulate demand for health services; (3) that health research is a nicety; and (4) that health is an externality to considerations of economic policy. These myths tend to focus current concerns on sustainability, rather than on the ideal of continuous improvement. Comparative examinations reveal that Canadian health care spending is not out of line with that in other developed countries and suggest relative efficiency in the Canadian health care system. A broad and introspective approach to medicine is required that can critically address diverse issues such as variance in clinical practice patterns and the impact of poverty and unemployment. If health care educators can enshrine this approach in medical schools, professional medicine will be able to respond to the changing needs of Canadian society.

AB In this paper I review the evolution of the sustainability concept. This is followed by a description of three ''classical'' systems of sustainable agriculture. None of these systems were or are capable of generating growth of output consistent with modem rates of growth in demand. I then turn to three unresolved analytical issues that continue to divide the conventional resource economics and the sustainable development communities. In a closing section I argue sustainable growth in agricultural production should be viewed as a research agenda rather than as a package of practices that is available to producers whether in developed or developing countries.

AB Life-cycle assessment (LCA) is a theoretically attractive approach for evaluating resource consumption and environmental mental emissions associated with the production, use, and disposal of products. Current LCA guidelines suggest adherence to conventions that can significantly affect results. Conventions of special importance in LCAs of forest products are those pertaining to sustainability of natural resources, recyclability and biodegradability of products, and use of renewable energy in manufacturing processes. More general methodological issues (e.g., relating emissions to impacts, site-to-site variability in loads, data quality) are also important in forest-product LCAs.

TI ESTIMATING THE PARAMETERS OF THE STOCK-RECRUITMENT MODEL OF RICKER FROM
   A YIELD-PER-RECRUIT MODEL IN DATA-LIMITED SITUATIONS
SO FISHERIES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
AB A simple method to estimate the parameters of the Ricker stock-recruitment model is described.  The method is based on the Beverton and Holt yield per recruit model, as a function of fishing mortality, which can be used to describe the stock-recruitment relationship of an exploited stock even when the data are limited to 1 year of estimates for average biomass and fishing mortality, or, to describe virgin biomass (educated guess).  Once the parameters are estimated, the surplus production and maximum sustainable yield can be established.  The method is applied to Merluccius gayi of the central zone off Chile and Sardinops sagax off northern Chile.  The application of the method is discussed.

TI AN END-USE ANALYSIS OF GLOBAL FOOD-REQUIREMENTS
SO FOOD POLICY
LA English
DT Article
DE END USE ANALYSIS; FOOD SYSTEM EFFICIENCY; AGRICULTURAL SUSTAINABILITY
AB The technique of 'end use analysis', borrowed from the energy sector, is employed to identify four sources of potential change in global food requirements.  These include:  (i) changes in global calorie requirements resulting from improved nutritional status and changes in physical activity levels, (ii) efficiency changes in the storage, handling, transportation and consumption of food which result in changes in the global level of food system efficiency, (iii) changes in the consumption of animal products, and (iv) changes to dietary structures due to increasing knowledge and concerns about the health impacts of alternative diets.  This paper argues that, in the long run, there may be significant scope for altering the relationship between income and food demand, and that investments in increasing agricultural supply must be compared to investments in reducing the growth rate of global food demand.  Given the current concern about the environmental sustainability of increasing agricultural production, reducing demand growth is one method of increasing sustainability, and is possible without sacrificing dietary quality.

AB To quantify forest structure following mechanized selective logging in a dipterocarp forest in West Kalimantan, Indonesia, we compared unlogged forest and sites logged 6 months, 1 year and 8 years prior to sampling.  Forty-one percent of the total area was in swamp forest, interdigitated with lowland forest.  Small patches of lowland forest (15% of lowland area) and 85% of swamp forest escaped logging disturbance.  The canopy of 76% of lowland forest was moderately to heavily disturbed by logging; 45% was in open gap or pioneer vegetation.  There was only limited evidence of canopy development after 8 years.  In lowland sites logged 6 months or 1 year before sampling, forest floor was disturbed in 16% of area by roads, tractor tracks and skid trails.  Local canopy disturbance increased, but at a decreasing rate, with the amount of basal area extracted.  Dipterocarp trees over 50 cm in diameter at breast height (DBH) comprised 70% of total basal area before logging.  The harvest removed 62% of pre-cut dipterocarp basal area and 43% of pre-cut total basal area.  Small dipterocarp trees (less than 50 cm DBH, below harvestable size) suffered high mortality due to logging, possibly limiting future wood production.  Logging resulted in a complex spatial mosaic of forest types and disturbance levels, suggesting options for conservation and management.  Swamp forest timber resources, unharvested by conventional mechanized logging, could potentially be hand-logged by local villagers, increasing both villagers' incomes and revenue to concessions.  Patches of unlogged forest may sustain some vertebrate and tree species.  The detailed analysis of forest structure in this study provides part of the essential information needed to assess sustainability of management options.  For the modeling of stand development that is necessary to develop an ecologically sound management system for dipterocarp forests in Indonesia, additional data on regeneration, tree growth and survival rates are required.

AB Models that accurately predict mortality are essential for the management of forests for sustainable yield. We develop models for mountain ash (Eucalyptus regnans) and alpine ash (E. delegatensis) using extensive remeasurement data from Victorian Central Highland forests. The models are based on Cox's proportional hazards regression. The predictive power of the models is evaluated with data sets withheld from the estimation procedures. The results suggest that the models will provide a reliable means of estimating mortality in seeded and planted stands of both species on a stand basis.

ID FOREST MANAGEMENT; PERSPECTIVE; TENURE
AB The paper focuses on rainforest degradation in Sarawak during the rapid economic development of the state since the late 1970s. Evidence from government statistics, satellite and cartographic data, together with the responses of interviewees in rural areas, indicate that forest degradation is due not only to the activities of commercial timber companies, but also, to those of rural communities, and has originated in, and been maintained by, the current systems and policies governing land tenure and natural resource exploitation in the state. The research indicates that more sustainable forms of development in Sarawak's rural areas will not be feasible until issues of a centralised government administration and the unregulated exploitation of natural resources are resolved.

AB The province of Misiones (Argentina) is currently being spontaneously colonized by a high inflow of farmers with few resources who are settling on state-owned lands covered by primeval rain forest.  We are developing a tool using SPOT images to monitor this extremely dynamic process and to locate and assess problems of sustainability.
   Indicators extracted from SPOT images were constructed for 50 farms on a settlement site, for the recognition is a diagnosis based on equilibration theory.  Successful classification of the farms was obtained in 70 to 80 per cent of cases by applying multivariate statistical methods to these indicators.  On this research site, the overall sustainability diagnosis using SPOT data was found to be satisfactory.
   These results will now enable us to adapt and extend the diagnosis to the organisational level of local agrarian systems.

TI EVALUATING SELECTED FORAGE LEGUMES FOR LIVESTOCK AND CROP PRODUCTION IN

ID FODDER BANKS; MAIZE
AB A programme of forage legume evaluation was developed at the International Livestock Centre for Africa's (ILCA) subhumid research site in Nigeria from 1985 onwards. Evaluation included monitoring herbage and seed yields, incidence of diseases/pests, regeneration ability and persistence for three growing seasons. This was followed by an in situ bioassay to determine the direct effect of the sown legumes on maize (Zea mays L.) production in the absence of added nitrogen.
   The results for selected accessions from introductions received in 1987 and 1988 are presented. Stylosanthes guianensis CIAT184 (ILCA164) and ILCA15557 and Aeschynomene histrix ILCA12463 were promising both in terms of biomass production (up to 9.4, 3.4 and 9.6 t/ha respectively) and quality (all had crude protein values of 11% or more), and in terms of beneficial effects for maize production (all plots gave significantly more grain than those with no legume, reaching over 3 t/ha for maize grown on plots after S. guianensis ILCAI 5557). The use of such appropriate forage legumes to enhance both livestock and crop production in a sustainable farming system is recommended.

AB Particularly high population densities are readily sustainable in newly designed glass column reactors. The optimal density of Isochrysis galbana in these columns in summer was 4.6 g L-1 dry algal mass at which value the highest sustainable productivity obtained was a record of 1.6 g L-1 d-1. The population density exerted a direct effect on productivity: The higher the light intensity, the more pronounced was the dependence of the output rate on the population density, variations of 10%+/- from the optimal density resulting in a significant decline in productivity. The population density had also a very significant effect on the course of photoadaptation which took place during the first days after transferring the cultures from the laboratory to the outdoors. The output rate was lower by 5 to 35% on the first day of such transfer as compared to the light-adapted control. The higher the cell density, the faster was the process of photoadaptation as indicated by the rise of the productivity and O2 tension to the control level. The potential for excess light damages was most prominent in the column reactors used, in which the light path was much reduced compared with that in open raceways. Significant photoinhibition took place at below optimal population density (2.8-3.8 g L-1), and when cell density was further reduced (1.9 to 1.1 g L-1), exposure to full sunlight caused photooxidative death within a few hours. The pattern of O2 concentration in the culture that emerged along the day served as a useful indicator of photolimitation.

ID INTERNATIONAL SECURITY; REDEFINING SECURITY; PEACE RESEARCH; CONFLICT
AB Environmental problems, including the recent concern with the 'global change' problematique, now occupy a prominent position on international agendas and are recognized as a legitimate concern of peace research.  Numerous scholars, policy-makers, and activists have proposed broadening use of the concept security beyond its traditional geopolitical and military focus to take into account environmental threats that seriously jeopardize human well-being.  This article examines arguments that have been made both for and against use of the concept 'environmental security'.  To assess the utility of this approach, the core concept 'security' is defined in terms of threats and vulnerabilities.  Strategies for enhancing security are distinguished on the basis of whether they are designed (a) to reduce threats or vulnerabilities and (b) to be carried out unilaterally or collectively.  Parallels are drawn between the options available to achieve military and environmental security with reference to the Prisoner's Dilemma game, which has been used widely to explain why states seek military security through counterproductive arms buildups rather than through a potentially much less costly strategy of mutual arms reductions.  While the logic of the Prisoner's Dilemma did not prevail in the successful negotiations on protecting the ozone layer, it may become a significant factor in international efforts to address the problem of climate change.  The larger question for peace research is whether the pursuit of environmental security can be channeled into cooperative arrangements that promote sustainable development rather than self-serving, nationalistic ventures that will heighten international conflict and perpetuate international injustices.

AB This paper provides an overview of mountain environmental problems and the role of women in conserving the mountain resource base. There is a remarkable convergence of policy objectives between the themes of sustainable development, environmental conservation, and the advancement of women. These issues are discussed and constraints and opportunities are enumerated. While both mountains and women have begun to receive more global attention in the last two decades they are not yet firmly integrated into the conservation agenda. Nevertheless, the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, held in Rio de Janeiro in June 1992, made a crucial step in moving mountain and women's issues into better focus. A series of recommendations are made to ensure that this progress is maintained.

AB Nepal's economic activity is dominated by agriculture. The volume of exports is small. About a quarter of the foreign exchange earned from export is required to cover costs of imported fossil fuels. Fossil fuels supply less than 7% of total energy consumption. More than 90% of primary energy consumption is supplied by biomass resources, and forests are the major source of biomass. The sustainable fuelwood yield of forest is far less than the total consumption, which has caused severe forest denudation. Consumption of crop residues and animal dung for fuel are increasing because of fuelwood shortage. The paper outlines the consequences of biomass consumption in Nepal and past efforts at biomass resources management and indicates their effectiveness. A few major practical policy measures have been suggested to correct the situation. The experiences and measures for biomass resources management explained in this paper are expected to be useful to other countries facing a similar situation.

AB Nature orientates itself to specific environmental situations and when challenged develops devices that allow plants and animals to live in very extreme climates.
   Traditional urban form has needed to make the most of its topology. Traditional buildings when necessary, have developed technologies that achieve additional comfort levels.
   Mechanisation however, has allowed building to drift away from its natural science base, to a free stylistic repertoire. This tendency has, over a period of time, caused some fundamental problems of performance.
   Consequentially the discipline of architecture needs to broaden, to allow it to recover its natural science base. To achieve this the design team must be more integrated from the earliest stages of design. Clients must give the team additional support during these first stages. Most importantly government must enact clear legislative requirements to ensure that energy efficient solutions are built.
   This paper aims to describe how the practice's concern with developing low energy buildings and evolving so called 'sustainable strategies' has and is informing its design approach and to illustrate the extent of the energy savings and reductions in pollutive emissions that are reasonably achievable.
   It is important to realise that, although 20 - 30% of these energy savings can be made by utilising recent advances in component technology, approximately 70 - 80% of possible affordable improvements are achievable by good orientation and clear concept design.
   This paper aims to highlight the importance of good conceptual design in achieving low energy buildings and balanced ecological planning.

AB Studies on climate change and energy production increasingly recognise the crucial role of biological systems. Carbon sinks in forests (above and below ground), CO2 emissions from deforestation, planting trees for carbon storage, and biomass as a substitute for fossil fuels are some of the key issues which arise. Halting deforestation is of paramount importance, but there is also great potential for reforestation of degraded lands, agroforestry and improved forest management. We conclude biomass energy plantations and other types of energy cropping could be a more effective strategy for carbon mitigation than simply growing trees as a carbon store, particularly on higher productivity lands. Use of the biomass produced as an energy source has the added advantage of a wide range of other environmental, social and economic benefits. The constraints to achieving environmentally-acceptable biomass production are not insurmountable. Rather they should be seen as scientific and entrepreneurial opportunities which will yield numerous advantages in the long term.

AB This paper presents Energy policy and describes the framework of Energy utilization, in Egypt, with special emphasis on wind Energy plans and programs, to illustrate the role wind Energy can play in the sustainable Energy development programs in Egypt
   A Master plan that targets 600 MW by the year 2005 for grid connection is currently worked out, based on 200-300 kw turbine size capacity.
   National institutions concerned are taking part in master planning of wind Energy utilization, New and Renewable Energy Authority (NREA) under the Ministry of Electricity and Energy in Egypt has the responsibility for promotion of technologies and applications
   The paper also illustrate demonstration program and projects performance results and present hands on experience gained through the last 5 years
   Moreover the paper presents the National five year plan objectives that calls for 70 MW wind farms at the are of the Red Sea, based on national investment together with 150 MW wind farms in the same area based on private investment, which is a change in the laws due to convection of economical reforming in Egypt. Fuel saving and environmental impact assessment together with economical analysis is presented for the national five year plan 1992/1997.

   ENERGY; CO2 AND SO2 EMISSIONS

AB In this study major agricultural residues of Turkey were identified and characterized as a potential fuel source for electric power generation. The environmental cycle for impacts of biomass utilization were investigated in comparison to Turkish lignites. Based on the total production of cereals (26.9 million tonnes) and oil-seeds (4.0 million tonnes) it is estimated that 53-68 million tonnes of agricultural residues are produced annually in Turkey, 60 % of which can be used for energy purposes. The primary energy content of the recoverable agricultural residues is in the range of 525-700 PJ or about 25-30 % of Turkey's annual primary energy consumption. Agricultural residues have the potential to replace all the lignite (35.3 million tonnes) and bituminous coal (1.3 million tonnes) used in electric power generation plants. Agricultural residues can also play an important role in reducing the most important environmental impacts from thermal power plants. The benefits include the reduction of net emissions of CO2 by efficient carbon recycling and lower SO2 and NOx emissions due to the relatively Low sulphur and nitrogen content of agricultural residues as compared to those of lignite.

AB Clarifying the means by which we define and shape the commons, can become the platform from which we can seek to achieve community-scale integration in service to principles of sustainability. This paper presents the formulation of energy-related environmental variables - sun, light, wind and water - in ''envelope form'' for purposes of modeling alternative integrative patternings of communities as ''tissue on the land''. Such modeling yields prototype designs of urban districts, urban blocks and/or individual buildings whose designs capitalize on passive energy manipulation as a ''first order'' response, thus structuring strategies for the integration of efficient ''second order'' metabolic systems which together provide the technical base for energy-related resource management.

   PRACTICE; GUIDELINES
AB The increased exploitation of renewable energy sources is central to any move towards sustainable development. However, casting renewable energy thus carries with it an inherent commitment to other basic tenets of sustainability openness; democraticization etc.
   The implications of this commitment for the developers of renewable energy projects are significant. Moreover, a failure to apply these broader principles to the development process risks alienating the very public whose views will determine the political future of renewable energy.
   From recent experience of the development of wind power in the UK, it is clear that it is no longer enough just to know the future technical potential of renewable energy, or even the regulatory and/or fiscal framework that would enable that potential to be realised. Increasingly we must concentrate on the practical politics of developing renewable energy that will ensure it is accepted and embraced by the public. Drawing on UK experience, guidelines can be established for renewable energy developers such that the principles of sustainable development are as central to exploitation renewable energy as renewable energy is to sustainability.

DE RENEWABLE FUTURE; BARRIERS; CASE STUDIES; AND REPLICATION
AB The environmental sustainability of the current global energy system is under serious question. A major transition away from fossil fuels to one based on energy efficiency and renewable energy is required.
   The development of a wide range of renewable energy technologies is continuing at an impressive rate. Cost reductions have been real and impressive. With few exceptions however, the relative contribution of renewable energy fo the total energy mix remains quite small in most countries. There are still a wide range of barriers preventing renewables from making a much more significant contribution.
   The paper utilises a range of case studies from around the world which demonstrate some of the lessons of successful renewable energy implementation, and suggest a set of coordinated policies which would lead to a growing role for renewable energy in the commercial energy market.

DE ZAMBIAN ENERGY SCENARIO; RENEWABLE ENERGY; ENERGY RESOURCES; ENERGY
   DEMAND; ENERGY SUPPLY
AB The importance of the pattern of energy production, conversion and consumption in ensuring sustainable development necessitates stock taking of national energy supplies and demands so as to enable adequate policy formulation. In this paper, the state of energy resources, supply and demand in Zambia is described and analysed. Wood, the only non-commercial energy resource, constitutes 66% of the energy consumed in the country through its use as firewood in rural areas and as charcoal in urban areas. Hydropower with an existing installed capacity of 1670 MW supplies 94% of the country's electricity and meets 13% of the national energy demand. Shares of electrical energy consumed in mining, industry, household, government and agriculture sectors are 72%, 10%, 8%, 7% and 3%, respectively. With average annual output of about 470,000 tons and vast reserves of over 80 million tons, coal is also abundant and meets 9% of the national energy demand. Mining and industry have nearly equal share to account for over 90% of the domestic coal consumption. Petroleum contributes 12% of the energy demand and is fully imported. Its share in transportation, mining, industry, household, agriculture and services sectors is 49%, 27%, 14%, 4%, 3% and 3%, respectively.
   With annual average sum of solar radiation amounting to 7.1 GJm(-2) for Zambia, solar energy potential is high but scantly exploited. The same is the case with biomass. Wind potential is weak as the average wind speed is 2.5 ms(-1). Photovoltaic power is being put to some practical applications. While hydropower will. continue to remain the mainstay of Zambian electricity supplies, renewable energy sources need to be exploited for applications in remote areas.

AB Each of the following sections carries one central thought, often summarised in one (bold-face) sentence. Together, these statements give an overview of some major long term issues of sustainable use of energy which humanity must face. No effort is made to argue all points, to be exhaustive, or go into details; that is the task of other publications, The aim is to give a clear, broad and striking picture, which can be filled in by further study. We draw conclusions in the field of energy policy, in particular with respect to developing countries. The attention is strongly concentrated on the CO2 issue, not only because of its importance, but also because this issue illustrates many of the problems that will arise in all policies that want to tackle long term issues of energy supply and use.
   This paper in no way presents a final opinion; it is intended as a contribution to the debate, and attempts to stimulate others to advance further. Criticism and corrections are welcomed,

AB Village-scale hydro-electric programmes exist in many developing countries throughout the world. Well-implemented schemes provide a cheap and reliable source of power from a renewable, indigenous source. Despite the massive demand and scope for these programmes, they tend to be very small-scale and, though beneficial to the villages that they electrify, they only make a minor impact on overall rural electrification needs. This paper addresses they key technical, organisational and economic factors for successful village hydro-electric programmes in order to promote a wider and more sustainable use of small-scale hydro power for rural development.

In this article, synoptic, incremental, transactive, advocacy and radical planning theories are discussed in light of criteria for a sustainable development.  All the five planning models have major shortcomings from the standpoint of a sustainable development.  If the aim is to plan for a sustainable society, it seems as, depending on the concrete planning situation, elements from several of the planning theories should be combined.

AB The Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI) has made considerable progress towards immunizing the world's women and children, preventing 3.2 million child death episodes per year from measles, neonatal tetanus, and pertussis, as well as 440,000 cases of paralytic poliomyelitis. Vaccinations provided through the EPI are believed to be one of the most cost-effective child survival interventions at a cost between $5 and $10 per child. However, variation exists in the average cost per fully immunized child, depending upon the type of vaccine technology and delivery strategy utilized, the scale of operation, and country and environmental characteristics. Recent evidence on the cost-effectiveness of immunization strategies raise concerns over the affordability of national immunization programs by governments and highlights the need for continued donor support, identification of other financing mechanisms, or reconsideration of policies aimed toward accelerating and maintaining immunization coverage.

AB Numerous biological, chemical, and physical indicators of soil quality have been suggested, but few have been evaluated using data from long-term field studies. Our objective was to evaluate several proposed soil quality indicators to determine effects of removing, doubling, or maintaining crop residues for 10 years in a no-till, continuous corn (Zea mays L.) production study. Soil aggregate characteristics, penetration resistance, bulk density, volumetric water content, earthworm populations, respiration, microbial biomass, ergosterol concentrations, and several soil-test parameters (pH, P, K, Ca, Mg, Total-N, Total-C, NH4-N, and NO3-N) were measured on samples collected from Rozetta and Palsgrove silt loam (fine-silty, mixed, mesic Typic Hapludalfs) soils. Soil aggregates from double residue treatments were more stable in water than those from normal and removal treatments. The double and normal residue treatments had higher total carbon concentrations and higher levels of microbial activity as measured by CO2 evolution. Ergosterol concentrations where crop residues were removed were 8 to 10 times lower suggesting this biochemical measurement of fungal biomass may be a sensitive soil quality indicator. Earthworm populations where crop residues had been removed for 10 years were significantly lower than in either normal or double residue treatments. Measures of force and energy required to crush soil aggregates were extremely variable and showed significant differences only for aggregate size. Several parameters were used to develop a soil quality index that gave ratings of 0.45, 0.68, or 0.86 for removal, normal, or double residue treatments,

AB Ecologically sustainable development is aimed at reducing environmental degradation while enabling economic development with equity between the developed and developing worlds and between generations.  Parasite control in livestock can both contribute to, and take advantage of, sustainable agriculture.  This will tend towards less intensive, lower input, diversified crop and animal production with less risk of parasite-induced losses and greater opportunities for integrated control including the exploitation of grazing management.  Chemotherapy will continue to play a part but the most serious problem is resistance in the target species.  Except for a few isolated issues, currently used parasiticides are relatively minor contaminants of the food supply or the environment.  Nevertheless, the compounds of the future will need to be narrow-spectrum, non-persistent and rapidly degraded, with convenience in the hands of the user reduced in importance.  Environmentally friendly alternatives to chemotherapy, including genetic resistance of hosts, vaccines, and biological control, show considerable promise and must be pursued.  Sustainable systems pose optimisation problems and more attention must be given to systems research, models and products to aid decisions.  If governments are serious about sustainable development, greater support will be needed for longer-term patient, multi-disciplinary research.

TI EXCHANGE-RATE UNIFICATION AND ECONOMIC-DEVELOPMENT - THE CASE OF UGANDA,
   1987-92
SO WORLD DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB This study assesses the feasibility and sustainability of exchange rate unification in Uganda.  A hybrid model originating from Pinto (1989) and Elbadawi (1990) is constructed to suit Uganda's conditions.  The model is used to study the key variables in the size and behavior of the premium in the process of exchange rate unification and the sustainability of a market-based exchange rate.  The model is then tested on monthly data for 1987-92.  Three results emerge:  (a) the exchange rate premium varied directly with the money supply; (b) the real effective exchange rate varied inversely with the premium; and (c) external import support reduced the premium's absolute size, but as foreign resources dried up, the premium reemerged.  The paper then examines development policy implications of the results.

ID RESOURCE
AB Biodiversity relates to sustainable development through a series of direct and indirect uses. These include direct harvest, nature tourism, wild genes improving domestic crops, wild species contributing to crop productivity, pest management, sources of medicine and bioremediation (biologically based environmental clean-up). Biodiversity relates through services, individual species indicating environmental change or stress, insights into the life sciences and increasingly today, through wealth generated from biodiversity at the level of the molecule. Sustainable development relates to the quantification of biodiversity through organizing information to enable the foregoing activities. It also relates in little-explored ways to ecosystem function, stability and resilience. Biodiversity is already a proven indicator of environmental change in freshwater systems.

SO AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB Based upon a framework of three (i.e. biophysical, sociopolitical and techno-economic) dimensions of sustainability in agriculture, this paper discusses the current situation of Chinese agriculture in relation to sustainability. The main challenges are population pressure, land degradation, environmental pollution, global climate change, non-agricultural activities, market uncertainty, low level of capital investment, and some policy and behavioural conditions. However, there are opportunities related to natural resources, labour, education, science and technology, and some models of sustainable farming which already exist.

ID FERTILIZER; WATER; SEED
AB Studies to increase profitability and N use efficiency in winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) production are needed to develop more sustainable agricultural systems in the 480- to 650-mm precipitation zone of northern Idaho and eastern Washington. Field experiments were conducted on Latahco silt loam (fine-silty, mixed, frigid Argiaquic Xeric Argialboll) soils east of Moscow, ID, during the 1982-1983, 1983-1984, 1985-1986 and 1986-1987 growing seasons. Fifteen different N placement-source-application timing treatments were arranged in a randomized complete block design with five replications. Fertilizer placements were (i) surface broadcast, (ii) band 50 mm below the seed, and (iii) combinations of surface broadcast and banded below the seed placements. Times of application treatments were (i) fall, (ii) spring, and (iii) various fall-spring splits. All treatments were evaluated with two N sources: NH4NO3 (AN) and urea (U). Parameters evaluated were (i) winter wheat stand counts, (ii) early-season plant biomass, (iii) grain yield, and (iv) apparent N use efficiency (NUE). Placement, N source and time of application had minimal impacts on winter wheat stand counts and early season biomass production. Both winter wheat grain yield and apparent NUE were greatest when N applications were split between fall and spring. Splitting time of N application resulted in apparent NUE of 58 to 61%, compared with 52 to 55% and 51 to 53% for fall only and spring only N applications, respectively. Grain yield and apparent NUE differences attributable to N source and N placement were not significant. Based on this study, ideal N management in the 480- to 650-mm precipitation zone would utilize AN, U, or comparable N sources and split N applications where as little as 25% of the N is banded below the seed or surface broadcast in the fall, with the remainder applied as a spring topdress prior to Zadoks growth stage 24. This proposed management will improve both profitability and water quality by increasing both grain yield and N use efficiency when compared with systems currently employed.

TI EVALUATING BIODIVERSITY - THE BATU-APOI EXPERIENCE
SO AMBIO
LA English
DT Article
AB Batu Apoi, a dipterocarp forest in Brunei Darussalam is being developed into the country's first National Park. Universiti Brunei Darussalam-Royal Geographical Society ran a rainforest expedition at the site in order to document the great biological diversity of the reserve, beginning in 1991. This 14-month project and subsequent research have resulted in the collection of many species of plants and animals, indicating that Batu Apoi is richer in species than might be expected from its size. New species of virtually every group of plants and animals have been identified. Many of the plant and animal species are used by the Iban tribesmen, who, thanks to an enactment that prohibits guns in Brunei, hunt employing traditional methods such as traps, snares and spears. A variety of plants are purported to possess pharmaceutical properties, according to local beliefs, many of which do not have botanical names. With revenue generated from overseas investments, besides oil and gas production at home, Brunei Darussalam is in an enviable position in being perhaps one of few countries that has relatively large areas under rainforest cover, but does not need to exploit its forest for timber export. However, immense opportunities that remain in studying and eventually utilizing these forest resources sustainably will be a challenge for the country in the years to come.

AB As with agriculture, aquaculture is a biological conversion process of food into animal production, but it differs, from a waste management viewpoint, from animal farming. Firstly. prediction of feed intake and optimum level of feeding are difficult, hence feed waste contributes a relatively large proportion of total waste output in most operations. Secondly, collection of wastes, both solid waste and soluble or dissolved waste, is also very difficult and wastes are rapidly dispersed into the surrounding water. These factors create many problems which are generally unknown to other animal farming operations. However, sustainable aquaculture can be maintained through nutritional strategies for the management of aquaculture waste (NSMAW) by minimizing waste outputs from the source. The basic principles are formulation of high-nutrient-dense diets and development of efficient feeding systems based on energetic data. Monitoring and quantitation of waste output is also carried out indirectly using digestibility measurements and comparative carcass analyses. This is a biological and nutritional approach rather than a conventional chemical approach to effluent analyses. These latter are laborious, inaccurate and expensive. Recent high-nutrient-dense (''low-pollution'') diet formulations output less than 200 kg solid waste and less than 5 kg P per tonne fish produced, but achieving this reduction of waste output requires completely revised feeding standards based on an average 1 5 MJ DE/kg salmonid fish produced.

AB The Clinton/Gore administration has politicized new catchwords like ''Information Highways'' and ''National Information Infrastructure'' (NII).  If electronic networks for the production and distribution of multi-media information raise high expectations for economic development, the NII, as an attempt to improve participatory processes, can also be seen as a step towards a more ''sustainable democracy'' and an enlargement of civil society.

AB Mounting human numbers, excessive resource consumption in developed countries, chronic poverty in developing nations and widespread environmental degradation provide a familiar backdrop to today's debate on how sustainable development can be achieved. Development must be people-centred, but conservation-based. It must involve the integrated, multi-purpose management of the environment. Protected areas have to be treated as one element in this multi-purpose approach. Planning has to be based on critical analysis (and extrapolation) of current trends, and improved models of complex socio-economo-environmental systems. A scenario of the world in 2025 is presented as a basis for analysing how habitats and environmental management, including that of protected areas, may need to respond. Problems are likely to be most acute in Mediterranean and semi-arid areas, and in both the dry and humid tropics. National agencies responsible for protected areas will need to work as a part of much broader cross-sectoral groups working for sustainable development.

AB Natural environments are assailed on every side through the unprecedentedly rapid expansion of human activities. In the absence of conservation responses of a scope and scale to match the challenge, we shall shortly witness the widespread degradation and destruction of many wildlands and their biotas. Fortunately we still have time, though only just time, to slow and stem the biotic holocaust overtaking the biosphere. But the traditional measures, notably in the form of protected areas, are becoming ever-more limited in their capacity to resist. While we need many more protected areas - better protected too - we shall find there is a much more positive payoff in tackling the tide of environmentally impoverishing human activities, principally through initiatives directed at sustainable development of all environments and all their communities, both human and non-human.

AB The doubly-labelled water ((H2O)-H-2-O-18) technique was used to assess the long-term rates of energy expenditure and, after accounting for any changes in body composition, the derived rates of energy intake in weight-stable 'large-eating' (n 6) and 'small-eating' (n 6) women. The self-reported energy intakes (approximately 11.2 v. 5.6 MJ/d) and energy expenditures (approximately 8.5 v. 124 MJ/d) for the 'large-eating' and 'small-eating' groups respectively, should not be sustainable without significant body-weight changes. (H2O)-H-2-O-18-assessed rates of energy expenditure for the 'large-eaters' (approximately 85 MJ/d) and 'small-eaters' (approximately 11.3 MJ/d) were in close agreement with the results obtained using 5 d, self-reported activity diaries but the derived rates of energy intake for the 'large-' (approximately 8.5 MJ/d) and 'small-eaters' (approximately 10.8 MJ/d) were markedly different from those obtained using self-reported, weighed food diaries. When two 'small-eaters' were supplied with their self-reported energy intakes (approximately 5 MJ/d) for up to 28 d both subjects lost about 0.75 kg body-weight/week. These results provide no support for the existence of 'metabolically efficient' women in the community.

AB An overview of national and international factors shaping Indonesia's coastal environmental management is provided.  Indonesia is committed to sustainable development of its coastal lands and waters, but the inventory and capacity of coastal resources for supporting Indonesia's rapid economic growth is not well known.  There is a need for Indonesia to evolve from unsustainable single-purpose resource uses toward sustainable multiple resource uses supported by planning and management integrated at the national and provincial levels.  Key coastal environmental management challenges are to create a national cross-sectoral coordinating agency, develop provincial management capabilities, and foster community and private sector participation.  As this populous developing country begins its second 25-year development cycle, increasing the economic contribution of coastal resources in context with sustainable national development goals will be essential.

AB A threatened green sea turtle (Chelonia mydas) rookery (nesting beach) in Java, Indonesia, requires protection within a complex regulatory regime. The unsustainable exploitation of turtle eggs and potentially damaging land use threaten Java's prime C. mydas rookery at Pangumbahan. The regional imperative for economic development must be reconciled with national protection and sustainable use policy declared in the National Marine Turtle Conservation and Management Strategy of 1991. A discussion is presented of the complexities of protecting this rookery and how implementing recent legislation and improving cross-sectoral cooperation could achieve a better long-term prospect for the resource.

TI WOMENS TIME, LABOR-SAVING DEVICES AND RURAL-DEVELOPMENT IN AFRICA
SO COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
AB All approaches to rural development in Africa implicitly require more responsibility and input from women. As a result women's workloads in rural areas have increased dramatically. One of the most time- and energy- consuming tasks performed by women is the preparation of grain. Using The Gambia as an example, this research investigates the results of the introduction of village cereal mills on the lives of women and their communities. The paper concentrates on women's access to the technology, the time and energy this saves, its sustainability and their level of control. It is found that the energy saved is of great significance to rural women, enabling them to contribute more effectively to village life. However the mills have not yet resulted in greater autonomy and power for women in their communities due to constraints of illiteracy and poverty.

AB An example of developmental autonomy, assessed at the level of expression of tissue-specific genes, was characterized in this study. cDNA clones that corresponded to two different epidermis-specific genes (HrEpiA and HrEpiB) of the ascidian Halocynthia roretzi were isolated. Transcripts of both genes first appeared around the time of gastrulation, suggesting zygotic expression. In the case of HrEpiA, transcripts became undetectable after metamorphosis had begun, while transcripts of HrEpiB were still detectable in juveniles after metamorphosis. In situ hybridization analysis using HrEpiA and B probes gave the following results. (1) All types of partial embryo that originated from blastomeres with epidermal fate from two-, four-, and eight-cell embryos expressed these two epidermis-specific genes. (2) When cleavage was blocked by treatment with cytochalasin B at the one-cell stage, the cleavage-arrested one-celled embryos expressed the two genes. (3) Even when blastomeres with epidermal fate were isolated from two-, four-, and eight-cell embryos and the division of the blastomeres was arrested immediately after isolation, they expressed the two specific genes. These results suggest that the epidermal lineage in the early ascidian embryo is a developmental system with considerable self-sustainability. (C) 1994 Academic Press, Inc.

AB The paper examines and applies system approach in analysis of spatial and economic aspects of island development.  Islands are viewed as separate systems and as parts of larger regional (coast-island) systems which leads to recognition of specificities of island existence and island development paradigm.  The elements of the paradigm are:  1) complex structure of island economy, 2) agriculture as a necessary part of the island economic structure, 3) determined relations between economic development and population growth, 4) population growth stimulation as a measure against abrupt, forced immigration and 5) nodal principle in organization of economic and social functions.  In accordance with the paradigm revitalisation of decayed islands has to be gradual.  Development policy has to be geared towards sustainable island development.

AB One of the main differences among evaluation models is between monetary and non-monetary evaluation. Cost-benefit analysis and cost-effectiveness analysis are well-known examples of a monetary evaluation. In the past decades the degraded state of the natural environment has become a key issue, and it is increasingly taken for granted that environmental and resource problems generally have far-reaching economic and ecological consequences. Economic-environmental evaluation and decision problems are conflictual in nature and, therefore, multicriteria techniques seem to be an appropriate modelling tool. This paper attempts to analyse in a critical way some essential aspects of multicriteria decision methods. In particular, the paper deals with uncertainty and measurement problems in environmental policy analysis, seen from the viewpoint of the measurement level of information (including fuzzy set methods). Particular emphasis will be placed on methods for concerted planning evaluation.

First, profit-maximizing farmers respond to incentives provided by both the USDA and the EPA, implying that explicit interagency policy strategies are critical. Second, evaluating sustainable agriculture options with the Appraisal can improve our understanding of the attractiveness of widespread adoption, but only if systematic operational systems are developed to evaluate the economic and environmental trade-offs. Third, the Appraisal policy options should be evaluated in light of the argument that preferred policies often only resolve a problem by transferring the problem to another time or location. The Appraisal offers a unique opportunity to address these and other issues.

TI IS THE BUDGET DEFICIT TOO LARGE - SOME FURTHER EVIDENCE
SO ECONOMIC INQUIRY
LA English
DT Article
AB The size of the federal budget deficit has alarmed politicians and the general public both. Following recent work, we examine the long-run solvency of the U.S. government by testing for cointegration of federal expenditures and revenues. We include a break tem in the cointegrating recession for 1981 to capture a shift in the fiscal process in the first Reagan administration. Tests show the break to be significant; and with the break, in contrast to earlier work, expenditures and revenues are cointegrated with a coefficient of one. Thus, we find the deficit to be stationary and so potentially sustainable.

TI DYNAMIC MACRO MODELING AND MATERIALS BALANCE - ECONOMIC-ENVIRONMENTAL
   INTEGRATION FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
SO ECONOMIC MODELLING
LA English
DT Article
DE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT; ECONOMIC GROWTH; DYNAMIC MODELING
AB In this paper a model is presented with the aim of studying the long-term relationship between an economy and its natural environment. The approach is based on two main elements: reciprocal interactions between on the one hand population growth, investment, allocation of inputs and outputs, technology and productivity, and on the other hand declining environment quality, pollution and resource exhaustion; and a more realistic and consistent representation of the interdependence between various environmental effects, from extraction to emission, by using a materials balance perspective on economic processes. In order to develop the model attention is devoted to production functions that are consistent with materials balance. The model is multisectoral, including economic processes of extraction, production of commodities and investment goods, waste abatement and recycling. Environmental processes of resource regeneration and waste assimilation are linked through the economic and environmental sphere, and the model allows for endogenous development of resource-efficient technology.

AB It has been argued that existing perspectives on the environmental crisis can be divided into two broad categories (deep and shallow). Deep ecologists have used this typology to argue that mainstream perspectives on the environment are shallow and overly preoccupied with pollution control and resource degradation. This paper argues that the deep/shallow typology is biased and misleading because it: (1) obscures the fact that shallow ecology is comprised of several internally differentiated and disparate perspectives and (2) it favors the deep ecology perspective by creating the impression that the human-centered nature of the shallow perspective is incompatible with the fundamental changes required to address the environmental crisis.
   In order to test these claims, we compared deep and shallow perspectives on the environmental crisis using the North American expression of deep ecology and the Brundtland version of sustainable development and steady-state economy as exemplars. From this we were able to make the following conclusions: (1) deep and shallow ecology perspectives are best visualized as part of a continuum of perspectives on the environment that emerged from a long-standing critique of Western development, (2) that the descriptions of the etiology of the environmental crisis offered by sustainable development and deep ecology are incomplete, and (3) although both traditions are presently regarded to be in direct opposition, they have much to learn from each other.

AB After a critical analysis of the strategies for conservation of the environment in Latin America and of large-scale development projects (agriculture and livestock raising, mining and electrical power plants) in the Amazon region of Brazil, this paper deals with the use of high-resolution satellite imagery for environmental monitoring. Two areas were considered in the study, Tucurui and Altamira. Spot/XS and Landsat/TM multispectral images were used, together with color aerial photographs of these areas. A computer-assisted visual interpretation procedure was employed to analyze images, and linear multispectral transformation was applied in selected subscenes in order to improve information extraction. The results indicate that high-resolution satellite imagery is generally compatible with the scale of the environmental problems in Amazonia and is a very efficient source of detailed information at a local scale on many aspects of the environment, in particular for monitoring changes over time in selected areas. Therefore, commercial satellite imagery, processed by specialized software, can accommodate a variety of analysis needs for decision makers and can also be an effective means of verification of international agreements on conservation of the environment in Amazonia.

AB The usefulness of inspiratory muscle training (IMT) in chronic airflow limitation (CAL) patients is a controversial issue, mainly due to differences in the training load. To further evaluate this aspect, we studied the effect of the magnitude of the load using a threshold pressure trainer.
   Ten CAL patients (5 males, 5 females), 67 +/- 2 yrs (mean +/- SEM) and forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) 36 +/- 2% pred, were trained for 30 min a day using a load of 30% of their maximal inspiratory mouth pressure (PImax) (Group 1). Another 10 CAL patients (5 males, 5 females), 73 +/- 2 yrs and FEV1 37 +/- 2% pred), were trained using only 12% of their PImax (Group 2). Training was assessed hy PImax, inspiratory muscle power output (IMPO), sustainable inspiratory pressure (SIP), maximal inspiratory flow rate (VImax), pattern of breathing during loaded breathing, Mahler's dyspnoea score, and the 6 min walking distance (6MWD).
   After 5 weeks of training, Group 1 exhibited significant increments in: PImax (34 +/- 11%); IMPO (92 +/- 16%); SIP (36 +/- 9%); and VImax (34 +/- 13%). Dyspnoea was also reduced, and the 6MWD increased by 48 +/- 22 m. We observed no significant changes in Group 2. During loaded breathing, Group 1 showed a significant increment in tidal volume (VT) and mean inspiratory flow (VT/TI), and a reduction in inspiratory time (TI). In Group 2, VT and VT/TI also increased significantly, but the breathing frequency increased with a reduction of expiratory time. When comparing both groups after training, significant differences in PImax, IMPO, VImax and dyspnoea were observed, with no significant changes in the other parameters.
   We conclude that, in patients with chronic airflow limitation, inspiratory muscle training with a high enough load improves inspiratory muscle strength and power output, reduces dyspnoea, and makes the pattern of breathing adequate during loaded breathing. These changes may allow patients to cope better with increased loads imposed by physical effort and exacerbation of symptoms.

DE WHITE PINE; RED PINE; TREE PHYSIOLOGY; PHOTOSYNTHESIS; SEEDING
   NUTRITION; SILVICULTURE
AB For significant and predictable improvements in productivity of red and white pine forests, an increased understanding of the physiological processes in these species is essential. Relatively little physiological research has focused on these two species over the last two decades. However, with renewed interest in these species now for their high social, environmental and economic value this situation is changing. This paper describes past efforts at understanding red and white pine physiology, as well as discussing recent achievements. In addition, new results obtained by the authors through the use of Biotronic growth units are described in more detail to emphasize the high adaptability of white pine seedlings in response to nutrient stress through changes in carbon distribution. nutrient uptake and utilization.
   The ultimate practical output of much forestry research is often models predicting tree and forest growth. However, models which are based solely on empirical growth measurement data will not provide the understanding that is necessary for sustainable management; thus. increased research on physiological processes will continue to be required in future. Long-term detailed field studies that consider environmental and silvicultural influences at the organ and whole tree level are required to ensure that future models have high explanatory value.

AB The origins of coherence in complex systems are examined, and it is shown that mechanical equations of 'motion' are only temporary representations of the structure and organization present in the system at a given time. The precise trajectories of different factors, particularly in market economies, will be chaotic, or certainly sensitive and unpredictable. However, the main point is that evolution and change in the structure of the system are the most important feature. It means that any mechanical equations that have been derived to describe behaviour in the system, and indeed the taxonomy on which these are based, will change over time as new behaviours, new problems and challenges emerge in the system. These changes are essentially unpredictable, as is the expected time of stability of any existing structure and taxonomy. In other words, the equations of prediction, which may themselves correspond to a particular short-term chaotic trajectory, will only remain a valid description of the system for as long as the system structure is maintained, and this is only for an unpredictable time. Wisdom therefore is to be found in recognizing the limits to knowledge, and the new science should aim at understanding the significance of evolutionary processes as the true basis for sustainable existence.

TI USING HIERARCHY THEORY TO EXPLORE THE CONCEPT OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
SO FUTURES
LA English
DT Article
AB It is commonplace to experience a discrepancy in values when assessing the same phenomenon or action from different perspectives, eg what is good to our taste (assessment on a short-term timescale) may be harmful to our health (assessment on a longer timescale). This pattern is repeated at each enlargement of perspective that brings another hierarchical level into the picture: what is profitable for the family-less taxes-may be harmful to the community. The study of these contrasts has traditionally been addressed by disciplines such as philosophy, political science and ethics. However, the development of hierarchy theory provides us with a scientific tool to explore the nature of the contrasts of values. This article discusses the major principles of hierarchy theory and goes on to consider the issue of sustainable development.

TI EFFECTIVE OVERSIGHT - A GUIDE FOR NONPROFIT DIRECTORS
SO HARVARD BUSINESS REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
AB More than ever, the public is looking to the nonprofit sector to address the pressing social problems that are hobbling the United States. Nonprofits have a record of promoting literacy, providing health care, supporting the arts, and offering a safety net for the poor that neither business nor government can match.
   But, as Regina Herzlinger observes in this article inaugurating HBR's Social Enterprise department, recent revelations suggest that nonprofits are far from faultless. Some have come under fire in recent years for rewarding executives with the kind of salaries and perks once reserved for corporate heavy-weights. Other organizations, such as hospitals, have been charged with providing too few services for the poor.
   As a result of such revelations about some nonprofits, all nonprofits face increased scrutiny from both benefactors and government regulators. To survive under this spotlight, a nonprofit needs a powerful and proactive board of directors to provide oversight. The board must assume the roles played in a business by owners and the market, ensuring that the nonprofit accomplishes its mission efficiently and devising its own system of measurement and control. Herzlinger proposes four questions to help board members create such a system: (1) Are the organization's goals consistent with its financial resources? (2) Is the organization practicing intergenerational equity? (3) Are the sources and uses of funds appropriately matched? (4) Is the organization sustainable?
   Together these questions offer a framework to help board members provide the critical oversight that nonprofits need to survive.

AB Reconceptualizing development in terms of people as means and ends requires reassessing the roles of the state and of leadership. In general the SSA record in respect of both has been poor. The requirements for sustainable development include human investment, skills, information, creativity and appropriate institutional capacity just as much as fixed investment. Accountable, decentralized government and more active civil society roles are also important for sustained development. A central issue is refocusing attention on national development goals, resources and markets, treating the external world (sources of capital and technology and of markets and sources) as imposing constraints on or providing opportunities for sustainable development but not as a source of blueprints for action nor of basic goals.

AB It is high time that the European Union had a coherent and sustainable European policy. Such a policy should comprise a strategy for the adaptation and extension of the EU of twelve (sixteen with the EFTA states currently applying) to include other European countries as comparable members; the refinement of its various relationships with other southern and eastern neighbours; and the reappraisal of those fundamental values and shared interests that justify collective action by the EU. This article is mainly focused on policy towards central and eastern Europe, but it touches on a much broader issue about the adaptability of the west European integration model to a now very different Europe.

AB This article examines the mechanisms of subsistence adaptation of two Papua New Guinea populations, the Metroxylon sago-depending lowland Gidra and the taro-monoculture Mountain Ok, surviving in low population densities of 0.5 and 1.4 persons per km2. Observation of the groups' land use systems strongly suggests that their population densities have not been far below the carrying capacity, although the territory of each population is markedly heterogeneous. Both groups have maintained their sustainable food production not only for resource management but also for survival at a population level, either expanding their territory or changing the sustainable level in tandem with changes of subsistence system.

DT Article
AB This article reviews aspects of India's Operation Flood dairy programme which reflect the extension of the internal and external linkages of India's co-operative dairy sector. This discussion of the institutional linkages of Operation Flood leads to a broader debate about the dairy sector and development, particularly issues of corporatism, relative autonomy and dependence. Operation Flood institutions have embedded themselves securely within the political centre, enabling them to effectively intervene in policy-making for the overall dairy sector, despite the programme's own limited performance in milk production and procurement. Foreign aid has facilitated this positioning, resulting in a subtle interplay of dependence and autonomy between the donors, the Indian state, local actors and Operation Flood as an autonomous interest.

AB This paper proposes a competency-based view of careers, derived from competency-based models of employer firms. The implications for boundaryless careers are explored by reference to changing organizational, occupational and industry community contexts. All of these contexts are seen as likely to promote boundaryless career behaviors. Future research possibilities for each of three career competencies, and for interdependence among the competencies, are briefly examined.

TI ECONOMIC COMPARISON OF 3 WINTER-WHEAT FALLOW TILLAGE SYSTEMS
SO JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION AGRICULTURE
LA English
DT Article
AB Economic information is needed to evaluate the sustainability of tillage systems used for winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) production in the Central Great Plains. This study compared the potential economic returns of conventional stubble-mulch tillage (CT), reduced-till (RT), and no-till (NT) winter wheat production systems using estimated farmer costs or custom costs. Grain yields were not significantly different   between tillage     systems from       1987 through 1992 with 6-yr average grain yields of 40, 40, and 42 bu/acre for the CT, RT, and NT systems. respectively. Preharvest costs were highest for NT while RT and CT costs were virtually the same when using farmer based costs. Using custom rates, preharvest costs were in the order CT > NT > RT. Returns above production costs were in the order RT > CT > NT when using farmer based costs and an average yield of 40.4 bu/acre for all tillage systems. Returns above production costs were in the order RT > NT > CT when using custom rates. Using farmer estimated costs of production, estimated net returns to land, labor, capital, management, and risk were 107 and 95% of the CT system for RT and NT systems, respectively. When labor costs were included, net returns to land, capital, management, and risk were 111 and 100% of CT for the RT and NT systems, respectively. When custom rates were used for the tillage practices, net returns to land, labor, and capital were 123 and 110% of CT for the RT and NT systems, respectively. If costs or application rates of herbicides could be reduced, the NT system would become even more economically competitive with the other tillage systems. Because the cost variations between tillage systems are minimal, the added benefits of increased precipitation storage efficiency and decreased soil erosion potential with RT and NT must be considered when selecting a tillage system.

DE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT; CONSERVATIVE DEVELOPMENT; SOCIAL TECHNOLOGIES;
   IMPACT ASSESSMENT; LAND USE PLANNING; LAND USE INTENSIFICATION
AB With relatively minor exceptions, the process of land use change is one of intensification and the narrowing of future land use options.  This has led to community concern for the gradual irrecoverable loss of values associated with less intensive land uses; in particular, concern for the availability and functional capacity of biodiversity, earth materials, water and air.  Concern extends to the functionality of these resources in industrial, amenity and service roles.
   Such losses, called, inter alia, environmental costs, are never wholly avoidable despite the hopes behind the sustainable development concept.  What is realistically possible is conservative development, meaning that land uses with environmental costs exceeding the economic net benefits would be proscribed as options, through the application of extant and emerging social technologies such as land use zoning, environmental standards and environmental impact assessment.
   This paper presents some general and some more specific ideas about land uses susceptible to proscription under the conservative development criterion.  Most major land uses stand to be challenged to a degree, particularly in densely populated areas, regions of economic opportunity and/or in regions recognized as having a high conservation value.  Proposals involving a leap in intensification or loss of remnant or old-established land uses will be more liable to assessment for proscription.  Several regions are identified where joint assessment for exclusion across members of a suite of land uses would not be surprising (e.g. the Kimberleys); also some regions and situations where particular land uses stand to be challenged, e.g. irrigated cotton, high country developments and integrated forest harvesting.
   Rather than list intensification trends at length and predict which challenges to intensification might succeed, this paper discusses the prospects for development of social technologies which evaluate community concerns about the environmental costs of land use intensification.  It is suggested that a blending of the existing procedures of the Resource Assessment Commission for regional resource inventory and evaluation and the existing resource allocation procedures of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority would form a highly defensible core for a new generation of option-defining technologies.  The social importance of having a rich suite of social technologies for addressing intensification issues is emphasized.

   MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES
AB The primary factors which are likely to mould future non-urban land use patterns in Australia are identified.  Over the past three decades the rate of increase in land productivity in Australia has been higher than for any other OECD country.  Land degradation does not appear to have seriously threatened agricultural output over the last 45 years.  However, there is cause for concern that land degradation, attributable to past activities, may only now be exerting a significant impact on productivity in some regions.  Many of the services provided by natural resources have been underpriced; consequently, there has been a bias in agricultural research towards technologies that enhance on-site productivity, but which impose excessive external social costs.  Underpricing of native trees from state-owned and managed forests appears to have caused excessive exploitation of these forests and lowered the establishment of softwood and hardwood plantations.  Many important land use and land cover issues remain unresolved in Australia's rangelands, including questions relating to the optimum grazing pressures, the role of fires in the suppression of unpalatable shrubs and appropriate management strategies for controlling numbers of large kangaroos and rabbits and protecting the natural habitat of threatened species of native animals.  The riparian zone, which acts as a crucial buffer between rivers and their catchments, has been one of the most neglected environments in Australia, possibly because river banks, floodplains and wetlands do not fit neatly into the category of land or water.  It is widely accepted that the aboriginal peoples must be involved in seeking to achieve the sustainable use of our natural resources.  How to achieve the appropriate participation and involvement of aboriginal peoples is a problem that is yet to be fully resolved.  In many respects, renewable natural resource systems in Australia are unique.  Knowledge creation and application will be a most important resource for the future management of our agricultural forestry and natural resource systems.  The solutions to many of the major renewable resource problems do not depend on technology alone.  Institutional changes and incentive structures are required that recognize and take account of the pervasive and complex interrelationships between human reactions and responses in their production and consumption activities and the environment.

TI LOST LAND AND LIMITS TO GROWTH - CONCEPTUAL PROBLEMS FOR SUSTAINABLE
   LAND-USE CHANGE
SO LAND USE POLICY
LA English
DT Article
ID WORLD
AB Drawing on recent work in environmental economics, this paper introduces the concept of the land use intensity of economic activity, analogous to the more familiar materials and energy intensities. It then considers how this might be measured, looking at a range of economic and land use change statistics, and how it might be reduced. Environmental compensation is seen as a possible means of achieving the latter objective. It is argued that no single measure of land use intensity would be meaningful, because concern about 'lost land' is typically not about land in terms of hectares or economic value, but about the environmental significance of land use change. This in turn reflects a variety of material, post-material and non-instrumental values. The paper concludes that composite measures of the land use intensity of economic activity are likely to be the most useful; that environmental compensation may be a useful policy instrument within a carefully formulated framework; and that differences in values have to be confronted if sustainable land use change is ever to be defined.

DE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT; NESTED MODELS
AB Some of the difficulties of extending economic and ecosystem models to allow for long term forecasting applications to the problem of sustainable development are discussed.
   It is argued that the new generation of models required will be nested models with fine time-space grid sub-models of non-global smaller scale phenomena imbedded in global scale coarser grid models.  These models will have to be constructed by adding the economic dimension to the already interdisciplinary ecosystem models and will require the introduction of an economic numeraire which is invariant and compatible with common units of the other disciplines.

AB We tested a general model predicting the effect of body temperature (T-b) on the aerobic capacity, metabolic cost, and endurance of sustained, terrestrial locomotion. In the ghost crab, Ocypode quadrata, T-b was a function of ambient temperature (T-a), relative humidity (RH), and the duration of acute exposure. At 15 degrees C and 24 degrees C, T-b was similar to T-a. At high T-a (30 degrees C to 35 degrees C) and low RH (40% to 50%), T-b's were 6 degrees C below T-a. When the RH was 99%-100% at a T-a of 30 degrees C, T-b stabilized at 29.7 degrees C. The depression in T-b resulted from evaporative water loss. The maximal rate of oxygen consumption (Vo(2max)), determined during treadmill exercise, decreased by nearly 75% as T-b was decreased from 24 degrees C to 15 degrees C. The minimum cost of locomotion (C-min, the slope of the steady state oxygen consumption vs. speed function) did not change at low T-b (15 degrees C). As T-b was increased from 24 degrees C to 30 degrees C, Vo(2max) decreased to half of its original value. At the lowest walking speeds, steady state oxygen consumption (Vo(2ss)) at a T-b of 30 degrees C did not differ significantly from or may have even exceeded that at a T-b of 24 degrees C (the y-intercept of the Vo(2ss) vs. speed function was elevated relative to resting rates). The minimum cost of locomotion decreased by nearly two-thirds when T-b was raised from 24 degrees C to 30 degrees C. The reduced C-min increased the range of sustainable speeds by nearly threefold over that predicted from a thermally insensitive C-min at a T-b of 30 degrees C Endurance correlated with the speed at which Vo(2max) was attained (maximum aerobic speed) and, therefore, was reduced significantly at both low and high temperatures. On the basis of the present study of quantified locomotion, we conclude that thermal optima of maximal oxygen consumption and endurance are caused by a true thermal effect on oxygen utilization and muscle function rather than by a submaximal effort by the animal.

AB Experimental sites were established at two locations in north-eastern Victoria to define factors limiting the establishment and growth of Trifolium subterranean L. (subterranean clover). Liming the soil, seed inoculation and fungicide application were used in renovating subterranean clover pasture on two acidic soils (Longwood: brown/grey sandy loam DY 3.14 and Seymour: grey brown light clay DY 3.22, Northcote classification) with mean annual rainfall of 650 mm and 600 mm respectively.
   Soil acidity, low available soil phosphorus and plant disease were identified as factors limiting clover yield on these soils. Significant yield responses to lime (35-140%) were obtained with subterranean clover at both sites, with corresponding decreases in Al in the 0-10 cm soil horizon. Liming the soil, when combined with seed inoculation, increased the number and effectiveness of root nodules at both sites. Soil P available for plant growth was low at both sites (6.1 and 8.4 mu g g(-1)) resulting in sub-optimal P concentrations in the clover herbage (45 mmol kg(-1) at Longwood). Levels of root disease were low but Aphanomyces euteiches and Phytophthora clandestina (causal agents of lateral and tap root rot) were detected frequently on roots. Application of fungicide resulted in higher dry matter yields (p = 0.05) at both sites.
   An assessment of the relative contributions of these limiting factors and the benefits to be obtained from better management would provide a clearer picture of the profitability and sustainability of this farming system.

AB Image analysis has been used to assess the growth of cell suspension-derived protoplasts of Petunia hybrida cv. Comanche at an interface between aqueous culture medium (KM8P), supplemented with 0.01% (w/v) Pluronic F-68, and oxygenated (10 mbar; 10 min) perfluorodecalin. Protoplasts synthesised a new cell wall and entered normal mitotic division which was sustainable to the cell colony/callus stage. This process was accentuated by the collective and additive effects of oxygen, perfluorodecalin and surfactant media supplements. The mean area (mm(3)) of protoplast-derived cell colonies after 68 days of growth was increased 35 fold over control (media alone) in the presence of these combined treatments. The new cultural regime, leading to improved cell throughput from protoplasts, is discussed primarily in relation to the role of perfluorodecalin as a gas carrier and possible effects of Pluronic F-68 in stimulating cellular uptake of nutrients and/or growth regulators. Image analysis provides a novel and accurate approach to quantifying cell growth responses.

These views, here termed the economic and the ecological, are respectively that of the United Nation's Brundtland Commission, which favours economic growth as a means of overcoming the world's environmental problems, and an alternative view, according to which environmental problems must be dealt with directly, and economic growth may well be a hindrance to their solution. The paper concludes with a theory of human development based on the vicious circle principle, which shows the economic perspective on sustainable development to be incoherent, and the ecological perspective to remain a viable alternative.

DE LAND REFORM; LAND TENURE; RESOURCE MANAGEMENT POLICY; STRUCTURAL
   ADJUSTMENT; SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA
ID PROPERTY
AB Current critiques of African resource management policies have been influenced by some of the key precepts of World Bank and International Monetary Fund ''structural adjustment'' programs, especially the notion that state agencies should play a reduced role in directing and managing economic activity. Many Western donors argue that better resource management will result from policies that extend clearer property rights to users and give greater authority to local institutions, believed to be more accountable to the public. The author agrees with the need for tenure reforms, but argues that devolution of tenure rights and withdrawal of the overbearing state will not alone result in sustainable resource management. Tenure policy needs to be conceived in broad terms, with the aim of achieving an appropriate distribution of rights among all parties with interests in natural resources: farmers, communities, and the state.

TI DIFFERENTIAL-EFFECTS OF ROTATION, PLANT RESIDUE AND NITROGEN-FERTILIZER
   ON MICROBIAL BIOMASS AND ORGANIC-MATTER IN AN AUSTRALIAN ALFISOL
SO SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY
LA English
DT Article
ID BIOLOGICAL PROPERTIES; SOIL BIOMASS; TILLAGE; DECOMPOSITION
AB Measurements of microbial biomass C in an Alfisol topsoil commenced in the ninth year of a field trial, which had been set up to determine the influence of agronomic practices on plant yields and soil properties. Management practice and time of sampling over a 5-year monitoring period affected the magnitude and direction of changes in the concentrations of microbial biomass C, which did not consistently relate to changes in the concentrations of soil organic matter C and N.
   Microbial biomass C was (a) higher in soils under a wheat-pasture rotation than under continuous wheat, but only during the first 3 years of monitoring, (b) higher in soils where plant residues were incorporated or retained on the soil surface than where residues were burned, but (c) lower in N-fertilized soils than in unfertilized soils. Measured differences in biomass C between treatments were generally much less than predicted, when based on calculations of biomass C accumulation from the decomposition of known amounts of returned plant residues. By contrast with biomass C, organic matter contents were consistently higher where practices resulted in greater residue return, viz. in soils under the rotation which included a pasture phase, in N-fertilized soils, and in soils where residues were incorporated or were left on the soil surface.
   The decreased biomass C contents in N-fertilized soils (despite a greater return of plant residues and an increased accumulation of soil organic C and N), were partly attributable to an effect of fertilizer in decreasing soil pH, which directly affected biomass assay performance. Nevertheless, after correction for pH changes, N fertilizer application practice decreased biomass C as a percentage of soil organic C, due it is deduced, to increased death rates of decomposer organisms. Rates of C and N mineralization expressed as percentages of soil organic matter C and N were unaffected by N-fertilizer practices.
   We have concluded that short- and long-term factors influenced biomass C under the various management practices. Changing soil environmental conditions may with time partly offset, or even reverse, trends based solely on considerations of energy supply (i.e. plant residue return). In the wider context, the value of microbial biomass as an index of sustainability is better appraised when differences in time scale for the expression of factors influencing the processes of C turnover in soil are also considered.

AB This paper explores roads toward environmentally sustainable transport, with particular emphasis on the bottlenecks preventing the achievement of policy objectives of reconciling the economic interests of the transport sector with environmental constraints. Several arguments substantiated by empirical evidence from various countries are put forward to demonstrate that current megatrends in transport are at odds with a sustainable development and lead to high social costs. A variety of policy strategies is discussed to improve the current threatening situation.

AB Fringed sagebrush is a native, drought-resistant, increaser species in Saskatchewan pastures and rangelands.  Conventional control by cultivating and reseeding is neither highly effective nor sustainable.  Two field experiments were conducted in 1988 and 1989 through 1991 to develop a management plan for fringed sagebrush.  Comparison of fringed sagebrush control using various applications of clopyralid, dicamba, dichlorprop, fluroxypyr, picloram, triclopyr and 2,4-D, showed control was sufficient using the low-cost herbicide 2,4-D isooctyl ester at 1.5 kg ai/ha.  Total yield of crested wheatgrass plus smooth brome was compared and the plots subjected to two applications of 2,4-D yielded the greatest accumulation of grass over the length of the experiments.  The economic threshold of fringed sagebrush is the density at which yield is reduced by approximately 290 kg/ha; above this density it is economically viable to use 2,4-D at 1.5 kg/ha to control fringed sagebrush.  Grazing practices can aid greatly in management of fringed sagebrush by allowing the forage to out-compete fringed sagebrush.

TI THE COSTS AND BENEFITS OF SOIL CONSERVATION - THE FARMERS VIEWPOINT
SO WORLD BANK RESEARCH OBSERVER
LA English
DT Article
ID ECONOMICS
AB Most countries in Central America and the Caribbean depend heavily on agriculture; efforts to sustain and improve the sector's productivity are therefore crucial to the region's economic development and to the welfare of its people.  Land degradation is thought to pose a severe threat to the sustainability of agricultural production.  Yet despite long-standing concern about this threat and dramatic claims of environmental damage, surprisingly little empirical analysis has been done on the causes and severity of land degradation problems in the region and on how best to tackle them.  Meanwhile, many of the conservation programs designed to address the problems have fallen short of expectations.  Often farmers have not adopted the recommended conservation practices or have abandoned them once the project ended.
   The research presented in this article attempts to bridge the empirical gap, using cost-benefit analysis to investigate the nature and severity of the soil degradation problem and to assess the cost-effectiveness of proposed solutions.  Because soil degradation problems tend to be site-specific, the analysis is rooted in case studies, and because conservation programs stand or fall on the participation of farmers, the study's main focus is on the profitability of the measures and the deterrents to their adoption from the farmers' point of view.

AB This paper gives some examples of the application of systems analysis (the examination of the elements and linkages in an interacting group of items forming a unified whole) to the issue of human development and environmental change. The various examples, taken from a report submitted to the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED), deal with four basic human needs (food, water, energy and waste assimilation) and illustrate that: (1) it is possible to formulate holistic conceptual models of the socio-ecological system in which we live; (2) systems analysis can help us understand the constraints we face in terms of population growth, natural resources, and the assimilative capacity of the environment for wastes; (3) we can receive guidance in sharing limited natural resources with both inter-regional and inter-generational equity; and (4) we can gain insight into how our management options may shift in an environment which is constantly changing due to human and natural causes.

AB This paper reviews the marine living resources management practices in the ASEAN region. Lessons learned from past management of these resources are highlighted with an analysis of impacts. The lack of an appropriate management policy at national and regional levels, inefficient enforcement measures, the rapid population growth and unsustainable economic development have all contributed to the degradation of the resource base in the marine environment of many ASEAN members.
   The need to establish a holistic and integrated management approach as well as action plans to mitigate the accelerated deterioration of the marine environmental quality and to promote sustainable use of resources is strongly emphasized in this paper. Recent changes in government policies in ASEAN towards sustainable development could provide valuable opportunities to arrest further resource depletion. The ASEAN initiation of integrated management of marine resources is a step towards the right direction.

AB Freshwater habitats play a very important role in sustaining human activities. Natural functions of wetlands, and other freshwater habitats, generate a wide array of resources that directly or indirectly support the economic and social welfare of diverse groups of people. This role is being seriously weakened as a result of inappropriate planning and management approaches which fail to maintain the functional integrity of the freshwater ecosystems with the result that the flow and quality of resources is degraded. This paper illustrates some of the major functions of wetlands and presents a case for developing integrated planning and management practices that protect the health and productivity of freshwater wetlands and seek to optimise the sustainable use of the flows of resources they generate.

LA English
DT Article
AB Agricultural meteorology, because it deals with various aspects of agricultural sustainability, approaches to managing natural resources and areas of concern in global change and environmental quality, is a very relevant science for addressing some of the most important issues facing society today and in the future. Agricultural meteorologists must be actively involved in developing educational programs to introduce students and teachers in the primary and high school grades to the exciting contributions that agricultural meteorologists can make to these issues. A revised and expanded curriculum in agricultural meteorology is needed to prepare undergraduate and graduate students to deal effectively with solving current and future agricultural and environmental problems. Because of financial constraints and the relatively small number of agricultural meteorologists, innovative approaches to sharing information, expertise and educational materials should be explored and adopted where appropriate. These approaches would include use of satellite delivery of courses to many institutions, offering short courses and workshops for credit, and the opportunity for students to spend one or more semesters at a visiting institution to take relevant courses not available at their home institution.

TI THE FUTURE OF SERVING AGRICULTURE WITH WEATHER CLIMATE INFORMATION AND
   FORECASTING - SOME INDICATIONS AND OBSERVATIONS
SO AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID UNITED-STATES
AB Weather/climate information and forecasting services to agriculture are discussed from three perspectives: tradition, transition and technology. Traditional weather and climate services to agriculture have been highly successful. For example, numerous applied climatological studies and references have been derived from the primarily voluntary network of climate observers in the United States. However, traditional climatic studies will probably not meet the needs of the future, given the significant transitions and technologies affecting agriculture. Agriculture is going through a number of significant transitions which will dictate to some degree what future services will be provided by the agrometeorological community. These transitions should be considered in the testing and deployment of new technologies. Both profitability and sustainability principles are fueling a largely voluntary move to the implementation of 'precision farming' information, methodologies and technologies. Concurrently, officials at all levels of government are considering regulatory legislation which would mandate that agricultural producers use more precise and well-documented management practices. To a large degree both the implementation of precision farming practices, as well as the enforcement of new regulatory laws to ensure food safety, and the quality of the environment will depend upon an even greater utilization of weather/climate information and forecasts. Though new technologies will be providing improvements in forecasting and improved climate services are becoming available, a number of important issues remain unclear and must be addressed by a coordinated effort within the agricultural weather and climate community, starting first with a renewed effort to educate agricultural clientele about the potential new services which the discipline has to offer.

TI FORESTRY RELATED LAND-USE IN THE WEST USAMBARA MOUNTAINS, TANZANIA
SO AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper reviews socio-economic and ecological aspects of land use in the West Usambara mountains. It also examines the state of degradation, the existing farming systems and discusses some factors causing land use problems in the area. The major cause of land degradation in the Usambaras is ascribed to increased deforestation in the recent past coupled with inappropriate farming practises including overgrazing. Deforestation is caused by population growth which necessitates the expansion of farmlands and settlement, and uncontrolled harvesting or cutting often followed by uncontrolled grazing. Overgrazing is a problem mainly on common or community areas. Soil erosion is evident in many parts of the Usambaras where devegetation has occurred. Furthermore, rapid population growth has increased the demand for more cleared land in order to satisfy increased food and settlement needs.
   The use of improved farming practices is limited, inter alia, by inefficient means of production. As most peasants have limited alternative means of production, the expansion of farmlands is achieved largely through clearing of natural forests. Clearing of the forests reduces occurrence of certain species of plants and habitats they provide. State proclamation of land as a public property, coupled with an inappropriate land tenure system, has failed to provide a land use system capable of stabilizing in a productive and diverse state.
   There is a pressing need for redressing the land use problems in order to enhance sustainable use of land-based resources in the Usambaras.

The best performance in terms of rates of survival and growth rates (height and diameter growth) has been attained by Acacia nilotica, A. Cyanophylla, A. seyal, Cassia siamea and Prosopis juliflora. Given the ecological limitations of semi-arid areas, growth rates of these species is promising and this indicates that sustainable production system can be realized using proper agroforestry technologies in the semi-arid areas of Southern Ethiopia and similar area types elsewhere.

TI RIVER RESTORATION AND GEOMORPHOLOGY
SO AQUATIC CONSERVATION-MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article
AB 1. The restoration or rehabilitation of rivers is currently an expanding area of investment by public water management bodies in the USA and EC. This position has developed from the rapid growth in environmental (and particularly water) awareness, the rise of accountability for environmental degradation within the legislative framework of water institutions and the move away from agricultural over-production towards sustainable development.
   2. The restoration process has been pioneered primarily by aquatic ecologists and landscape designers working in conjunction with civil engineers. Geomorphology, the science of landform development, has much to offer, but at present the contributions are often superficial, concentrating on the scaling and siting of instream fluvial features. This paper argues that it is essential to incorporate the broader geomorphological wisdom at the design stage so that restoration schemes will be sustainable in the longer term.

AB Despite a recognition of the importance of families in providing informal care to frail seniors, there is no consensus as to who constitutes the caregiving family. The authors discuss the current ideology about the caregiving family and the state of knowledge about its composition and propose that the caregiving family has actual and potential elements. Based on the assumption that the concept of ''who's the family' is socially constructed, the authors argue that it is essential to understand ''who's the family'' from the perspective of primary caregivers in order to evaluate the nature of family support. This paper challenges the notion that the cargiving family is equivalent to the kin family. It is argued that the status quo in which a simplistic view of family caregiving is used to justify pressure on families to provide more care is not sustainable.

TI ITS NOT EASY BEING GREEN - THE POLITICS OF CANADA GREEN PLAN
SO CANADIAN PUBLIC POLICY-ANALYSE DE POLITIQUES
LA English
DT Article
ID POLICY INSTRUMENTS
AB On December 11, 1990, the Canadian federal government introduced the Green Plan, a $3 billion comprehensive environmental action plan intended to guide federal environmental policy over the ensuing five years. This article examines the policy instruments contained in the Green Plan. We develop a classification of instruments in the plan, and then offer an explanation for the observed pattern. We argue that the Green Plan contains a surprising paucity of measures to directly protect the environment, whether regulations to restrict or prevent pollution, taxes to penalize polluting behaviour, or spending for clean up. Rather, the overwhelming balance of initiatives is concerned with generating and disseminating information about the environment. We have analysed the interaction of rational actors within an institutional and ideological context, and argued that the contents of the Green Plan are best explained by a combination of the electoral incentives of the Conservative government, the budgetary incentives of Department of Environment bureaucrats, the institutional constraints posed by cabinet government and federalism, and a particular social construction of the idea of sustainable development.

TI ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT AS A REAL-ESTATE MANAGEMENT PROTOCOL - LONDON
   URBAN DESIGN OPPORTUNITY AT KINGS-CROSS
SO CITIES
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper considers the use of environmental assessment (EA) as a procedure interrelated with community-based citizen participation planning procedures. When applied to King's Cross railway lands in London, EA, as published in the environmental statements of two alternative development schemes, highlights the contrasts between a proposal for intensive commercial development and alternative community-orientated lower-scale strategies. It also emphasizes that less intensive development scenarios are less risky commercially. The conclusion is that EA, if carried out with multidimensional sensitivity in urban regeneration settings, and particularly with use of socio-economic impacts, can make the case for sustainable and socially aware development. Furthermore, commercially aggressive alternatives become less viable if subjected to full-range commercial risk assessment, as part of EA. As a consequence EA should produce a new real estate development paradigm over the coming years.

TI A CLIMATIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL-PROTECTION STRATEGY, THE ROAD TOWARD A
   SUSTAINABLE FUTURE - AN EDITORIAL ESSAY
SO CLIMATIC CHANGE
LA English
DT Article
AB This editorial essay conveys a clear message: The overuse of our fossil fuel resources especially in the North, and the overpopulation in many parts of the South, result in an unacceptable stress to Earth. This manifests itself in some of the most serious threats to mankind, such as global climatic change, environmental degradation, food shortage, hunger, poverty, and migration. It is the purpose of this editorial essay to make a contribution toward a reduction of some of these threats, notably those from climatic change. Specifically, I present a tractable climatic and environmental protection strategy which is designed to give concrete answers to such seemingly simple questions as: What has to be done? (This depends e.g. on the concentration stabilization objective of the Rio Climate Convention, and the global warming ceiling of the Enquete-Commission of the German Parliament). By whom does it have to be done? (This addresses the secret of a successful protection strategy which involves a fair burden sharing among the world's countries). When does it have to be done? (This discusses the problem of setting tractable, i.e. differentiated and binding emission targets). How can it be done? (This relates to individual countries, states, and municipalities. It is demonstrated for Germany how her commitment of a 25 to 30% CO2 reduction by 2005 can be achieved.) Moreover, the question is addressed: How many people and how much fossil fuel use can our planet stand? The major result is that without self-restraint climate and ecosystem protection cannot be maintained, because it is incompatible with trends in the wasteful fossil fuel use in the North and strong population growth in the South. Finally, a plea is made to share responsibility on the road toward a sustainable future.

TI SUSTAINABLE USE OF THE TROPICAL RAIN-FOREST - EVIDENCE FROM THE AVIFAUNA
   IN A SHIFTING-CULTIVATION HABITAT MOSAIC IN THE COLOMBIAN AMAZON
SO CONSERVATION BIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB We carried out a one-year study of the avifauna along a regeneration gradient created by indigenous shifting cultivation in the Colombian Amazon rain forest Regenerating one-hectare crop fields, from 1 to 17 years after abandonment, and undisturbed understory sites were compared in a sample effort of 4323 net hours. We made 878 captures of 103 species belonging to 11 trophic groups. Differences in species richness and number of individuals captured between regenerating areas and primary forest were low. A comparison of similarity indices among the sites for each habitat type showed no consistent differences, suggesting similar levels of local heterogeneity. Similarity indices calculated between sites of different-aged habitats, however, showed that young secondary growth at less than 10 years of abandonment was least similar to other sites, whereas old secondary growth between 13 to 17 years of abandonment, and forest understories, bad the most similar avifauna Two trophic groups were absent from the samples of the forest interior, and the abundance of the other nine varied among sites of regeneration. We conclude that slash and burn agriculture represents a high-intensity, small-magnitude disturbance to the forest avifauna Large changes occur when the crop field is established and last until about 10 years after abandonment Our data suggest that abandoned crop fields older than this age mimic the natural patch dynamics of the forest, making this type of agriculture an example of a potentially sustainable use of tropical forests, at least from the standpoint of its impact on bird communities.

ID INTERNATIONAL MIGRATION; SECURITY; CONFLICT; AFRICA
AB It is noted that the number of more or less permanently displaced persons throughout the world (now of the order of 1% of the total human population) continues to increase at a rate of approximately 3 millions per year; the situation in Africa is especially gave, with the number of displaced persons there (now of the order of 3% of the African population), continuing to increase at a rate of approximately 1.5 million per year. Human displacement - which can be seen to originate largely in rural areas - results primarily from one or more of three factors, namely escape from persecution, escape from military activities, or escape from inadequate means of subsistence. A number of examples from Africa are provided of the social and political consequences of human displacement, with emphasis on conflict situations at the sites of relocation.
   It is further noted that the numbers of displaced persons continue to grow relentlessly despite there being no discernible rise in persecution or military activities, and despite the long-sustained ameliorative efforts and financial assistance by intergovernmental agencies and others.
   It is accordingly suggested that the major cause of the continuing increase in the numbers of displaced persons is an ever-growing imbalance between population numbers and the human carrying capacity of the land. Population increases lead to smaller per caput natural resource bases, a predicament exacerbated by over-use - and thus degradation - of the land and its natural resources. In the arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, over-use of the land most often takes the form of overgrazing, leading to land degradation that is severe enough to be referred to as desertification. It is concluded that to achieve sustainable utilization of the land and its natural resources will necessitate the integrated attainment of environmental security and societal security - the latter inter alia requiring participatory governance, non-violent means of conflict resolution, and especially population controls.

ID CONSERVATION; WILDLIFE
AB In Madagascar, as practically throughout the world, many protected areas were originally created with little consideration for the resource requirements of local people and consequently are now suffering from acute pressure from local exploitation. In an attempt to redress the problems, integrated conservation and development projects have been initiated. The original aims to protect a representative ecocomplex are now expected to be achieved by understanding people's requirements and enhancing traditional practices or providing alternatives, and the aims have been expanded to promote the sustainable use of resources also outside of reserves.
   These two projects, at Andohahela and Soalala, are duly considered, using a framework that has been developed to understand local people's behaviour in relation to resources. Economic, energy, cultural, and ecological, factors, acting as interdependent systems, are considered. The economic, energy, and cultural, factors influence each other, acting together to define the values or resources to people and driving their behaviour in relation to those resources. The behaviour affects the ecological system and may alter the availability of useful resources, depending on the level of use and their resilience. The availability of resources affects the energetic effort required to collect them, so establishing a feedback link.
   The aims of the projects are to establish ecological equilibria that protect the reserves and enable sustainable use to be made of resources outside the reserve. To achieve these goals they must influence people's behaviour suitably. Strategies include strengthening feedback from the ecological system, and providing energy or economic incentives. Development activities which aim to promote sustainable use of resources and protect biodiversity, through maintenance of the protected area, are assessed. Many projects give a high priority to income generation and improved access to social services; however, the conservation aims of a project often require a better targeted, resource management-based development package. This paper advocates the consideration of economic, energy, ecological, and above all cultural, factors in the design of effective activities for conservation and development projects.

AB This paper supplies a critique of the view that a practice which ought not to he followed is ipso facto not sustainable, a view recently defended by Nigel Dower. It is argued that there are ethical criteria independent of the criterion of sustainability. The concept of sustainability is thus retrieved for the distinctive role and the important ser-vice in which environmental and social theorists (paradoxically including Dower) have hitherto employed it, not least when debating the nature, merits and demerits of sustainable development.

DE OBSERVATION NETWORK; WATER SUPPLY; WELL; DESIGN; PARAMETER UNCERTAINTY
AB An observation network design method, which simultaneously minimizes parameter uncertainty and exploration cost, is developed for locating water supply wells. Observation networks combining wells and geophysical measurements are considered for delineating the 'best' areas for wells. An area is considered the 'best' where the sustainable pumping rate and the degree of protection for the well are the possible maximum. The level of protection is measured by the travel time for a fixed radius protection zone around a well. The 'most appropriate' measurement network is selected based on two often conflicting objectives: (1) minimization of the uncertainty in characterizing the spatial distribution of the expected yield and travel time; and (2) minimization of the observation cost. The accuracy of estimation is characterized by the average and maximum kriging variance for yields and travel times calculated from measured hydrogeologic parameters. The parameters to be measured by an observation network for estimating yields and travel times are layer thicknesses, porosity, hydraulic conductivity and volumetric water content. They may be obtained from direct measurements (e.g. well logs, specific capacity test, and pumping tests) or estimated indirectly from geoelectric measurements. The approach combines two common techniques, geostatistics and multi-criterion decision making (MCDM), to determine the 'best' measurement network. Geostatistics are used to determine the spatial distribution of the estimation variance for yield and travel time calculated from different sources of data. MCDM is utilized to evaluate observation network alternatives based on the estimation variances and the costs associated with them. The methodology is illustrated for a study area located near Ashland, Nebraska.

AB This study identifies the demand for distributional impact assessment related to forest policies and projects and the linkages between distributional impacts and sustainable development. An integrated model is developed to assess distributional impact of forest policies and projects. The procedures of distributional impact assessment are discussed Emphasis is placed on the usefulness of the model in practice by integrating monetary and nonmonetary measures. The distributional impacts of the introduction of structural particleboard technology are assessed to illustrate the use of the model. The results show that useful information can be obtained by this integrated approach.

DE FOOD SECURITY; NUTRITION MONITORING; METHODOLOGY
AB This paper provides an overview of the concepts, issues and challenges that planners and policy makers face in designing food security and nutrition monitoring systems and using their outcome in the formulation of policies and intervention programmes. The principles involved in various types of monitoring systems are outlined after a brief review of their objectives. This is followed by a description of necessary steps in implementing a monitoring system and possible flows of information and its use in various stages of decision making. Identifying relevant issues in designing different types of food security and nutrition monitoring, future challenges facing governments, academic institutions and donor agencies in developing sustainable monitoring systems are discussed. Presenting some of the leading research issues in improving the design and implementation of food security and nutrition monitoring, some guidelines for evaluating their performances in meeting the objectives of improved policy making and reduced food insecurity and malnutrition are provided. The paper concludes that a monitoring system which is simple, user-driven, based on existing institutional structures which increases the capacity for analysis and interpretation and has the commitment of relevant decision makers for using the information in policy design is more likely to be sustainable and successful.

AB The failure of forest owners and managers to exclude user groups from use of the resource forces them to opt for a collaborative management approach, termed as joint management or comanagement. Joint forest management has been compared with agriculture crop sharing arrangements. With the objective of making joint forest management a sustainable venture, a model based on the cooperative/bargaining nature of the agreements for sharing the forest produce between the two partners has been developed. Shares of the two partners have been worked out for two cases of joint forest management from the state of West Bengal in India, and outcomes have been compared with existing sharing arrangements.

TI USING SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT - THE BUSINESS CASE
SO GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS
LA English
DT Article
AB Sustainable development has been adopted by a variety of interests in the international environmental debate, each of which constructs the meaning of the phrase in its own terms. The author analyses the publications and activities of the international Chamber of Commerce (ICC) to show that a business construction of sustainable development may exclude key elements identified by other commentators, especially three different forms of equity (intergenerational, intragenerational and international), and concentrate instead on market mechanisms and technological change. This links sustainable development primarily to growth, and only secondarily to environmental quality or social equality, and demonstrates how a potentially radical notion can be used by reformist groups to influence the policy debate.

AB Health information is essential for proper management and deployment of limited resources in the health services of the Pacific Islands. There have been numerous efforts to establish and strengthen sustainable information systems but the common feature of these attempts has been the very limited achievement. Subsequently, the use of information as a management tool has been abandoned in favour of 'gut feeling', hearsay and adhocry. In the last decade health planning and primary health care activities have necessitated the re-emphasis of monitoring and surveillance of health and health service indicators. Therefore a revival of interest in health information systems is taking place.
   A review of national health information systems in the Pacific showed that routinely collected data remained largely untouched by human thought. The contributing factors to the current inertia are examined with suggestions on how to elevate health information from its current lowly status to its rightful place as an essential tool for management. The special problems of small island states, like limited resources, geographical isolation, natural barriers to technology, and diverse cultural milieu, will be examined in relation to an appropriate health information system for Pacific Island countries in the twenty-first century.

TI THE ROLE OF INFORMATION IN THE PLANNING, MANAGEMENT AND EVALUATION OF
   COMMUNITY NUTRITION-PROGRAMS
SO HEALTH POLICY AND PLANNING
LA English
DT Article
AB Protein-energy malnutrition has many diverse location-specific causes which make if difficult to solve through uniform interventions implemented through vertical programmes. This paper investigates the role of information in the planning, management and evaluation of several community nutrition programmes judged to be successful. The programmes come from Tanzania (Iringa), India (Tamil Nadu), Dominican Republic and Colombia.
   The review finds that the initial conceptualization and design of these programmes benefited from the results of earlier surveys and experience with similar programmes in the same or other countries. Strong capacity for operations research is important to assist with a myriad of small but important programme design details and larger mid-term re-orientations. The impact of this information depends upon the flexibility of the programme and receptivity of its management towards a learning-by-doing approach. Information for on-going programme management differs widely and conforms to the overall character of the individual programme. Thus, Iringa employs a simple system based on community growth monitoring, primarily to catalyze intervention planning and action at household and community levels. Tamil Nadu's system is far more complex and is primarily intended to assist in the delivery of centrally planned interventions. Programme evaluation benefited from information generated within the programme, but more rigorous impact evaluation requires stronger designs and more in-depth analysis than is usually provided. Overall, the review suggests that characteristics like community participation, empowerment and growth monitoring are less important in the short/medium term than strong management, a learning-by-doing approach, and the existence of some method for informing programme design and management about community needs and responses to the programme. The former characteristics may well be important for the longer-term sustainability of programmes.

AB Using a stress-capability framework, the problems and opportunities for sustainable development at the village level in Bali are examined. Balinese culture incorporates a traditional form of local government which emphasizes cooperation, consensus building, and balance. These aspects provide a strong foundation for sustainable development initiatives. At the same time, many decisions are being taken external to the villages, and even to Bali, which may lead to problems for development initiatives.

AB A long-term field experiment was conducted during 1977-78 to 1990-91 on medium black soil to evaluate the effect of continuous sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench]-wheat (Triticum aestivum L. emend. Fiori and Paol.) cropping and manuring on sustainability. The yield of both the crops, energy output and net returns increased with an increase in level of each nutrient during all the years. The response per unit nutrient applied and benefit :cost ratio drastically declined with increased levels of nutrients. The total energy-use efficiency and energy productivity increased only up to an 80 kg N/ha. However, energy intensiveness showed the reverse trend. Application of P and K decreased the energy-use efficiency and energy productivity but increased the energy intensiveness.

TI THE PRESERVATION OF ASIAN WETLANDS - BIRDS AND THEIR PROBLEMS
SO INTERDISCIPLINARY SCIENCE REVIEWS
LA English
DT Article
AB As man continues to destroy the resources of the planet at an alarming rate, conservationists have come to realise that preserving large tracts of land or specific animal species is seldom a practical proposition.  Emphasis is increasingly being placed on the sustainable use of natural resources.  Wetlands are among the world's most productive ecosystems, and can be of benefit to both Homo sapiens and other species.  In tropical and subtropical Asia they play a crucial role in the migration patterns of birds, offering wintering grounds to some, while others use them to rest and refuel during their long flights.  Man benefits from the wetlands in terms of water conservation and purification, flood control, stabilisation of shorelines and timber and food production.  Over two-thirds of the world's fish harvest is linked to the health of wetland areas.  Yet we continue to destroy or modify these valuable assets.  Wetlands in Vietnam, China, Hong Kong and India are under discussion here.  In two cases they have been completely destroyed, owing to the iniquities of war and the hunger for agricultural land, and subsequently restored.  All have been dramatically modified, and are subject to other threats such as land reclamation, pollution and drought caused by deforestation of surrounding areas.  Meanwhile, as other wetlands in the region fall victim to man's shortsightedness, increasing numbers of birds are obliged to rely on those which remain.  Some of these bird species are highly endangered, and the conservation of their habitat has become crucial to their survival.  They may provide a useful figurehead for conservation efforts, but we should no longer consider saving a single species a sufficient goal.  Both the wildlife and its human neighbours should be able to share the benefits bestowed by healthy wetlands.

AB This paper examines the relationship between product differentiation and the sustainability of collusive pricing in markets for vertically differentiated products. The main finding is that collusion is more easily sustained, the more similar the products are. Exactly the opposite result may be obtained in models of horizontal differentiation. Consequently, when products are differentiated both horizontally and vertically, theory provides no clearcut prediction.

SO INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION
LA English

ID ECONOMY; IMPACT; NAFTA; AREA
AB Standard explanations for trade liberalization do not fully account for Mexico's turn toward free trade during the 1980s. To a large extent, the initiative came from within the country. Even many Mexican entrepreneurs whose sectors seem likely to lose from increased competition now support trade liberalization. Four conditions lowered the ''political cost-benefit ratio'' for policymakers and entrepreneurs. First, Mexico's leaders dispersed implementation into several financial ministries, thereby better insulating this policy from lobbying by the likely ''losers.'' Second, potential losers were less well-informed than were likely ''winners.'' Third, under these conditions, the liberal ideological biases of Mexican elite policymakers and investors flourished, prompting them to accept a higher political cost than would have been tolerated otherwise. Finally, many Mexicans came to perceive trade liberalization as a necessary tool in the fight against inflation. Each of these hypotheses, however, also flags a possible threat to the policy's future political survival.

TI SUSTAINABILITY OF CONJUNCTIVE WATER-USE FOR SALINITY CONTROL IN
   IRRIGATION AREAS - THEORY AND APPLICATION TO THE SHEPPARTON REGION,
   AUSTRALIA
SO IRRIGATION SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
AB The long term sustainability of conjunctive water use for controlling irrigation salinity is affected by increase in groundwater salinity over time. This paper uses mass conservation of salt and water to assess groundwater degradation over long time scales. Management options which affect this rate of degradation are also examined. The groundwater model developed is illustrated using data from the Shepparton Irrigation Region in the Murray Basin, Australia. The model predicts rapid groundwater deterioration when conjunctive use is conducted over only a fraction of the area of influence of a groundwater pump. Where the pumped aquifer is underlain by deeper groundwaters, the rate of groundwater degradation is also affected by leakage into or out of the conjunctive use system. Surface redistribution of groundwater from pumps installed in zones of regional groundwater discharge to areas recharging the regional groundwaters, reduces excessive degradation in the zones of discharge. With optimal surface distribution of groundwater, the rate of degradation is low. The rate of groundwater degradation also depends on salt inputs from irrigation water and rainfall, and the average depth from the soil surface to the base of the aquifer. The rate of degradation resulting from applied salts in surface water and rainfall is typically about 0.01 dSm(-1) per year for shallow aquifers in the Shepparton region, but the rate is lower where deeper aquifers are pumped. Partial irrigation also reduces the rate of degradation because of the reduced rate of salt inputs. Where poorer quality groundwater lies within the area of influence of the groundwater pump, a greater rate of deterioration in the quality of pumped groundwater can be expected from groundwater mixing. In some irrigation regions limited export of groundwater through surface water conveyance structures to a river is possible, so that a regional surface salt balance could be maintained. However, salt exports made equal to the rate of surface imports into the irrigated area will only significantly impact groundwater salinity in the very long term, or where only shallow aquifers can be pumped. In addition, this export can be costly for downstream water users, or if construction of additional conveyance infrastructure is extensive; export can have a detrimental impact on riverine ecosystems. Other management options such as the depth of pump installation and the spatial distribution of irrigation water and pumped groundwater, which affect the redistribution of salts within the groundwater system, have the potential to have a much greater impact on local groundwater salinity.

AB Autoprotection is a phenomenon whereby prior exposure to a small dose of a chemical results in protection against a subsequently administered lethal dose of the same compound. While CCl4 autoprotection has been studied the most, it has also been demonstrated for other chemicals. Recent studies indicate that the prevailing concept of decreased bioactivation of the normally lethal dose of CCl4 owing to decreased hepatic microsomal cytochrome P-450(1) content cannot be supported by direct end points of liver injury such as necrosis. These findings suggest a pivotal role for hepatocellular division and tissue healing processes stimulated by the protective dose in the mechanism of autoprotection. Augmentation of hepatocellular regeneration and tissue repair, stimulated by the protective dose, appears to permit timely recovery and restoration of hepatic structure and function. In the absence of the protective dose, hepatocellular division is substantially deficient and it occurs too late to tip the delicate balance between recovery from injury and progression of massive injury in favor of recovery. Abolition of autoprotection by colchicine antimitosis, under conditions where metabolism and disposition Of CCl4 are not altered, is supportive of this concept. Selective colchicine antimitotic suppression of the early phase of hepatocellular division and tissue repair induced by a low dose of CCl4 results in progression of toxic liver injury, leading to hepatic failure and mortality. Studies have shown that pretreatment with phenobarbital results in postponed low-dose CCl4-stimulated cell division by 24 hours, which accordingly postpones the optimal autoprotection. These findings provide discrete evidence to suggest that the protective dose-stimulated hepatocellular division and tissue repair underlies the mechanism of autoprotection. These new insights reveal that in contrast to the widely held concept, the ultimate outcome of toxic injury is determined by whether a prompt stimulation of sustainable tissue repair can occur rather than by the magnitude of the injury inflicted by a toxic chemical.

AB In primates, plasma testosterone concentrations are elevated for some 3 months from birth. The function of this rise is uncertain, but studies in rats suggest that its prevention by castration or administration of gonadotrophin hormone-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogues has effects on development and expression of social and sexual behaviours, and adverse long-term effects on fertility. The consequences of suppression of this rise in testosterone by treatment with the GnRH antagonist antide have been investigated in the marmoset monkey. Eight sets of male:male twins were used, one of each set receiving s.c. injections of antide (10 mg/kg), on days 0, 3 and 7, then weekly from birth to 98 days of age, with the twin receiving vehicle only. Plasma samples were taken at weekly intervals for the determination of testosterone concentrations from birth until 2 years of age. Treatment with antide completely abolished the neonatal rise in testosterone seen in control animals. The timing of the onset of the pubertal testosterone rise was not significantly affected by treatment; however, the subsequent pattern of circulating testosterone showed a tendency to decreased plasma concentrations in the neonatally treated group from weeks 25 to 42, relative to controls, and this difference was significant between 43 and 70 weeks. This was associated with a similar depression in bioactive LH concentrations around this time. Thereafter, the testosterone concentrations were similar between treated and control groups. There was no effect of treatment on growth, based on sequential body weight data. At 20 months the animals underwent behaviour tests with ovariectomized females. During these encounters, males showed the full panoply of normal sexual behaviours, with response to female proceptivity, tongue flicking, sustainable penile erections, mounts with pelvic thrusting, intromissions and intravaginal ejaculations. No significant differences were observed for any of these parameters between the control and treated animals. No changes in aggressive behaviours between groups were evident. These results show that blockade of the postnatal rise in testosterone in the male marmoset monkey may result in attenuation of the pubertal rise in testosterone but is without major effect on adult basal testosterone concentrations or reproductive behaviour.

AB Plant and soil nematodes significantly impact our lives. Therefore, we must understand and manage these complex organisms so that we may continue to develop and sustain our food production systems, our natural resources, our environment, and our quality of life. This publication looks specifically at soil and plant nematology. First, the societal impact of nematodes and benefits of nematology research are briefly presented. Next, the opportunities facing nematology in the next decade are outlined, as well as the resources needed to address these priorities. The safety and sustainability of U.S. food and fiber production depends on public and administrative understanding of the importance of nematodes, the drastic effects of nematodes on many agricultural and horticultural crops, and the current research priorities of nematology.

AB The effects of 12 summer crop rotation treatments on population densities of Meloidogyne arenaria race 1 and on yields of subsequent spring vegetable crops were determined in microplots. The crop sequence was: (i) rotation crops during summer 1991; (ii) cover crop of rye (Secale cereale) during winter 1991-92; (iii) squash (Cucurbita pepo) during spring 1992; (iv) rotation crops during summer 1992; (v) rye during winter 1992-93; (vi) eggplant (Solanum melongena) during spring 1993. The 12 rotation treatments were castor (Ricinus communis), cotton (Gossypium hirsutum), velvetbean (Mucuna deeringiana), crotalaria (Crotalaria spectabilis), fallow, hairy indigo (Indigofera hirsuta), American jointvetch (Aeschynomene americana), sorghum-sudangrass (Sorghum bicolor x S. sudanense), soybean (Glycine max), horsebean (Canavalia ensiformis), sesame (Sesamum indicum), and peanut (Arachis hypogaea). Compared to peanut, the first eight rotation treatments resulted in lower (P less-than-or-equal-to 0.05) numbers of M. arenaria juveniles on most sampling dates. Soybean, horsebean, and sesame rotations were less effective in suppressing nematodes. Yield of squash was greater (P less-than-or-equal-to 0.05) following castor, cotton, velvetbean, and crotalaria than following peanut. Compared to the peanut rotation, yield of eggplant was enhanced (P less-than-or-equal-to 0.10) following castor, crotalaria, hairy indigo, American jointvetch, and sorghum-sudangrass. Several of these rotation crops may provide a means for depressing M. arenaria population densities on a short-term basis to enhance yields in a subsequent susceptible vegetable crop.

TI RESTRUCTURING FOR RESILIENCE - THE NASA MODEL
SO JOURNAL OF POLICY ANALYSIS AND MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
ID PROGRAM
AB Two decades of incremental decisions have locked in a vision of human space exploration through an interdependent civil space program centered on the Shuttle and the Space Station. The program lacks the resilience necessary to contain cost overruns, schedule slips, and capability cutbacks. The result is overcommitment, which makes it difficult to sustain the program in a budget-constrained environment. Coping with overcommitment through budget cuts in space science, applications, and technology could split the post-Apollo coalition and jeopardize NASA as an institution. Alternatively, terminating the Space Station could eliminate overcommitment, strengthen NASA's political base, and facilitate restructuring toward a resilient program that is sustainable. A restructured NASA might once again become a model for other agencies.

TI SIGNIFICANT ISSUES FOR THE FUTURE OF PRODUCT INNOVATION
SO JOURNAL OF PRODUCT INNOVATION MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB In this issue, Merle Crawford and Milton Rosenau present their thoughts on some of the issues confronting product development professionals. Both reflect on the emergence of new products management as a profession-a field with its own requirements for success. Crawford wonders about the sustainability of our current use of teams for much of our work, the need for improved measurements, and the overall relationship between the management of new initiatives and the ongoing work of the organization. As new products work become more integrated with corporate operations, what new responsibilities will we face, beyond our current challenges? Rosenau looks squarely at the complex issues of rewards and compensation. How can we modify systems that have traditionally evaluated individual performance and adjust them to fit various cooperative work patterns necessary in new product development? He calls for formal study of these important issues. These essays continue a year-long series of contributions that the editor-in-chief solicited from members of the editorial board. Members were asked to reflect on changes and opportunities that they feel will influence our profession during the coming decade. Both of these short essays are designed to introduce new perspectives. It is not essential that you agree with the recommendations, but we hope that you are stimulated as you reflect on the issues that are raised.

TI ANGOLA - THE FORGOTTEN TRAGEDY
SO JOURNAL OF SOUTHERN AFRICAN STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
AB Angola's September 1992 election should have marked the end of 30 years of conflict.  The legacy of Angola's pivotal position within the Cold War, and ten years of South African destabilisation, have denied Angola a sustainable peace.  This article places the election within an historical context, discussing the preceding events and then offers explanations for its failure.  Particular attention is paid to the role played by the United States and the United Nations, with the conclusion that the international community abandoned Angola at this critical moment in the country's history.  The resumption of the war has seen the development of military tactics new to Angola, in particular the siege, which has characterised this phase of the struggle.  The siege of central Angolan towns has continued against a backdrop of negotiations to achieve a cease-fire and peace settlement.  The international community has responded to the conflict by condemning one of the parties to the struggle, and by imposing limited sanctions.  However, there have been inconsistencies within the UN's response which have left it open to manipulation and weakened its efforts to play a decisive role in negotiating peace.

   SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT; TOTAL CATCHMENT PLANNING; WATER USE MANAGEMENT
AB This paper deals with some of the strategic issues arising from the consideration of the sustainable development of river catchments. Principles and best practice are discussed, both in general terms and as challenges to professionals involved with the coordinated planning and management of river catchments.
   Points are illustrated with reference to experience in the highly developed River Thames catchment, where the many demands made on the water environment require complex multifunctional decision-making.
   Sustainability offers a new paradigm and common language to support decision-making for sustainable development. The appropriate institutional and legislative framework will be supported by tools such as environmental appraisal, strategic environmental assessment and economic instruments. Within this context, the implicit partnership between asset management planning, catchment management planning and land-use planning has the potential to deliver sustainable development for the water environment, through a process which may be called 'total' catchment planning.
   It is suggested that source control will play a major role in the search for 'prevention rather than cure' as a basic principle of sustainability.

TI SOUTH-KOREA NEW DEFENSE POLICY AND MILITARY STRATEGY
SO KOREAN JOURNAL OF DEFENSE ANALYSIS
LA English
DT Article
AB Peace in Korea is fragile.  Despite the worldwide recovery of realism that has reduced the effectiveness of military muscle as a means of achieving policy objectives and the bankruptcy of communism that culminated in the collapse of the Eastern bloc and its hegemon the Soviet Union, Korea still remains to be changed.  The North Korean nuclear issue has yet to be resolved thoroughly; military tension along the demarcation line and zone has not yet eased safely; and, between the two halves of Korea, the degree of mutual distrust has yet to be lowered while that of mutual understanding and cooperation is yet to be enhanced vigorously.  This is why peace in Korea is fragile.  A North Korean awareness, however, of the practical necessity in dealing with the nuclear issue and the credible deterrent capability and intention of the US-Korean alliance regime could save peace in Korea from deteriorating further.  Like the one in the contemporary world, peace in Korea needs to be buttressed by proper means and measures.  In this sense, peace in Korea is fragile but salvageable.
   Because the Korean peninsula is the hub of Northeast Asia, because, for this reason, the peninsula had been the battleground of the wars fought among the neighboring powers, because, for the same reason, it was the forefront of the ideological hotfront in the Cold-War era, maintaining a peaceful and sustainable Korea is a necessary precondition for securing stability in the region.  South Korea, in this regard, has its own mandated role, and the neighboring powers have theirs.  South Korea, keeping this mission in mind, has set its security policy and goals:  safeguarding persistence, peace, and prosperity not only for the Koreans but also for the people in the region.  Too, South Korea sets its defense-oriented policy and strategy through utilizing all military and extra-military measures.
   Realizing the mandated responsibility and the various constraints for national healthy survival, South Korea is developing its version of ''total defense'' policy and strategy.  It is based on the premise that deterring war is far better than defending the country in contingency.  Having experienced a savage intra-Korean war and a near total destruction from the fighting, South Korea cherishes the importance of preventing a war far more than that of waging a victorious war.  The ROK has maintained a solid military strength and defense alliance mechanism with the United States to secure peace in Korea, has vigorously pursued Northern Policy, and has adopted its active-defense posture so that it can play a solid role as the geostrategic hub of the region in name and practice.

AB The energy use pattern of a mountain agroecoststem, which represents a typical mountain village having about 90% of rainfed agriculture, was analysed. The non-commercial energy contributed a major portion (about 98%) of the total energy consumption in the functioning of the village. Of the total energy consumed in cropland, 28% was imported from forest and market. The agronomic production met from the cropland was one-quarter of the food demand and less than 20% of the fodder demand. To support one unit of agronomic production about 17 units of energy came from the forest at the village level.
   The requirement of the agroecosystem was found to be far greater than the availability of the forests. Land topography, social and economic conditions are the main barriers to the advancement of technology in the mountain region. For a sustainable development of this agroecosystem, environmental and social factors should be considered. The vegetation of natural forests of the region will be an essential component to achieve sustainability. By developing forest-based farms and the cottage industries that depend on them, the economic conditions would be improved. Alternative land use is needed to ensure the sustainability of agroecosystems as well as to check further environmental degradation.

AB Long run trajectories for the shares of agricultural, industrial and ecospheric wealth in open interacting economic system are modelled by a three-dimensional system of ordinary differential equations using a predator-prey paradigm. For the two-dimensional case, corresponding to an ecosphere in equilibrium, stability properties are determined and possible bifurcation behaviour is described and interpreted. Bifurcation values for the parameters are described for the cases of less developed and industrialized economies. Discovery of rich dynamics, including the possibilities of bifurcations leading to creation of new attractors, offer promise that this modelling approach may shed greater light on the conditions under which economies may move to more desired levels of agricultural wealth. The model predicts that an agricultural economy ages by slowing its learning, seeking and obtaining greater stability, eventually leading to trapping. Efforts external to an economic system, such as freer trade or foreign aid require complementary endogenous restructuring of parameters to avoid regression to stable nodes or foci, or to limit cycles. Economic restructuring needs to focus on enriching the dynamics of system behaviour.

AB Inland valleys are the upper reaches of river systems, comprising valley bottoms and minor floodplains which may be submerged for part of the year, their hydromorphic fringes, and contiguous upland slopes and crests. Valley bottoms and hydromorphic fringes are estimated to occupy between 22-52 million ha of land in West Africa. In spite of their potential for agricultural use, they are only marginally used and with limited success. The high physical and biotic complexity and heterogeneity of inland valleys explain why little progress has been made in the systematic characterization of inland valley systems.
   We propose a multi-scale agro-ecological characterization with increasing detail at four levels: macro level (scales between 1:1,000,000 and 1:5,000,000), reconnaissance level (1:100,000-1:250,000), semi-detailed level (scales 1:25,000-1:50,000), and detailed level (1:5,000-10,000). Methods of characterization at each of these levels are discussed, and examples of actual applications are given, as well as the mechanisms applied in desaggregation (scaling down) and aggregation (scaling up) between characterization levels. This approach allows (i) a systematic description of (different) inland valley agro-ecosystems; (ii) identification of constraints to sustainable agricultural use; (iii) targeting and implementation of research; and (iv) extrapolation of research results and transfer of newly developed technologies to other areas with similar agro-ecological conditions.
   Agro-ecological characterization of inland valleys carried out so far, shows that variation in (bio)physical and land use factors is considerable, both between levels and within valleys. The set of descriptors now developed, allows for extrapolation in particular of the relation between biophysical driving factors and actual land use. Besides, it allows the identification of geographic areas where improved management is promising, as well as indications on the types of improvement required to overcome constraints.

AB Draught animals still do much of the work on farms in developing countries, as well as being used for transportation. Despite the efforts made by governments to promote mechanization, tractors are not a realistic alternative for the overage small farmer. Animals such as the buffalo have been used for centuries without causing any air or water pollution or soil compaction; they are an integral part of a sustainable agriculture, producing milk, meat and manure without any external cash inputs, and they buffer the farmer against crop failure and provide companionship. Draught animal power on small farms is not a backward way of farming but it needs support from research and development agencies if it is to develop its full potential.

TI SMALL RUMINANTS - POTENTIAL VALUE AND CONTRIBUTION TO SUSTAINABLE
   DEVELOPMENT
SO OUTLOOK ON AGRICULTURE
LA English
DT Article
AB Small ruminants - that is, sheep and goats - have an important contribution to make to sustainable development. A high proportion of the world's sheep and goat populations are found in Africa and Asia, mainly on mixed farms under rainfed systems, and they are significant assets for poor people. They provide meat, milk, fibre and skins and act as a buffer against environmental fluctuations, reducing risks for the farmer. Current levels of productivity are low, and for meat the gap between output and demand is widening. Improvements in the productivity of small ruminants and in their contribution to development will depend on increased efficiency in the use of goats and sheep, integrated use of natural resources, targetting of the poor, wider use of improved technologies at the farm level, and greater attention to ecosystem and ecoregional development.

TI SUSTAINABLE GROWTH IN THE UNITED-STATES GAS UTILITY INDUSTRY
SO RESOURCES POLICY
LA English
DT Article
AB Sustainable growth models are financial planning tools which weigh financial objectives with operational performance to determine the optimum level of growth for a firm.  The gas utility industry is unlike many other industries in that its growth has been dependent on its ability to raise substantial capital in the equity markets.  This paper examines the actual and sustainable growth of the US gas utility industry from 1970 to 1990.  Each sector of the industry - distribution, transmission, integrated and combination - has different financial objectives and operational performance which has resulted in different rates of growth in revenues.  The inefficiency of the pricing system established by the regulation of these sectors was apparent in the declining profit margins in the 1970s and rising asset utilization ratios in the 1980s, both of which adversely affected the sustainable growth rates.  Substantial growth potential exists in this industry through future stock issues, operational improvements and changes in financial objectives.  Sustainable growth models are shown to be an effective financial planning tool, as well as a tool for directing policies to stimulate growth in this industry.

   ORIGINS; FORESTS; FISHERY; ISSUES; SALMON
AB The concept of sustainability is central to many current natural resource debates. While the concept has substantial appeal, consensus on its meaning is lacking, especially concerning what combinations of resources or practices should be sustained. The many meanings of sustainability are addressed by first presenting four defining questions: what is sustained, why sustain it, how is sustainability measured, and what are the politics? These questions are used to identify what we see as nine distinct types of sustainability, each reflecting a different vision of which resources should be sustained. Illustrations are drawn from three major renewable natural resource areas-agriculture, forestry, and marine fisheries.

AB This paper employs diffusion and farm-structure variables to explain variations in Montana farmers' adoption of two kinds of sustainable agricultural practices: those involving intensive management and those which require fewer purchased inputs.  While perceived profitability was found to be the most important factor affecting adoption of both, the independent variables had different effects on beliefs about net economic returns as well as on adoption of the two practices. Type of farm enterprise played a larger role in adoption of the low-input practices than the management intensive ones; access to information was more important for the latter. Implications for policy are discussed.

AB This paper examines the evolution of population policies in the Caribbean region.  Superficial examination of socioeconomic and demographic conditions and trends in the Caribbean may suggest that population policies are not critical for improvements in social and economic well being.  However, serious demographic impediments to development exist, including high rates of teenage fertility, youthful age structures with a rising proportion of people aged 65 and older, high population densities, and significant emigration.  National population policies in the region are highly variable, but generally reflect insufficient recognition of problematic demographic conditions and trends typical of microstates.  Caribbean governments should give increased attention to the development of viable and effective population policies addressed to their particular demographic situation.

AB The concept and some definitions of sustainable agriculture are reviewed. Most of these definitions include economic, environmental and sociological aspects. The finite area of land emphasizes the need for consideration of soil conservation and of soil quality in relation to sustainability. An important element of soil quality is rooting depth. Therefore loss of soil by erosion is a dominant factor in long-term sustainability. The effects of tillage on soil parameters in minimum data sets that have been proposed to describe soil quality are reviewed. Soil organic matter may be one of the most important soil quality characteristics in relation to tillage because of its influence on other soil physical, chemical and biological properties. Conservation tillage practices can increase the organic matter content, aggregate stability and cation exchange capacity (CEC) of the topsoil. However, bulk density and penetrometer resistance are also increased, especially with zero tillage. Although such soil quality parameters may form a basis for describing some of the consequences of particular tillage practices, they do not provide a basis for predicting the outcome in terms of crop growth and yield. This is both because critical values of soil quality parameters have not been defined and because in some soils biopore formation in zero or minimally tilled land can modify the soil for water movement and for root growth and function.
   The effects of tillage on crop growth and yield in long-term experiments are reviewed. The review only includes experiments in North America, Europe and New Zealand that have lasted 10 years or more to allow for seasonal variation in weather, possible progressive changes in soil conditions and the learning phase often experienced when new tillage methods are used. While there is a good deal of variation in the results of these tillage experiments some patterns have emerged. In long-term experiments, yields of maize in Europe and the US and soybeans in the US have been similar after ploughing and no-tillage. especially on well-drained soils. In Europe. yields of winter cereals have also been similar after traditional and simplified tillage but yields of spring cereals have sometimes been less, after direct drilling than ploughing.
   Trends in tillage practices are reviewed. Conservation tillage in the US is increasing and is used on about 30% of cropland. including no-till on about 10% of cropland. This increase in use of conservation tillage is mainly attributed to the legal requirement for farmers who arc in government price support programs to adopt conservation plans which may involve conservation tillage. However, the allowable rates of erosion in these plans are likely to be in excess of rates of erosion for long-term sustainability. Survey information on tillage practices needs to be considered in relation to predictions on suitability of conservation tillage based on experimental results- In the semi-arid prairies of Canada there is a trend toward fewer cultivation operations, but in eastern Canada the mouldboard plough is still the dominant tillage method. In Europe although erosion is less obvious it is believed to be increasing, but minimum tillage is not widely used. This is because of the need to remove at least some straw for successful minimum tillage in sequential winter wheat and barley crops. but there are few economic uses for straw, and burning is illegal in many countries. In the more moist cooler conditions of Europe grass weed proliferation is another constraint, at least with present terminology, So far, the overall success of conservation tillage has not been limited by the growing problem of genetic resistance of weeds to herbicides. Societal attitudes to the continued use of herbicides may pose longer-term problems for some conservation tillage practices.

AB In the first part of this review article, soil-tool interactions are described at the simplest level of integration, i.e. the process level. It deals with the initial soil condition, toolshape, toolspeed and the movement of drawn and power take-off (PTO) driven implements, low and high speed soil movement, soil strength and the tool forces. At the next higher levels of integration, i.e. operation and treatment, the field performance of implements is described. The pros and cons of the various drawn and PTO driven implements for primary tillage are discussed, such as mouldboard, chisel and disc ploughs, and spading machines, including equipment for reduced and conservation tillage. Drawn and PTO powered secondary tillage tools are also discussed in some detail. Energy and labour requirements are related to seedbed quality, achieved in terms of the degree of pulverization. In conclusion, some attention is paid to the ranking and evaluation at farm level of the various implements in practical tillage and cropping systems. Long-term developments are anticipated and the future needs of sustainable agriculture described, with an indication of themes such as farming-by-soil and management of soil-ecosystems.

AB Resource use in crop production is analysed with reference to the concept of potential yield, based on the relationships between the balances of energy and mass in plant growth. Three models of the production process are proposed: a bio-physical model which looks at the conversion of energy and mass into a potential yield of biomass, a business model which towards the economics of the conversion process and a feed-back model which points the way towards on-line optimisation. The impacts of environmental, nutritional and physiological constraints on potential yield are discussed. The business model emphasises the importance of scale of operation in reducing the costs of crop production by spreading the fixed costs of machinery. The contributions of additional energy inputs in the form of fertilisers, agrichemicals and machinery in improving the overall efficiency with which solar energy is converted into biomass, together with the pivotal role of nitrogenous fertiliser in increasing yields, are examined. Nitrogenous fertilisers underpin high yields and account for about half the energy supplied by the farmer to a cereal crop. Tillage helps in ameliorating the environmental constraints on crop growth. The implications of sustainability, and climate change, for resource use in crop production are discussed briefly.

DE CATCHMENT; MANAGEMENT; PRODUCTIVITY; SUSTAINABILITY; UNIT
AB Soil cultivation caused a great change in the ecological state, from a situation with the soil surface protected by vegetation to a sitation with bare soil exposed to climatic forces during part of the year. Annual crops require annual soil cultivation, and the increased mineralization of organic matter and the loss of soil productivity by erosion, leaching and other degradation processes remain a problem for sustainable food production. The challenge for the future is to manage the agricultural landscape in units which are catchments. These units would contain intensively drained and cultivated areas, permanent vegetation zones, as well as natural and constructed wetlands working as condensors and self-purifying units. The management would be differentiated according to a land suitability approach with intensity of use based on productivity and requirements for maintenance of environmental quality.

AB The resource-based view (RBV) of the firm holds that certain assets with certain characteristics will lead to sustainable competitive advantage.  All the traits are required to be present to result in sustainable competitive advantage.  Such a trait approach overlooks the dynamics of the creation of firm resources especially the strategically important factors as identified by the resource based view theory.  We propose that the resources are made up of factor networks which have specific interfactor and inter-resource relationships that result in the characteristic traits being evidenced.  These strategic resource factor relationships include network type, available substitutes and cogency relationships (compensatory, enhancing and suppressing.)  Specific configurations that lead to high or very high support of sustainable competitive advantage are proposed.  Twenty-two specific paths to sustainable competitive advantage for a factor, contingent on resource factor traits and relationship configurations, are proposed.  The implications, upon confirmation of these configurations, are discussed.

ID EMPLOYMENT
AB Urban development within the developing world was, until just over a decade ago, seen primarily as the responsibility of government. A shift has taken place from the traditional approach of centralised, top-down decision-making to one in which government's role involves the creation of an environment which enables urban residents to solve many of their own problems. This shift not only involves new responsibilities for urban residents, but for government, particularly local authorities, as well. Four problems are singled out for detailed consideration. The first of these is shelter. Although it is increasingly recognised that governments should not be in the business of providing houses for people, misdirected policies of imposing unaffordable standards and inappropriate approaches have the effect of preventing the urban poor in developing nations from solving their own problem. A consideration of urban service provision in such cities underlines the need to involve the community itself in the planning and supply of such services. A crucial constraint on meeting the financial demands for the provision of shelter and services is found in the official discouragement that is frequently directed toward informal-sector employment which comprises a significant proportion of all employment opportunity. Tolerance of this sector is a prerequisite for sustainability. Finally, the case is made for deriving local solutions to local urban problems within both the areas of urban physical planning and urban development projects. The paper concludes that appropriate policies must be adopted by governments which involve local communities in the planning process. As each sector interacts with others, comprehensiveness is required for any feasible and sustainable solution.

AB The conventional literature in the environment and development field often presents a rather deterministic view of the relationship between poverty and the environment, revolving around the negative impact of the poor on the environment. Based on extensive fieldwork in rural communities across the Philippines, this article is a case study of that relationship between the poor and the environment in a country with severe poverty rates, significant environmental degradation, and a highly organized civil society. As a country where large numbers of poorer people have been transformed into environmental activists, the Philippines offers both a refutation of the traditional paradigm of poor people as environmental destroyers and enormous insights into the conditions under which poor people become environmental protectors. This case study leads the author to posit a set of conditions under which poor people become environmental activists rather than environmental degraders. Suggestions are made as to the relevance of the Philippine case study for understanding the relationship between the poor and the environment in other parts of the Third World.

AB For the development of management strategies in sustainable agriculture it is necessary to describe and predict the role of soil microbes in different management systems. The classical approach uses the microbial biomass as the key parameter for the entire system, but for ecological purposes the variability of biotic parameters in time and space has to be better described. Moreover, the biomass active in the total soil profile or its most active zones should be used as a basis for the assessment of soil activity. The sum of adenylates was found to be more closely related to the microbial biomass than was ATP, which however appeared to be a better indicator for the microbial activity, Fatty acids from phospholipids were highly correlated with the soil microbial biomass. The pattern of fatty acids from soils under different long-term management indicated a high potential to typify the microbial community in soils and special organism populations. To overcome the problem, that only a small portion of the soil inhabiting microbes can be cultivated, first steps to use serological and genetical methods to directly identify or localize specific populations in the rhizosphere are shown.

TI A NUMERICAL ASSESSMENT OF SLAB STRENGTH DURING HIGH-ANGLE AND LOW-ANGLE
   SUBDUCTION AND IMPLICATIONS FOR LARAMIDE OROGENESIS

AB A finite element computer program for one-dimensional heat flow was modified to apply to two-dimensional subduction where conductive heat transport parallel to the upper and lower plates was neglected. One-dimensional finite element columns were cut, displaced, and reassembled to model heat advection. Calculated temperature, depth-dependent pressure, stress levels associated with dislocation creep in olivine at constant strain rate, and a 1-GPa deviatoric stress maximum were used to calculate the form of the brittle-plastic failure envelope for profiles across subducted slabs. The failure envelopes were then used to calculate maximum sustainable compression parallel to the slab. Model results suggest the following: (1) In high-angle subduction without frictional heating and horizontal heat flow, temperatures along the interplate contact zone remain below about 120-degrees-C, which is far below temperatures necessary for olivine plasticity. Without substantial frictional heating or lateral heat flow from the adjacent magmatic arc, the subducted slab will gain rather than lose strength before its upper surface contacts asthenosphere. In addition, viscous coupling due to olivine plasticity and associated ablation of the upper plate will be unimportant. Slab strength reduction due to heating occurs rapidly after the top of the slab comes into contact with asthenosphere. (2) In low-angle subduction the top of the slab remains in contact with overlying lithosphere and does not contact asthenosphere. Slab strength reduction due to conductive heating from above occurs slowly because the upper plate is cooled by the lower plate and is the source of progressively less heat. Temperatures along the interplate contact zone may be sufficient for olivine plasticity at large distances from the trench, and viscous coupling between plates and associated ablation of the upper plate may be important in this tectonic setting. (3) Low-angle subduction for distances of over 1500 km during the Laramide orogeny in southwestern North America appears viable. At 50 Ma, slab strength beneath the Black Hills of South Dakota is predicted to have been comparable to, or greater than, strength at the trench.

LA English
DT Article
AB Results of research carried out on soil characteristics of the coastal areas cultivated with agricultural techniques which are alternatives to conventional methods show that there are only slight variations as regards total heavy metals and available concentrations between the different types of agriculture practices investigated. Nevertheless data indicate some tendencies for an increase of the concentrations of certain heavy metals (notably Cu) in the case of fertilizer application along the plant row. A notable influence, however, derives from effects having nothing to do with agriculture itself: this is road traffic which results in extremely high values of Lead in soils near roadways. The particularly high values of this concentration found in soils along the roadways (100 mg/kg), show how the efforts of sustainable agriculture can be thwarted by phenomena which are in no way connected to the method of agriculture used.

AB The Projet Recherche Appliquee en Milieu Reel is situated on the Adja Plateau, Southwest Benin. The project is responsible for a FSR&D programme that aims at sustainable use of the so-called Terres de barre. Technologies tested in this context include seasonal fallowing, using Mucuna pruriens cv. group Utilis (weed control, green manure), planted fallows using fast-growing species such as Acacia auriculiformis and hedgerow intercropping systems (various woody auxiliary species). In this paper the local farming system is analyzed to identify key parameters that determine the possibilities for technology adoption. Parameters include: function and history of fields; tenureship; the field's position with regard to fertility flows in the farming system.
   The paper also aims at understanding the reasons behind low crop yields, in this case maize. An analysis of the soil's chemical fertility, using a computer-based fertility assessment model and data from literature, shows some anomalies with respect to the availability of nutrients from organic matter. Data presented on the use of green manures and oil palm fallow compared to cultivated fields make it likely that organic matter management is a crucial factor. in sustainable use of these soils (maintenance of soil structure and soil life). Given key parameters, a matrix is used to determine potential niches in the farming system for the various biomass production technologies mentioned previously, including the locally developed planted fallow based on oil palm.

   PRODUCTIVITY; WINTER; GROWTH; CROPS
AB Data on plant water use and soil water depletion by green manure legumes are needed to develop sustainable cropping systems in a semi-arid environment. The objectives of this study were to determine: (i) seasonal water use by legumes, (ii) their water use efficiency (WUE), and (iii) residual soil water contents after legume growth compared with summerfallow and continuous spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Black lentil (Lens culinaris Medikus), Tangier flatpea (Lathyrus tingitanus L.), chickling vetch (Lathyrus sativus L.), and feed pea (Pisum sativum L.), were seeded into wheat stubble with snow trap strips on an Orthic Brown Chernozem soil (Aridic Haploborolls) at Swift Current, SK, from 1984 to 1990. Legume water use exceeded that of fallow at 4 to 6 wk after seeding. When legumes were tilled into the soil at full bloom, differences in water content between cropped treatments and fallow were largest and most consistent in the top 0.6 m, suggesting that the legumes extracted water primarily from this depth. In an extreme drought year, substantial water depletion occurred below 0.6 m. Water use efficiency of legumes was 11 to 29 kg ha(-1) mm(-1), similar to that of spring wheat. Feed pea and chickling vetch used water more efficiently than the other legumes or N-fertilized wheat. Significant differences in WUE across years were related to differences in DM production. Soil water contents above the 0.6-m depth in late fall following green manuring were 62 to 82% that of fallow and increased over winter to 79 to 103% of fallow. Subsoil water was, on average, recharged after wheat to only 68% but following green manure to 81% of fallow. Partial fallow replacement with legumes would reduce the risk of erosion and nutrient leaching and minimize the hazard of salinization and eutrophication of downstream ecosystems.

TI THE SPRATLY ISLANDS - A MARINE PARK
SO AMBIO
LA English
DT Article
AB The Spratly Islands encompass a dense system of several hundred coral reefs in the most biodiverse of the world's seas. They serve as breeding grounds for a wide variety of organisms including sea turtles, birds, marine mammals, and tuna. A study of pelagic larval survival times and current patterns indicates that they may supply recruiting organisms for marine ecosystems throughout the South China Sea. They may be of growing importance in replenishing over-harvested stocks which provide food and livelihood to coastal villagers in the Philippines, Taiwan, mainland China, Vietnam, and Malaysia. Strategic concerns and vague possibilities of hydrocarbon deposits have led each of these countries to station troops in the area, resulting in violent confrontations and environmental stress. Future oil drilling could have widespread impacts. A more sustainable-use strategy would be to freeze current claims on the islands and establish an international marine park. Such a park would rival the Great Barrier Marine Park in size, number of reefs and biodiversity, and could generate on the order of USD 1 billion annually from tourism. Carefully managed, the park would safeguard substantially-sized populations of tens of thousands of species, and help to ensure a steady supply of recruits to regional fisheries.

DE VEGETARIANISM; LIVESTOCK; ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT; FACTORY FARMS
AB Although the recommendation to avoid animal flesh for environmental reasons has been increasingly advanced, especially in the highly industrialized countries, the ecological implications of such avoidance are seldom carefully examined. If sustainable food systems are to be modeled after natural systems that maintain fertility, both plants and animals would be involved. This paper examines the history of the idea that environmental responsibility is linked to vegetarianism and the destructive effects of present methods of animal raising on farmers, animal welfare, and the environment. Finally, it explores the question of whether vegetarianism is the appropriate response to these problems.

TI MONITORING AND REDUCING GREENHOUSE-GAS EMISSIONS FROM AGRICULTURAL,

ID MODEL; COMMUNITIES
AB Agriculture and forestry are significant sources and sinks of greenhouse gases. A holistic systems approach to estimating and reducing greenhouse gas emissions from agricultural, forestry and other systems requires that the major inputs, components and outputs of the production system are defined. Fluxes of greenhouse gases in natural systems may be estimated by mathematical modelling of the major biological processes and activities. Field and laboratory experiments and information from satellites provide the raw data on which such models are based. Such an approach can have a significant role in guiding key decision makers and policy analysts. We conclude that management strategies that reduce greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture and forestry are likely to be strategies that will also contribute to ecologically sustainable development.

AB Increasing atmospheric concentrations of 'greenhouse gases' are expected to result in global climatic changes over the next decades. Means of evaluating and reducing greenhouse gas emissions are being sought. In this study an existing simulation model of a tropical savanna woodland grazing system was adapted to account for greenhouse gas emissions. This approach may be able to be used in identifying ways to assess and limit emissions from other rangeland, agricultural and natural ecosystems.
   GRASSMAN, an agricultural decision-support model, was modified to include sources, sinks and storages of greenhouse gases in the tropical and sub-tropical savanna woodlands of northern Australia. The modified model was then used to predict the changes in emissions and productivity resulting from changes in stock and burning management in a hypothetical grazing system in tropical northeastern Queensland. The sensitivity of these results to different Global Warming Potentials (GWPs) and emission definitions was then tested.
   Management options to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the tropical grazing system investigated were highly sensitive to the GWPs used, and to the emission definition adopted. A recommendation to reduce emissions by changing burning management would be to reduce fire frequency if both direct and indirect GWPS of CO2, CH4, N2O, CO and NO are used in evaluating emissions, but to increase fire frequency if only direct GWPS of CO2, CH4 and N2O are used. The ability to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from these systems by reducing stocking rates was also sensitive to the GWPs used. In heavily grazed systems, the relatively small reductions in stocking rate needed to reduce emissions significantly should also reduce the degradation of soils and vegetation, thereby improving the sustainability of these enterprises.
   The simulation studies indicate that it is possible to alter management to maximise beef cattle production per unit greenhouse gases of per unit methane emitted, but that this is also dependent upon the emission definition used. High ratios of liveweight gain per unit net greenhouse gas emission were found in a broadly defined band covering the entire range of stocking rates likely to be used. In contrast, high values of liveweight gain per unit 'anthropogenic' greenhouse gas emission were found only at very low stocking rates that are unlikely to be economically viable.
   These results suggest that policy initiatives to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tropical grazing systems should be evaluated cautiously until the GWPs have been further developed and the implications of emission definitions more rigorously determined.

AB Degraded or sub-standard soils and marginal lands occupy a significant proportion of boreal, temperate and tropical biomes. Management of these lands with a wide range of existing, site-specific, integrated, agroforest systems represents a significant global opportunity to reduce the accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Establishment of extensive agricultural, agroforest, and alternative land-use systems on marginal or degraded lands could sequester 0.82-2.2 Pg carbon (C) per year, globally, over a 50-year time-frame. Moreover, slowing soil degradation by alternative grassland management and by impeding desertification could conserve up to 0.5-1.5 Pg C annually, A global analysis of biologic and economic data from 94 nations representing diverse climatic and edaphic conditions reveals a range of integrated land-use systems which could be used to establish and manage vegetation on marginal or degraded lands. Promising land-use systems and practices identified to conserve and temporarily store C include agroforestry systems, fuelwood and fiber plantations, bioreserves, intercropping systems, and shelterbelts/windbreaks. For example, successful establishment of low-intensity agroforestry systems can store up to 70 Mg C/ha in boreal, temperate and tropical ecoregions. The mean initial cost of soil rehabilitation and revegetation ranges from $500-3,000/ha for the 94 nations surveyed.  Natural regeneration of woody vegetation or agro-afforestation establishment costs were less than $1000/ha in temperate and tropical regions.  The costs of C sequestration in soil and vegetation systems range from $1-69/Mg C, which compares favorably with other options to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to the atmosphere.  Although agroforestry system projects were recently established to conserve and sequester C in Guatemala and Malaysia, constraints to wide-spread implementation include social conditions (demographic factors, land tenure issues, market conditions, lack of infrastructure), economic obstacles (difficulty of demonstrating benefits of alternative systems, capital requirements, lack of financial incentives) and, ecologic considerations (limited knowledge of impacts and sustainability of some systems).

AB Research on the effects of climate change on U.S. agriculture and world grain markets suggests that adaptation will occur with relatively small effects on total production. Additional research shows that reducing emission of greenhouse gases from U.S. agricultural production is relatively expensive compared to encouraging reforestation as an offset to emissions of carbon dioxide. Nevertheless, continued population growth and the increasing inequality of income across countries are likely to exacerbate the adverse effects of climate change. Concepts of sustainability should be expanded to cover industrial as well as agricultural production, and promote the efficient use of fossil fuels in general. Dealing with climate change effectively will require international cooperation and a willingness to address population growth and the divergence of incomes between rich and poor countries.

AB The majority of drug discovery units in pharmaceutical companies are currently organized by therapeutic area. In this Commentary, a proposal is offered which focuses discovery organization by molecular target, rather than therapeutic area. Examples of such molecular targets include ion channels, proteases, and tyrosine kinases, to name but a few. In the face of continued rationalization in the pharmaceutical industry, major cutbacks in the world-wide pharmaceutical R&D workforce, and the changing landscape of health care reform, the drug companies that survive the 90s will be those that gain sustainable competitive advantages in R&D. For this interim, and beyond, classes of numerous, highly validated molecular targets have already been identified in the past few years which have strong links to major disease processes with unmet therapeutic needs. Moreover, it is evident that these disease processes, and molecular targets, play key roles in therapeutically unrelated diseases. For example, tyrosine kinases have roles in endocrine, oncological, and certain cardiovascular disorders. There is little need for therapeutically aligned researchers in industry trying to find new targets. The key factors in gaining a sustainable competitive advantage in research will be to rapidly obtain these human targets, identify, design, and synthesize proprietary modifiers of these targets, and efficiently determine efficacy, biodistribution, and safety so that these modifiers can be rapidly advanced to clinical trials. A focus and organization of molecular target-oriented drug discovery is proposed to attain this advantage. (C) 1994 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

TI THE NATURAL INTEREST-RATE OF THE FOREST - MACROECONOMIC REQUIREMENTS FOR
   SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
SO ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
LA English
DT Article
DE FOREST PRESERVATION; SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
AB The goal of sustainable development implies a society that is both economically and environmentally reproducible in the long run. The assumption of reproducibility of forests, a renewable resource, has important implications for a market economy.
   A profit-maximizing owner will let a forest continue to grow, or regenerate after harvesting, if that choice yields a greater net present value than immediate harvesting without regeneration. The choice depends in part on the relationship between the forest's growth rate and the owner's discount rate. For each forest, there is a threshold interest rate above which the owner will prefer harvesting without regeneration.
   The interest rate thus is not only the market price of capital; it must also stay below a critical level if the market is to allow forest conservation. This reflects the dual nature of forests, as both marketable assets and as parts of natural ecosystems. Such cases of dualism are important in the development of ecological economics, and can be seen as parallel to the dual nature of labor and wages in Marxian theory.
   For long-run sustainability, interest rates must be low enough to allow forest conservation. This might threaten disequilibrium in capital markets, and cause inflationary pressure. The solution is to lower the marginal rate of profit on new investments, bringing markets back to equilibrium at a lower interest rate - with the likely long-term consequence of slower economic growth due to slower capital formation.

DE ENERGY POLICY; BRAZILIAN AMAZON; SUSTAINABILITY
AB The development of the Amazon has attracted attention for a variety of reasons, but especially because of its contribution to global carbon emissions and the importance of the forest as a pool of biodiversity. Less attention has been paid to the role the Brazilian Amazon might play in supplying energy for Brazil's growing population, and the energy needs of the Amazon population itself. Opposition to large hydro-power installations has attracted international concern, but alternative sources of energy, including biomass, also deserve consideration. In seeking a better balance between economic and demographic growth, and the sustainable use of valuable natural resources, the Amazon is likely to provide lessons of global, as well as regional, significance.

AB Social discourse regarding design issues evolves in the contexts of the scholarly arena, the city hall, the courts, the public media, and the use/action realm or everyday life. Design review, narrowly conceived, is one of the formal mechanisms within the broader context of this social discourse. In this conception, the impact of design review on the physical environment is direct and immediate but specific and limited in scope. Alternatively, it can also be considered as a generic process encompassing any or all instances of collective and critical reflection on design issues. These diverse processes may appear to lack coherence, but they have a much more fundamental and lasting effect because they shape the tacit assumptions and beliefs underlying our more direct actions. Here the broader context of design review will be considered. Following a discussion of the spatial scene, the evolution of three constructs during the past three decades-place, sustainability, and participation-into full-blown paradigms is summarized. It is shown that the three together are converging into a worldview that is taking hold globally. This emerging worldview, then, provides the grounds and the backing for substantive and procedural discussion of planning and design review.

ID CAPITALIST DEMOCRACIES; POLITICS; EXPANSION; ECONOMY
AB Recent review articles in environmental policy have called for more rigorous cross-national tests and for better integration with the standard literature on comparative politics and political economy. In this paper we take a first step in that direction, examining the relationship between air pollution and left party strength in seventeen OECD countries. Despite theoretical salience and political relevance, we know of no previous attempt of this sort. Three competing hypotheses exist. First, because of an historic agenda which emphasizes maximum employment and material welfare for the working class, left party strength might be associated with lower than normal environmental quality. Second, given the belief in government intervention to socialize the negative externalities of market capitalism, left party strength might motivate higher than normal environmental quality. Third, despite observed variations in agenda setting, policy formulation, and implementation, skeptics have often replied, ''different styles, similar content'', suggesting no party relevance at all. Our analysis, controlling for quantitative energy consumption and qualitative economic structure, reveals a moderate but sustainable inverse relationship between left party strength and per capita levels of air pollution. In the conclusion we speculate how and why this result might occur.

AB Management of natural resources is becoming a complex problem. To ensure sustainability of the resources, the manager must have better tools with which to make decisions. The development of simulation models that make use of GIS data bases is an emerging area of resource management. This paper examines several grid-based models and addresses the use of GIS programs to construct spatial dynamic models. Some considerations for the implementation of modeling using GIS data bases are provided. The capability to simulate ecosystem processes such as fire, erosion, and other factors will allow the resource manager to make more informed decisions by evaluating potential consequences on the computer.

ID LOCAL KNOWLEDGE; SCIENCE; AGRICULTURE
AB The notion of sustainable development, which is currently being proposed as the panacea to many of the most pressing environmental problems. reflects the environmental movement's ambivalent relationship to scientific knowledge: on the one hand, science is used to legitimize the 'green case'; on the other, it is seen as responsible for many of the current environmental problems. Local, or traditional, knowledge is often proposed as a superior form of knowledge as it lies outside science and is seen as representing a closer affinity with 'nature'. However, local knowledge, like scientific knowledge, can be reified, given virtues it simply does not possess. In this paper we examine the two categories of scientific and local knowledge. Using the work of sociologists of science such as Bruno Latour, we show that science is not different to local knowledge because it has a superior access to 'reality' but because it is more powerful, i.e. it is able to act over greater distances. We then draw upon anthropological work on the use of local knowledge in traditional agriculture to show that this system of knowledge is often 'scientific' but is more intimately related to local environments. However, local knowledge is not always in 'harmony' with such environments and can result in serious degradation. It should not, therefore, be counterposed as a 'greener' alternative to scientific knowledge. Rather, as with science itself, local knowledge should be investigated in 'action'. We conclude with a call for a new social science approach to the relationship between nature and culture and the local and universal which stresses 'hybridity', i.e. the extent to which these categories are inextricably mixed.

TI LAND DEGRADATION ASSESSMENT BY SMALL-SCALE TRADITIONAL AFRICAN FARMERS
   AND IMPLICATIONS FOR SUSTAINABLE CONSERVATION MANAGEMENT
SO GEOFORUM
LA English
DT Article
AB The attainment of sustainable agricultural production in most African countries is seriously undermined by increasing land degradation problems. It is argued in this paper that successful adoption of sustainable agriculture in tropical Africa will depend on the concurrent implementation of well articulated sustainable conservation policies to deal with land degradation. Such policies need to recognise and utilize traditional systems of land evaluation and management in the development of appropriate coping mechanisms or adaptive strategies. The study is illustrated with a case study from the community of Nsit in south-eastern Nigeria. One hundred and eight farmers were interviewed and a group discussion with community leaders and a few selected farmers was held. This approach facilitated the exploration of the stock of indigenous knowledge and information about land degradation assessment and management held by small-scale traditional farming communities. The result shows that small-scale farmers in Nsit have an adequate grasp of the physical conditions of their surrounding world and are able to ascertain the major stages of land degradation in their community. The implications for the evolution of sustainable conservation management in Africa are articulated.

AB The paper explores issues relating to pluriactivity in the New Zealand's agro-commodity systems in the 'farm crisis' conditions of the late 1980s and early 1990s. It draws on survey evidence from specialised farm businesses and their related farm households in those production systems: dairy, sheep/beef and apples. The survey findings suggest that the high incidence and patterns of pluriactivity are best understood in terms of forces beyond agriculture and that the New Zealand's 'farm crisis' per se has not induced major changes in the social relations of farm production or farm households. The paper concludes that patterns of on- and off-farm links may potentially constrain the development of sustainable agriCulture in New Zealand.

TI SEDIMENT BUDGET TO ASSESS THE GEOMORPHIC EFFECT OF A CYCLONIC STORM,
   NEW-ZEALAND
SO GEOMORPHOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB A short-term sediment budget was constructed to assess the erosion response of a soft-rock hill country watershed to an intense rainstorm event. The watershed is located in a landslide-prone area on the east coast of the North Island, New Zealand. During March 1988, 753 mm of rain was recorded over a four-day period with 320 mm and 329 mm on successive days. Known as Cyclone Bola, this was the largest rainstorm event in the Tutira watershed in the 93-year rainfall record.
   The budget quantifies the total sediment generated during the storm, the relative contribution of erosion processes involved, the amount of sediment held in storage and the amount discharged into two lakes within the watershed. A landform map of the watershed was constructed and the contribution of each landform type to the total budget was calculated.
   A total of 1.35 (+/- 0.13) million m3 of sediment was generated during the storm at an average of 420 m3/ha. This is equivalent to a denudation value of 42 mm for the total watershed (3208 ha) and 83 mm for the landforms severely affected by landsliding (1427 ha). Of the sediment generated, 21% remained on hillslopes, 22% was deposited on valley floors, 51% was deposited on the lakebeds and the remaining 6% was discharged from the watershed via the lake outlet.
   Most of the sediment generated during the storm was from primary source areas on hill slopes, with sediment in secondary storage providing only a small contribution. Landslide erosion was the main process, accounting for 89% of the sediment generated. Channel, tunnel gully and sheet erosion were only minor contributors to the budget. Six hillslope landforms, which occupy only 44% of the watershed generated 90% of the sediment.
   The results of this sediment budget, when put in context with the storm magnitude-frequency history being analysed from lake cores, contribute to the identification of sustainable land use and management of soft-rock hill country.

TI PRODUCTION TECHNOLOGY OF NON-TILLED WHEAT (TRITICUM-AESTIVUM) AFTER
   PUDDLED TRANSPLANTED RICE (ORYZA-SATIVA)
SO INDIAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES
LA English
DT Article
AB The production technology of non-tilled wheat (Triticum aestivum L. emend. Fiori & Paol.) after puddled transplanted rice (Oryza sativa L.) improved the wheat yield and the resultant sustainability of this cropping system. Satisfactory plant population and high yield of non-tilled wheat can be achieved with the use of 120 kg/ha seed rate under timely-sown conditions and 150 kg/ha under late-sown dates. This technique of wheat establishment advances the seeding operation and reduces the cost of production by saving energy (13%). The restricted supply of nutrient and irrigation adversely affects the yield of non-tilled wheat crop following rice.
   Future thrust is needed to study the utility of non-tilled soil after puddled transplanted rice, bio-physical aspects of root proliferation and tillering pattern of non-tilled wheat for moisture and nutrient utilization with the development of seed-cum-fertilizer drill, suitable for different sites and situations. Further research work is needed to develop agro-techniques of relay cropping wheat with rice.

TI WATER-RESOURCES MANAGEMENT FOR THE NEXT CENTURY
SO INTERCIENCIA
LA English
DT Article
DE WATER RESOURCES; WATER MANAGEMENT
AB The past twenty years have witnessed considerable advancement in the area of water resources management. There is now broad consensus on the key principles for managing water resources and for meeting society's needs for water supply and sanitation. Translating these principles into practice, however, will require an operational framework for sustainable development and the integration of a comprehensive approach to managing water resources within that framework.
   In many parts of the world, water resources are being stretched to their limits. Over 1 billion people do not have access to safe water supplies and more than 1.7 billion lack access to adequate sanitation facilities. Agricultural productivity is threatened by the depletion of groundwater and by waterlogging and salinization of soils from poorly managed or antiquated irrigation systems. Conflicts have arisen in many countries over demands for water for agriculture and urban supplies as well as demands for restoration and preservation of aquatic ecosystems. Industrial pollution of surface waters continues unabated in many countries.
   The scope of these challenges is daunting. Water resources management is no longer the prerogative of one discipline or sector. It is cross-sectoral and multidisciplinary in nature and must be part of a broader, regional economic development strategy that takes into account other sectoral dimensions - agriculture, manufacturing, energy, demography and health issues -so that management of scarce water resources can be sustained. Increasingly, emphasis should be placed on comprehensive river basin solutions with actions on the political, economic, environmental and social fronts.
   The guiding principles for sound water resources management contained in the Dublin Statement, coupled with the Earth Summit's call for full integration of environmental concerns into economic development, point to the international consensus behind this need for sustainable management of water resources. Adopting a new, more comprehensive approach will require assessment of the status of river basins' water environments, identification of priority issues related to multiple uses or demands, identification of practical solutions and their incorporation into sectoral institutions and strategic planning processes. Recognition of the interconnectedness of land, water and ecosystem management is central to this process as is stakeholder participation and the forging of partnerships for better cooperation and collaboration. Emphasis is also placed on increased investments for safe drinking water and sanitation facilities, especially for the poor. All levels of government, the private sector and the public have a role to play in identifying needs, potential solutions and implementing the needed interventions.

AB The motivation of this paper rests on the attempts by some groups of countries to coordinate their macroeconomic policies. Implicit in these attempts is the notion that coordination by at least some countries is better than zero coordination. We use a dynamic general equilibrium model of international coordination to study the properties of a partial coordination scheme. We find that, indeed, some coordination is Pareto superior to zero coordination. Although a free-riding incentive problem arises in partial coordination schemes, such schemes are sustainable provided the relative size of the coalition is chosen ''appropriately.''

DT Article
ID TQM
AB The majority of hazardous waste is generated industrially, and the importance of industrial pollution prevention to economic and environmental sustainability is now recognized. Sustainability can be evaluated using benefit-risk analysis, globally and locally by public agencies and firms. To evaluate pollution prevention seriously, using benefit-risk analysis or other methods, the benefits of hazardous materials use in industry must be recognized. Pollution-prevention technologies in a broad range of industries were reviewed as a part of research to develop benefit-risk methods. Ten basic functions served by hazardous materials in industry were identified as binding, pigmentation, reactants, reaction inhibition, catalysis, bleaching, mass deposition, mass removal, by-products, and end products. Pollution-prevention technologies were associated with each function. The classification of technologies offers a basis for development of general pollution-prevention approaches, and promotes transfer of technologies among industries in which hazardous materials perform similar functions. Hazardous materials used for mass transfer, and those generated as by-products, appear to represent areas of opportunity for pollution-prevention research and development.

AB Axillary shoot cultures of both Acer saccharinum L. 'Pyramidale' and A. platanoides L. 'Crimson King' displayed strong apical dominance and prolific basal callus in vitro, which was not conducive to rapid multiplication and rooting. Basal callus was reduced in 'Pyramidale' by replacing 6-benzylaminopurine (BAP-5muM) with zeatin (5muM), but this also reduced axillary shoot growth. The addition of 2,3,5-triiodobenzoic acid (1-20 muM) altered callus development and promoted a concentration-dependent increase in axillary shoot growth. Supplementing medium with thidiazuron (0.005 and 0.05 muM) in addition to BAP (1 muM) enhanced shoot growth, especially with nodal shoot sections, and increased subsequent rooting. Although thidiazuron also increased basal callus, this correlated with better shoot growth in 'Crimson King'. Selection of apical buds from 'Crimsom King' stockplants was essential for the establishment of sustainable cultures; axillary bud-derived explants quickly died. Once shoots of 'Pyramidale' and 'Crimson King' had elongated, they could be readily rooted in vitro, and plantlets were successfully weaned under high humidity 'dry fog'.

TI TILLAGE EFFECTS ON GROWTH AND YIELDS OF CORN ON GRANTSBURG SOIL
SO JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION
LA English
DT Article
ID ILLINOIS SOILS; ROTATION; WHEAT
AB A project to determine village effects on soil properties and the growth and yield of corn was initiated in the spring, 1989 in southern Illinois on a sloping Grantsburg (fine-silty, mixed, mesic Typic Fragiudalf) soil previously in tall fescue [Festuca arundinacea (L.) Schreb] sod. Each tillage treatment [no-tillage (NT); chisel plowing (CP); and moldboard plowing (MP)] was replicated 8 times on 9 x 12 m plots. Corn (Zea mays L.) (in the first and 3rd years) and soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] (in the second year) were grown in a rotation system on the plot area. This paper discusses the data collected during the two years of corn. Corn plant population was less for NT than MP in 1989, while in 1991 the plant population for NT was greater than that of CP. Corn grain yield in 1989 was least for NT and greatest for MP (8400, 9300 and 10, 500 kg/ha, respectively, for NT, CP, and MP). In 1991, tillage did not significantly affect grain yield. The grain yields for 1991 were 2,300 to 4,400 kg/ha lower than for 1989 due primarily to limited and poorly distributed rainfall and insufficient plant-available soil water in the 1991 growing season. Differences in grain yield in 1989 were attributed to effects of reduced plant population for AT into sod resulting possibly from effects of insufficient soil-seed contact which might have led to dehydration of seeds and subsequent failure to germinate. Another factor that might have affected germination was lower soil surface temperature for NT at planting as a result of residue on surface. Early in the growing season, NT system bad greater bulk density and greater resistance to penetration (soil strength) than the CP and MP systems. Greater regrowth of weeds at midseason in NT system appears to have had limited effect on plant available soil water since NT still bad greater values at tasselling and grain-fill. Most corn tissue nutrient content (by treatment) were in the normal range and appeared to have little association with 1989 yields. The significant first year plant population and corn yield advantages that the MP system bad over the NT system were masked in 1991 by the effects of rainfall. No-tillage planting into soybean residue in 1991 was much more successful than planting into a sod in 1989. Any conversion of conservation reserve land from sod into NT corn and soybean production could experience similar management problems and corn yield reductions the first year. The NT planting in soybean residue the third year made it easier to obtain sufficient soil-seed contact, provided a better rooting zone, bad better weed control and resulted in greater plant populations, Results suggest that the MP system productivity may be less sustainable over time than the NT system.

TI SOUTHERN BLUEFIN TUNA FISHERY - RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN INTERNATIONAL
   MANAGEMENT
SO MARINE POLICY
LA English
DT Article
AB The signing of the Convention for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna by Australia, New Zealand and Japan in May 1993 represents an important milestone in the development of management arrangements in the southern bluefin tuna (SBT) fishery. This convention has emerged from a voluntary management arrangement regulating catch of SBT between the three signatories. This paper provides an analysis of the SBT Convention and details elements of the Australia-Japan relationship which have been crucial in the development of this international convention. Although signed by the three countries the SBT convention is open to other parties, with the original signatories keen to encourage all States engaged in the fishery to join and thus help ensure effective and sustainable management of SBT into the future. The SBT Convention reflects increased concern over the management of highly migratory species and indicates increased commitment from Japan to join management arrangements concerned with these species.

AB This project examined the academic audit of postgraduate medical education, and went on to research, design and implement an educational audit system for use in Mersey Region, UK. Issues found to be significant included ownership of both standards and results, norming, and the levels of aggregation of data. The project has demonstrated that designing and implementing a system of feedback which is effective and sustainable is feasible, but requires the agreement and support of tutors as to its objectives and use. The resulting system has now been tested across a range of courses and programmes of meetings in Mersey Region, and has been accepted by the Postgraduate Office as the basis for future development.

AB Energy management practices in the Imlil region of the High Atlas were investigated, and household surveys determined inputs of food, fuel, fodder, fertilizer, and human and animal power. An energy system approach was used to model and analyze the man-environment equilibrium by calculating annual flows of energy, matter, and money for the Ait Mizane tribe. Resource use is characterized by the presence of disproportionate energy hardships due to historical patterns of extraction, the emergence of compensatory intensification strategies on private lands, and a rapidly expanding recourse to market energy alternatives. The results show the potential of an energy system approach to assess the multiple aspects of sustainable resource management and indicate the need for further micro-level research.

ID POLICY
AB Recognizing the steady depletion of natural resources in developing countries, this study analyses its causes by focusing on the ownership of such resources. Resource degradation was found associated with an array of individual, socioeconomic, politicoeconomic and institutional factors. In the pursuit of sustainable regional resources management and conservation, it is necessary to analyse and incorporate these multifarious factors into the design of a comprehensive strategy. While local government should be responsible for devising management strategies, their implementation requires the interfacing of field agencies with local communities that are to be assisted in the short term and instructed in depth; their performance should be closely monitored over the long term.

AB The Mediterranean climate, characterized by heavy rainfall very irregularly distributed over the year, together with soil features, are the main causes of soil erosion problems in NE Spain. The main landuse in this area is vineyard crop for the production of high-quality wines. In order to develop control strategies, the erosive nature of rainfall has been analysed using data gathered at one pluviographic station located in Masquefa (Barcelona) and the technical conditioning factors have been discussed. Studies have been carried out on kinetic-energy distribution over the year and the erosive character of rainfall, represented by the R-factor.

AB Fresh and composted dairy manure were compared along with other amendments in the greenhouse and in field microplots for their effects on induction of suppression to plant diseases caused by Rhizoctonia solani. Damping-off of radish induced by R. solani was least severe for seedlings planted in the greenhouse in soil media amended with urea and straw, more severe with manure or compost, and most severe after urea treatment. Radish damping-off was less severe at all inoculum density levels in the urea with straw treatment than in the other amendment treatments. At very high infestation levels (20 and 30 cfu/g R. solani), disease severity did not differ among the least effective amendments. The population of R. solani did not differ among treatments, despite differences in radish damping-off severity. Manure and compost were more effective than urea alone in inducing suppression of damping-off of radish at low inoculum levels. Neither amendment was effective at high inoculum levels. Bean hypocotyl lesions were least common for seedlings planted in field microplots amended with manure, and more severe in those treated with compost. Composting of animal manure did not significantly enhance the effectiveness of manure for inducing suppression in soil of plant diseases caused by R. solani.

DT Article
DE STRUCTURAL CHANGE; DEVELOPMENT MODELS; SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE
ID BRITISH AGRICULTURE; FARM
AB This paper provides both retrospective and prospective insights into the processes of agricultural change. It begins with an analysis of structural change in Canadian agriculture and goes on to interpret these changes within the context of a number of contemporary theories and models of agricultural development and restructuring. It is dear from this discussion that there is no unified pattern of change or response to uncertainty. Instead there is a multiplicity of strategies which are formulated on the basis of complex farm-based and external factors. Since agricultural policy has played such a significant role in shaping much of the sector today, it is argued that society has the potential to create new opportunities and development paths which fulfill many of the criteria for sustainable food and rural systems.

TI DEVELOPING SUSTAINABLE INSTITUTIONS - LESSONS FROM CROSS-CASE ANALYSIS
   OF 24 AGRICULTURAL EXTENSION PROGRAMS
SO PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION AND DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB The building or reform of agricultural extension institutions has received considerable attention over the past 15 years, promoted principally by the World Bank and its training and visit (T&V) approach. Many of these institutional development projects have now been completed, allowing cross-case analysis of the experiences and outcomes. Given the relatively similar objectives and institutional improvement strategies adopted, and the dissimilarities in the eventual performance and institutional vitality of the target organizations, these experiences provide a useful set of cases in which to examine the dynamics of institutions' performance and sustainability. This article examines 24 completed extension development projects in the light of an institutional sustainability framework that defines sustainability as the ability of an institution to produce outputs that are sufficiently in demand for enough inputs to be supplied to continue production at a steady or growing rate. Findings from the application of the framework highlight the importance of internal and external stakeholder support, the importance of early success in generating support, the need for both organizational action and learning in varying degrees depending on the situation, and the need to have a coherent strategy that matches the institution's internal capabilities and external environment.

TI LESSONS FROM INSTITUTION BUILDING IN KENYA
SO PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION AND DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB Participant observation of institution building in a public sector organization in Kenya provides a basis for a critical discussion of key facets of the institution-building process. Problems identified include: flawed needs assessments; overambitious project designs; poor selection and briefing of consultants; and countervailing vested interests on the parts of external agents. Recommendations include narrowing the gap between development rhetoric and reality; more careful project formulation; greater emphasis on in-house training; more careful selection of project team leaders; and the provision of funding for post-project sustainability evaluations.

TI THE CASCADE CHAIN - A THEORY AND TOOL FOR ACHIEVING RESOURCE
   SUSTAINABILITY WITH APPLICATIONS FOR PRODUCT DESIGN
SO RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING
LA English
DT Article
AB The article is a revised version of the findings from a research investigation carried out at the Interfaculty Department of Environmental Science, University of Amsterdam, for the Dutch Ministry of Environment (Sirkin and Ten Houten, 1993). The general aim of the research was to investigate the implications and applications of the concept and the principles of cascading (Sirkin, 1990) as a tool for the appropriate design of products and production processes; and furthermore, as a possible foundation for a sustainable resource management policy.
   Among the questions set out to be answered were the following: (1) What possibilities lie in the application of the cascade concept for the appropriate exploitation of the intrinsic and extrinsic properties of resources, substances, materials and products? (2) What does the appropriate use of resource potential and resource quality mean for the design of products? (3) What examples can be found in industrial practices, product design or in resource utilization systems where the principles of cascading are already applied? (4) Is it possible to apply the principles of cascading at the industrial or company level; and what kinds of problems arise when attempting to do so? How can they be solved? (5) What are the implications of cascading for the concept of integral chain control, and its applications for environmental policy? (6) What are the implications of cascading in relationship to an eventual sustainable resource management policy? And what strategic policy measures can be derived?
   Answering these questions, and attempting to set cascading into an operational framework within the context of sustainability, required revisions and further development of previously formulated cascade principles. The cascade chain concept, presented in this article, is the result of these revisions. The theoretical foundations of the cascade chain model as a tool for achieving resource sustainability are presented in Part I. Part II presents various examples of cascade systems and discusses the cascade chain implications related to product design, industrial practices and subsequent resource management policies. Part III consists of a summary and conclusions with policy recommendations and recommendations for further areas of investigation. A glossary of terms has been attached at the end of the article.

TI MAINTENANCE OF YIELDS AND SOIL FERTILITY IN NONMECHANIZED CROPPING
   SYSTEMS, BOLIVIA
SO SOIL SCIENCE SOCIETY OF AMERICA JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
ID ACID SOILS; TROPICS
AB Slash and burn farmers in the tropical rain forests of eastern Bolivia are abandoning land after one rice (Oryza sativa L.) crop because of declining yields. A trial was conducted on a Typic Paleudult for 41 mo to investigate whether alternative low-input nonmechanized cropping systems could prolong soil fertility and yield maintenance, and whether soil fertility or weeds were responsible for declining yields. Twelve cropping systems were investigated in a factorial design, with three summer-winter crop sequences: rice-peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.), com (Zea mays L.)-bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) later substituted by cowpea [Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp.], and rice-fallow (control); two weed control treatments: minimal and optimal; and two fertilizer treatments: with and without 60 kg N ha-1 and 17.5 or 35 kg P ha-1. Crop sequences significantly increased exchangeable acidity; the rice sequences significantly reduced exchangeable Ca, and cornbean/cowpea and rice-peanut significantly reduced exchangeable Mg. Fertilization significantly increased soil P but decreased Ca. Foliar analysis revealed N, Mg, and Zn deficiencies in all cropping systems. Rice yields, unlike corn, were significantly increased by optimal weeding. Corn yields were dominated by fertilization, whereas rice yields were mainly influenced by fertilization in the first and fourth years, and by weeds in the intervening years. Without fertilizers, rice-fallow was not sustainable, and only corn-bean/cowpea was sustainable for 3 yr. With fertilization, rice-fallow plus optimal weed control and corn-bean/cowpea with minimal or optimal weeding were sustainable for 3 yr. Additional fertilization and future liming would be necessary for more prolonged sustainability.

TI STRATEGIC DECISIONS FOR SUSTAINABLE URBAN-DEVELOPMENT IN THE THIRD-WORLD
SO THIRD WORLD PLANNING REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
AB The Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro was an important step in the emerging dialogue on the measures necessary to reduce the human impact on the planet's ecosystems-terrestrial, aquatic and atmospheric.  Important issues were aired and some limited agreements were reached, but much was left unsaid because no national governments, at this time, are ready to face the fundamental issues posed by the very high level of resource use associated with the lifestyle of the North.  Nor will they discuss the main reason for the continuing rapid growth of population in the South, namely poverty.  This paper argues that a focus on urban ecosystems may suggest some ways of beginning a constructive approach to these problems.

TI THE WORLD-BANK AND THE BROWN AGENDA - EVOLUTION OF A REVOLUTION
SO THIRD WORLD PLANNING REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
AB Since the beginning of the decade, the World Bank has rapidly expanded its environmental and urban activities to address the 'brown agenda'. This change has been motivated by a paradigm shift manifested in the Bank's projects, programmes, policies and research efforts. Concurrently, new organisational arrangements have arisen to reflect this shift in institutional focus. Will support for sustainable urban development become standard operating procedure at the World Bank? Very possibly-the transition is still occurring and the outlook is hopeful. But even if this revolution becomes institutionalised at a large development bank, the struggle for improved quality of life will continue in the cities of the developing world where environmental degradation from problems of the brown agenda is a day-to-day reality.

TI WHO CAN DELIVER SUSTAINABILITY - MUNICIPAL REFORM AND THE SUSTAINABLE
   DEVELOPMENT MANDATE
SO THIRD WORLD PLANNING REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
AB In spite of the international policy and financial shortcomings of the 1992 Earth Summit, it did establish a cross-sectoral consensus on the concept of sustainable development.  This consensus must now be operationalised, if not through treaties and new international assistance programmes, then though a period of decentralised experimentation.  Such experimentation must be guided by specific operational concepts that are practicable within the distinct operating environments of different sectors and institutions.  This paper forwards one such concept, and presents a hypothesis, based on the research and field experience of staff of the International Council for Local Environmental Initiatives and the conclusions of three discussions about the need for intermediary institutions to facilitate reforms in local governments and local service strategies that will be required to implement the proposed concept.  These discussions, involving representatives of 35 local governments and local development organisations from 26 countries, included strategy sessions to review the general planning framework to be used in the ICLEI Programme, called the Local Agenda 21 Model Communities Programme.  This hypothesis is to be tested in an ICLEI programme to establish a sustainable development planning process that includes involvement of a locally appropriate intermediary institution.

TI URBAN ENVIRONMENTAL-MANAGEMENT IN A CHANGING DEVELOPMENT CONTEXT - THE
   CASE OF THAILAND
SO THIRD WORLD PLANNING REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
AB 'Development' and 'modernisation' are increasingly recognised as little more than the creation of an economic and cultural hierachy to serve the needs of metropolitan interests. This article takes the case of Thailand and examines how its development evolved out of the imposition of European priorities and demands, to form a state and economy which serve the interests of an urban elite at the expense of the rural majority, the urban poor, the environment and, in the long term, ecological sustainability. To redress this imbalance, it is clearly necessary to decentralise power and resources to the provinces. The article describes a German technical assistance programme that mobilises local authorities and communities to undertake action planning which focuses on improving management of local environment and regional resources for the benefit of local people. Finally, an assessment is made of the potential of such 'local empowerment' programmes in shifting political priorities.

TI SUSTAINING CITIES AT THE GRASS-ROOTS - LIVELIHOOD, ENVIRONMENT AND
   SOCIAL NETWORKS IN SUAN-PHLU, BANGKOK
SO THIRD WORLD PLANNING REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
AB To be sustainable, development must address livelihood and environmental questions simultaneously. In the cities of Asia, both questions arise most visibly in slum and squatter settlements where low incomes and a deteriorating environment combine in their most debilitating forms. The experience of Suan Phlu, a low-income community in Bangkok, is drawn upon to show how low-income house-holds devote significant amounts of time and resources to environmental management as part of their livelihood strategies. The capacity for households to engage in improving environmental management is contingent upon particular sets of circumstances, including community stability, land and housing tenure, leadership, and the dedication and commitment of extra-community sources of organisation and power.

TI THE SEARCH FOR SUSTAINABLE URBAN-DEVELOPMENT IN METROPOLITAN LAGOS,
   NIGERIA - PROSPECTS AND PROBLEMS
SO THIRD WORLD PLANNING REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper examines the environmental problems of urban lower-income communities in metropolitan Lagos, and argues that sustainable urban development should be considered more in terms of the need to improve urban services and infrastructure, rather than raising the lifestyles and consumption patterns of the poor to the unsustainable levels of the rich.  Using metropolitan Lagos as an example, the paper examines the environmental problems of African cities, and the political and institutional factors responsible for them.  It sees the pattern of investment in urban infrastructure and services and the nature of urban environmental policies and management as being in urgent need of reform.

LA English
DT Article
AB In the late 1980s the demands for a more ecological life style and sustainability set off intense research for methods to analyse and assess the environmental impact of products and systems. The methodology crystallizing from this research is called life cycle assessment (LCA). This paper presents the concept, methodology, applications and present status of LCA. LCA as applied to food production systems is discussed in terms of needs, special demands on methodology, the studies that have been performed and ongoing activities.

The leishmaniases are examples of hitherto underestimated parasitic zoonoses which place those communities affected at significant risk of morbidity, debility and mortality. This article summarizes the experience of community-based applied research projects on leishmaniasis supported by the Canadian International Development Research Centre, in Lebanon, Jordan, Ethiopia, Kenya, Tunisia, Mexico, Costa Rica, Colombia, Peru, and Brazil. The article examines the role of leishmaniasis-associated morbidity versus mortality, and the impact of these diseases on a community's capacity to develop. It further analyzes the various determinants of leishmaniasis infection, disease and outcomes, and their interactions at the individual as well as the community level. Adverse health implications as a result of external and intervening factors are examined. Such factors include ecological/environmental changes such as those arising from developmental projects, unplanned urbanization, and continuous movements of populations. The paper views strategies for prevention and control of leishmaniases in the context of socio-political and economic constraints of the affected countries. Particularly emphasized is the need to take into account the knowledge base, beliefs, perceptions and practices of the population by incorporating active community participation in preventative and intervention practices. Leishmaniasis poses a particular challenge to classical health systems that tend to resist innovative change needed to address socio-political and economic realities of the present and future decades.

TI EXTENSIFICATION OF AGRICULTURE AND DEFORESTATION - EMPIRICAL-EVIDENCE
   FROM SUDAN
SO AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS
LA English
DT Article
AB Extensification of agriculture is one of the major factors contributing to the destruction of forests in Africa. In Sudan, such horizontal expansion comes at the expense of land devoted to trees and other vegetation, thereby inducing conditions that are inimical to sustainable agricultural production. Different factors have contributed to extensification. Although high economic returns from crop (mainly Sorghum) production was an important factor encouraging extensification of rainfed mechanized farming, other factors outside agriculture have also contributed to that expansion. This paper uses data from eastern Sudan and an acreage response model, to identify the most important factors influencing acreage expansion. Different measures and forms of risk were used in the acreage response model. The paper shows how policies in the energy sector can indirectly influence acreage expansion in the agricultural sector.

TI USEFULNESS OF THE HUMAN CARRYING-CAPACITY CONCEPT IN ASSESSING

LA English
DT Article
ID RANGE CONDITION; AGRICULTURE; POPULATION; THRESHOLDS; MANAGEMENT;
   VIEWPOINT; STABILITY; LEVEL
AB The carrying capacity concept was developed from animal ecology, and applied to rangeland management in order to assess sustainable livestock stocking rates. In it, long-term ecological sustainability was not a well developed criterion. Early applications of carrying capacity concepts to agricultural land-use have been much criticised, but recent developments provide useful insights. The proposed definition of human carrying capacity is 'the maximum level of exploitation of a renewable resource, imposing limits on a specific type of land-use, that can be sustained without causing irreversible land degradation within a given area'. Hence, it is a property of the ecosystem only. The definition is primarily aimed at maintaining ecosystem productivity and resilience, i.e. avoiding irreversible land degradation. The human carrying capacity is based on the sustainable supply of natural resources and on resilience thresholds of the ecosystem. The level of maximum sustained exploitation of natural resources can also be expressed as maximum sustainable agricultural production levels, or sustainable population densities based on such production levels. Such applications require careful definitions of the assumptions and conditions involved. Absolute assessments of human carrying capacity have limited value only, particularly in semi-arid regions. However, comparing human carrying capacity levels with current exploitation rates of natural resources provides a useful framework to consider the ecological aspects of sustainable land-use.

AB This article examines some of the existing analytical tools which quantify both the ecological and economic aspects of intercropping decisions. The characteristics of tree crops are evaluated to determine how a specific tool, the replacement value of intercropping (RVI), could be modified to better interpret agroforestry improvements to bush fallow farming systems. The modified equation captures some of the potential production improvements associated with agroforestry by accounting for the fraction of time that a field is actually in production over the long run. The result is an improved estimate of the average annual difference between a tree/crop polyculture and a monoculture system which employs fallows.

LA German
DT Article
AB The further course of energy policy in Germany is completely uncertain, especially in the light of the elections to be held in Germany in 1994. At the very last minute, the attempt at finding a long-term energy consensus failed although the positions held by the participants from politics, industry, and other groupings had already come much closer. Against the backdrop of a profound recession and a structural crisis of industry, on the one hand, and increasingly tougher international competition, on the other hand, the parameters of energy policy contribute greatly to the success or failure of future economic development. One of the objectives of the consensus talks had been to maintain an energy mix so as to spread more widely the economic, technical, political, and ecological risks that would be encountered. In particular, a permanent perspective was to be developed for the peaceful uses of nuclear power, on the one hand, by ensuring the politically undisturbed operation of the nuclear power plants currently in operation and, on the other hand, by creating a concrete, sustainable option for die development and operation of an advanced generation of nuclear reactors.

DT Article
AB The Upland Agricultural and Conservation Project in Central and East Java is representative of Indonesia's upland conservation efforts. An important component of the project was the use of subsidies to promote activities which increased farmer incomes and soil conservation. Two types of subsidies were used: an operating subsidy for annual inputs such as seed, fertiliser and pesticides; and a capital subsidy for terracing and related construction. This study measures the extent to which the effects of the subsidies were sustained over varying periods following termination of the project. The results show that the effects of the operating subsidies are clearly not sustainable; the effects of the capital subsidies may persist longer, but they too are probably not sustainable.

DT Article
ID MORTALITY-RATES; INFORMATION; MANAGEMENT; STRATEGIES; FISHERIES; RISK
AB Virtual population analysis (VPA) is often used in conjunction with survey data to provide estimates of current stock size and an allowable catch that is sustainable in the sense that it is expected to produce some desired trend (or stability) in stock size. But these estimates are generally very uncertain, and should be accompanied by statements about the odds of sustainability for a range of allowable catch options. The odds can be expressed as an easily understood short-term risk function, but potential cumulative risks associated with the function should be simulated as a long-term guide for management. Bayesian estimates of the odds of sustainability can be calculated using the likelihood function of the survey data for different current stock size and natural mortality rate possibilities, with estimates of expected recruitment and recruitment variability. Prerecruitment year classes in the survey are included in the calculation of expected recruitment and its uncertainty, allowing use of survey data from gears with different (arbitrary) age selectivity from the main fishery gear. Application of the calculations to a yellow perch (Perca flavescens) fishery illustrates how critical it is to have a well-designed survey, even when much age composition data for VPA are also available.

AB Crop manage ment systems utilizing no-till and legumes for soil improvement and double cropping represent promising systems for the preservation of soil, productivity and sustainability in Ontario agriculture. Field experiments were conducted in 1988 and 1989 to investigate the effect of planting date and tillage system on corn silage and grain yield for corn planted into either an established alfalfa sod or bare soil. There were no differences in grain and total biomass yields between corn planted in May under the no-till treatment and corn planted in May under the fall-plowed treatment, in both years. In 1988, delaying corn planting until after first-cut hay harvest on fall-plowed plots did not result in grain yield reduction compared with May-planted corn under the same tillage regime. Grain yield was reduced significantly in 1989 by a delay in planting. Corn silage yield was equivalent among all systems in 1989, indicating that no-till systems can be used effectively for producing alfalfa hay and silage corn. In 1988, rainfall in June was 7% of the average value, and as a result planting difficulties resulted in low silage yields, particularly in the no-till treatment. However, under conditions of adequate soil moisture, no-till corn following alfalfa should produce yields comparable to those with conventional tillage systems, while enhancing soil properties.

TI IS THERE A CONFLICT BETWEEN GROWTH AND WELFARISM - THE SIGNIFICANCE OF
   THE SRI-LANKA DEBATE
SO DEVELOPMENT AND CHANGE
LA English
DT Article
AB This article seeks to derive some general lessons regarding the relationship between growth and welfarism by undertaking a reassessment of Sri Lanka's long experience with interventions in social spheres. While Sri Lanka has been hailed by many for pursuing the welfarist strategy with apparently spectacular results, several critics have recently suggested that she would have been better off by diverting resources away from welfare interventions towards investment for growth. They have argued that the interventions were not terribly effective anyway, and further that welfarism involved a conflict with growth which eventually undermined the very sustainability of welfarist strategy. This article contests these criticisms, and argues in its turn that the Sri Lankan experience offers a lesson not in the conflict but in the complementarity between growth and welfarism.

TI A SUSTAINABILITY INDICATOR FOR THE DUTCH ENVIRONMENTAL-POLICY THEME
   DIFFUSION - CADMIUM ACCUMULATION IN SOIL
SO ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
LA English
DT Article
DE CADMIUM; SUSTAINABILITY INDICATOR
AB Dutch initiatives into the development of indicators for sustainable development received a major impetus with a workshop held in 1989. Subsequent work has focused on the development of such indicators within environmental policy themes. This paper reports on the development of an indicator within the environmental policy theme 'diffusion' - the movement of toxic micropollutants into and throughout the environment. This theme presents a challenge to indicator development because of the myriad substances (including heavy metals, PCBs, pesticides and their residues, radiation) and behaviours on release. Consequently, a case study was undertaken in which consideration was limited to cadmium accumulation in soil.
   Development of a sustainability indicator required specification of the sustainability context and associated criteria. We propose two criteria, both of which must be satisfied for sustainability: (1) additions of cadmium to the soil from all sources (atmospheric deposition, fertilizer use and sewage sludge disposal) should not exceed losses from the soil due to leaching, runoff and uptake by crops; and (2) the total volume or concentration of cadmium in the soil should not exceed soil quality standards.
   A pictorial presentation for the indicator, known as a 'state space', is proposed in which the two criteria define the axes of a graph. The format offers implications for policy, particularly the urgency of implementation and the severity of measures. As with most indicators, more information is conveyed with time series. Output from a dynamic materials balance is used to generate such a time series. Via these development trajectories and alternative scenarios reflected by the dynamic materials balance, policies can be assessed by their capacity to move the system towards more sustainable conditions.

AB This study presents a model of two interactive pollutants in which the natural rate of regeneration of each pollutant is affected by the quantity of the other pollutant present in the atmosphere. The behavior of pollution accumulations in the natural unintervened system is characterized. With human intervention, it is shown that while a sustainable environment can be obtained, a deteriorating environment may also arise. There is a unique continuous boundary beyond which the environment is non-revitalizable.

TI WHOSE COMMON FUTURE - RECLAIMING THE COMMONS
SO ENVIRONMENT AND URBANIZATION
LA English
DT Article
AB Whose common future: reclaiming the commons describes how one of the main forces underlying evictions in both urban and rural areas is the enclosure of land and other resources which had previously been managed by local communities. This enclosure not only destroys homes, settlements and (in many instances) livelihoods but also undermines the institutions and cultural pattern that protected ''common properties''.  The paper argues that people and their community organizations must reclaim the right to use, maintain and control local resources as a precondition for sustainable development.

AB Sustainable urban development strategies for China considers the transition that needs to be made in China to achieve sustainable urban development. After outlining the links between economic growth and energy use, a conceptual framework is developed to contrast the major economic, technological, energy and environmental assumptions between conventional and sustainable development strategies. Using five of China's cities (Beijing, Guangzhou, Shanghai, Shenyang and Xian) as examples, the authors demonstrate that urban environmental degradation in China, as in many Asian countries, is attributable to the pursuit of economic growth under the conventional development model.

AB Institutional responses to uncontrolled urban cultivation in Harare: prohibitive or accommodative ? reviews local government's response to uncontrolled crop cultivation within the urban boundary of Harare.  The author reviews institutional responses to urban agriculture in Harare during the colonial period and since Independence in 1980.  The final section comments on why local authorities find it difficult to manage urban agriculture effectively and sustainably and suggests some new directions both for policy and for research.

TI INTEGRATED PEST-MANAGEMENT IN RICE
SO EXPERIMENTAL AGRICULTURE
LA English
DT Article
ID INDONESIA; DISEASE
AB Integrated pest management (IPM) in rice has been mainly applied to irrigated, lowland paddy rice ecosystems which generally use more inputs and have higher yields ha-1 than rainfed ecosystems. Large scale implementation of IPM was stimulated in the 1970s in several Asian countries by pest resurgences resulting from indiscriminate insecticide use. Legislation has been enacted in at least five countries to support IPM and by 1992, approximately 0.05% of Asian farmers had received training in IPM. In at least two countries, adoption of IPM as national policy has resulted in large savings from reduced importation of pesticides with no reduction in total rice output or productivity. The inter-country programme on rice IPM of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the United Nations, the International Rice Research Institute and national programmes have all contributed to promoting rice IPM. Host plant resistance, deployed with location-specific cultural practices that conserve natural enemies, remains the basis for sustainable, low-cost rice IPM. Thresholds, monitoring and forecasting systems have little or no impact on farmer practice in the tropics; farmer group learning appears to be the most effective way towards IPM adoption.

AB Surplus-production models, because of their simplicity and relatively undemanding data needs, are attractive tools for many stock assessments. This paper reviews the logistic production model, starting with the basic differential equation and continuing with a description of the model development without the equilibrium assumption. It then describes several extensions, including ''tuning'' the model to a biomass index; partitioning fishing mortality by gear, time, or area; and making projections. Computation of confidence intervals on quantities of interest (e.g. maximum sustainable yield (MSY), effort at MSY, level of stock biomass relative to the optimum level) can be done through boot-strapping, and the bootstrap can also be used to construct nonparametric tests of hypotheses about changes in catchability. To fit the model, an algorithm that uses a forward solution of the population equations can be implemented on a small computer. An example of the utility of surplus-production models (illustrating several of these extensions) is given. The example is loosely based on swordfish (Xiphias gladius) in the North Atlantic Ocean, but is not intended to describe the actual status of that stock.

DE GLOBAL AGRICULTURE; DEMAND AND SUPPLY; KNOWLEDGE
AB This paper considers the sustainability of the global agricultural system at acceptable levels of economic and environmental costs. A future scenario of demand for food and fibre is outlined as the challenge confronting the global agricultural system over the next 40 years. The capacity of the system to increase supply in response to this scenario in an economically and environmentally sustainable manner in less developed countries is considered. Five categories of agricultural resources are investigated. Knowledge, which can be more readily developed than other resources, can be substituted for natural resources. Of each resource, it is therefore asked whether knowledge has the capacity to substitute for agricultural resources to increase supply in a sustainable manner. The demand scenario will only be met in a sustainable way with improved knowledge which may compensate for insufficient supplies of natural resources. As knowledge can only grow through investment in its development, a strategy to control and manage the allocation of investments to various sectors is required if a sustainable global agricultural system is to be developed.

DE FOOD SECURITY AND ENVIRONMENT; IMPACT ASSESSMENT; LONG-TERM DYNAMICS OF
   AGRICULTURAL CHANGE
AB It has been suggested that environmental degradation, economic growth, the population explosion and climate change pose present or potential threats to food security and that these threats would be exacerbated through conjunctive interrelationships. While evidence exists to support this view, the complexity of interrelationships and the level of uncertainty associated with each threat calls for closer examination. This paper considers the methodological difficulties enstraining a balanced assessment of the four threats. The nature of each threat is examined in turn. The conjunction of these threats to food security does occur, but not in a spatially or temporarily consistent manner. Furthermore, there is considerable uncertainty regarding the ability of physical and economic models to correctly represent the dynamic feedback processes of the real world. The lack of certainty has generated polarized views regarding the potential impact of these threats. Over-simplification has generated the claim that these factors present an unprecedented challenge to world food security. This alternate perspective holds that technological advances and policy corrections could overcome food production constraints and achieve sustainable growth. Both views need to be challenged, though the paper concludes that the latter carries more strength.

DE ACACIA-ALBIDA; SOIL; MAIZE; YIELD; SMALLHOLDER CROP PRODUCTION
AB Research conducted in different ecological zones of Malawi indicates that Acacia albida has effects on maize similar to those reported in the Sahel, Sudan and Ethiopia. Yield and soil trends were evaluated along transect lines at increasing distances from individual trees in different orientations extending away from the tree canopy. Exploratory studies along the lakeshore plain of Lake Malawi during the 1987/1988 season showed that yields of local maize under traditional management with A. albida were more than double the yield away from the trees. However, the soil fertility status changed little over the length of the transects. Later studies were conducted inland from the lake with hybrid and local maize. Soil differences were again minimal. Hybrid maize (NSCM41 and R201 ) generally outyielded local maize, but the size and period of sampling were too limited for conclusive results, especially regarding crop sustainability. Overall yield patterns were similar to the lakeshore area, but differences were more variable. This appeared to be a function of variability in tree size and shape, soils, crop management by the farmer, and proximity to neighbouring trees. The relative contributions of these factors are not known, indicating areas for further research. Because of the on-farm nature of these trials, control over external influences was limited, suggesting the need to standardize cropping practices and other factors across sites if the mechanisms affecting yields are to be better understood.

DE ECONOMIC VIABILITY; AGROFORESTRY SYSTEM; TAUNGYA SYSTEM; MIXED
   INTERCROPPING; HEDGEROW INTERCROPPING
AB The economic viability of agroforestry systems depends on endogenous and exogenous biophysical and socioeconomic factors. Understanding of such factors helps to delineate recommendation domain areas as well as to identify modifications in such factors in order to improve the system's viability. Each system has strengths and limitations in terms of its economic viability across the various land-use systems in Eastern and Southern Africa. In this paper, three agroforestry systems-taungya (or shamba), Faidherbia albida mixed intercropping, and hedgerow intercropping-are reviewed in terms of factors influencing their economic viability. The taungya system's economic viability was found to be dependent on conditions where access to land is scarce and where the returns to labour were low. To improve the returns to labour for the farmers participating in the system, a more prominent role of the agricultural activities is suggested, while the Forestry Department's net returns may be improved by changing their objective function from maximizing net timber income per unit area to optimizing total net timber income by using their scarce resources to cover larger areas, sacrificing some timber output per unit area. Alternatively, an increased public awareness of the environmental value of forest areas may generate additional resources to Forestry Departments, which may be used to increase income generating opportunities for the participating farmers.
   Apart from biophysical conditions required for the Faidherbia albida system, no specific socioeconomic conditions for this existing system were identified except that the tree's role may vary depending on the priorities of the farmer, i.e. food, fuelwood or fodder. A critical factor for the long-term sustainability and potential expansion of the system is the time required to reap the benefits from newly established trees. Therefore, research should be focused on selecting and breeding shorter period species.
   The hedgerow intercropping system is still in its infancy and mostly tried under research station conditions. To identify exogenous biophysical factors which may influence the biological response of the system, it is proposed that a more indepth synthesis of existing research is conducted to identify such factors. Particular attention should be paid to responses under low rainfall conditions and/or acidic soil conditions. Government policy on prices of inputs such as fertilizers, seed(lings) and food crops were identified as major exogenous socioeconomic factors affecting the economic viability of the system. Key endogenous factors which would affect its economic viability are the management capability of farmers, labour costs for establishing and maintaining the system, as well as the costs of seeds or seedlings. Because cost of establishment is influenced by the establishment method, choice of species and the hedgerow arrangement, it is proposed that more research is focused on the effect of these factors on cost as well as crop yields.

AB In Colombia, transmission poles and fenceposts of pine, cypress, and eucalypt treated with chromated copper arsenate (CCA) and established in replicated field trials have shown good results after 10 years of field exposure. There was complete failure of all untreated posts and poles. There is a need to use wood from sustainably managed sources such as plantations rather than from the natural forest in Colombia for both economic and biodiversity reasons. The results of this study indicate that CCA-treated plantation wood will be durable under Colombian conditions.

AB While environmental change and policy responses to environmental threat have attracted considerable attention from government and industry over the past decade, conventional approaches have tended to be individualistic, naturalistic and government-led in orientation. This article considers a perspective on 'sustainable development' which emphasizes citizen-led initiatives. In particular, the possibilities for 'bridging the gap' between innovation processes and the implementation of technology are discussed. Three European case-studies are presented of a constructive and citizen-led 'social management' of environmental change-urban ecology, wind energy and science shops. Conclusions are then reached about the policy and theoretical significance of these social experiments.

DE GEOTHERMAL RESOURCES; GEOTHERMAL UTILIZATION; GEOTHERMAL DEVELOPMENT;
   GEOTHERMAL INVESTMENTS
AB Thermal springs have been used for bathing, washing and cooking for thousands of years in many countries. At the beginning of this century, experiments started with piping the hot water to houses for space heating and with using geothermal steam for the production of electricity. Geothermal is a proven energy resource that uses mostly conventional technology. Commercial production on the scale of hundreds of MW has been undertaken for over three decades both for electricity generation and direct utilization. Today, electricity is generated from geothermal energy in 21 countries. The installed capacity is nearly 6300 MW-electric. Four developing countries (El Salvador 18%, Kenya 11%, Nicaragua 18% and Philippines 21%) produce over 10% of their total electricity from geothermal. Electric generation cost is commonly around 4 U.S.cents/kWh. Direct utilization of geothermal water (space heating, horticulture, fish farming, industry and/or bathing) is known in about 40 countries, thereof 14 countries have each an installed capacity of over 100 MW-thermal. The overall installed capacity for direct utilization is about 11,400 MW-thermal. The production cost/kWh for direct utilization is highly variable, but commonly under 2 U.S.cents/kWh(t). A worldwide survey shows that the total investments in geothermal energy between 1973 and 1992 amounted to approximately 22 billion U.S.$. During the two decades, 30 countries invested each over 20 million U.S.$, 12 countries over 200 million U.S.$, and 5 countries over 1 billion U.S.$. During the first decade, 1973-1982, public funding amounted to 4.6 billion U.S.$ and private funding to 3 billion U.S.$. During the second decade, 1983-1992, public funding amounted to 6.6 billion U.S.$ and private funding to 7.7 billion U.S.$. Geothermal development has in the past been much affected by the development of prices of the competing fuels, especially oil and natural gas. Assuming a continuation of the present oil prices, the annual growth rate in geothermal utilization is likely to be some 4% for electricity generation and 10% for direct utilization. This would imply installed capacities of 8900 MW(e) and 30,000 MW(t) in the year 2000. The total investment cost of geothermal in the world during the next decade can be expected to be some 15-20 billion U.S.$. Properly implemented, geothermal energy is a sustainable resource and benign to the environment. The emission of greenhouse gases is minimal compared to fossil fuels. The removal of hydrogen sulphide from high temperature steam and the reinjection of spent geothermal fluids into the ground make the potential negative environmental effects negligible. The relative economic viability of geothermal energy will improve significantly if and when a pollution tax is endorsed on power production using fossil fuels. Geothermal exploration and exploitation requires skills from many scientific and engineering disciplines. International geothermal training centres are operated in Iceland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, and New Zealand. The International Geothermal Association was founded in 1988 and has over 2000 members in all parts of the world.

TI ALTERNATIVE SYSTEMS OF INQUIRY FOR A SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE
SO IDS BULLETIN-INSTITUTE OF DEVELOPMENT STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
AB Scientific investigation has long been dominated by positivism, which holds that an independent reality driven by immutable laws exists. Consequently, it should be possible to define sustainability in absolute terms. Advances in alternative paradigms, however, suggest: that any attempt precisely to define sustainability is flawed; that problems are always open to interpretation; that the resolution of one problem inevitably leads to the production of another 'problem-situation', as problems are endemic; that the key feature now becomes the capacity of actors continually to learn about these changing conditions, so that they can act rapidly to transform existing activities; and that systems of learning and inquiry are needed to seek the multiple perspectives of the various stakeholders and encourage wider involvement and action. These systems of inquiry are participatory in nature, and the information and action arising from them is judged by a framework of trustworthiness criteria.

TI NEW INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY - OLD INFORMATION HABITS
SO IDS BULLETIN-INSTITUTE OF DEVELOPMENT STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
AB Recently, 'information' has been viewed as an essential requirement for effective and efficient management, and as a basis for medium and long term planning. The establishment of 'information systems' and the introduction of 'the new information technologies' have been presented as solutions to problems of unavailability of adequate data on key areas of policy concern in many countries. Attempts to increase the usefulness of information systems regard to either the detailed organizational structure of the institutions concerned, the true resource costs of additional data collection activities or their impact on existing procedures. They frequently entail very strong, and usually unexamined, assumptions about effective and sustainable implementation, in particular with respect to the cooperation of those at lower levels within the institutional hierarchy. Indeed, they may often involve the collection of a considerable volume of additional data in situations where the quality of data already collected seems suspect. Critically, much of the discussion on information systems tends to divorce information from other aspects of decision-making processes. Thus, the mechanisms required for information to play a serious role in policy formation often do not exist.

TI COMMUNICATION SUPPORT FOR SUSTAINABLE NATURAL-RESOURCE MANAGEMENT
SO IDS BULLETIN-INSTITUTE OF DEVELOPMENT STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
AB Natural Resource Management (NRM) can be looked upon from different perspectives: (1) the bio-physical science perspective, (2) the economic perspective and (3) the social actor perspective. After briefly contrasting the three complementary perspectives, the article focuses on the third, which is the least developed. The social actor perspective requires that one distinguish between (1) the natural resource (be it a farm, a water catchment, underground water resources, etc.) and (2) the social actors who hold a stake in, and/or affect it.  These stakeholders ideally form a platform for integral decision making about the natural resource. The platform/resource combination highlights communication processes of interest in sustainable NRM:  creating a rich picture of intentions and realities; (land use) negotiation and accommodation; making things visible; raising the level of social aggregation at which platforms operate; and information systems for platform decision support.  Such and other platform processes need active facilitation.  The article outlines the implications for communication support, and explores professional contributions.

LA English

DE BIOLOGICAL CONTROL; CHEMICAL PESTICIDES; INTEGRATED PEST MANAGEMENT;
   PESTS; SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE
AB Food production in Africa is declining, while her population is increasing rapidly. Some factors responsible for low food productivity are mentioned; special attention is given to the problem of agricultural pests. The hazards of overuse of pesticides in developed countries are cited to caution farmers in developing countries from getting drawn into a similar situation when attempting to solve pest problems. Integrated pest management (IPM), which aims to increase food productivity and profitability without endangering the environment, is recommended as a sustainable solution to the pesticide problem. The role of biological control agents, i.e., introduction, augmentation and preservation of natural enemies is emphasized. In developing sustainable agriculture through IPM, the importance of incorporating farmers' traditional methods of farming into an IPM package and of identifying farmers' overriding concerns, is recommended as a prerequisite to the acceptability and success of such packages.

ID PRICE-SETTING SUPERGAMES; CAPACITY CONSTRAINTS
AB Optimal penal codes in asymmetric Bertrand supergames exhibit security level punishments for the largest firm. If no firm has sufficient capacity to service the market, then collusion that is barely sustainable by optimal penal codes entails higher capacity utilization by the largest firm than by the other firms. Collusion supported by optimal penal codes in models with a large firm facing a competitive fringe can result in the large firm having low capacity utilization and thus providing a ''price umbrella'' for the fringe firms, which have high capacity utilization.

AB The continuing challenge to improve the quality of urban air, worldwide, provides many opportunities to introduce cleaner technologies into the industrial energy base. The fuel cell is particularly attractive from an environmental viewpoint because of its inherent efficiency, zero or near-zero emissions, and quiet operation. Since 1991, fuel cells have made major institutional strides in being recognized as part of the solution to the major air-pollution problem in Southern California. Fuel cells and hydrogen are now receiving greater attention in the regulatory planning process. This process seeks to identify lower-emitting technologies and fuels that can assist the region in meeting health-based air-quality standards by the year 2010, and provide for a sustainable, health-grounded regional economy as well. Current demonstration projects involving fuel cells and hydrogen are discussed, as well as necessary plans and incentives for infrastructure development - a critical component of fuel-cell commercialization. Finally, an overview is presented of regulatory efforts that are being considered to support early markets for fuel cells.

Some recent studies on the evolution of the environmental movement in the United States arc examined The impact on competitive advantage, legal requirements, and ethical and moral beliefs are also discussed. Finally, the writer stresses the importance of developing ways to ''value'' preventive measures for environmental protection, as a way for industry to economically weigh the benefits of self-imposed environmental protection. Suggestions for future research topics are offered.

TI ECONOMIC-IMPACT OF RURAL-DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS ON SMALL FARMERS
SO JOURNAL OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB Economic impact studies of three rural interventions (Farm clinic-FC, Dharmastala Rural Development Project-SKDRDP, and IRDP) and their combinations were undertaken. Study revealed that the number of schemes which failed to generate any income was maximum under IRDP. Though crop loans under FC did not seem to have any appreciable impact incomewise, results of minor irrigation projects were quite encouraging under all packages. The SKDRDP was observed to have comparatively 'the best' sustainable packages incomewise (combination of minor irrigation, land levelling, plantation cultivation etc.,). However, schemes such as ''Dairy'' under IRDP and ''draft animals'' under F.C. were observed to be negative in their economics.
   Shift of beneficiaries from the lower income groups to higher brackets was maximum under SKDRDP with least reversals. FC recorded minimum shifts with reversals, IRDP falling in between. SKDRDP's intervention had brought about maximum variation individually or in combination with regard to the ''sourcewise income variation'', FC registering negative growth and IRDP falling in between. Dependence on agricultural wage was more under FC schemes and least under SKDRDP. As IRDP could not provide sufficient employment through its packages, wage dependence was more.
   It was clear from the study that the approach of an NGO with regard to the identification of the problem, designing of sustainable packages and proper implementation, meticulous follow-up etc. were responsible for the marked economic upliftment of the small farmers.

TI DEFINING A FRAMEWORK FOR GENDER ANALYSIS IN DEVELOPMENT-PLANNING
SO JOURNAL OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB With growing realization of the importance of considering the relative social positioning of both men and women in developing planning, there is a shift from the narrow 'Women in Development' approach to the broad gender approach. This paper, therefore, begins with an examination of the gender roles including reproductive, productive and community management activities. Establishing that men and women have differential gender roles, the concept of practical and strategic gender needs are defined and illustrated. This follows outlining a framework for gender analysis and examining its various components like activity analysis, resource analysis, benefits analysis, inclusion analysis and social sustainability analysis. How these five components provide basis for designing and implementing projects that can benefit women and benefit by women's participation are also shown through an inventory of project cycle adaptation parameters.

DE SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION; SUSTAINABLE LAND USE; CARRYING CAPACITY;
   FUNDING MODALITIES
AB A framework for planning development strategies for sustainable land use in developing countries is proposed based on the carrying capacity concept. The rehabilitation of degraded land includes a stabilization and a restoration phase, with corresponding measures to be taken and funding modalities to be explored. Restoration measures focus on the rehabilitation of ecosystem functions, but are effective only when preceded or accompanied by measures stabilizing exploitation levels. Short-term benefits are required to ensure local participation, but may be counterproductive when long-term ecological rehabilitation is the major objective. Incentives are important policy instruments to enhance participation by rural communities in rehabilitation activities. Long-term economic, ecological and social (humanitarian) arguments, at a scale surpassing the local level, should receive more attention in the process of justifying investments for land rehabilitation. Some criteria and conditions to be met both at a macro-scale and at the local level are discussed.

AB Some of the economic and operational aspects of mapping are discussed, including the conditions that may offer air survey a competitive advantage over other methods.  The financing of national mapping programmes around the world is increasingly market oriented, driven by the need to provide the end users with information that they can turn into sustainable economic growth and social progress.  Despite these economic pressures, map makers seem to find their work more enjoyable and rewarding than most professionals.

AB Alternative practices for weed management, such as integrated weed management (IWM) may allow the persistence of weed populations below a given economic threshold. Increased species diversity of weeds also may result. If diversity increases, and the number of ecological interactions also increases, weed species should be viewed as an interactive community, rather than an unrelated set of targets for control. In this review we summarize how diversity is evaluated in unmanaged systems, examine how IWM techniques may alter the diversity of weed species and suggest how strategies can be developed for managing weed diversity under IWM. Methods used to evaluate diversity in natural systems may be used to evaluate weed diversity in alternative systems of weed management. We made preliminary calculations of diversity for reduced tillage, modified herbicide use, crop rotation, critical period of weed control, techniques to improve crop competitiveness, and alternative control methods. Many of these IWM techniques potentially may result in changes in weed species diversity. We examined potential effects of these changes in weed diversity within six primary elements of community ecology: colonization, disturbance, the physical environment, interactions with other communities, community interactions and community dynamics. Opportunities to develop strategies of community management exist within each of these elements. If diversity could be managed while maintaining acceptable crop yields, some previously unrealized benefits of the presence of weeds could be seen, as predicted by relationships among plants of unmanaged communities. Moreover, the goal of producing a more sustainable system that incorporates the diversity of the weed community would be complemented by trends in policy towards encouraging biodiversity in agroecosystems.

   ANALYSIS; STRAINS; NUMBERS; SEED
AB Rhizobial inoculants for use in Canada are regulated and have been evaluated in a formal testing program since 1975. This program is carried out by Agriculture Canada under authority of the Fertilizers Act and involves inoculant strain and formulation registration (with Food Production and Inspection Branch) as well as analysis (by Research Branch) of approximately 220 inoculants and pre-inoculated seed products yearly. Inoculant evaluation is based upon the calculated number of viable rhizobia which would be provided per seed if the inoculant was applied at the manufacturer's recommended rate. Current standards are 10(3), 10(4), and 10(5) viable rhizobia per seed, of the proper cross-inoculation group, for small, intermediate, and large seeded legumes, respectively. Application of these standards means that some inoculants are considered ''satisfactory'' even though they yield test results as low as 9.4 x 10(6) rhizobia per gram. No standards are currently applied relative to permissible levels of contaminants in inoculant products, despite the fact that some inoculants contain many more contaminating microorganisms than they do Rhizobium cells. The demands of modern sustainable agriculture, taken together with advances in inoculant formulation technology, warrant an increase by a factor of ten in the minimum acceptable Canadian standards for legume inoculants and pre-inoculated seed products.

DE GLOBAL CHANGE; CIVIC SCIENCE; ENVIRONMENT; SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
ID NATIONAL-INCOME ACCOUNTS; NATURAL-RESOURCES
AB Global environmental change is caused by the interaction of two extremely complex systems. One is the biosphere, the other human society and economy. Neither is modellable nor manageable because both operate intricately and chaotically, and from time to time catastrophically. Civic science is negotiated science where future states are envisaged through open structures of learning, consensus-seeking and bargaining. This suggests that interdisciplinary science is more than the fusion of disciplines. It is the transformation of science into democratic structures through which fairer decisions can be made. Geographers should be singularly capable of adopting civic science, but they cannot do so on their own.

DE TURKEY; TOURISM; HUMAN RESOURCES; EDUCATION; TRAINING
AB One of the most important issues facing the further development of the Turkish tourism industry is the quality of its supply of indigenous trained personnel.  Despite a spectacular increase in the size of the Turkish tourism industry over the last decade there is a danger that this growth will not be sustainable owing to the increasing shortage of skilled staff.  In recognition of this the Turkish government has initiated a strategy to strengthen the provision of hospitality/tourism education and training through the development of a National Hospitality Management Curriculum and National Training Awards.  It is these initiatives which are discussed in this article.

DT Article
AB The possibilities and limitations in internationalising the economy of the Randstad are considered, taking into account criteria of sustainability. The Randstad has a central position in the West European urban core region. National physical planning policies are strongly focused on the Randstad. A number of strategic projects are being developed to promote the attractiveness of the Randstad. At the same time, initiatives have been taken to strengthen the administrative cohesion within the Randstad. We show that the coordination between different strategic projects is weak and that priorities are unclear. A strategic plan for the Randstad is presented, aimed at a strengthening of its international position and its environmental qualities.

AB Current United Kingdom (UK) government policy on pesticides is aimed at minimizing rather than arbitrarily reducing usage. It is to be achieved through a rigorous Approvals process, the setting of statutory maximum residue limits, regular monitoring, legislation on the safe use of pesticides on farms, and a core-funded research program on topics such as improved forecasting of pest infestations, more effective application techniques, alternative control strategies, integrated pest management and sustainable farming systems. Over the longer term these measures are expected to bring about substantial real decreases in pesticide usage, without the need to impose arbitrary reduction targets, such as have been implemented by several other European countries. Reductions in the usage of particular chemicals will also occur as a result of the implementation of European Community (EC) environmental legislation on pesticide levels in ground and drinking water and pesticide discharges into the North Sea. With herbicides, the tonnage of active ingredient applied in the UK declined substantially during the 1980s, due mainly to the increased use of products which were more biologically active at lower dosage rates than those they replaced. The actual percentage of crops sprayed remained at 95 to 100. Further reductions are likely in the 1990s, enhanced by factors such as dose-cutting by farmers in response to economic rather than environmental pressures and an increase in set-aside. Weed scientists are currently studying the long-term effects on weed population dynamics of reduced herbicide inputs in cereals, set-aside management, and more environmentally friendly, lower input rotations, as part of a wider program of research designed to provide government with scientifically based information upon which to decide future policies.

DE INTEGRATED WEED MANAGEMENT AND CULTURAL; BIOLOGICAL; AND MECHANICAL WEED
   CONTROL
AB Weed science has a long history of solving weed management problems for farmers. Over the last four decades most of the solutions to weed problems have been based on herbicide technology. Thus, most crop production systems in the United States rely heavily on herbicides as the primary method of weed management. During the last decade environmentalists, farmers, agricultural scientists, policy makers, and the general public have begun to question the long-term sustainability of conventional farming systems. The sustainability of these systems is being questioned because of environmental, social, and economic concerns caused by global competition, cost of production, soil erosion, water pollution, and concern over the quality of rural life. Weeds are the major deterrent to the development of more sustainable agriculture systems. Since weeds dictate most of the crop production practices (e.g., tillage, herbicides, cultivation, row spacing) weed scientists must become the leaders of collaborative integrated approaches to agriculture systems research. New crop production systems must be developed that are less destructive to the environment, are profitable, conserve energy, and support rural community development. The goal is to facilitate the development of ecologically based alternative methods of weed management that will support crop production systems that require less tillage and herbicide inputs. To accomplish this goal, research efforts must be radically expanded in weed/crop ecology and in the development of ecologically based technologies for weed management.

ID EARTHQUAKE
AB Although one of the smallest of the new independent states of the former Soviet Union, the Republic of Armenia has an ancient tradition and a strong ethnic identification, greatly enhanced by the diaspora. In addition to the problems following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Armenia has had to contend with a draining war in Nagorno-Karabakh and the after-effects of a devastating earthquake in 1988. Humanitarian efforts have ranged from emergency supply deliveries to longer-term sustainable health care partnerships. The United States government, through the Agency for International Development, has organized such partnerships, partially as a result of a multinational mission in 1992 and a subsequent hospital-to-hospital program developed by the American International Health Alliance. We describe the current state of health care in Armenia and some of the problems that need to be addressed to improve health care services to its citizens.

AB P fertilizer in three forms was applied at 0(P0), 15 (P1) and 45 (P3) kg ha-1 P per annum to a rotation lucerne - lucerne - potatoes - winter rye - sugar beet - spring barley. The experiment was laid down in 1949 near Halle on Phaeozem soil containing 57 mg total P and 8.5 mg DL-P per 100 g soil (0-20 cm) and with pH 6.0 (0.1 M KCl). Small differences between treatments were first observed only after 20 years. Since then the effects of treatment increased but even after the 7th cycle (1982-1987) the maximum effect was < 8 cereal units (CU) per ha. The crops most responsive to P were: lucerne (in the year of sowing), potatoes and sugar beet. Over the period 1977-1988, annual P removal exceeded P input by 23 and 9 kg ha-1 P for treatments P0 and P1 respectively; on treatment P3, P input exceeded removal by 19 kg ha-1 per annum. DL-P on treatment P0 in 1979 was 3.5-4.0 mg per 100 g, insufficient to support high yields. A level of 5-6 mg DL-P per 100 g soil, as found in treatment P1 is required for sustainable high yield. Change in total soil P content corresponded with the P balance (input - withdrawal) only on treatment P3. The lack of correspondence on treatments P0 and P1 suggests that crops obtained much of their P requirement from subsoil.

AB This paper claims that countries of the North must develop a new model of wealth - one less harmful to the environment and capable of being applied throughout the world. There are reasons to be hopeful they will do so: first, they have the means at their disposal; second, it is a misconception that environmental protection is a cost; and third, there is mounting pressure for change as indicated by air, water and soil quality data. The challenge is to move the emphasis away from end-of-the-pipe pollution control to improving resource productivity. The best way of doing this is through the imposition of 'green taxes' to raise resource prices. If governments compensate by cutting other taxes to make the change revenue-neutral, there would be real benefits to the environment and the economy, particularly in developing countries.

AB Soil-dwelling invertebrates were sampled over a 5-year period in a study comparing zero, reduced, and conventional tillage practices for grain crop production on a vertisol in semi-arid northeastern Australia. Soil animals were classified into ecologically distinct functional groups (herbivores, detritivores, and predators); ants and spiders were categorised separately. Zero tillage generally had the highest population densities of detritivores and predators, while conventional cultivation had lowest abundance in these groups. Numbers of herbivorous soil insects were similar between tillage treatments at each sampling time. Numbers within each functional group fluctuated over time, with low population densities coinciding with periods of low rainfall. It is hypothesised that the retention of crop residues on the soil surface in zero tillage, favours decomposer and predatory soil fauna, in contrast to conventional disc ploughing where stubble is buried soon after harvest. The density of predators was correlated with density of detritivores in zero tillage (r2 = 0.45, P < 0.04). Zero tillage is promoted as a soil conservation practice in the semi-arid tropics. Zero tillage may further increase the ecological sustainability of agroecosystems by maintaining high populations of soil-ameliorating fauna, and predators of insect pests.

AB Low external input agroforestry systems hold great promise as alternative, sustainable production systems for small-to-medium farmers in the Amazon Basin. The design of such systems is considered essential to stabilize agricultural production and avoid the cycle of continuing destruction of primary forest [Anderson A (1990) In: Anderson A (ed) Alternatives to Deforestation: Steps toward Sustainable Use of the Amazon Rain Forest pp 3-23. Columbia University Press, New York]. In order to be successful, these systems must be compatible with local ecological conditions and adoptable by farmers. Currently, many small-to-medium producers in the Amazon Basin use a slash and burn agricultural strategy that combines annual cropping with cattle grazing in mixed farming systems. While cattle play an important role in household economic survival, grazing-induced land degradation threatens the long-term viability of these farms [Loker W (1993) Human Organization 52(1): 14-24]. This paper presents a model of a low external input agroforestry system that incorporates farmer preferences and practices but uses well-adapted grass-legume pastures, rotational grazing and the management of natural forest regeneration to enhance productivity in an ecologically sound manner. This system provides farmers with the benefits of both annual crops and cattle raising, avoids the land degradation that characterizes current practices and effectively incorporates trees into the production system.

AB A survey was conducted in 17 selected thaluks (revenue sub-divisions) of Kerala state to elucidate the floristic structure, composition and the extent of similarities and diversities in the composition of homegardens of Kerala, with particular reference to small (below 0.4 ha), medium (0.4 to 2 ha) and large (> 2.0 ha) holding size categories. Besides attempts were also made to characterize the potential of homegardens to supply commercial timber and fuelwood. Two hundred and fifty two farmers were selected through a stratified random process. In addition to gathering general information on crop and livestock production enterprises, all scattered trees and shrubs (greater-than-or-equal-to 15 cm girth at breast height) on the homestead and border trees except palms and rubber were enumerated.
   There was tremendous variability both in the number of trees and shrubs present and species diversity of the selected homesteads in different provinces. The small, medium and large sized holdings also exhibited profound variability in the number of woody taxa and individuals present. In total, 127 woody species (Girth at Breast Height (GBH) greater-than-or-equal-to 15 cm) were encountered. The mean number of woody taxa found in the homegardens ranged from 11 for Pathanapuram to 39 in Perinthalmanna. Floristic diversity was higher in the smaller homesteads. It decreased with increasing the size of holdings. Mean Simpson's diversity index for the homesteads ranged from 0.251 (Kochi) to 0.739 (Kottarakkara) suggesting that floristic diversity of homegardens was moderate to low compared to a value over 0.90 for the species-rich evergreen forests of the Western Ghats. The Sorensen's similarity indexes suggested a moderately high degree of similarity for the different tree species encountered in the homesteads of Kerala.
   No clear cut planting pattern was discernible in the homegardens of Kerala. The homegarden trees and shrubs were either scattered throughout the homestead or on farm boundaries. Farmers tend to prefer timber trees such as ailanthus (highest frequency) and teak besides fruit trees such as mango, jack, cashew and the like. Major homegarden species were represented in all diameter classes. The diameter structure, however, exhibited a slightly skewed (+) distribution pattern, having the highest frequency in the 20-30 cm classes ensuring adequate regeneration status and in that process making homegardens a sustainable as well as dynamic land use system.
   Standing stock of timber and firewood in the homestead of different thaluks are presented. Average commercial standing stock of homesteads ranged from 6.6 to 50.8 m3 ha-1 and fuel wood volume was of the order of 23 to 86 m3 ha-1. Implicit in the high commercial timber volume and fuel wood volume is that a substantial proportion of the society's wood demands are met from the homesteads. Palms, however, constituted the dominant component of standing commercial timber and fuel wood volumes accounting as much as 63% and 72%, respectively, of the total wood in these categories.

AB A common strategy to conserve tropical forests and their biological and cultural diversity is increasingly being implemented by environmental and cultural survival organizations. Sustainable commercialization of renewable forest products is becoming a crux of this strategy, as forests must pay for their conservation. Indigenous peoples living in tropical forests have been trading many commodities for centuries, and there is potential for new and increased markets. What are some of these products?

TI MODELING ECOLOGICALLY SUSTAINABLE ECONOMIC-DEVELOPMENT IN A REGION - A
   CASE-STUDY IN THE NETHERLANDS
SO ANNALS OF REGIONAL SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper addresses the relevance of the notion of sustainable development in a regional context and the use of models for regional sustainable development policy. First, the notion of sustainable development is discussed by linking socio-economic and ecological elements. In a spatial context an often neglected but relevant concept is regional sustainable development (RSD). Its relationship with both the global concept of sustainable development and sustainable use of resources is discussed. The use of models for sustainable development in a regional context is investigated. All potential models integrate economy and ecology: a description of economic processes, ecological processes and their interactions; and an inclusion of socio-economic and ecological indicators in the policy evaluation. Only dynamic models are considered, as they are regarded to be the most relevant class for addressing issues of sustainable development. It is argued that scenario and simulation models are most appropriate on a regional level, as here the level of detail in describing the economics and ecology is fairly balanced. Finally, a case study is presented for the Peel region, an area in the Netherlands, where presently agriculture causes considerable damage to groundwater, forests, and protected fen areas due to intensive cattle farming, irrigation and drainage. Several relevant development scenarios for RSD planning are developed, and the model analyses for each of them are reviewed from the viewpoint of RSD.

AB This paper considers the overgrazing problem in low income countries, paying special attention to the joint influence of the economic and natural ''environments'' within which livestock farmers operate. The context is the argument that liberalisation of agricultural product markets will encourage the sustainable use of environmental resources. The paper explores the link between economic conditions and ecologically sustainable use of resources in semi-arid lands, using an infinite-horizon stochastic control range management model. The approach makes it possible to establish, for any given initial conditions, whether there exists an optimal policy that is ecologically sustainable under those conditions, and what economic environment and initial endowments would be sustainable.

AB This paper is based on the work of the Resource Assessment Commission, which was required by the Prime Minister to inquire into uses of Australia's forest and timber resources. It begins with a brief discussion of concepts of sustainable resource management and the guiding principles of the Commission. A description is given of the study area, its environment and forest resources. Sources of conflict in resource management are identified. The paper then explains how benefit-cost analysis techniques were applied to assess resource management options. The analysis undertaken was based on the Krutilla-Fisher model and contingent valuation of the forest resource.

AB Many experts have concluded that migration and regional diversification are necessary steps to combat soil degradation and income erosion in the Sahel. Through observation and experiments conducted with two Senegalese village Social Accounting Matrices, the socioeconomic and environmental impact of migration and diversification out of agriculture is examined. Economically, it is found that migration can result in substantial increases in village income. These increases are accompanied by a shift in inter-compound income distribution and a shift in intra-compound access to agricultural income. Socially, the cost to the family of increased migration could be high due to the emergence of single parent households. Environmentally, the impact of migration and diversification out of agriculture need not be positive. Stress on the environment might be reduced through curtailing peanut production, but reductions in the agricultural labor force could actually reduce the possibility for labor intensive soil conservation, increase the possibility for millet mono-cropping, and increase the incidence of extensive but sparsely cultivated land because of land-tenure insecurity due to current usufruct laws.

AB Although it is easy to subscribe to the concept of sustainability, it is well-known that disagreements begin once we try to apply the concept to concrete cases. This paper spells out, in the case of forestry, the features of the concept that lead not only to confusion, about which there is already a vast literature, but also to contradictions among decision models which use a discount rate and government regulations inspired by substainability. Indeed, forestry analysis highlights weaknesses of conventional cost-benefit analysis when it gets involved into intergenerational effects. Sustainability forces this involvement. On the other hand, discounting is an essential condition for optimally allocating resources over time. This paper reconciles intergenerational transfers with discounting through the bequest method. Among other things, the bequest method provides a rationale for various degrees of weak sustainability. The regionalization of the method shows that one of its basic components, the contingent valuation method (to specify the bequest), works even better at the regional level, while another basic component, partial equilibrium analysis, does not appreciably hinder national or global optimization.

ID WAX ESTER SECRETION
AB Background and Design: A prospective study of 30 patients with moderate to severe acne was performed. Th, follicular reservoir and sustainable sebum excretion rates were measured before and after a 4-month course of isotretinoin at a dose of 1 mg/kg per day.
   Results: The follicular reservoir and sustainable sebum excretion rates were profoundly reduced at the end of the course of isotretinoin (79% and 83%, respectively) and remained significantly suppressed at 1 year following therapy (43% and 36%, respectively). Those patients who relapsed clinically at 1 year after treatment had a significantly higher follicular reservoir rate.
   Conclusions: These data support the concept that up to 1 year after therapy, there is a reduction in the sebum secretion rate accompanying the remission of acne. This suppressed sebum secretion may modulate the microenvironment of the pilosebaceous canal through an effect on the follicular reservoir.

TI ESTONIAN AGRICULTURE - A PROCESS OF RADICAL STRUCTURAL REFORM - THE
   SITUATION AND OUTLOOK IN SPRING 1993
SO BERICHTE UBER LANDWIRTSCHAFT
LA German
DT Article
AB Since Estonia became independent on 20. 08. 1991, the Estonian economy has been converting to a market economy: in law, in the structure of the economy and in economic and social policy. In 1992, GDP fell as a result by some 40 % in real terms. These losses consequent upon adjustment were largely unavoidable, if the country wanted national independence, democracy and transition to the market economy. Economic decline has been brought to a halt in 1993.  In 1994, long-term recovery can get under way.
   Estonian agricultural production has fallen by about a third since 1989. This concerns primarily milk production which continues even now, because of natural conditions, to be the main feature of the production system in Estonian agriculture, representing more than 70 % of added value. There are four main reasons for that development: the narrowing of producer price ratios in regard to inputs and products as a result of the loss of export markets in the former Soviet Union and the lifting of price controls, short-term discruption to production resulting from changes in agricultural structure, a lack of liquidity in production and the disorganization of agricultural trade.
   Producer prices for milk amount currently to 20 % of the European Community level, for machinery, equipment and inputs to between 10 and 15 %, for labour between 2 and 2,5 % and for land between 5 and 10 %. In the next few years, the prices of machinery, equipment and inputs will rise rapidly to the world market level. The price of milk may more or less double to export parity value, as domestic purchasing power increases in line with real wages. Following this process of price adjustment - perhaps in as little as 3 years - the price of milk would stand at 40 % of the current European community level, that of inputs and capital goods 80 % and wages 5 %.
   Trends in producer price rations, and the low wage levels in particular, argue over a period of ten years, for the survival of family-run small-holdings which, operated full- or part-time; will play an important social and economic role for a transitional period. If, however, the Estonian economy, and thus real wages, develop over the next 20 years in line with the Northern and Western European post war models, and that is likely if the possibility of stagnation is ruled out, family farms comprising 25 ha of utilized agricultural area (UAA) and operated full-time will not be sustainable in the long term. The minimum size of farm operated full-time could then, even in 20 years' time, require 30 cows with offspring and between 120 and 150 ha of UAA. The maximum number of privately run full-time farms would then be approximately 10,000 units. Viewed thus, small-holdings operated full-time are likely to be a social transitional phenomenon. It is therefore necessary, even at this stage, to be extremely cautious in regard to investment in buildings and plant financed with credit. It has also to be made clear to farmers in good time that - with all of today's unquestionable socio-economic advantages - with 25 ha of UAA, they will not be able to remain in full-time farming for long.

TI INTEGRATING LOCAL PLANT RESOURCES AND HABITAT MANAGEMENT

LA English
DT Article
DE WILD PLANT RESOURCES; TRADITIONAL USAGE; BOTANICAL GARDENS; SUSTAINABLE
   USAGE
AB The use of wild plant resources as a source of basic needs is an important aspect of multiple-use of land in much of Africa, ranging from vegetation with a low species diversity, high biomass production and resilience to harvesting (e.g. Phragmites reedbeds, Cymbopogon grasslands) through to vegetation with a high diversity of species (and plant life-forms), with a multiple of uses and often low resilience to resource harvesting (e.g. medicinal plants, pole cutting, fuelwood from Afro-montane forest). Complexity and costs of managing sustainable use of wild populations increase markedly with an increasing number of uses and resource users. It is suggested that if the primary objective of core conservation areas is accepted to be the maintenance of habitat and species diversity, then the limited money and manpower available for management of core conservation areas in southern Africa limits sustainable harvesting use of plant resources to low diversity, low conservation priority vegetation types or encroaching species. For high diversity, high conservation priority sites such as Afro-montane or Coastal evergreen forest, the emphasis must be on providing alternative sources of supply to resource users outside of core areas. Botanical gardens staff, with their horticultural experience, can play a very important role through 'bulking up' material for supply to small farmers, herbalists and introducing additional species for agro-forestry. Botanical gardens can play a greater role in the establishment of field gene banks and ex situ conservation of vulnerable species. They can also provide a valuable educational and research role on mass production techniques to boost local stocks of threatened and commercially valuable species for cultivation by local people, whether farmers or specialist users (e.g. herbalists) in the country of origin as a means of generating employment and restoring local self-sufficiency.

AB There is considerable interest in the use of coal combustion byproducts as soil liming materials in agricultural production, but there is concern that such use may be detrimental to the quality of agricultural soils. To evaluate these byproducts as liming materials and address issues related to soil quality, we compared the influence of different amounts of four combustion byproducts [fly ash and bed ash from a fluidized bed combustion furnace, lime-injected multistage burner residue, and spray dryer residue] and CaCO3 on soil pH and activities of urease, phosphatase, arylsulfatase, and dehydrogenase in an acidic soil. Studies comparing the influence of the combustion byproducts and CaCO3 on soil pH showed that on a weight basis of application, substantial differences were observed in the ability of these materials to influence soil pH but that such differences decreased markedly after the data were transformed to a CaCO3 equivalent basis of application. Analysis of covariance for these transformed data indicated that whereas the liming abilities of fly ash and CaCO3 were not significantly different when compared on the CaCO3 equivalent basis, those of bed ash, multistage burner residue, and spray dryer residue were less than that of CaCO3. Studies comparing the influence of the byproducts and CaCO3 on soil enzyme activities showed that the effect of these liming materials on the enzyme activities studied was largely due to their influence on soil pH. The relationships obtained between soil pH and enzyme activities in soil amended with the liming materials generally demonstrated the marked similarities in the influence of the combustion byproducts and CaCO3 on these activities when observed within the domain of soil pH. These studies showed that the combustion byproducts tested functioned as soil liming materials in a manner similar to that of CaCO3 and seemed to have little adverse effect on soil quality.

AB A model is developed to describe neuronal elongation as a result of the polymerization of microtubules and elastic stretching of the neurites by force produced by the growth cone. The model for a single segment with a single growth cone revealed a constant elongation rate, while the concentration of tubulin in the soma rises, and the concentration of tubulin becomes constant in the growth cone. Extending the model to a neurite with a single branch point and two growth cones revealed the same results. When the assembly or the disassembly rate of microtubules is unequal in both growth cones, transient retraction of one of the terminal segments occurs, which results in complete retraction of the segment when the difference in (dis)assembly rate between the two growth cones is large enough. When the model is applied to large trees, a maximal sustainable number of terminal segments as a function of the production rate of tubulin appears. Mechanisms to stop outgrowth are discussed in relation to the establishment of synaptical contacts between cells.

AB The pterin age-grading method was applied to natural populations of stable flies sampled for 3 years from diverse locations in Minnesota and Iowa. Significant differences were detected among years in mean degree-day ages per fly. Fly ages, in degree-day units, were exponentially distributed. A two-parameter Weibull distribution closely fit the fly survival distributions. Mean expectations of life did not differ significantly between males and females and were estimated to be 86.6 degree-days above a 6.5-degrees-C threshold. Conventional age-grading techniques based on ovarian morphology applied to Iowa females showed that large fractions of the populations experienced delays in vitellogenesis. The reproductive rate, in terms of lifetime ovipositions, was less than the maximum sustainable rate suggested by ambient temperatures.

AB Growing evidence suggests that in Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.), components of reproductive success besides fecundity are size dependent. However, managers setting escapement goals usually estimate reproductive potential of a stock in terms of total number of spawners, number of female spawners, or potential egg deposition given a mean size of spawners. Interannual variation in size composition of spawners may thus result in errors in assessing reproductive potential. Here, we develop models of recruitment and harvest and determine optimal size-selective harvesting strategies. These optimal strategies range from the current large-fish harvests (larger-than-average fish are caught, leaving smaller fish to spawn) to small-fish harvests, where the reverse is true. If the body mass (M) of individual spawners increases more rapidly than reproductive success (RS) with respect to increasing length of adult females (e.g., if number of eggs alone best measures RS), then sustainable biomass yield is maximized by the current large-fish harvest. However, if RS/M increases with increasing length of females (e.g., if total biomass of eggs best measures RS), then small-fish harvest maximizes sustainable yield. Evidence suggests that some salmon populations show this latter pattern; thus, large-fish harvests may generate suboptimal yields.

DT Article
AB This article describes the creation of land markets within an overall strategy of converting from a centrally planned economy to a market-based economy. The first major step is the privatization of rights to immovable property (land and dwelling units in particular). This process is well advanced, with some remaining problems: (1) the rights of family members to such property are ill defined; (2) there are residual conflicts over the distributed ex-cooperative land; (3) buying and selling agricultural land is prohibited, but it is likely that informal transactions are occurring, leading to legal insecurities; (4) the recording of titles to immovable property is dispersed, being different for urban and agricultural properties; (5) condominium arrangements for urban apartment buildings are not in place; (6) land allocated to apartment buildings is not sufficient for access and owner use; (7) land invasions are common in urban areas; (8) legislation has not been consistent, creating overlapping rights to urban commercial properties. The effort to create a unified Property Registration System is urgently needed to overcome these problems and to move the country toward a socially and environmentally sustainable land market. Legislation and institutional arrangements for the PRS are in place, ready for the systematization of information about rights to real property.

TI SEX-BIASED HARVESTING AND POPULATION-DYNAMICS IN UNGULATES -
   IMPLICATIONS FOR CONSERVATION AND SUSTAINABLE USE
SO CONSERVATION BIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB The consumptive use of wildlife, in particular trophy bunting and game ranching of ungulates, has been advocated as a tool for conservation in Africa We show that these methods of harvesting differ significantly from natural predation, with trophy bunting showing extreme selection for adult males and game ranching leading to disproportionate harvests of young males. Little information, either theoretical or empirical, exists concerning the effect of these harvesting regimes on the long-term population dynamics of ungulate populations. Despite that, the potential effects of sex-skewed harvests are numerous. In this paper, we investigate one potentially deleterious effect of sex-skewed harvests. Both theory and experimental data suggest that male ungulates are limited in their absolute ability to inseminate females. Using a Leslie-Matrix model and published data on impala, we show that the interaction between sperm limitation and harvests with highly male-biased sex ratios can lead to greatly reduced female fecundity (defined as the number of young born) and population collapse. These results are robust and suggest that present methods of harvesting may not be optimal, or viable, in the long term.

   SUSTAINABILITY
AB The paper is principally concerned with (a) outlining the range of possibilities that exist for organisations which wish to undertake environmental and sustainability reporting and (b) suggesting particular approaches as the more desirable. But the paper also attempts to show that there is an important difference between environmental reporting and reporting for sustainability, and that, so far, efforts to encourage organisations to voluntarily undertake either have not been successful. Environmental reporting is business-centred and there are a number of practicable ways in which it can be undertaken. The most notable of these are the UN CTC approach to financial environmental reporting plus the Compliance-with-Standard Report. Reporting for sustainability is life-centred and, whatever method we adopt it is likely to show that western organisations are not currently sustainable. The concept of sustainability is widely underestimated and misused in business and political circles. This is explored and the real meaning of sustainability operationalised. Environmental reporting and sustainability reporting are shown to be essential and practicable. It is argued, however, that there is little or no prospect of widespread, systematic reporting by corporations without a major regulatory initiative.

AB A society that hopes to make wise policy, must communicate clearly. in most countries, that is currently impossible because of incoherences in the key premises disputants hold about how the world works. This article identifies a set of key premises held by leadership groups in most contemporary societies (called the dominant social paradigm-DSP) and contrasts them with different premises on these same matters held by followers of a new environmental paradigm (NEP). The premises underlying the NEP are based on the latest environmental science research; they deeply challenge the premises of the DSP. Societies organized according to these differing paradigms would be deeply different. The societies dominated by the DSP are unsustainable. Nature will be our most powerful teacher as we learn our way to a new, more sustainable paradigm.

AB This article reviews the current debate about new indicators of wealth and progress and how the meaning of 'development' is changing. The goal of sustainable development is to clarify the confusion of means (ie the current obsession with economic growth) with truly evolutionary human development as the ends to be pursued within the ecological tolerances of the planet. The article also reviews the debate about overhauling national accounts as provided for in Agenda 21 and how best to augment such 'scorecards' with additional indicators of overall progress and quality of life. A historical overview of the social indicators movement is combined with a discussion of newer indicators of environmental costs and benefits. This debate is nothing less than a tug-of-war of paradigms, epistemology and methodology.

Immigration and children born to immigrants after arrival in the USA account for 50% of population growth, and this share is projected to increase steadily. Progress in deficit reduction, equity and opportunity for all Americans, and a healthier environment would be well served by temporarily closing the door on immigration while the nation takes stock of its resources and goals.

TI BURDEN-SHARING IN THE TRANSITION TO ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY
SO FUTURES
LA English
DT Article
AB Unbridled consumerism in developed nations, marked by increased use of environmental resources, competes with escalating population growth in developing nations as principal threats to environmental sustainability. The paper examines the issue of sustainability through the I = P X A X T identity, whereby the impact of any population or nation on environmental sources and sinks is a product of its population, its level of affluence, and the damage done by the technologies that support that affluence. Population stabilization is essential in the transition towards sustainability. Likewise, reduced consumption, poverty alleviation and improved management of environmental resources are key in this transition. Finally, technology transfers to low-income nations are vital in reducing environment throughput. In closing, the article outlines priorities for high- and low-income nations alike, pointing out that changes in public perceptions about the concept of development are needed to avoid overshooting the carrying capacity of the Earth.

TI ALTERNATIVE IMAGES OF A SUSTAINABLE FUTURE
SO FUTURES
LA English
DT Article
AB Uncertainty about the changes that will be necessary in the industrial nations to reach a sustainable future can be summarized in terms of three scenarios: (1) 'Continued growth with pollution control'; (2) 'Technology transformation'; and (3) 'Social transformation'. The IPAT equation (Environmental Impact = Population x Affluence x Technology) is used to estimate the feasibility of these scenarios. The analysis suggests several insights. It may be possible to slash environmental impacts to roughly a hundredth of today's level, but this cannot be achieved through conventional approaches to 'growth with pollution control'. A sustainable society is therefore feasible, and, in fact, different routes are possible to different kinds of sustainable futures. Technological progress is a critical success factor, but we need to choose technologies in the light of the kind of society we want to create. Most important, the scenarios suggest that the idea of a sustainable society can be formulated as a positive image of the future capable of inspiring change.

TI A TRANSITION FROM AGRICULTURE TO REGENERATIVE FOOD SYSTEM
SO FUTURES
LA English
DT Article
AB As part of the larger transition to a post-fossil-fuel era, major transformations of industrial agriculture can be expected to occur. This is not only because industrial agriculture is a major source of the unsustainability of industrial societies, but because it is itself unsustainable. Development of the types of regenerative and sustainable food and fibre systems that are needed will involve: (1) a restructuring and decolonizing of industrial agriculture; (2) the maintenance and enhancement of indigenous and traditional food systems; and (3) conceptual and value shifts towards systems approaches, contextual analysis by levels, and the use of health models rather than economic/productivity models as the basic evaluative criteria.

TI INTEGRATING HUMAN-NEEDS INTO OUR VISION OF SUSTAINABILITY
SO FUTURES
LA English
DT Article
AB Sustainability is often treated as something to be attained simply by quantitative assessments, technological improvements, plus whatever behavioural adjustments are needed to 'bring us back to sustainability'. But we place too great an emphasis on the first two, ignoring the reasons for our current 'misbehaviour'. We seldom ask what sorts of behavioural adjustments will 'work': what does it take to satisfy our profound human needs for 'meaning' and 'identity'? This article proposes that some cultural maps serve these needs better than others, and that the competitive, hierarchical 'map' of the dominant 'West' contains behavioural expectations that fail to satisfy these needs. Yet calling anyone's 'map' into question is threatening. We face the perennial dilemma of changing ways of thinking without creating resentment. For this, we can look around the world to places where positive reconstruction is under way, to examples of cooperation and community building, using them as texts for sustainability.

TI THE FUTURE OF WORK IN NORTH-AMERICA - GOOD JOBS, BAD JOBS, BEYOND JOBS
SO FUTURES
LA English
DT Article
AB No democratic society is sustainable that refuses to face and deal with the basic needs of its citizens. Rapid technological change and the globalization of economic activity are restructuring the North American economy, and with it the nature and future of work in the USA and Canada. There is now a clear, though barely articulated question as to whether secure, full-time, adequately waged employment will be available to much of the North American workforce, at least over the next 30-60 years, or whether 'jobless growth', underemployment and 'contingent' employment will become the norm, as happened first in the UK and is increasingly the trend in other industrialized nations. This article offers an overview and evaluation of various policy options for dealing with changing patterns of work in North America. The aim here is to further the search for democratic approaches to these new realities so that North America can maintain both sociopolitical and economic viability, and do so without sacrificing its environmental 'capital'.

TI SUSTAINABILITY AS AN EVOLVING PROCESS

DT Article
AB The growing number of human beings and the industrial lifestyles that they have embraced have combined to overwhelm the natural systems that sustain all life on Earth. Just as the process of natural selection forges a relationship between the constraints of nature and the human genome, a similar process, sociocultural evolution, links nature and a 'sociocultural genome'. The dominant sociocultural genome, the product of industrial evolution, now contains much defective information that must be winnowed out through a long-term social genome project. Sustainability, in this context, is seen as a process of analysing and remedying the deficiencies within the social genome so that equilibrium can be restored between human demands for environmental services and the capability of the environment to provide them. New ways of approaching efficiency are suggested as guidelines for an ongoing process of social transformation leading to development of more sustainable future societies.

This article summarizes these trends, proposes a broad definition of sustainability that includes ecological, environmental, economic, social, ethical, cultural and political dimensions, and lists changes needed to make human activity more sustainable. Also considered are barriers to change, general strategies for change, specific agents and instruments of change, and inherent conflicts between social goals and ecological sustainability. More than a hundred indicators are identified for assessing progress towards ecological and societal sustainability at the global, national and local level. Examples are given of promising initiatives representing progress towards a sustainable future.

ID STRATEGIES
AB While the technologies presently exist to cut carbon emissions dramatically, all sectors of the economy have been slow to adopt them. This lack of success is due in part to the assumptions that change agents have made in designing social marketing campaigns to promote energy conservation. Social marketing campaigns have primarily utilized the 'rational-economic model' of human behaviour. This model of human behaviour is psychologically naive and campaigns based on it have been ineffective. It is possible, however, to design a social marketing campaign based on social psychological principles that has a much higher likelihood of success. This article introduces social psychological variables that are relevant to residential energy conservation and illustrates how the author trains home auditors to utilize them.

TI BUILDING A SUSTAINABLE SPECIES-CIVILIZATION - A CHALLENGE OF CULTURE AND
   CONSCIOUSNESS
SO FUTURES
LA English
DT Article
AB The sustainability crisis is generally viewed in material terms-too much Pollution, not enough resources, and too many people. To build a sustainable future, humanity must reach beneath these physical challenges and confront a deeper crisis in culture and consciousness. Until we come to terms with these non-material challenges to sustainability, we will not be able to make the many material changes required to build an enduring planetary-scale civilization. When we have broken the cultural hypnosis of consumerism and can envision ecological ways of living, and when these modes of living connect with a clear vision of a sustainable future for the Earth that we co-create with other citizens through the continuing conversation of a conscious democracy, and when we can achieve ongoing reconciliation among the diverse members of the human family, then we have a realistic basis for making the technological and material changes required for meeting the challenge of building a sustainable species-civilization.

TI INFOGLUT AND COMPETING PROBLEMS - KEY BARRIERS SUGGESTING A NEW STRATEGY
   FOR SUSTAINABILITY
SO FUTURES
LA English
DT Article
AB Hope for a sustainable society is encouraged by many recent gains in understanding environmental problems and by a wide variety of positive actions undertaken in the past few years. Yet it is uncertain as to whether much, if any, overall net progress is being made. More attention should be given to key barriers, two of which are discussed here. Information overload, or infoglut, brought on by the burgeoning information society, creates a plethora of entertaining and commercial distractions from our many problems-and often makes our problems more difficult to comprehend. Other competing problems, more immediate in their demands and/or more readily grasped, serve to displace interest in pursuing sustainability. These barriers are likely to persist, as suggested by three scenarios: 'False success', 'Mini-success/regress', and 'Evident regress'. Any substantial reduction in the likelihood of these scenarios will require a new strategy for sustainability that copes with infoglut by a major investment in effective outreach, and acknowledges competing problems by linking sustainability to these concerns.

AB The battle to achieve sustainable growth in agricultural production must be fought out along a broad multidisciplinary front. Poverty undermines health and degrades the environment. Environmental problems link the agricultural and health research agendas. Environmental changes underway at the global level will require changes in food production and health practices. Effective bridges must be built between the 'island empires' of the agricultural, environmental, and health sciences. More effective linkages must be built between the suppliers of knowledge and technology and the users.

AB Sustainability is a complex and sometimes fragile condition, as shown by this case study from Zambia's North-Western Province. The long-term evolution of a cassava-based agricultural system provided enough staple food for a rapidly growing population of immigrants and refugees, but a mealybug invasion in 1985-1989 destroyed much of the cassava and triggered a famine for many people. The famine, caused by the interaction of ecological, political, and economic factors, demonstrated that locally self-sufficient sustainability was an illusion. Affected villagers tried to cope by growing maize and buying maize imported from other regions. But if they used only local resources, many people could not protect themselves, and they suffered severe food shortages. By 1989, the mealybug had apparently been controlled by a biological control program (as much political as technical) that coordinated institutions on three continents. This case demonstrates that: (1) resourceful villagers are an essential dynamic element in evolving food-production systems and in coping with famine; (2) localities are ecologically, politically, and economically incorporated and vulnerable, rather than being isolated and self-sufficient; and (3) biodiversity is essential in a world of not-yet-recognized pests (and diseases).

TI HOW GREEN PRODUCTION MIGHT SUSTAIN THE WORLD
SO ILLAHEE-JOURNAL FOR THE NORTHWEST ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB A 1990 MIT study of the world auto industry celebrated lean production (producing more product of higher quality with fewer people in less time) as the management paradigm used with great success by many Japanese companies over the past three decades to gain a decisive competitive advantage over western competitors (Womack et al. 1990). Evidence is accumulating, however, that the end of the lean production era may be near, and a new strategic paradigm-''green production''-may be taking shape. Indeed, green business strategies based on the principle of environmental sustainability may constitute a key competitive advantage in the coming decades.

AB The entrepreneurial view of the firm stresses the need for a more insightful understanding of business leaders within sets of SMEs. Here, competitiveness emerges as a network-embedded capability and the coordination among firms, maximizing firm-specific competencies, represents a strategic leverage in accomplishing and maintaining a sustainable competitive advantage. When the goal is not only greater efficiency in terms of the lowest cost but innovation in terms of how to improve productive performance by changing the way in which it is undertaken, a critical issue becomes the entrepreneur's ability to create, manage, and recombine the set of relationships with external suppliers. The ability to glue external expertise and capabilities in an original and unique way is considered the key factor in pursuing innovative performance.
   As orchestrators of inter-firm linkages, entrepreneurs relying on personal networks and prior relationships are able to identify possible sources of knowledge. As coordinators of such innovative ties, they combine a wide set of diverse competencies not only to overcome size constraints through development cost reduction, but also to recoup ideas and creativity for the realization of more complex typologies of innovation. These elements reduce the level of uncertainty, while enhancing early cooperation between firms.
   Because the entrepreneur is supposed to be able to manage a higher nwnber of ''innovative poles'', which can be better managed thanks to trust and reputation developed in prior relationships, the different management topology could be associated with a different level of supplier contribution to the development of new products.
   This paper provides insights into the role of suppliers in the new product development process, and explores the role of the entrepreneur in promoting and managing a wide set of external, innovative ties. Attention is focused on 103 small- and medium-sized firms located within two Italian industrial networks where interdependencies are unusually large and complex.
   With respect to the first aim, the empirical analysis confirmed SME's structural recourse to suppliers. More important, the contribution of such resources is not necessarily limited to cost reductions and marginal improvements. Although incremental contributions certainly exist and are relevant, more complex relationships largely focused on joint design and development emerge as important patterns in buyer-supplier interaction.
   With respect to the second aim, an entrepreneurial explanation of SMEs' innovative performance is advanced. In a competitive environment where the actors are not atomistic, but exist within systems of actors, the relational capability could represent for entrepreneurial firms the way to gain a sustainable competitive advantage. We found entrepreneurs who, exploiting basic experiences, seek new combinations among the various inter-firm ties, relying upon such linkages as a vehicle for transferring and combining their organizationally embedded learning capability. Our findings showed that (1) when the entrepreneur is leading and managing the business, more suppliers are involved in the development of new products, and (2) the type of contribution given by suppliers differs by management typology. More precisely, the incremental type of contribution is dominant whenever professional management is present, while the relevance of architectural and radical topologies increase when the entrepreneur is present.
   On a broader level, the findings suggest further studies to address the question of how internally determined, rather than spontaneous, is the evolution toward a network structure in sets of SMEs similar to those studied. We showed that the number and the quality of inter-firm relationships cannot be explained merely by environment-specific factors.

TI THE DILEMMA OF PRISONERS - CHOICE DURING STALIN GREAT TERROR, 1936-38
SO JOURNAL OF CONFLICT RESOLUTION
LA English
DT Article
AB Stalin's Great Terror was one of history's most massive political purges. In its form, the Terror resembled a one-shot, n-person prisoner's dilemma game. Although the Terror could not have been sustained if prisoners cooperated, most prisoners defected against one another, as the model would predict. Yet the record of the Terror also demonstrated that in a mass purge there exists a wider strategy set than that of the prisoner's dilemma game. Using an illustrative case and a generalized model of purges, it is shown that if prisoners implicate their interrogators and play what is called a ''transformation'' strategy, they raise the cost to the authority of conducting the purge. In fact, the authority has no consistent best response to the transformation, and the purge should not be sustainable for long thereafter. The Great Terror was apparently limited by employment of this transformation. Limitations on the formation and use of such a strategy are also considered.

TI AGROFORESTRY DRAINAGE MANAGEMENT MODEL .2. FIELD WATER-FLOW
SO JOURNAL OF IRRIGATION AND DRAINAGE ENGINEERING
LA English
DT Article
AB Part I of this paper presented a two-dimensional dynamic finite-element model of fluid flow and solute transport in root-soil profiles with different root-uptake mechanisms. Field data collected in 1989 were used to validate the model. The present paper presents further validation and application of the numerical solution of Richard's equation against the field data collected from an agroforestry demonstration site for sustainable agriculture during the 1990 irrigation season. The site is tile-drained, isolated from the surroundings by interceptor drains, planted with six-year-old Eucalyptus camaldulensis (red gum) over an area of shallow ground water, and irrigated by a furrow system. Computer simulations were made for 220 dayas to evaluate the irrigation management. In comparing the measured with the numerically predicted volumetric moisture content in the soil profile and pressure head, the values were well correlated in space and time (r = 0.82-0.94). Therefore, the model can be used to provide management guidelines for subsurface drainage in agroforestry systems.

AB This study was conducted to compare various orchard groundcover management systems (GMSs)-including a crownvetch ''living mulch'' (CNVCH), close-mowed (MWSOD) and chemically growth-regulated (GRSOD) sodgrasses, pre-emergence (NDPQT) and tw,vo widths of post-emergence (GLY1.5 and GLY2.5) herbicides, hay-straw mulch (STMCH), and monthly rototillage (tilled)during the first 6 years in a newly established apple (Malus domestica Borkh.) planting. Mean soil water potential at 5 to 35 cm deep varied substantially among treatments each summer, and treatment x year interactions were observed. During most growing seasons from 1986 to 1991, soil water availability trends were STMCH > NDPQT > GLY2.5 > GLY1.5 > tilled > GRSOD > MWSOD > CNVCH. Soil organic matter content increased under STMCH, CNVCH, and MWSOD and decreased under NDPQT and tilled treatments. Water infiltration and saturated hydraulic conductivity after 4 years were lower under NDPQT and tilled, and soil under STMCH and GRSOD retained more water per unit volume at applied pressures approximating field water capacity. Mid-summer soil temperatures at 5 cm deep were highest (25 to 28C) in tilled and NDPQT plots, intermediate (22 to 24C) under GRSOD, and lowest (16 to 20C) under CNVCH and STMCH. These observations indicate that long-term soil fertility and orchard productivity may be diminished under pre-emergence herbicides and mechanical cultivation in comparison with certain other GMSs.

ID POPULATION-MODEL
AB The problem addressed is that of finding the harvesting policy that will maximize the yield and maintain a given population in a steady state. It is assumed that the equations describing the evolution of the population and the yield are linear but that the equation describing reproduction is nonlinear (density dependence). The optimal strategy consists in harvesting two age classes only: a younger age class is partially harvested, and an older age class is completely harvested as in the linear case. This problem is a particular case of a general abstract maximization problem in which, for example, nonlinear mortality or nonlinear value of the individuals can also be introduced. The appropriate compactness for this problem is obtained from the fact that maximizing sequences are decreasing.

AB Two experiments were conducted to determine the effect of protein and energy intake on (1) protein deposition and nitrogen utilization, (2) partitioning of body protein between edible products and offal, and (3) weights of metabolically active organs. In the first experiment, 90 female pigs were fed at two energy intake levels and 15 protein intakes from 20 to 45 kg. Protein deposition increased linearly with increasing protein intake until a plateau in deposition was reached at 106 and 126 g d-1 at the low and high energy level respectively. Marginal efficiency of utilization of ileal digestible lysine was 0.74 for the two energy levels. In a second experiment, 24 female pigs were fed a protein- adequate diet at six levels of energy intake ranging from 1.7 times maintenance to ad libitum. Protein deposition increased from 70 to 172 g d-1 with increasing feed intake. The proportion of body protein deposited as lean tissue decreased from 0.62 to 0.55 with increasing feed intake. Consequences of these results for a more sustainable animal production are discussed.

AB The effects of selecting male parent breeding stock for efficiency of feed utilization (EFU) were compared with those of selection for body weight (BW). Selection for EFU resulted in an improved feed and protein efficiency at a certain fixed body weight when compared with BW selection. Correlated effects of selection for EFU (slaughter yield, viability, parent stock fertility) were favourable. For sustainable poultry meat production, losses in the production cycle through manure, slaughter offals and mortality should be minimized. The results of experimental selection indicate that selection for EFU may be a useful tool towards decreasing losses in poultry meat production.

DE SUSTAINABILITY; SMALL RUMINANT PRODUCTION; BENIN
AB Since 1986 the RAMR project (Recherche Appliquee en Milieu Reel) has conducted on-farm research on the Adja Plateau in Mono Province (South Benin). In this article, technical and socio-economic aspects of small ruminant production systems on the Adja Plateau are described. Monitoring of small ruminant flocks showed that about 25% of the small ruminants were sold annually. Export of nutrients as a result of the sale of animals (85 g N. 23 g P. 12 g K and 46 g Ca per hectare) was low compared with export through crop production. In-depth studies at village level showed that farmers mainly collected oil palm leaves, constituting 75% of the small ruminant rations, to feed their animals. Nutrients in collected oil palm leaves represented a substantial fraction (about 10%) of available nutrients in fields under oil palm. Proposals for future research on small ruminant production systems have to contribute to the sustainability of farming systems. Emphasis will be put on animal feeding and feed production integrating small ruminant and crop production.

AB Fisheries development of Lake Tana, Ethiopia, urgently requires the identification of its unknown units of fish stock. A diversity of large barbs (up to 80 cm SL), lumped into one species Barbus intermedius and contributing over 35% of the annual catch, consists of at least thirteen distinct morphotypes (Nagelkerke et al., 1994), possibly species. Their abilities and limitations in food selection and feeding can be predicted from structural specializations following functional morphological methods. Using ecomorphology, a spectrum of ecotypes ranging from detritivores to piscivores is predicted. Such hypotheses may be tested by analysing these fishes' intestinal contents. From knowledge of available food organisms and the trophic segregation thus found among barbs and sympatric species, a preliminary food web has been constructed. This food web, together with quantitative studies on population dynamics and energy flow, provides a biological framework for rational fisheries management aiming at sustainable production and protection of biodiversity.

LA English
DT Article
AB Acid soils cover more than a third of Subsaharan Africa. Due to their poor fertility, aluminium toxicity and fragile structure, their agricultural productivity is low and declines rapidly under cultivation. The sustainable use of these soils requires adequate inputs of nutrients and amendments in the form of fertilizers, organic matter and sometimes lime. In view of population pressure the gradual intensification of the cultivation of acid soils, often the last reserve of underutilized land, is essential for Africa's economic growth, Sustainable increases in productivity can only be achieved by a gradual transformation of traditional farming systems through development pathways that take full account of socioeconomic and agroecological diversity.

TI NEW ROADS TO CROP PROTECTION AGAINST VIRUSES
SO OUTLOOK ON AGRICULTURE
LA English
DT Article
ID RESISTANCE; PLANTS
AB Farmers and growers, already under pressure to produce food under tighter constraints, face the omnipresent threat of new pests and diseases caused by new strains of fungal, bacterial or viral pathogens or their vectors, such as insects. The whitefly Bemisia tabaci is an example of such a threat in Europe (Bedford and Markham, 1993). It is feared that over-use of pesticides, fertilizers and growth regulators could create major environmental problems, but to survive without them will require other strategies, broadly referred to as 'sustainable agriculture. Traditionally, durable disease resistance has required ingenious breeding programmes to introduce natural resistance genes from crop-related wild species into crops. However, we can now exploit the power, flexibility and specificity of recombinant DNA techniques (genetic manipulation) either to identify existing natural resistance genes and transfer them between unrelated crop species, or to create new and more effective resistance genes against one or more pathogens or pests. The rationale behind many of these 'designer genes' has arisen from empirical field observations or from our deeper understanding of molecular and genetical aspects of the natural life-cycle of the pathogen.

DT Article
AB The research was designed to determine whether all households in a community are equally affected by famine, and what households themselves do to ward off starvation. information on production, income, and food consumption is disaggregated by agroecological zone (highland and lowland), and by socioeconomic strata This kind of information improves our understanding of why the poor are more vulnerable than the less poor to drought and famine, and why relief and development interventions must target them more effectively. A sound famine prevention strategy must allocate resources so as to support sustainable economic growth and welfare improvement at national and local levels. Public interventions against famine must therefore strengthen, not supplant, the coping mechanisms of vulnerable households. In a world of limited public resources for crisis intervention, an understanding of how vulnerable households can be reintegrated into a productive development process is crucial to improving policies and the sustainability of investments for future economic growth.

TI PERFORMANCE GUARANTEE SCHEMES IN THE MINERALS INDUSTRY FOR SUSTAINABLE
   DEVELOPMENT - THE CASE OF THAILAND
SO RESOURCES POLICY
LA English
DT Article
AB Achieving sustainable development within Thailand and other developing nations requires a combination of appropriate minerals policies, environmental policies, legislation, administration, enforcement and organization in order to achieve a balance between mineral development and environmental concerns. Central to achieving these objectives is the design and implementation of an efficient and equitable mining reclamation procedure based on the principle of the 'polluter pays'. It is proposed that a cornerstone of this procedure is a land reclamation bonding process which minimizes the disincentive to invest while maximizing the incentive to protect the environment. A reclamation bond allows the miner (or polluter) to receive a refund of their money for reclamation and thereby is an incentive for the miner to develop a proper plan of operations and reclamation in order to maximize their refundable money - often accomplished by the adoption and utilization of advanced technologies. Between implementing command and control regulations or establishing a bonding system, a bonding system is by far preferable for Thailand and other developing nations on the Asia-Pacific region.

DT Article
AB The Marine Conservation Project for San Salvador Island, Zambales (MCPSS) was initiated in 1988. The primary goal was to organize a community-based marine resource management scheme for the island community. This paper provides an overview of the MCPSS, a profile of the site, the means of implementation, and results from the first 2 years of work with lessons for similar programs. The MCPSS has succeeded in establishing a municipal marine park with a 125-ha nonfishing sanctuary and a traditional fishing reserve surrounding the island. These zones have been established through a process of community education, organization, and participatory decision making which resulted in a municipal ordinance and community support. The MCPSS, although encountering various obstacles of local island politics, technical deficiencies, and limited funding, has shown that it is possible to engage island communities of fisherfolk in coral reef protection and management that may be sustainable. It has also been shown that the use of destructive fishing techniques such as blast, sodium cyanide, and others particular to the site can be stopped by community action.

AB Sustainable use of soil resources can be assessed from management-induced changes in soil properties from long-term experiments. Such data are scanty, especially with regard to changes in soil physical properties. Therefore, soil physical and chemical analyses were performed 28 yr after initiating a crop rotation-tillage experiment on a well-drained Wooster silt loam soil (fine-loamy, mixed, mesic Typic Fragiudalf) at Wooster, OH. All combinations of three rotations (continuous corn [CC; Zea mays L.]; corn and soybean [Glycine mar (L.) Merr.] in a 2-yr rotation [CS]; and corn, oat [Avena sativa L.], and meadow in a 3-yr rotation [COM]) and of three tillage treatments (no-tillage [NT]; chisel plow [CP]; and moldboard plow [MP]) were maintained on the same plots for the entire length of study. All crops were grown every year. Soil properties studied for the 0- to 15-cm layer were:  structural stability of aggregates, bulk density, total porosity, penetration resistance, organic C, pH, cation-exchange capacity (CEC), and exchangeable K, Ca and Mg. Mean bulk densities measured prior to tillage treatments and planting were 1.18, 1.24, and 1.28 Mg m-3 for CC, CS, and COM rotations, respectively. The lowest bulk density was observed for the CC-NT combination. Total aggregation in CS was 26.9% greater than CC and 111.2% greater than COM. With tillage treatments, aggregation was in the order of NT>CP>MP. Rotation treatments had no effect on aggregate size. In accord with bulk density, the relative magnitude of organic C content was 100, 85, and 63 for CC, CS, and COM rotations, respectively.

AB Multiple readings and recaptures of marked fish were used to estimate precision and accuracy of age estimates from cross sections of pectoral fin rays of white sturgeons Acipenser transmontanus collected in impoundments of the Columbia River. Ages ranged from 2 to 104 years but only 37% of samples were assigned the same age by two readers. Percent error in multiple readings averaged 5.9% and the coefficient of variation averaged 7.8%, indicating low precision relative to reported values for other species. An injected dosage of 25 mg oxytetracycline (OTC) per kilogram of body weight marked 216 of 220 fin ray samples for validation and did not reduce white sturgeon growth. Accuracy was improved by identifying the period of annulus formation (May-June) from the position of an OTC mark relative to translucent zones in fin ray cross sections. However, age was underestimated from counts of translucent zones formed after injection with OTC, especially for slow-growing and large fish. We conclude that age estimates were not precise or accurate and recommend development of alternative methods for aging white sturgeons to supplement the fin ray method. We urge that aging data based on the fin ray method be applied cautiously. Imprecision limits interpretation of age frequencies and relative year-class strengths. Inaccuracy results in overestimation of growth, mortality, and sustainable exploitation rates.

TI SUSTAINABLE GRAZING MANAGEMENT - GRAZIERS PERSPECTIVES AND IMPLICATIONS
   FOR PASTURE MANAGEMENT IN THE MARANOA REGION, SOUTH QUEENSLAND
SO TROPICAL GRASSLANDS
LA English
DT Article
AB Evidence of land degradation in Australia's pastoral areas suggests that some current grazing management systems are not sustainable. In the Maranoa region of southern Queensland there were no guidelines for sustainable pasture utilisation, but local landholders possessed a wealth of knowledge about management practices gained from years of practical experience. The Local Consensus Data technique was adapted to document local graziers' recommended management practices for profitable production with minimal degradation of the natural resources.
   Groups of experienced graziers defined best pasture management practices, stocking rates and living areas necessary to achieve sustainable land use for the 5 pasture land types in the Maranoa. Many graziers run more livestock than the recommended levels of stocking. Of major concern are the number of properties smaller than the area considered necessary to apply sustainable management practices and the proportion of properties with stocking rates above those recommended. These constraints limit the adoption of technologies and are the most important determinants of sustainable land use in the Maranoa.

TI TOWARD SUSTAINABILITY IN LOWER MEKONG RIVER BASIN DEVELOPMENT
SO WATER INTERNATIONAL
LA English
DT Article
AB The Lower Mekong River Basin of Southeast Asia is at an important juncture in its path of development. The natural resource base upon which future development will depend is being undermined by deforestation. Poverty in many places in the basin provides few options other than continued use of the forests for fuelwood, slash-and burn agriculture, as well as commercial uses. The Mekong River holds great potential in helping meet the region's energy and food requirements, especially given the low level of water development in the basin. It is generally accepted that any development program must account for a range of socioeconomic, cultural, and environmental factors. The record of water development projects in the basin holds clues about their strengths and weaknesses in promoting environmentally and socially-responsible development. Reviewing past work also shows how the emphasis of water development programs has changed during the past two to three decades. A review of the contemporary work program of the Mekong Committee and Secretariat reflects the extent to which they have learned such lessons and, in turn, their potential for contributing to more sustainable development in the basin.

AB The embedding optimization modeling approach is adapted to aid sustainable groundwater quantity and quality management of complex nonlinear multilayer aquifers. Implicit block-centered finite difference approximations of the quasi three-dimensional unsteady flow equation and Galerkin finite element approximations of the two-dimensional advection-dispersion transport equation are embedded directly as constraints in the model. Also used are nonlinear constraints describing river-aquifer interflow, evapotranspiration, and vertical flow reduction due to unconfinement. These circumvent use of large numbers of integer variables. The use of both linear and nonlinear formulations in a cyclical manner reduces execution time and improves confidence in solution optimality. The methodology is demonstrated for Salt Lake valley where groundwater quantity and quality management are needed, the proportion of pumping cells and cells needing head constraint is large, and many flows are described by discrete nonlinear or piecewise linear functions.

AB Assuming a model tip (Si4O10H10) as a reasonable representation of the surface of a Si3N4 cantilever stylus having a hydrogen-terminated asperity and a broader load-bearing base, we investigate the interaction of an atomic force microscope (AFM) with an alkali halide crystal by quantum chemical methods. Structural relaxation of the sample during engagement is allowed, and defect formation is investigated. Force curves above cation and anion positions are calculated, determining maximum sustainable loads and indicating a basis for atomic contrast. Experiments using a Si3N4 cantilever for AFM imaging of 12 alkali halide and alkaline earth fluoride crystals in air and desiccated helium are reported, in the widest AFM survey of such materials to date. Adsorbed water is shown to significantly enhance the observation of atomic periodicity on ionic halide samples, and rapid surface diffusion on alkali halide crystals is illustrated as it affects prospects for defect investigations. Observations of step edges and point-defect candidates at atomic scale are reported. The theoretical and experimental results are discussed together in the effort to provide a quantum-mechanical model for observations of alkali halide samples at atomic resolution, and to examine a possible basis for atomic resolution in the presence of long-range attractive forces.

TI THE ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN UNION IN GLOBAL CHANGE RESEARCH
SO AMBIO
LA English
DT Article
AB The achievement of a deductive understanding of global change is now recognized to be one of the most important and difficult scientific challenges ever posed. The evolving commitments and responsibilities of the European Commission towards the Earth's environment have led to comprehensive actions and plans regarding global change research. One of the priority objectives of the environment policy of the European Union-based on the concept of sustainable development-is to preserve, protect and improve the quality of the environment. The investigation of identified environmental issues is supported, on a shared-cost basis, at a wide variety of academic and research organizations within EU member states. In addition, there is a strong emphasis on interdisciplinary environmental research within the European Commission's own establishment, the Joint Research Centre, and international cooperation, both within and outside Europe, is actively encouraged. Participation in global change programs is a specific component of the current Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development; plans for the further development of work in this area have been prepared. These proposals include the development of a European Network for Research in Global Change (ENRICH), building on the capabilities and facilities of existing institutions, and working closely with international global change research initiatives, such as the International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme (IGBP), the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP) and the Human Dimensions of Global Environmental Change Programme (HDP).

TI LESSONS FROM THE PAST - FORESTS AND BIODIVERSITY
SO BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION
LA English
DT Article
DE BIODIVERSITY; HISTORY; FORESTS; CONSERVATION; CYCLES
AB The biodiversity of forested regions today is the result of complex historical interactions among physical, biological, and social forces over time, often heavily influenced by cycles of various sorts. Fire, agriculture technology, and trade have been particularly powerful human influences on forests. Virtually all of our planet's forests have been affected by the cultural patterns of human use, and the resulting landscape is an ever-changing mosaic of unmanaged and managed patches of habitat, which vary in size, shape, and arrangement. Because chance factors, human influence and small climatic variation can cause very substantial changes in vegetation, the biodiversity for any given landscape will vary substantially over any significant time period - and no one variant is necessarily more 'natural' than the others. This implies that biodiversity conservation efforts may need to give greater attention to ecosystem processes than to ecosystem products. A review of historical evidence shows that past civilizations have tended to over-exploit their forests, and that such abuse of important resources has been a significant factor in the decline of the over-exploiting society. It appears that the best way to maintain biodiversity in forest ecosystems in the late 20th Century is through a combination of strictly protected areas (carefully selected on the basis of clearly defined criteria), multiple-use areas managed by local people, natural forests extensively managed for sustainable yield of logs and other products and services, and forest plantations intensively managed for the wood products needed by society. This diversity of approaches and uses will provide humanity with the widest range of options, the greatest diversity of opportunities, for adapting to the cyclical changes which are certain to continue.

AB Environment Audit has been well recognised as an effective management tool for industry in developed nations.  Such audit is in wide practice and usage though different approaches are being followed to carry out this study there.  From the experience of developed countries, as well as the increasing awareness towards environmental protection, the developing countries are also in the process of implementing this tool with the objective of achieving ecologically friendly production and environmentally sustainable development.  This paper has been prepared with a view to emphasise various issues involved with the subject such as the need, the benefits etc.  Further the paper elaborates on the methodology to be followed to carry out the audit.  It has been emphasised in the paper that the environment, rather industry should derive benefits from it to become not only ecologically friendly but also more competitive.  The paper has also discussed the role of a consultant in carrying out such study.  Finally, the potential and scope of environment audit in our country has been covered briefly.

AB Nothing is as effective as examples in conveying the usefulness of ecological economics to present and potential practitioners. I suggest ten example areas or problems where ecological economics can and should make specific analyses and recommendations. One example: a resolution, or creative rephrasing, of the dichotomous views of Japan that contrast its economic successes with its precarious dependence on imported renewable and nonrenewable resources and its high population density. For background, I also briefly review nine efforts to date in the general direction of total environmental cost.

DE COSTA-RICA; FOREST MANAGEMENT; POLICY; SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
AB The Osa Peninsula and its Golfo Dulce Forest Reserve, which contain the largest remaining forest on Costa Rica's Pacific coast, currently experience great pressures from smallholders clearing for agriculture and gold mining. The paper compares the sustainability of Costa Rica's current model of extensive government intervention on the Osa, combined with natural forest management, to a proposed relatively free-market approach also promoting the same package of technological change and industrial promotion. Concluding that the current approach fails to promote sustainable development, the authors propose an alternative free-market-oriented approach that, while not without its own risk, represents a much more feasible and, therefore, potentially more successful approach to the country's deforestation problems. The authors point out that it might not be possible to provide a sustainable income on the Osa for all the residents of the peninsula and to maintain secondary forest cover at the same time. Policymakers must be clear about what they want to sustain, who receives the benefits, and who bears the costs of their sustainable development efforts.

DT Article
DE COSTA-RICA; LAND INTENSIFICATION; LINEAR PROGRAMMING; MILK
ID POPULATION PRESSURE; THIRD-WORLD; DEGRADATION; POLICY
AB This research examines trade-offs between costs and production practices of intensification of milk production in highland Costa Rica. We identify bottlenecks to intensification and how they affect choices between more and less sustainable practices. To this end, we constructed a linear programming model of a highland dairy farm to simulate farmer decision making. Six models for three farm sizes are constructed from data collected via a 1990 survey and published material on nutritional requirements and forage yields. Significant economic and environmental trade-offs are found in response to low labor productivity or availability, and tow protein content of forages. Costs are the focus on the economic side while on the environmental side, intensification, incentives to deforest, use of cut feed versus more erosive pasture, and manure versus chemical fertilization are examined. Land intensification is not economic unless researchers can provide labor-saving devices appropriate for small farms or improve protein content of forages. Another finding is that dry season milk production costs farmers in the region 1.1 to 3.4 colones more per kg than rainy season production (3.3% to 13.6%, depending upon the price received for milk). Expanding storage facilities would cost the processing plant less than paying farmers a two colones premium for year-round production. Since the value of land for producing milk exceeds clearing costs in nearly all models, compliance with land use controls to improve environmental sustainability is unlikely. Finally, targeting input and credit subsidies to inputs which improve labor productivity and encourage environmentally sustainable practices would mitigate economic and environmental trade-offs in milk production.

TI COST-EFFICIENT EMISSION REDUCTION STRATEGIES FOR LITHUANIA
SO ENERGY
LA English
DT Article
AB As a consequence of the political changes in 1991, Lithuania is currently facing the challenge of developing an efficient energy supply system. Owing to the outdated energy system and the lack of domestic energy resources, Lithuania has to find the pathway for a sustainable economic development. However, such a strategy should be developed with consideration for the requirements of environmental protection complying with international protocols. Therefore, the energy-flow optimization model extended by environmental modules (EFOM-ENV) of the Commission of the European Communities has been adapted and applied to Lithuania. This has been carried out in a joint co-operation project of the Institute for Industrial Production and the Lithuanian Energy Institute, financed by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG). To study the effects of budget limitations during the transitory period from a centrally planned to a market economy, new constraints concerning investments and fuel imports in hard currency have been introduced. Among others, these effects have been analyzed with regard to their impacts on the development of cost-efficient emission reduction strategies.

DE CO2 EMISSIONS; NORMATIVE SCENARIO
AB In dealing with 'sustainable use of energy', this paper will discuss the issue of energy and environment, including the four main measures (energy saving and efficiency; switching to natural gas; CO2 recovery; development of alternative energy sources) to reduce the CO2 emissions resulting from energy use; review the energy and development issue, including the striking differences in terms of energy use (relative use of energy sources; energy use per capita; and energy intensity) between and within the main regions of the world; show with a normative energy (NE) scenario for 1990-2050 that global CO2 reduction of 50% could be reached by simultaneously applying the four main measures with differentiated responsibilities for industrialized and developing countries; compare this NE scenario with a targeted efficiency (TE) scenario for 2050; and, finally, discuss a global umbrella to promote regional energy arrangements that will be efficient, equitable and sustainable and draw some conclusions on the governance of energy as an area of global concern.

TI SUSTAINABLE COLLUSION IN OLIGOPOLY WITH FREE ENTRY
SO EUROPEAN ECONOMIC REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
AB We investigate the stability of collusion in a market where firms cannot prevent entry. In a symmetric, homogeneous oligopoly there are collusive long-run equilibria under which the colluders obtain positive economic rents while they do not prevent entry of firms up to a maximum equal to the largest number of firms sustainable at a single shot equilibrium. The collusion is not generous to new entrants; their profits are a little better than those associated with the discounted single shot equilibrium. Eventually entrants obtain profits equal to the incumbent firms. We extend the results to asymmetric, differentiated oligopolies.

AB There is increasing recognition that natural disturbance is a dominant force in forest development. This paper sets out to review natural disturbances and their effects in forests in Australia, and to determine whether or not the effects of management of forests for all of their benefits can be contained within the known effects of natural disturbance.
   The history and evolutionary significance of fire in Australia is reviewed, and the differing fire ecologies of two representative species, Eucalyptus regnans in the south-east (which is killed by fire and regenerates prolifically from seed after fire) and Eucalyptus marginata in the south-west (which survives all but the most severe fires and regenerates from both shoots and seeds) are outlined. The development of E. regnans following stand-replacing fire can be defined as highly resilient (returning quickly to the pre-disturbance state) and that of E. marginata as resistant (difficult to move from the pre-disturbance state).
   The topic of forest management in relation to disturbance is discussed within the context of forests of mountain ash (Eucalyptus regnans), the world's tallest flowering plant, in south-eastern Australia. These forests in their natural state are essentially even-aged or at the most include two to three age-classes, the result of regeneration following stand-replacing bushfires. They produce timber of high value, and cuffent land planning and management prescriptions allow for about one-half of the forest area to be managed for timber production on a sustained-yield basis. The silvicultural system is clear-felling, followed by burning to give stand-replacing conditions. Mountain ash regenerating from this system is one of the fastest growing tree species in the world and at its best has a volume increment of 50 m3 ha-1 year-1 and net primary production of 35 t ha-1 year-1 over the first 10 years. There is no definitive evidence of a loss of diversity of plant species in timber production forests. The greatest problem is to manage land for timber production and for the diversity of fauna which depend on nesting hollows in large dead or living trees. However, all of the species found in older forests can be found in regrowth forests which have been burned or logged over the past 50 years and which include large dead or living trees with nesting hollows.
   Them has been speculation that harvesting mountain ash forests by clearfelling and regenerating them following slash-burning will lead to a loss of nutrients and a consequent loss of productivity. Nutrient cycling in mountain ash is shown to be resilient to disturbance. Rapid uptake of nutrients by the regenerating forest, immobilization of nutrients by microorganisms, and increased rates of nitrogen fixation are processes which lead to the conservation of nutrients following stand-replacing fires. There is no evidence of productivity decline following bushfire or timber harvesting.
   Another concern about forest harvesting is that there will be a reduction in carbon storage. The break-even point for E. regnans plantations yielding short-lived products (e.g. paper) is 3 7 years and for E. regnans forests grown for sawn timber, 60 years. Harvesting forests on rotations of 80-120 years will therefore result in an increase in carbon storage; however, it would take several rotations to restore carbon storage equivalent to that of old-age forest.
   Much of the literature on disturbance illustrates the difficulties of dealing with traditional and sometimes deeply entrenched concepts of how plant communities develop and the nature of the end-state of development. Development of mountain ash forest fits within Egler's model of initial floristic composition; there is no stable and self-perpetuating end-point, the climax is probably no more than the state where species change is immeasurably slow, and maximum diversity and productivity are maintained by random periodic disturbance. Does this set of conclusions provide the basis for management of the forest? The management of diversity in heath is discussed as an example; the issue is less contentious than in forests since no commercial product is harvested. Coastal heath on soils of poor fertility in Victoria also follows the model of initial floristic composition; diversity and productivity are maintained by fire, decreasing markedly within 20-50 years of disturbance. Management can use fire to maintain a mosaic of regenerated heathland to accommodate the range of responses of fauna and flora to disturbance, thereby maximizing diversity.
   The solution of maintaining diversity through an intermediate level of disturbance is well-established in the ecological literature; through disturbance, an equilibrium is never reached and higher diversity is maintained. In the managed forest, management dictates the disturbance regime (frequency, size and intensity) which must be fined to the attributes, or life histories, of the organisms to be managed.
   This paper presents the view that timber harvesting in Australian forests is ecologically sustainable and that the effects of management can be contained within the framework of those caused by natural disturbance. Given that each plot in the forest differs from all other plots and that none is at steady state, a solution for the management of diversity is to use the whole of the forest estate (parks, stream reserves, catchment reserves, old-age forest, forests of different ages resulting from past fires and logging) so that diversity of the estate, rather than diversity of each plot, is maximized.

AB Methods are presented to predict some of the effects of management on the tree size diversity of forest stands, measured with the Shannon-Wiener index applied to diameters. The diameter distribution is an indicator of stand structure and a determinant of biological diversity. The methods, which involve linear and nonlinear programming models of managed stands, were applied to northern hardwood forests. The attendant stand growth model was calibrated and validated with remeasured plots. The results suggest that, in this specific case, a natural, undisturbed stand would reach the highest possible sustainable diversity of tree size. Any intervention would decrease that diversity. In particular, economic harvesting policies would reduce tree size diversity by 10 to 20%, depending on the length of the cutting cycle. However, economics and diversity did not necessarily conflict. With the data and model used here, lengthening the cutting cycle up to 30 yr led to higher tree size diversity, while it also increased the soil rent of a stand by decreasing the present value of the cost of re-entry. Similarly, for a given cutting cycle, the soil rent increased with tree size diversity up to about 90% of the sustainable maximum, but decreased sharply thereafter. Real internal rates of return of 2 to 4% could be earned with stands that had either mediocre or very good levels of diversity. Likewise, starting from the same initial stand state, proper choice of a cutting guide could lead to much higher levels of tree size diversity, without decreasing forest value.

TI PRODUCTIVITY AND YIELD STABILITY IN CASSAVA (MANIHOT-ESCULENTA) AS
   AFFECTED BY STAKE WEIGHT
SO JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
AB The influence of weight of stakes planted on subsequent cassava yields and the stability of yields was investigated in a 4-year study (1986-90) in Nigeria using two cultivars (TMS30572 and TMS91934). Harvest yields were dependent on the weight of stakes planted and an optimum weight of 875 kg/ha for both cultivars was established; which corresponds to an average stake weight of 88 g. Cultivar TMS30572 consistently outyielded TMS9]934 (P < 0.05). Tissue analysis of 25 cm long stakes from the mainstem and from the primary and secondary branches of both cassava cultivars showed differences in the amounts of food reserves stored in the stakes. More carbohydrate was found in each of the three stakes of the mainstem than in the stakes from the primary and secondary branches of both cultivars. The yields of each cultivar for the three growing seasons did not vary significantly, which suggests that sustainable high root yield appears to be achievable and is greatly aided by the appropriate management of the stakes.

AB The northern prairie landscape has changed dramatically within the past century as a result of settlement by Europeans. Natural ecosystems have been disrupted and wildlife populations greatly altered. Natural resource agencies control only limited areas within the landscape, which they cannot manage independently of privately owned lands. Wildlife managers need first to set quantifiable objectives, based on the survival, reproduction, and distribution of wildlife. Second, they need to build public support and partnerships for meeting those objectives. Finally, they need to evaluate progress not only with respect to attitudes of the public and partners but, more importantly, of the wildlife response. This paper describes some useful tools for managing information at all phases of this process. We follow by discussing management options at a landscape level. Examples are given that involve agency lands as well as private lands, managed for biological resources and diversity as well as economic sustainability.

AB The urgent need to integrate evolutionary theory into applied habitat management and land-use planning endeavors has become a focus for much conservation and biodiversity related research. Only recently have scientists begun to incorporate a holistic ecosystem approach, focusing on relationships among plant and animal resources rather than on individual species, into their management philosophies. Swept up in these emerging efforts to sustain biological diversity and functional ecosystems, genetic concepts have been incorporated into habitat management with an alarming mixture of excellence, generalization, and unfortunately even misconception. This does not imply that evolutionary theory has no bearing on the applied sciences but rather that more attention must be given to the interface between theoretical and applied research. The need to integrate genetic theory into ongoing conservation and management efforts is clear; however, much controversy remains as to how this integration may be accomplished for individual management situations. For vertebrates, the transfer of genetic information between generations or within and among various breeding components of populations is inextricably linked to the ecosystem in which they exist. Changes in the structure of an ecosystem can and must influence the ecology of its component species to some extent. However, genetic consequences resulting from changes in the ecology of species or species complexes are not clearly understood. Undoubtedly, alterations in the transfer and conservation of genetic information occur concomitantly with large-scale changes in the landscape. It is likely that these small undetected changes at the genetic level impact species to a similar extent as larger more obvious landscape level factors. In this work we will discuss concepts that are integral to the long-term existence of organisms in managed landscapes and to maintenance of gene diversity in general. Specifically, we will focus on the concept of effective population size, confusion associated with this concept, and its applicability to the maintenance of biologically diverse and sustainable landscapes.

AB The importance of wildlife conservation in the agricultural Midwest has long been recognized. Likewise, the impact of habitat fragmentation within human-perturbed landscapes has received increased attention. Theoretically there exists an optimum degree of fragmentation at the landscape scale (e.g. to maintain both interior and edge species) that will permit an integrative approach to sustainable agriculture, as well as to conserve biotic diversity at a greater spatial and temporal scale. We propose a method for comparing biotic diversity within and between fragmented landscapes. This method encompasses both natural and human-subsidized components of the landscape mosaic.
   A sustainable landscape approach to conserving biotic diversity will require the cooperation of land-use planners, public land owners, policy makers, resource managers, and wildlife biologists, to name a few, at a scale seldom addressed in a human-dominated landscape. We describe a representative watershed (Four-Mile Creek Watershed) in Ohio and Indiana within which we outline an approach to wildlife habitat conservation that attempts to optimize biotic diversity and sustainable agricultural productivity. A new paradigm, namely agrolandscape ecology, is needed if we are to manage landscape elements (corridors and patches) within an agricultural landscape matrix. Approaches using ecological theory, hierarchy theory, landscape planning, and problem-solving algorithms must be integrated if society is to simultaneously increase habitat quality and implement a sustainability approach to landscape management.

TI THE LIMITATIONS TO ORGANIC LOADING ON A BOTTOM OF A COASTAL ECOSYSTEM
SO MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
LA English
DT Article
ID MARINE-SEDIMENTS; OXYGEN; MODEL
AB Artificial organic loading of a coastal ecosystem with materials such as urban sewage and aquacultural waste must be confined within the assimilative ability of the ecosystem, which is defined as the capacity for oxygenic degradation of organic matter at the bottom of the system. Suitably restricted loading should allow the sustainable use of a coastal ecosystem.
   Bed sediments at eight sites in Uwajima Bay, Japan, were sampled with a cylindrical core sampler and were incubated under constant temperature for the measurement of their rates of oxygen uptake. The rate of oxygen uptake was maximal for a particular concentration of sulphide in the substratum, which may have some proportional relationship to the extent of organic loading. The concentration of sulphide at the peak of oxygen uptake ranged from 0.02-0.06 mg S g-1 among sampling sites. A positive relationship between the density of several kinds of benthos and the rate of oxygen uptake by the substratum was also found by multivariate analysis.
   A model of a coastal ecosystem was constructed, and the effects of environmental factors, such as temperature, depth and vertical mixing rate, on the upper limit of organic loading were investigated.

DE FERTILIZER; RESIDUAL EFFECT; ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
AB A method to estimate fertilizer residual effects directly upon the response function of sequential crops is presented. The method allows for the prediction of fertilizer quantities that are demanded to support different levels of sustained yields in the long run. A case study has been made based upon a series of eleven years of experimental results from the application and reapplication of P2O5, K2O and limestone on soybeans. The statistical fits obtained were satisfactory and support the proposed method. The study also includes an economic analysis of fertilizer applications under conditions of stationary equilibrium of the case studied.

AB The variability within and among ectomycorrhizal species provides a substantial genetic resource and the potential to increase forest productivity and environmental sustainability. Two parallel and interacting approaches, classical and molecular genetics, are being developed to acquire the genetic information underpinning selection of improved ectomycorrhizal strains. Determining the genetic traits of the fungi which contribute to symbiosis and plant function are being followed using natural variability combined with classical and molecular genetic manipulations. Classical and molecular manipulations for breeding rely on key information including sexual and parasexual reproduction, postmeiotic nuclear behaviour, mating-types and vegetative incompatibility mechanisms. Progress in the manipulation of genomes of ectomycorrhizal fungi will depend on efficient methods for gene cloning and DNA transformation. Gene transfer into fungal cells have been shown to be successful and include treatment of protoplasts and intact mycelium with naked DNA in the presence of polyvalent cations, electroporation, and microbombardment. The merits and limitations of these methods are discussed. Using this technology the expression of foreign DNA, the functional analysis of fungal DNA sequences, as well as molecular exploitation for commercial purposes can be carried out. This review concentrates on these aspects' of fungal molecular biology and discusses the applications of the experimental systems that are currently available to ectomycorrhizal fungi. As it is essential to be able to define the traits which a breeder is seeking to improve, availability of genetically defined strains that are isogenic for a character or differ only in one character and a thorough knowledge of the biochemistry of the symbiosis will be necessary before any genetic manipulation be carried out. Genetic variability of ectomycorrhizal strains has been assessed by DNA fingerprinting. This approach allows the evaluation of DNA variability and the exchange of genetic information in natural populations, the identification of species and isolates by DNA polymorphisms, and tracking the environmental fate of the introduced fungi to determine their survival, growth, and dissemination within the soil.

AB This study combines data from a social survey and an air photo time series to gain both 2 temporal and spatial understanding of Dominican hill land use evolution. Research results indicate that disparities in present land use and productivity between two hill land study sites stem from their different stages of development along a common and use continuum. The authors emphasize the importance of understanding land use history when identifying key constraints to long-term sustainability of hill land farming systems.

TI CONSTRAINTS ON SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT IN ETHIOPIA - IS THERE A FUTURE
   FOR IMPROVED WOOD-STOVES
SO PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION AND DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB A fundamental component of resource conservation in Ethiopian development programmes is sought in part through the dissemination of improved stoves. However, as an evaluation of a range of stove programmes reveals, the absence of applied research by government and non-governmental organizations together with fundamental constraints arising out of the wider development context is resulting in programmes that are poorly targeted, inflexibly implemented and largely unable to meet the energy needs of poor rural and urban households. Despite these problems, donors continue to fund such projects, in large part because project evaluations are not made public, because of a policy lacuna, and ultimately because development thinking appears locked into finding a quick technology fix for what are essentially long-term, intractable sociopolitical processes and problems.

TI ECONOMIC AND ECOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVES ON RANCHING IN THE EASTERN AMAZON
SO WORLD DEVELOPMENT
LA English

ID DEFORESTATION
AB Approximately 10% of the Eastern Amazon forest was converted to pasture during 1960-90.  The performance of the ranching sector was poor during this period.  There are clear signs, however, that this is changing.  Some ranches are becoming more specialized, focusing exclusively on calf production, range fattening, or dairy production.  New, better adapted forages are now commonly planted and pasture lifetime has been extended.  Old, degraded pastures are being rehabilitated and the returns on investment approach 20%.  These encouraging developments are counterbalanced by lingering doubts about the long-term sustainability of ranching in the Amazon environment.

AB The development of resistance of Botryotinia fuckeliana to dicarboximides was evaluated in a vineyard in Walenstadt which has been managed following the Swiss guidelines for Integrated Pest Management (IPM). Dicarboximides have been scarcely used; in total, they were only applied seven times from their commercial introduction in 1977 to the start of the experiments in 1989. In the following 3 years, they were applied once in 1989 and twice in 1991, the vineyard was not sprayed in 1990. A single dicarboximide spray at veraison in 1989 caused an increase of the proportion of resistant isolates from less-than-or-equal-to 25 % at the beginning of the experiment to 100 % at harvest. Between the sampling at harvest in autumn 1989 and the following spring, the proportion of resistant isolates was reduced to less-than-or-equal-to 20 %. The proportion of resistant isolates on mature grape berries was only 5 % in 1990. In spring 1991, the proportion of resistant isolates was less-than-or-equal-to 15 %. While the proportion of resistant isolates increased to 100 % by two applications of dicarboximides the proportion of resistant strains in the untreated, neighboured part of the plot remained at 15 %. The resensibilization has no sustainable effect as a single spray caused the increase of the proportion of resistant isolates to 100 %. Despite IPM and a reduced number of sprays, the build up of a resistant subpopulation could not be prevented.

AB The sustainable yield of a population can be related directly to its demographic parameters and density-dependent processes. For fish stocks a direct and simple relationship can be derived relating this yield to the level of natural mortality and the stock and recruitment relationship. For terrestrial mammals, a plethora of different density-dependent processes have been identified. A derivation of a stock and recruitment relationship for terrestrial mammals is described here and applied to data on certain mammals. The comparative response to harvesting of marine species with these terrestrial mammals is then examined.

ID FORMAL MACROAPPROACH
AB Biotechnology as a multidisciplinary and transdisciplinary field of science and engineering is regarded to be a key technology for the future, able to essentially contribute to sustainable development.
   In the first part of this paper, a critical analysis of the status quo in biotechnologies is given in the area of pharmaceutical, agricultural, environmental, and industrial biotechnology as well as food biotechnology.  Here the general potential becomes clear, but also a series of disadvantages which are partly the result of the existing paradigm in science and technology and partly in direct connection to bioprocessing itself.  Nevertheless, these biotechnologies will contribute to sustainable development, but mainly in a shallow sense of survival and livelihood.
   In the second part of this paper, another new dimension in bioprocessing is elucidated, which is in agreement with the new ecological, holistic world view.  Here the so-called ''eco-principles'' are derived from a systems analysis of the ecosphere and represent the intelligence of nature as the result of evolution.  The eco-principles will serve as guidelines for the general eco-restructuring of technology, being a drastic change within the next 2 - 5 decades.  For the applying of eco-principles, a quantitative measure for sustainability in technology was developed (''sustainable process index''), which will enable us to design the new technology paradigm called ''Eco Tech''.  Ecological security and social equity, together with economic efficiency will define sustainable technology development in a deeper sense.
   Following this route, a completely new dimension of biotechnology will be reached, where the technosphere is fully embedded into the natural cycles of the ecosphere on a local basis.

AB In the Mediterranean basin, most of the present forests derive from original forests where the dominant species was different from the present one.  These changes are largely due to human activities reflecting millenia of management and, often, overexploitation.  In southern France, for example, palaeoecologists believe that the original malacophyllous deciduous forest of downy oak (Quercus pubescens) was replaced by a sclerophyllous evergreen holm oak (Quercus ilex) coppice in the driest areas, and chestnut (Castanea sativa) orchards or coppices in the ''wettest'' areas.  However, for the last several decades, exploitation of these coppice stands has been decreasing.  In this study, we addressed the question of the resilience of these managed ecosystems in the fact of changing management schemes, and to determine appropriate strategies and criteria of sustainable development.  We present some aspects of the auto-succession after clearcutting of holm oak coppice stands and aspects of the natural regeneration of 4 species (Q. ilex, Q. pubescens, C. sativa, and P. pinaster).  The consequences of the contrasted life history strategies are compared to estimate the future of these coppices.

TI RICE WHEAT IN SOUTH-ASIA - SYSTEMS AND LONG-TERM PRIORITIES ESTABLISHED
   THROUGH DIAGNOSTIC RESEARCH
SO AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article
AB Rice and wheat are grown in rotation on about 12 million hectares in South Asia. Yields in this rotation have increased over time, but evidence indicates that factor productivity may be declining. Recently, multidisciplinary teams of agricultural scientists conducted diagnostic surveys in several rice-wheat areas in South Asia. This paper reviews rice-wheat system problems and longer-term issues of sustainability identified through the surveys (near-term problems affecting rice and wheat yields are discussed less fully). System problems include poor wheat populations caused by the poor soil structure and plow pan formed for puddled rice, late wheat planting resulting from late rice harvesting, and losses to grassy weeds encouraged by continuous rice-wheat cultivation. Sustainability issues include soil nutrient depletion and possible buildup of insects, weeds, and diseases.

TI A SIMULATION-MODEL OF AN ALPACA SYSTEM IN THE DRY PUNA OF THE ANDES
SO AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article
AB A stochastic model was developed to study the alpaca production system in the high Andes. The model was based on actual knowledge of the biology of the alpaca, especially energy metabolism. It is composed of six subroutines: voluntary intake, energy partitioning, reproduction, fiber production, offspring development and forage utilization. Outputs of the model were validated against data from research and from a dynamic survey of a peasant community (Apopata). Model predictions did not differ (p > 0.05) from actual data on voluntary intake, body weight and fiber production for different animal categories. Simulation experiments showed that the management given by the farmers allows the system to recuperate during years of good rainfall, assuring its sustainability.

TI LEARNING FROM 6 REASONS WHY FARMERS DO NOT ADOPT INNOVATIONS INTENDED TO
   IMPROVE SUSTAINABILITY OF UPLAND AGRICULTURE
SO AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS
LA English

ID SHIFTING CULTIVATION; SOIL PROPERTIES; CONSERVATION; PRODUCTIVITY; MAIZE
AB Upland agriculture in southeast Asia has been associated with resource-poor farmers, land degradation, soil and water losses, and increasing pest problems.  Research and extension have offered farmers on-farm innovations-often forms of 'agroforestry'-intended to improve sustainability of upland agroecosystems.  Farmer adoption, however, has been minimal.  Based on case materials, six overlapping reasons why farmers do not adopt are that farmers do not face the problem targeted by the innovation, farmer practice is equal to or better than the innovation, the innovation does not work, extension fails, the innovation costs too much, and 'social' factors.  Learning from such reasons, our work in the Philippines is hopefully leading to farmers' adaptation and adoption of contour vegetative strips for soil erosion control.  A few conclusions are drawn.

AB The question of which cropping system is superior in the context of the farming systems of the West African Guinea savannah has not been answered yet. A methodological framework for the assessment of cropping systems is provided. Relevant indicators required in order to evaluate the performance of the systems, namely their productivity, stability and sustainability, are determined These parameters are computed from experimental data which are based on a five-year crop sequence trial Subsequently, the experimental data are used to conduct an ex-ante analysis from a farming systems perspective of 18 farm households. Results indicate that a portfolio of the three cropping systems seems to be optimal. However, the actual combination of cropping systems varies according to the relative resource endowment and risk preferences of the farm households.

AB The Agroforestry Center for Sustainable Development was established by the Universidad Autonoma Chapingo, Mexico, in 1991 with the expectation of developing itself into a Center of Excellence in Agroforestry education, training, and research in Mexico and other parts of Latin America. The Center's program for the initial five-year period includes development of a graduate program at Masters level, establishment of a field research station, and setting up a library and documentation unit with a well-stocked library of agroforestry literature. Environmental protection, sustainability issues, social equity, participatory research (involving resource-poor farmers), and interdisciplinary emphasis are some of the key guiding principles of all Center-sponsored activities. Active collaboration will be sought between the Center and various national and international agencies that have programmatic emphasis in the region. The proposed graduate (MS) program will consist of one-year of course-work followed by a second year of thesis research. Structure and curriculum of several supporting courses have been drafted.

AB The CIES/Consortium was created in 1992 for increasing the personnel capability and conducting research in natural resources, sustainable development, and human health in the Chiapas region of Mexico. Research is being conducted in four principal study areas: Highlands of Chiapas, the Lacandon rain forest, Soconusco, and 'El Ocote' Reserve. There are four research departments: Conservation of Natural Resources, Alternative Production Systems, Health and Population, and Agroecological Technology. Agroforestry research, within the Department of Alternative Production Systems, includes agroforestry systems diagnosis in the highlands of Chiapas, ethnobotanical survey of potentially useful woody plants, silvicultural evaluation of woody forage species, management alternatives for the fallow vegetation in the Lacandon rain forest, and forest regeneration ecology and biomass dynamics in the Highlands of Chiapas and Lacandon rain forest after human interference. The CIES/Consortium researchers are also involved in the training of professionals and supervision of bachelor- and master- theses in their respective study areas. In January 1994, CIES/Consortium started a Postgraduate program in 'Natural Resources and Rural Development'.

AB Innovations intended to conserve soils and improve soil nutrient cycling have not been widely adopted because of technical problems and lack of fit with farmers' circumstances.  Research in Claveria, the Philippines, facilitated and monitored farmers' adaptation of contour hedgerows to fit their particular needs.  Farmers tested diffeent establishment methods and many hedgerow species.  They initially planted a combination of Gliricidia sepium (a legume tree) and Pennisetum purpureum.  (grass).  Later adoptors chose fodder grasses (especially Setaria spp.) or naturally occuring vegetation in their hedgerows-either solely or in combination with other species, including weeds such as Rottboellia cochinchinensis identified as crop problems.  Upland rice and maize farmers who adopted contour hedgerows from 1987 through 1991 were interviewed in 1992.  Although hedgerow-crop competition, grazing by neighbors' cattle, and added labor were problems, farmers viewed hedgerows as a way to reduce soil erosion and provide fodder.  Farmers planting mulberry were disappointed after a silkworm project folded.  Farmers now face the problem of soil nutrient depletion, leading to fallowing of fields with hedgerows and shifting to other parcels.  A farmer decision tree model of the minimum necessary criteria for sustainable adoption of contour hedgerows is hypothesized.

AB The case of an agroforestry farm in the coastal mountain area of the federal state of Bahia, Brazil, is used to highlight benefits of the integration of traditional knowledge into a scientifically based farming system.  Special attention is given to the selection, combination and management of the crops cultivated.  Working hypotheses on the rationale of some major measures are suggested and discussed from a synecological point of view.  The results show that under the site conditions the 'forest garden' provides cocoa yields without external inputs at a level which, in the surrounding cocoa plantations, can only be attained by the use of considerable amounts of fertilizer and pesticides.

AB An integrated knowledge-based spatial decision support system, Landassess DSS, is being developed to assist with the sustainable management of Australia's northern grazing lands. The system incorporates a knowledge base of management and ecological knowledge, a natural resource database, a geographic information system, and scientific and economic models. The system requirements introduced the need for an integrating paradigm to facilitate the modeling of the natural resource system, knowledge representation, representation of heterogeneous data, and the integration of system components. The ability to model real-world features with corresponding knowledge base and software objects, which include structural and behavioral information, provides a powerful and intuitive method for representing and integrating knowledge and data, process models, and spatial information, as well as encapsulating and abstracting different levels of information and functionality.

AB Dengue viruses are maintained in endemic transmission cycles in tropical urban areas where epidemics periodically occur. Until about 30 years ago, there were long intervals (10-40 years) between epidemics but they are now occurring in many areas at 3-5-year intervals. These epidemics are most likely caused by virus strains with different epidemic potential. Accompanying this increased frequency in epidemic activity has been a change in the disease pattern with cases of the severe form of dengue (dengue hemorrhagic fever) becoming much more common. The occurrence of these factors and the expanding geographic distribution of dengue hemorrhagic fever in the past 15 years have made it necessary to re-evaluate currently recommended methods for prevention and control. The result has been increasing emphasis on the development of effective sustainable Aedes aegypti control programs based on source reduction using community participation. A brief overview of global programs using this approach is presented with emphasis on the Puerto Rican program, one of the earliest developed.

TI COMMUNITY PARTICIPATION IN VECTOR CONTROL - LESSONS FROM CHAGAS-DISEASE
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
LA English
DT Article
AB As applied to vector-borne disease control, the term community participation has been broadly interpreted. Community-based vector control projects have been described as having bath active and passive components. Recently, community participation in organized efforts to control Chagas' disease has become more dynamic, with increasingly active involvement by local community members. Chagas' disease is a particularly significant vector-borne disease problem in the South American countries of Brazil, Venezuela, and Bolivia, and health officials there are beginning to emphasize horizontal or decentralized approaches to control of triatomine vectors. Experience suggests that vector control programs using community participation have significant and sustainable impact on vector density, appear to be more cost-effective than purely vertically structured programs, are readily integrated with other health or development programs, promote an enduring sense of pride in home and community, and are politically viable vector control strategies. Community participation per se has inherent value because of its positive effect on social relationships and community solidarity. Moreover, it is a dynamic process that results in accrued benefits for public health that exceed most vector control program goals and persist well beyond program termination.

TI IMPREGNATED BED NETS FOR MALARIA CONTROL - BIOLOGICAL SUCCESS AND
   SOCIAL-RESPONSIBILITY
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
LA English
DT Article
AB Malaria is a serious public health problem in numerous countries of the world. In Africa alone, it is estimated that more than a million children less than five years of age die each year from this disease. The problem has become more critical with the development of Plasmodium falciparum resistance to chloroquine, the high cost of replacement antimalarials, and vector resistance to the cheaper insecticides such as DDT. Emphasis now is on sustainable control programs that can be implemented by communities with assistance from primary health care providers. This has led to a re-examination of impregnated bed nets (IBNs) that serve as a physical barrier to break human-vector contact. Over the last decade, bed nets impregnated with cheap and long-lasting pyrethroids used in Africa and Asia have shown their utility in reducing human-vector contact, inoculation of humans with sporozoites, clinical episodes of fever, and high levels of parasitemia. One study in The Gambia demonstrated that mortality in young children was significantly reduced, and the results of that study have led to the initiation of large-scale mortality studies in different epidemiologic areas in Africa. This paper reviews current bed net materials, recommended insecticides, an impregnation technique, costs, and the importance of community participation. As a malaria control option IBNs appear to be very premising, but further entomologic and epidemiologic assessments, including mortality studies, are needed. Future use of IBNs should be considered as part of a larger program that includes other vector control measures, proper case management, appropriate use of antimalarials for prevention in specific target groups, surveillance, and program monitoring with attention to changing epidemiologic situations and developing technology.

TI THE ROLE OF BIOLOGICAL-CONTROL OF MOSQUITOS IN INTEGRATED VECTOR CONTROL
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
LA English
DT Article
AB An integrated approach for the control of mosquitoes and the diseases they transmit will better enable sustainable control while helping to circumvent some of the problems associated with the use of conventional insecticides. Environmental methods and biological control are alternatives to chemical control and are key components of the integrated strategy. The use of vertebrate and invertebrate predators and entomopathogens as biological control agents and their role in integrated control programs is reviewed with emphasis on fish, Toxorhynchites mosquitoes, Notonecta species, predatory copepods, entomopathogenic bacteria, and the fungus Lagenidium giganteum. The successful implementation of these organisms will depend on an in-depth understanding of the ecology of both the targeted species and the biological control agents to be used. Thorough geographic reconnaissance will also be essential for the successful abatement of pest and vector mosquitoes. The success and sustainability of future programs, especially in developing countries, will rely not only on the use of the most appropriate technologies but also on the direct participation of the affected communities. Possible undesirable effects of biological control are also reviewed.

AB Though only a fem naturalists have read much economic theory, current understandings of how biological diversity is being lost are largely framed by the models developed by economists over the past two centuries. There is more than a touch of irony here. While conservation biologists are challenging the course of economic development, their perception of the process of biodiversity loss is driven by historic patterns of economic reasoning that have become a part of popular consciousness. To be sure, the early economic models were designed to address the development of agriculture and the use of land. But agriculture is the most dependent on biodiversity. At the same time, the geographic expansion of agricultural activities and the choice of agricultural technologies have been the key driving force of biodiversity loss. Later economic models addressed the limits of markets to provide guiding signals for human interaction with the complexities of ecosystems. Even the way we frame how we should respond to the greatest long-term threat to biodiversity, the likelihood of climate change, is rooted in the economics of more than half a century ago.
   This article elaborates these economic framings of the interaction of economic systems with the evironment and discusses their policy implications. One of the major problems is that even existing economic understandings of the processes of biodiversity loss are only accepted within a part of the economics profession because these understandings conflict with political ideologies held by most American economists. Thus processes of biodiversity loss are maintained, not for a lack of knowledge, but for a desire among people to maintain simple views of biological systems. Even the patterns of reasoning held by economists who do ponder biological systems, however, are inadequate. The paper concludes with suggestions of additional ways of modeling the interactions between human activity and biological systems which may provide further insight into how we might better maintain biological diversity.

ID BIODIVERSITY
AB A significant reduction in the diversity of life on earth is already assured as a result of the loss and degradation of terrestrial and aquatic habitats over past centuries. With continued human population growth, biodiversity will come under even more pressure in coming decades. Yet significant opportunities do exist to lessen the rate of extinction and thereby increase the amount of biodiversity that is passed on to future generations. Strategies for biodiversity conservation must reorganize ethical, ecological, and economic values of biodiversity if they are to have the greatest possible impact. All of these values are important in determining the costs of biodiversity loss and the benefits of conservation. In recent years a coalescence of scientific information, heightened economic value, and grassroots activism has stimulated an unparalleled global response to the loss of biodiversity. Linked efforts to save study and use the earth's biodiversity sustainably and equitably stand the greatest chance of substantially reducing the rate of diversity's loss.

ID CONSERVATION; GROWTH; FLUCTUATIONS; EXTINCTION
AB The sustainable use of wild species by local people is emerging as an important conservation strategy. The premise is the economic value of species will justify their own preservation as well as the habitats they occupy. However, the lack of natural history and demographic information for the majority of species being exploited or with potential uses presents challenging problems for implementing sustainable use programs. Each year in Argentina and Paraguay, an average of 1.9 million tegu lizards of the genus Tupinambis are exploited for their skins. In spite of the importance of tegus as a resource, their biology is poorly known and their populations have never been managed. The life history of Tupinambis, like that of other exploited lizards, is characterized by a relatively long life span, a large clutch size, several years of growth before reproduction, and high mortality of hatchlings. Importantly, the mortality of young-of-the-year and the proportion of females reproducing each year are both probably strongly influenced by interannual environmental variation. When these parameters were randomized in life table projections to simulate the effects of environmental stochasticity, the population growth rate was highly sensitive to environmental fluctuations. Monte Carlo simulations of different harvest strategies showed that estimates of population growth rates were overwhelmingly influenced by environmental variation and the number of years included in the growth rate estimate, even in the face of seemingly large changes in adult mortality that would result from population management. These results are both encouraging and cautionary for Tupinambis conservation. On the one hand these patterns can help explain how Tupinambis populations may have persisted in spite of high and variable harvest levels during many years, but conversely, stochastic effects make it difficult to evaluate the effects of conservation measures. Size and sex can be determined from harvested skins, and pilot studies suggest that analyses of the annual harvest can provide valuable information for evaluating long-term population trends.

AB A study Of common snapping turtles conducted from 1975 through 1992 in southeastern Michigan provided sufficient demographic data to examine how life history characteristics may constrain population responses of long-lived organisms. Females reached sexual maturity between 11 and 16 years of age. Minimum reproductive frequency was less than annual(0.85), and nest survivorship over 17 years ranged from 0 to 64% and averaged 23%. Survivorship of yearlings had to be estimated since hatchlings can pass through the mesh on traps. Actual survivorship of juveniles was over 0.65 by age 2 and averaged 0.77 between the ages of 2 and 12 years. Annual survivorship of adult females ranged from 0.88 to 0.97. A life table for the population resulted in a cohort generation time of 25 years. Population stability was most sensitive to changes in adult or juvenile survival, and less sensitive to changes in age at sexual maturity, nest survival or fecundity. An increase in annual mortality of 0.1 on adults over 15 years of age with no density-dependent compensation would halve the number of adults in less than 20 years.
   The results from the present study indicate that life history traits of long-lived organisms consist of co-evolved traits that severely constrain the ability of populations to respond to chronic disturbances. Successful management and conservation programs for long-lived organisms will be those that recognize that protection of all life stages is necessary. Without protection of adults and older juveniles, programs that protect nests and headstart hatchlings have a low probability of success. Carefully managed sport harvests of turtles or other long-lived organisms may be sustainable; however, commercial harvests will certainly cause substantial population declines.

AB This paper presents a modelling study on regional sustainable development. First, the use of formal modelling for studying the multi-level relationship between economic, environmental and development processes is discussed. Such a relationship is analyzed for an island region in Greece. A potential conflict exists here between environmental conservation, local interests and rapid growth in tourism. A dynamic model is used to depict the development of the economies of three main islands and their interactions with the terrestrial and marine environment. The presentation of the case study model is followed by a discussion of scenarios, indicators and simulation results.

AB This paper discusses one example of alternative tourism, trekking in Northern Thailand, to assess the nature of the interaction between the changes in the attraction and the motivations of the client group. Visitation does reduce the authenticity of the villagers, yet several adaptive strategies are successfully employed by the companies to counteract this. A survey of trekkers revealed high satisfactions, yet motivations are changing to emphasize the authenticity of the entire experience rather than the ethnic authenticity of the hilltribes. A transformation is taking place from primary ethnic tourism to cultural tourism with a strong recreational emphasis. While this bodes well for future sustainability, hilltribe response and involvement remain minimal.
