AB It is shown that it is possible to use a linear regression algorithm direct method to solve crystal structures from X-ray fluorescence holography (XFH) data. It is found that, in contrast to conventional X-ray structure determination methods, which do not always work unambiguously, the sustainable method utilizing the XFH data generally provides the unique phase-retrieval structure solution and is able, in many cases, to replace the above for determining both the absolute values (moduli) and phases of structure factors. The XFH (theta, phi) scan with a fluorescing Cu atom from a spherical cluster of a Cu3Au single crystal, at an energy of 10 keV for the incident unpolarized plane-wave X-radiation, is numerically simulated to test the performance of the method in finding a unique solution for the structure factors involved in the restoration procedure using the linear regression algorithm.

DE crop coefficients; FAO Penman-Monteith approach; GIS; irrigation
   requirements; reference evapotranspiration2
AB Geographic information systems technology was used to utilize meteorological data and crop distributions in order to estimate irrigation requirements. The irrigation requirements were estimated as the difference between crop evapotranspiration and effective rainfall. Crop evapotranspiration was evaluated as the product of reference evapotranspiration and the crop coefficient, while the reference evapotranspiration was calculated via the FAO Penman-Monteith method. Monthly effective rainfall was estimated from total monthly rainfall according to the method developed by the USDA Soil Conservation Service. For the purpose of this paper, the island of Crete in Greece was used as a case study. Based on individual meteorological stations as representative stations for the whole island the irrigation water demand was estimated at 362 135 Mm(3) for the year 1991. The large variation is caused by the location and number of representative meteorological stations. A combination of up to 10 meteorological stations, chosen for geographical reasons as representatives of different regions of the island, resulted in a significant reduction of this variation. The irrigation water demand for the year 1991 was estimated, based on 10 stations, at 359 Mm(3). The station of Lefkogia can be considered the representative station for the island. An increase in irrigation water requirements is projected to be 8-10 Mm(3)/year for Crete. These analyses should assist in the strategic planning of water use for irrigation, particularly in cases where the number of stations is inadequate, by identifying representative stations for different regions and projecting further irrigation water demand. The accurate estimation of irrigation water demand is also essential for developing a rational policy for sustainable water resources. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

ID AGRICULTURAL-RESEARCH; ENVIRONMENTALISM
AB Ideology is maintained and driven by powerful symbols. Agricultural media such as farm magazines achieve this by appropriating societal values of currency and incorporating them in imagery that accompany advertisements of agricultural products, including pesticides. Critical questions relating to environmental sustainability and social risks associated with the use of such products are often masked as a result. Content analyses of two mid-western farm magazines from the 1940s to 1990s trace the social construction of pesticide advertisements over time, illuminating changing images of pesticides in farm magazine advertisements in response to changes in the socio-cultural setting. Changing images reflect how the agricultural industry strategically repositions itself to sustain market and corporate profit by co-opting dominant cultural themes at specific historical moments in media advertising. Sustainability implications in the broad context of agriculture and society are examined.

AB Dependency stands for many grievances and is generally considered a symptom of oppression. An opposing concept, offered as the preferred state, is self-reliance. Dependency and self-reliance are key concepts in sustainable development programs that feature participatory approaches. Some of the ways in which development projects employ the concepts of dependency and self-reliance, however, are troubling. Dependency and self-reliance in two programs for participatory sustainable development are examined, one in Canada and the other in New Zealand. Frameworks for dependency and self-reliance are drawn from social psychology and philosophy to examine problematic aspects associated with the concepts. Analysis produced a proposal for use of the term situated interdependence as a way to cast the outcomes of participatory sustainable development more precisely. The location of the cases (Canada and New Zealand) centers the discussion within a context of industrialized agriculture, but also points to issues pertinent to developing countries.

AB By convening a multidisciplinary team (the Monitoring Team) that included farmers, university and agency researchers, and non-profit staff; a small group of farmers in southeast Minnesota, U.S.A., bolstered the legitimacy of the sustainable agriculture movement. Through the experience of forming a team and working with individuals who operated within the mainstream knowledge paradigm, farmers gained validation of their knowledge about farming, while researchers came to value alternative knowledge systems. In the context of a socially embedded movement, farmers were empowered by sharing their knowledge with researchers, and ultimately contributed to the sustainable agriculture movement by challenging traditional patterns of knowledge exchange.

ID FOOD SECURITY
AB Urban agriculture has, for centuries, served as a vital input in the livelihood strategies of urban households in the developing countries. As a response to the economic crises exacerbated by the structural adjustment programs and increasing migration, urban agriculture has expanded rapidly within the last 20 years. An examination of the general trends in urban agriculture reveals a number of issues policy-makers in developing countries should address to provide services to ensure a sustainable behavior towards urban cultivation. Most important is the legalization of urban agriculture as a step towards securing lands for the urban poor. The illegal status has left a governance vacuum, which should be filled through policy formulation and regular institutionalized management in a participatory manner including all relevant stakeholders if food security has to be increased and environment improved in an urban development context.

ID SOUTHERN SPAIN; CONSERVATION; DIET
AB Olive tree cultivation in the Mediterranean goes back to ancient times. Even since the Roman Age, olive cultivation spread to the entire Mediterranean basin. This longevous tree integrates and identifies economically, socially, and culturally the inhabitants of this basin and determines its rural landscape. For the residents of the Mediterranean, olive oil constituted the main source of nutritional fats, their most valuable export product, and was identified with their culture. Even now, olive cultivation has a multiple importance for the Mediterranean. The olive groves, which grow mostly on inclined, shallow, and low fertility soils, and on hand-made stone terraces, have limited watering requirements and sustain the fragile natural resources of the Mediterranean. Today, olive cultivation in the Mediterranean is an additional income source and supports the population in rural areas during the winter period, which profit from summer and sea tourism activity. Although an agro-ecosystem, the olive grove resembles the natural Mediterranean ecosystem and abandonment transforms them into natural Mediterranean type forests. Their change of use from olive cultivation to pasture degrades the ecosystem and decreases the natural resources, because of over-grazing. At this time, two major factors threaten the traditional olive cultivation (i) the competition of the intensive olive groves in plain and irrigated areas and (ii) the cheaper seed-oils, which intensify the abandonment of traditional olive groves and change them into pasture, resulting in the deterioration of the ecosystem. Olive cultivation has left its mark on life in the Mediterranean and has contributed to the sustainability of natural resources. Nevertheless, it succumbs under the pressure of current socioeconomic situations. Today, the conservation of olives in production constitutes a necessity for the fragile Mediterranean ecosystems and a challenge for everybody involved.

ID CHALLENGES
AB Water scarcity is one of the most prominent issues of discussion worldwide concerned with sustainable development, especially in the and and semi-arid areas. On the Loess Plateau of China, population growth and, fast-growing cities and industries have caused ever-increasing competition for water. The present paper shows a down-scale analysis on how the region wide mass action of soil-water conservation ecologically influenced regional water scarcity on the Loess Plateau,, the Middle Reaches of the Yellow River of China. Result shows a great progress has been achieved in erosion control and food production since the 1980s. About 24% of erosion area has been controlled. Grain yield has increased greatly and sediment in the Yellow River has decreased by about 25%. However, various sources of evidence show that the soil-water conservation measures might have played a significant role on regional hydrocycles, leading to the depletion of deep soil water and reduced runoff in the Yellow River and consequently ecological problems. The study implies that cropland and forest plantations are increasingly suffering water stress. Advancing sustainable development further, or even maintaining the current situation, will be a great challenge given the burgeoning socio-economic development of the area combined with global climatic change.

TI Effects of western Corn Belt cropping systems on agroecosystem functions
SO AGRONOMY JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
ID SOIL QUALITY; NITROGEN; ROTATION; INDEX
AB Agricultural sustainability is enhanced by management practices that optimize the performance of multiple agroecosystem functions. The performance of western Corn Belt cropping systems was evaluated based on four agroecosystem functions: food production, raw materials production, nutrient cycling, and greenhouse gas regulation. A simple multiattribute ranking procedure was used to quantify agroecosystem performance using data from a long-term cropping systems experiment near Mead, NE. Treatments included in the procedure were continuous corn (Zea mays L.) (CC), corn-soybean [Glycine mar (L.) Merr.] (C-SB), corn-oat (Avena saliva L.) + clover [80% sweet clover (Melilotus officinalis L.) and 20% red clover (Trifolium pratense L.)]-sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench]-soybean (C-OCL-SG-SB), and corn-soybean-sorghum-oat + clover (C-SB-SG-OCL) each at three N fertilization levels (ZERO, LOW, and HIGH). Based on treatment averages of soil and crop indicators from 1983 to 1998, agroecosystem performance scores ranged from 66.6 to 77.3, with a least significant difference (LSD) between treatments of 2.2 (P < 0.05). Treatments with the highest scores included C-OCL-SG-SG-SB/LOW (77.3), C-SB/LOW (76.9), CC/LOW (76.7), CC/HIGH (76.6), and C-SB-SG-OCL/LOW (75.3). Among these treatments, those fertilized at the LOW N rate attained high scores through moderate performance in all four agroecosystem functions. The CC/HIGH treatment, however, attained a high score solely through its superior capacity to be highly productive, as its scores for the two environmental quality-related functions were the lowest among all treatments. Correlations between production- and environmental protection-related functions were negative, emphasizing the importance of employing management practices that are productive yet minimize deleterious environmental impacts.

TI Sustainability appraisal of shifting cultivation in the Chittagong Hill
   Tracts of Bangladesh
SO AMBIO
LA English
DT Article
AB An integrated socioeconomic and erosion study on the sustainability of traditional shifting cultivation (Jhum) carried out in 1998 and 1999 in the Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT) of Bangladesh showed the system to be nonsustainable under the current conditions with fallow periods of only 35 years and lack of land rights. An estimated input (mainly labor) of USD 380 ha(-1) yr(-1) results in only a total output of USD 360 ha(-1) yr(-1) and Jhum cultivated areas suffer severe loss of soil and valuable plant nutrients along with runoff during the rainy season. To compensate these losses by commercial fertilizers will cost nearly USD 2 million yr(-1) for CHT. To ensure long-term productivity of the soils, Jhum should therefore be adjusted to a tolerable level and farmers should be given rights and title to the land to motivate them to switch to improved, settled farming systems.

TI Water management for a megacity: Mexico City Metropolitan Area
SO AMBIO
LA English
DT Article
AB The paper presents an overview of the present situation of the Mexico City Metropolitan Area (MCMA). The analysis indicates an urgent need to radically improve the current water supply and wastewater management practices, to become sustainable. The MCMA is one of the most rapidly growing urban centers of the world, with a population of about 21 million people, a very high rate of immigration and numerous illegal settlements. In order to meet the increasing water demand, successive governments have focused almost exclusively on supply management and engineering solutions, which have resulted in investments of hundreds of millions of USD and the construction of major infrastructure projects for interbasin water transfer. Environmental, economic and social policies associated with water management are mostly inadequate and insufficient, which is resulting in increasing deterioration in the environment, health and socioeconomic conditions of a population living in one of the largest urban agglomerations of the world. Surprisingly, however, no long-term strategies on demand-management, reuse, conservation, and improved water-management practices have been developed so far.

TI Can corals be harvested sustainably?
SO AMBIO
LA English
DT Article
AB The international trade in corals has been identified as a potential cause of localized depletion of coral populations in the major coral-exporting countries. The international coral trade is regulated by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna (CITES) agreement, which requires that export of corals is not detrimental to the species. The primary coral importing regions (USA and Europe) have threatened to limit or ban coral imports unless sustainable practices can be demonstrated. The spatial and temporal scale at which sustainability is defined is important in evaluating sustainability, e.g. at geological, regional or local scales. Other major issues are: the ecology of the target species; management options including provision of no-take areas; and the potential for coral culture. Implementation of practices that enhance ecological sustainability in the coral harvest fishery is possible, but may be difficult in some developing countries because of limited natural-resource management capacity.

   their neighbors?

AB Wind erosion is a serious environmental problem in the inland Pacific Northwest, US. In addition to on farm damage to soil and crop quality, it causes off-farm damage, including human respiratory illness, traffic accidents and diminished recreational values. Three key practices for effectively controlling wind erosion in eastern Washington are reduced tillage, continuous spring cropping and vegetative wind strips. Although these are effective in controlling wind erosion, their adoption by farmers in the region has been slow. Technology adoption theory has been classified into three paradigms: income, utility and innovation-adoption. This study on adoption of wind erosion control practices draws from all three paradigms. However, unlike most past research, this study distinguishes between single-practice adopters and multiple-practice adopters, and compares single-practice adopters with zero-practice adopters. Data were obtained from a random sample survey of 266 farmers in six semi-arid counties in a region of east-central Washington State prone; to wind erosion. Statistical results revealed: (1) that adopters of multiple conservation practices contrast more sharply with non-adopters than do adopters of a single conservation practice; and (2) adopters of a single practice differ more from zero-practice adopters than they do from all other farmers (including adopters of other practices). More specifically, this study recognizes heterogeneity among `adopters' in erosion control, and suggests that there may be some hierarchy among adopters in strength of innovation. It also supports earlier findings by sociologists that early adopters have more financial resources or larger farms and that education may aid adoption. Adopters were more aware of an erosion control educational program. Multiple-practice adopters are a distinct identifiable group, who may play a key role as innovators who can influence neighbors to adopt effective conservation practices. These individuals also possess unique information on the comparative cost, yields and technical challenges of alternative conservation practices that could be used on farms with similar soil and climatic conditions. Knowledge of the attributes associated with innovative multiple-practice adopters may permit soil conservation policymakers and field staff to target educational programs more accurately during the early stages of technology dissemination. Conservation-practice dissemination strategies may benefit by including innovative farmers in leadership roles in the initial stage of conservation education programs.

ID COMMUNITY PSYCHOLOGY
AB In this paper I discuss the clash of values between the Old Order Amish community of Ontario and the dominant social paradigm in agriculture. Land-use and agricultural regulations, designed for an industrial style of agriculture, are experienced as a threat to the survival of the Old Order Amish agricultural social economy and community. The paper describes how I have worked with the Old Order Amish to respond to these challenges and to create public policies that will allow them to maintain their human and agricultural diversity and small-scale sustainable farm practices. Four case studies illuminating the oppressive land-use regulations along with the emancipatory responses to the oppression are examined. The social transformation themes include principles and processes for community psychologists, land-use planners, and community economic development practitioners to consider. The article has heuristic value for a practice-based approach to social change.

TI Integrating spatial optimization and cellular automata for evaluating
   urban change
SO ANNALS OF REGIONAL SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
AB Urban growth and change presents numerous challenges for planners and policy makers. Effective and appropriate strategies for managing growth and change must address issues of social, environmental and economic sustainability. Doing so in practical terms is a difficult task given the uncertainty associated with likely growth trends not to mention the uncertainty associated with how social and environmental structures will respond to such change. An optimization based approach is developed for evaluating growth and change based upon spatial restrictions and impact thresholds. The spatial optimization model is integrated with a cellular automata growth simulation process. Application results are presented and discussed with respect to possible growth scenarios in south east Queensland, Australia.

AB This article explores the prospects for establishing an environmental accounting system along the U.S.-Mexico border. After reviewing the rationale for environmental accounting and developing an accounting framework, three studies from the San Diego-Tijuana region are presented. In the first study, we estimate the total proportion of Government expenditures made to defend the environment against human-induced changes in San Diego. This study reveals that defensive expenditures absorb 1.23 percent of total economic output and more than 21 percent of local government expenditures. The second study focuses on a smaller area along the border where the environmentally sensitive Tijuana Estuary on the U.S. side connects to the heavily populated Canon de los Laureles on the Mexican side. Expenditures made in Mexico aim to protect against threats to human health and safety, while those in the U.S. target the preservation of recreational resources and ecosystem health. Our third study estimates the value of agriculture land losses in San Diego between 1990 and 1995. Using an average price estimate for agricultural output and discount rates ranging from 0 to 5 percent, we find that the present value of the losses ranges from 0.18 percent to 1.8 percent of the total economy. Many of the areas lost to urban development are close to the existing urban area, suggesting the possibility of secondary impacts, such as increased air-pollution emissions resulting from longer transportation distance to market.

ID IDENTITY; THREAT
AB Drawing on poststructuralist political ecology, the narratives of two struggles about siting a superquarry are examined to elucidate the complex articulations of community, nature, resistance and identity in play in public debates. Focusing on the discursive formulations of the quarry in the expert language, as well as in the arguments of both local proponents and opponents of the quarries, shows the importance of ontological categories in "environmental" siting disputes. In Harris, these themes rearticulate the histories of dispossession, crofting and religion, as well as complex layers of geographical identity in the various claims to community. In Cape Breton, the rethinking of aboriginal Mi'kmaq identity was stimulated by revived interest in the religious traditions linked to the sacred site near the proposed quarry. In light of these findings, the complexity and active rearticulation of local "community" as political resistance are emphasised and the difficulties of thinking about sustainability highlighted.

TI Budget deficits, money growth and inflation: the Turkish evidence
SO APPLIED ECONOMICS
LA English
DT Article
ID PRICE-LEVEL; TURKEY; COINTEGRATION; STATISTICS
AB The paper investigates the long-run relationships between budget deficits, inflation and monetary growth in Turkey considering two alternative trivariate systems corresponding to the narrowest and the broadest monetary aggregates. While the joint endogeneity of money and inflation rejects the validity of the monetarist view, lack of a direct relationship between inflation and budget deficits makes the pure fiscal theory explanations illegitimate for the Turkish case. Consistent with the policy regime of financing domestic debt through the commercial banking system, budget deficits lead to a growth not of currency seigniorage but of broad money in Turkey. This mode of deficit financing, leading to the creation of near money and restricting the scope for an effective monetary policy, may not be sustainable.

DE overdraft; hydrogeologic analysis; seawater intrusion; coastal basin;
   India
AB The Balasore coastal groundwater basin in Orissa, India is under a serious threat to groundwater quantity and quality. Overdraft has resulted in declining groundwater levels and seawater intrusion. The present article focuses on the pertinent hydrologic and hydrogeologic analyses of the basin. Streamflow analysis of two rivers indicated that streamflow reaches its peak in July-August and reduces to a minimum in April-May. The runoff from the basin is estimated at 16.0 x 10(6), 160.7 x 10(6), and 525.8 x 10(6) m(3) for dry, normal, and wet years, respectively. The safe yield of the Balasore basin has been determined to be 155.3 x 10(6) m(3) For normal year and dry years, the gross annual irrigation requirements for the existing cropping pattern are 32 and 178% greater than the safe yield of the aquifer, respectively, while the current groundwater withdrawal for irrigation is 71% more than the safe yield. The regression analysis of monthly rainfall, river stage, and the corresponding groundwater level for the period 1997-1999 revealed that though river seepage and rainfall are two major sources of recharge to the basin, the first source is more significant. The stratigraphic analysis indicated that the basin mainly comprises three confined aquifers. The overall flow of groundwater in the first aquifer is from north to south into the Bay of Bengal. The second aquifer is severely contaminated by seawater intrusion within a 4- to 5-km wide tract along the coastline, leaving groundwater unfit for drinking and irrigation purposes. It is concluded that some urgent measures must be taken to ensure sustainable groundwater resources in the basin.

ID CONDENSED TANNINS; HAY
AB Cassava (Manihot esculenta, Crantz), an annual tropical tuber crop, was nutritionally evaluated as a foliage for ruminants, especially dairy cattle. Cultivation of cassava biomass to produce hay is based on a first harvest of the foliage at three months after planting, followed every two months thereafter until one year. Inter-cropping of leguminous fodder as food-feed between rows of cassava, such as Leucaena leucocephala or cowpea (Vigna unculata), enriches soil fertility and provides additional fodder. Cassava hay contained 20 to 25% crude protein in the dry matter with good profile of amino acids. Feeding trials with cattle revealed high levels of DM intake (3.2% of BW) and high DM digestibility (71%). The hay contains tannin-protein complexes which could act as rumen by pass protein for digestion in the small intestine. As cassava hay contains condensed tannins, it could have subsequent impact on changing rumen ecology particularly changing rumen microbes population. Therefore, supplementation with cassava hay at 1-2 kg/hd/d to dairy cattle could markedly reduce concentrate requirements, and increase milk yield and composition. Moreover, cassava hay supplementation in dairy cattle could increase milk thiocyanate which could possibly enhance milk quality and milk storage, especially in small holder-dairy farming. Condensed tannins contained in cassava hay have also been shown to potentially reduce gastrointestinal nematodes in ruminants and therefore could act as an anthelmintic agent. Cassava hay is therefore an excellent multi-nutrient source for animals, especially for dairy cattle during the long dry season, and has the potential to increase the productivity and profitability of sustainable livestock production systems in the tropics.

AB Secure, sufficient electricity supplies available at any time, as guaranteed in Germany, are vital to the existence of our modem society. Under the conditions of deregulated markets, it must continue to be possible in Germany to offer reliable, economical an non-polluting energy supplies. These three factors should enjoy equal importance in energy policy decisions in the interest of sustainability. The skewed balance caused by political preferences as experienced at the present time can jeopardize the general objective of optimization of the three factors in the long run.
   As in no other country, the power industry in Germany had to make a considerable adaptation effort, inter alia, because of market deregulation, airborne pollutant reduction, and agreements on the operating life of existing nuclear power plants. Other problems are likely to arise in the near future, e.g. in connection with emission trading.
   The power industry is willing and able to solve these future problems. This is true in particular of the expected replacement of power plants of approx. 40 000 MW generating capacity in Germany, where the European framework must be taken into account with a replacement requirement of approx. 200 000 MW. This implies investments of euro 50 billion in Germany alone, which can be made only if there is sufficient security in planning for the operators of power plants. The choice of efficient and economically viable power generation technologies must be possible in this respect.

AB Social Democratic energy policy in this and the past parliamentary terms pursues the objective of modernization in the interest of higher efficiency and protection of the climate.
   For Germany as the main energy exchange in Europe and a country. leading in the generation and consumption of energy and in technical know-how, the development of a long-term national energy concept is a requirement of political reason.
   In energy law, EU conditions must be taken into account. The relationship between deregulation and regulation will have to be considered in the light of past experience. Planning reliability is needed for the German hard coal mining industry.
   The financial promotion of renewable energies and of cogeneration schemes must be advanced even further.
   The agreement on opting out of the use of nuclear power has been concluded after decades of conflict. Nuclear energy research, especially fusion research with is immense financial requirements, is being reviewed critically, except for the part serving for repository and safety research.
   Research and development need new accents. This implies the need to resume work on traditional power plant technology, which has received less attention in recent years.
   In general, also the European and international dimensions to all these problems must be taken into account as well, as Germany is part of global structures when it comes to designing a sustainable energy policy.

AB More than half of Australia's lands and coastal regions are now encompassed within the boundaries of native title claims. The claims and the 'native title communities' who have lodged them are shaping a new geography of Australia's lands and seascapes. These communities derive from traditional ownership and thus have a different, and more fundamentally authoritative, basis to the indigenous 'residential communities' whose representative organisations are the mechanism through which governments have promoted indigenous self-management and which dominate in public affairs. Recognition of native title provides some opportunities for indigenous people to negotiate for benefits which will address their marginalised and economically dependent status but these are limited by the protection given to non-indigenous interests and are often proving they can be very difficult to realise. Overcoming indigenous marginalisation, promoting co-existence between indigenous and other Australians, and securing sustainability in rural regions requires that institutional reform goes beyond legally bounded interpretations of where native title does and does not still exist. Rebuilding indigenous institutions for governance of country is fundamental to achieving necessary change but political will and resources to support the process are critically lacking.

TI Diversity of customers requires diversity of markets - a study on the
   potentials of four different shopping facilities for organic food
SO BERICHTE UBER LANDWIRTSCHAFT
LA German
DT Article
AB The project "Ways to promote ecologically sound food products in the Berlin-Brandenburg region" tested four different shopping facilities for organic food with respect to their ability to attract new consumers. We chose a food coop selling to members only, a weekly open market, an eco-supermarket selling only organic food, and an organic products section of a regular warehouse. The basic idea of the project was that in order to promote the consumption of organic food it is necessary to develop strategies for diffusing both the products and the 'ideas' connected to these products. Besides classical marketing measures related to products, prices, staff and communication it is therefore essential to think about strategies for diffusing the 'ideals' aligned with organic agriculture and a sustainable food culture. These strategies have to go beyond the traditional ways of advertising and public relation.
   The results of an extensive survey with consumers who buy organic food show that weekly markets can strengthen their profile as "event-shopping-facilities". Coops have a strength in being stores with a personal atmosphere, mainly frequented by price-aware families. Eco-supermarkets may improve their image located between that of a regular supermarket and a traditional organic food store. Organic sections of regular warehouses have an advantage in being a one-stop-shopping facility with high quality goods. At open weekly markets the direct contact to the producers is possible they therefore are suited best for spreading information and creating emotional impressions. However, in the long run their economic situation may be at risk. Eco-supermarkets and the coops have potentials for further diffusing both products and ideas. Organic sections of regular warehouses have only little potential for diffusing information and ideas.
   Besides information on consumption habits, motivations and attitudes of consumer groups in the four shopping facilities, the article outlines strategies for marketing and diffusion of ideas.

AB In recent times there has been a growing dichotomy between preservation of single species and broader, ecosystem-based approaches to conservation. Freshwater habitats are among the most highly human-impacted ecosystems. We used a long-term data set on black kites (Milvus migrans), a threatened raptor dependent on aquatic habitats, to explore ways to reconcile single species and biodiversity-driven approaches to conservation. In the pre-Alpine lakes of northern Italy, black kite populations showed medium-low density, extremely low breeding success and widespread declines. Spatio-temporal variations showed density and breeding success to be positively related to ecosystem productivity (as estimated by phosphorus concentrations in lakes), availability of aquatic habitats and grassland, and to be negatively related to extent of farmland and fish harvest by professional fishermen. Fish species richness, used as a surrogate of biodiversity was highest in one oligotrophic lake, but on average increased with increasing ecosystem productivity (i.e. lake eutrophication). Given expected future declines in ecosystem productivity, kite conservation will be helped by enhancing populations of alternative prey in terrestrial habitats (e.g. through incentives for grassland), and higher regulation of fish harvest. On the other hand, ecosystem management may profit from the use of black kites or other aerial piscivores as indicators of biodiversity and of diffuse ecosystem stress, such as sustainability of fishing practices.

AB We studied the relationship between extinction frequencies of Iberian lynx subpopulations (Lynx pardinus) and their size and isolation during a 35-year period of strong geographic range contraction. At the end of this' period there were fewer fragmentation events; fewer lynx populations of small size, and less isolation between them, than in simulated geographic ranges derived from a random distribution of local extinctions. Only small populations occupying < 500 km(2) went extinct. Local extinction in large, self-sustainable populations probably resulted from the sole action of deterministic factors, e.g. widespread prey decline. As compared with large populations; small ones experienced increased contraction per unit occupied area, which may reflect demographic unstability. The consistent effect of isolation on extinction suggests that such unstability was often prompted by reduced immigration and the subsequent disruption of metapopulation equilibrium. Several practical recommendations could be derived. Provided that habitat quality was, adequate, a lynx population should avoid extinction within 35 years if. it occupied an area of at least 500 km(2). The persistence of small populations will also be enhanced by minimizing the distances to neighbouring populations within 30 km; and by maximizing the area occupied by these neighbours. Therefore, habitat management, or any other restoration action, directed to expand the area occupied by a small lynx population should be best located at points of its boundaries oriented towards other existing nearby populations.

AB Many chameleon species are thought to be restricted to primary rainforest where they are threatened by the continued fragmentation. and degradation of natural vegetation. We surveyed chameleon abundance in forest subject to high disturbance, low disturbance and in a riparian zone in Madagascar. Four Calumma species and Brookesia thieli were present in all habitats, but B. minima was not recorded from the high-disturbance forest. Chameleons were,more abundant in rainforest subject to low-disturbance (e.g. selective timber extraction) than in patches of high-disturbance forest that was recovering front burning. Riparian zones within low-disturbance forest provided linear patches of high chameleon, abundance and are therefore an important con servation resource because they also protect a range of other endemic and threatened species. Carefully designed management plans are needed to conserve biodiversity and allow the sustainable use of forest products by people in Madagascar. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Diethyl L-aspartate was polymerized by a bacterial protease from Bacillus subtilis (BS) in organic solvent at a temperature between 30 and 50 degreesC to yield alpha-linked poly(ethyl L-aspartate) having an M-w of up to 3700 and a maximum polymer yield of 85%. The best polymerization conditions were the 40 degreesC polymerization of diethyl L-aspartate using 30% protease BS containing 4.5 vol % water in acetonitrile for 2 days. Poly(ethyl L-aspartate) was readily depolymerized by the enzyme into the oligomeric and monomeric L-aspartate in aqueous acetonitrile. Poly(sodium aspartate) prepared by the saponification of poly(ethyl L-aspartate) was readily biodegradable by activated sludge obtained from the municipal sewage treatment plant. Also, poly(sodium aspartate) was depolymerized by the hydrolase enzyme into the monomeric aspartate. These results may indicate the sustainable chemical recycling and biorecycling of this polymer.

AB An application of modern process control techniques to poultry production is outlined. Compact dynamic data-based models are proposed to describe and control the metabolic response of broiler chickens to the micro-environment. The dynamic response of heat production to step changes in air temperature and light intensity could be modelled with an average coefficient of determination R-T(2) of 0-83 and 0.93, respectively. T Using recursive parameter estimation techniques, the time-variant response of animal growth to food supply could be predicted on-line with a maximum prediction error of 5%, 3-7 days ahead depending on the type of feeding schedule. Compact data-based models were shown to be suitable for control of broiler growth. Overall, the studies suggest that the potential conflicts between the environmental, financial and biological pressures on sustainable poultry production can be resolved through the development of integrated management systems using modern process control techniques.

AB Modern agrobiotechnology is developing at a crucial phase in the history of agricultural science. The conventional green revolution paradigm is being forced to shift to a more ecologically just and politically sound paradigm of sustainable agriculture. Within agricultural innovation systems, the decisions in agrobiotechnology, be they on research directions, allocations or release of research products, will now depend on a judicious mix of public opinion, regulatory and political safeguards, new partnerships and organizational formats, social contracts and scientific judgements. This entails changes both in the expectations from science and in the existing policy processes and instruments. Agricultural biotechnology is now marked by new research and development partnerships demanding new capabilities in the social sciences to analyse relationships between science, technology and society.

ID TECHNOLOGY; ETHANOL
AB Lignocellulosic biomass such as agricultural and forestry residues and dedicated crops provides a low-cost and uniquely sustainable resource for production of many organic fuels and chemicals that can reduce greenhouse gas emissions, enhance energy security, improve the economy, dispose of problematic solid wastes, and improve air quality. A technoeconomic analysis of biologically processing lignocellulosics to ethanol is adapted to project the cost of making sugar intermediates for producing a range of such products, and sugar costs are predicted to drop with plant size as a result of economies of scale that outweigh increased biomass transport costs for facilities processing less than about 10,000 dry tons per day. Criteria are then reviewed for identifying promising chemicals in addition to fuel ethanol to make from these low cost cellulosic sugars. It is found that the large market for ethanol makes it possible to achieve economies of scale that reduce sugar costs, and coproducing chemicals promises greater profit margins or lower production costs for a given return on investment. Additionally, power can be sold at low prices without a significant impact on the selling price of sugars. However, manufacture of multiple products introduces additional technical, marketing, risk, scale-up, and other challenges that must be considered in refining of lignocellulosics.

AB Few models of blue crab population dynamics have accounted for the spatial aspects of crab life history in their formulations. Here I develop a spatially-explicit model of the Chesapeake Bay blue crab population that reflects our understanding of the general life history. Best available estimates of growth, mortality and fecundity were used. Currently, we lack empirical data on which to base estimates of movement probabilities. Thus, movement probabilities were based on the relative area of each region. The model results show that the current pattern of exploitation in blue crab is likely not sustainable and needs to be reduced substantially. The model appears relatively insensitive to the estimated probability of survival during early life history. Moreover, variation in the proportion of crabs that recruit to the fishery at age-1 appear to have little impacts on projected rates of population growth. Model results also show that restriction of a winter dredge fishery in the lower Chesapeake Bay is not sufficient to ensure a sustainable pattern of exploitation. Until further empirical data are available to improve accuracy, the model serves as a useful tool for exploring consequences of different spatial distributions and patterns of exploitation.

AB Over an extended period during the 1990s, using long interviews with the top management of five banks and secondary data, we studied the transformation of Canadian banks. We observed how the Canadian banks have changed to take full advantage of the increased technological potential for developing and exchanging information. The failure of the "pure players" has shown that the information advantages of the Internet are not sufficient to lead to sustainable competitive advantage. Existing financial institutions can make better use of that same information flow by combining it with organizational changes that make the new information more strategically valuable. By aligning information technology and the hard elements of their organizational architecture with soft elements like reputation, cooperation, and information sharing, traditional banks have developed powerful advantages in the 1990s.

AB Forest management in Sweden today, as in many other places, involves the management of multiple resources for diverse purposes, such as promoting biodiversity, recreation, hunting, carbon sequestration, and reindeer herding as well as wood production. Sustainability is no longer related only to timber production; it now embraces the composition, processes, and functions of the entire ecosystem. Moreover, pressure from substitute products requires the production of timber, wood fuel, etc., to be economically competitive. The increased complexity of forest management has intensified the need for improved instruments for analysis and decision support. In response to this, a research programme aiming to develop new systems for forest management analysis and planning was recently initiated at the Forest Faculty, Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences (SLU), in which research efforts in different fields are being linked in a common framework to generate models and methods with the following desired attributes. The new systems should be designed with (i) a modular structure to allow the development of different applications, (ii) the landscape as the basic planning unit, (iii) the tree as the basic unit of projection of the tree layer, (iv) models of the interactions between processes and the management of the tree layer, and (v) models for evaluating risks and uncertainties in the data acquired and model projections. We believe that the separation of the system into a decision phase and a projection phase should facilitate the analysis of large and complex multiresource planning problems and suggest in this paper possible avenues for implementing such a feature. Since spatial problems are inherent in many biodiversity-related applications, we propose that appropriate spatially structuring principles should be included in the design of the system. The complex trade-offs involved when selecting ecosystem models in relation to the purpose of the analysis and data availability are highlighted.

AB Decisions concerning ecosystem management, forest certification, and sustainable management require stand- and tree-level information that reflects current silvicultural and management practices. Typical forest stands, however, take years to mature making timely data collection, analyses, and reporting difficult. Further, collecting and evaluating certain forest stand information that affects sustainability such as belowground biomass response or response to changing climatic factors is often intractable. One modeling tool that may be useful for supplying future informational needs at the tree and stand level is the use of miniature scale plantations. Data from a miniature scale spacing trial for loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) that was established at 1:16 scale to an operational study suggest that important stand characteristics associated with forest productivity develop similarly at the two scales. Once models are formulated that relate the size of trees (spatially scaled models) and the rates of growth (temporally scaled models) grown at miniature scale to their operational scale counterparts, it may become feasible to conduct experimentation in miniature and make inferences to operational scales.

ID SUSTAINABLE PROCESS INDEX
AB The paper reviews the challenges and chances of process integration and especially process synthesis in the relatively new field of renewable resource utilization. Due to driving forces that are in many cases external to both technology and economics, this field puts new requirements on process synthesis in terms of methodology as well as interpretive power. Characteristics of the raw material sources but also new concepts like regionality and ecological structuring of processes gain interest in this context. These requirements are generalized from two particularly interesting case studies, the utilization of meat and bone meal and the "Green Bio Refinery Concept".
   Process integration proves to be an important approach to keep costs in check in view of tight markets. Process synthesis is shown to be a central factor for both technology development and technology implementation in the context of renewable resource utilization.
   The paper explores the scope of both concepts in terms of applications as well as requirements. It points towards necessary changes and additions to process synthesis methods in order to realize their potential in this field.

AB Now GIS is turning into a good tool in handling geographical, economical, and population data, so we can obtain more and more information from these data. On the other hand, in some cases, for a calamity, such as hurricane, earthquake, flood, drought etc., or a decision-making, such as setting up a broadcasting transmitter, building a chemical plant etc., we have to evaluate the total population in the region influenced by a calamity or a project. In this paper, a method is put forward to evaluate the population in such special region. Through exploring the correlation of geographical parameters and the distribution of people in the same region by means of quantitative analysis and qualitative analysis, unit population database (1km x 1km) is established. In this way, estimating the number of people in a special region is capable by adding up the population in every grid involved in this region boundary. The geographical parameters are obtained from topographic database and DEM database on the scale of 1: 250 000. The fundamental geographical parameter database covering county administrative boundaries and 1km x 1km grid is set up and the population database at county level is set up as well. Both geographical parameter database and unit population database are able to offer sufficient conditions for quantitative analysis. They will have important role in the research fields of data mining (DM), Decision-making Support Systems (DSS), and regional sustainable development.

AB Flame-spread phenomena over thin solids are investigated for purely forced-opposing and concurrent flows. A two-dimensional, opposed-flow, flame-spread model, with flame radiation, has been formulated and solved numerically. In the first part of the paper, flammability limits and spread rates in opposed flow are presented, using oxygen percentage, free-stream velocity, and flow-entrance length as parameters. The comparison of the flammability boundaries and spread-rate curves for two different entrance lengths exhibits a cross-over phenomenon. Shorter entrance length results in higher spread rates and a lower oxygen-extinction limit in low free-stream velocities, but lower spread rates and a higher oxygen-extinction limit in high free-stream velocities. The entrance length affects the effective flow rate that the flame sees at the base region. This affects the radiation loss and gas residence-time in an opposing way to cause the cross-over. Radiation also affects the energy balance on the solid surface and is in part responsible for the solid-fuel non-burn-out phenomenon. In the second part of the paper, a comparison of flammability limits and flame-spreading rates between opposing and concurrent spreading flames are made; both models contain the same assumptions and properties. While the spread rate in concurrent spread increases linearly with free-stream velocity, the spread rate in opposed flow varies with free-stream velocity in a non-monotonic manner, with a peak rate at an intermediate free-stream velocity. At a given free-stream velocity, the limiting oxygen limits are lower for concurrent spread, except in the very low free-stream-velocity regime, where the spreading flame may be sustainable in opposed mode and not in concurrent mode. The cross-over disappears if the two spread modes are compared using relative flow velocities with respect to the flames rather than using free-stream velocities with respect to the laboratory.

AB In this paper, I critically examine a number of notions about interdisciplinary research approaches to the challenges posed by the world today. I juxtapose this critique with a discussion of interdisciplinary developments in Pacific studies, raising questions as to how deeper dialogues between academic disciplines and the worldviews of Pacific Islanders may be reached. While interdisciplinarity is widely seen as a politically correct agenda for contemporary research on processes of globalization and development, caution is needed against prevailing optimism about the potential for solving multidisciplinary problems through interdisciplinary innovation. Such optimism may overrate the potentials of broad (as opposed to deep) research approaches and may reflect disregard, if not arrogance, toward the complexity of the matters addressed. The drive in some European countries for research on "sustainable development" indicates close ties between interdisciplinary aspirations and the bureaucratic ambitions of research administrators. Under such circumstances interdisciplinarity becomes an object of institutional conflict and internal debate between institutions, as well as between bureaucrats and scientists, more than a question of creative epistemological contact between plural knowledges in and beyond academic disciplines in a search for increased knowledge more generally. The avoidance of such pitfalls in the further development of Pacific studies requires close attention to and appreciation of initiatives from within Oceania, coming from beyond the domains of conventional disciplines. In this paper, such paths toward interdisciplinarity are exemplified in a discussion of epistemological encounters between Oceanic and western knowledges, and with reference to the emerging currents of "Native Pacific Cultural Studies.".

AB The objective was to determine whether the inhalation of large quantities of feedyard dust predisposed the animals to pulmonary bacterial proliferation. Two control groups, C1 and C2, did not receive dust treatments, and two principal groups (P1 and P2) received a total of 14 dust treatments each. The CI and PI groups of goats each received a transthoracic challenge of live Mannheimia haemolytica (4 X 106 colony forming units, CFU) The C2 and P2 groups of goats each received a transthoracic challenge of live Pasteurella multocida (1.0 X 10(6) CFU/goat). The results showed that dusted animals had fever when compared with non-dusted controls. In addition, dusted animals demonstrated a leukocytosis with neutrophilia after the first dust treatment that was not sustainable. Finally, dusted animals demonstrated pulmonary clearance of two potential bacterial pathogens that was not significantly different from that shown by control (not dusted) animals.

TI Quality design: A planning methodology for the integration of refugee

DE Uganda; quality design; health services
AB In an emergency, the international community responds to the immediate health needs of refugees through the establishment of action-oriented, life-saving services. Healthcare delivery is often managed with limited, if any, coordination with local health management structures. In situations where refugees remain in the host country for many years, sustainability issues inevitably arise. Refugee-hosting governments may ultimately be called upon to assume the management and funding of refugee services. Planning for service integration, while protecting against declines in service quality, is a challenge in the typically resource-poor host environments. This paper discusses these issues by presenting the experience of the West Nile districts in northern Uganda, and describes quality design as a relevant planning methodology. Quality design is a systematic planning approach that documents and directly incorporates the service users' self-defined expectations and needs.

ID ECOSYSTEMS
AB This paper develops a methodology for identifying that natural capital-called critical natural capital (CNC)-the maintenance of which is essential for environmental sustainability. By consideration of the characteristics of natural capital, of the environmental functions that these characteristics enable natural capital to perform and of the importance of these functions to humans and the biosphere, it shows how sustainability standards in respect of these environmental functions may be derived. The difference between the current situation and these standards is termed the sustainability gap. The methodology that emerges from bringing these ideas together into a single analytical framework enables policy makers to identify the extent of current unsustainability, the principal causes of it, the elements and processes of natural capital (the CNC) which need to be maintained or restored to close the sustainability gap and the costs of so doing. The framework should therefore be of use in identifying priorities and policies for moving towards environmental sustainability. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Critical natural capital (CNC) is commonly defined as that part of the natural environment, which performs important and irreplaceable functions. So far, the challenge to determine the criticality of natural capital (NC) has mainly been taken up by the natural sciences, and the critical functions of nature mainly associated with its life-support and ecological services. Little attention has been paid to the socio-cultural functions of NC and to their values for the health and well being of human societies. The aim of this paper is to encourage a more complete accounting of the critical functions of NC and its associated values, by highlighting the importance of the information functions (health, recreation, amenity, education, heritage, etc.) for the quality and sustainability of human life. It is argued that, despite their immaterial and often intangible nature, these functions provide many, socio-economic benefits, which might be assessed through both qualitative and quantitative valuation methodologies. Integration of ecology, sociology and economics is essential to operationalize the concept of CNC as a tool for more balanced environmental planning and decision making.

ID ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
AB This paper appraises the integrity of France's patrimoine naturel as carrier of collective cultural meanings and as biophysical life support infrastructure. First we situate philosophically the French patrimoine naturel concept with its connotations of cultural heritage or transmission, in relation to the 'strong sustainability' precept of maintaining key environmental functions as critical natural capital (CNC). The main results are then presented of a recent survey by the French Institut Francais pour l'Environnement (IFEN) exploring perceptions of natural capital-and its criticalness-for the French society and economy. Building on the IFEN survey base, a qualitative analysis highlights France's natural capital as a life support infrastructure vulnerable to breakdown or contamination through pollution, accidents and the production of wastes. Ecosystem contamination is, moreover, closely associated with defilement of food-dioxin in chickens, mistrust of GMOs in agriculture and food, and the vache folle-mad cow disease. The 'sink' function of natural capital is thus in conflict with the culturally determined 'site' and 'scenery' functions. To conclude, we discuss (very briefly) some features of the French political culture that bear on prospects for a successful sustainable development strategy. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

DE framework; critical natural capital; environmental functions; water
AB This paper sets out an illustrative application to the UK of a new framework for identifying critical natural capital (CNC). This involves classifying the characteristics of natural capital and the environmental functions to which it gives rise, and then defining. standards of environmental sustainability for these functions. The framework then relates these functions to the economic system, through physical input-output tables, in order to identify the pressures on the functions and hence the extent to which the functions are not being maintained at a sustainable level. The framework is worked though in some detail for water, with less detailed application of it to air, land and habitats. The methodology can be used to identify areas of environmental unsustainability and the processes to which this unsustainability is due, so that policies to more towards sustainability may be more easily identified.

These related to air quality, river systems, forests, urban areas, coastal wetlands and agricultural and water resources. The paper concludes that the methodology provides a way of systematically considering different uses of and impacts on the environment, with a view to evaluating whether environmental functions are being used sustainably and the extent of any sustainability gap, identifying the source of environmental pressures, and monitoring whether policies aimed at environmental improvement are being effective.

ID CONSTRUCTED WETLANDS; POLLUTION CONTROL; NITROGEN REMOVAL
AB Total system life costs (capital cost and ecological based on released pathogens) were modeled for two-cell domestic treatment wetland systems and compared to costs of traditional and emerging technology systems. Small treatment wetlands that were operationally effective for 20-years had net present value (NPV) costs $500-3000 less than those of sand filter systems. The same treatment wetlands were modeled as releasing similar to 4 times pathogens, thus having a much higher ecological cost than sand filter systems. Wetland systems modeled using the highest possible pathogen treatment efficiencies still released similar to 2 times the pathogens of sand filter systems. Treatment wetlands must function a minimum of 10 years before replacement in order to remain equivalent in cost to a sand filter lasting 20-years using a 6.25% discount rate. The maximum allowable installation costs for any alternative system (with no annual expenses) were $6675-7700 if required to be equal in total system NPV costs to wetlands. NPV costs were found to be particularly sensitive to uncertainties in installation and maintenance costs. Modeling indicated that the capital savings realized using wetland systems could be used to modify the simple 2-cell design such that both capital and ecological loads delivered to the environment could be minimized. Wetlands may provide a more sustainable option for communities if effluent is centralized and treated in an appropriately scaled wetland system. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Conservation of crop genetic resources is now considered an important component of sustainable agricultural development. If conservation of genetic resources for agriculture is to be successful, a more complete understanding of the dynamics affecting traditional (landrace) crop populations is needed. We conducted a study of maize-based agriculture in the Central Highlands of Mexico in communities at 2400, 1700, 1400, and 1200 masl to assess the status Of traditional varieties in an area characterized by thorough integration into the national economy. Our research contradicts the view that modern varieties persist because of marginal conditions, deficient infrastructure, weaker markets, or traditional attitudes. One or two landraces dominated highland maize populations and farmers appeared to be more conservative in terms of their emphasis on traditional maize varieties than at lower elevations. The dominance of traditional varieties in the highlands is well known but poorly explained, and the coexistence of traditional and modern varieties in the mid-elevations was unexpected. Our highland study area has good roads, is near Mexico City, and is less than 50 km away from four major crop research institutes that have done maize breeding since 1950's. We suggest that in situ conservation of maize genetic resources in the highlands is sustained because the landraces there have good agronomic performance and are highly valued by farmers for their end-use qualities. At the mid-elevations, competition between local and modern maize was sharpest, and farmers have found that both landraces and improved varieties suit their needs, hence enhancing genetic diversity. Interventions and incentives would appropriately be carried out here to assure in situ conservation of locally adapted landraces of maize.

AB There is increasing pressure from communities neighbouring protected areas in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, to harvest resources from these areas. For example, Hyphaene coriacea Geartn. (vegetable ivory palm) leaves are extensively used by Zulu people for commercial and subsistence craftwork. This study investigates the effect of varying leaf harvest intensities on leaf production of Hyphaene coriacea in the Greater St Lucia Wetland Park in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, and aims to provide some management guidelines for sustainable use. Replicate plots subjected to three different harvest intensities were established and numbers and lengths of unopened leaves were monitored overfour years. Results suggest that a harvest intensity of one leaf stem(-1) year(-1) would be sustainable. This is equivalent to 34% of calculated annual production. The 650 ha harvest area is estimated to produce 191 750 leaves year(-1) (4793 bundles) which could be harvested sustainably.
   The effects of leaf harvest, even at maximum harvest rate, on lea production over the four year study period appear negligible although there was a slight decline over time in leaf production of trees subjected to high harvest intensity. A slight increase in leaf production was observed at moderate levels of harvest intensity.
   For the long term sustainable use of H. coriacea leaves, an adaptive management approach is recommended. This approach should be formulated with the users to include access rights and responsibility, economic benefit to the harvesters and monitoring of plant response to leaf harvest.

AB In any dynamic model of the economy with changing population, the latter should properly be one of the state variables of the system. It enters both in the maximand, at least under total utilitarianism, and into the production function in one way or another. If population growth is exponential and constant returns prevails, then a simple transformation to per capita variables can be used to eliminate one state variable, but this ceases to be true if growth is not exponential, as it obviously is not and cannot be. If the growth of population is exogenous, then introducing it into the system does not affect the optimal policy. However, if one asks whether the system is sustainable, in the sense of at least maintaining total welfare (integral of discounted utilities), then the criterion is that that the value of the rates of change of the state variables is non-negative, so that the shadow price of population becomes relevant. In this paper, we derive explicit formulas in a simple model, showing that the rate of growth of per capita capital is not the correct formula but must have another terms added to it. We also study the question under an alternative criterion of long-run average utilitarianism.

DT Article
DE China; scenarios; mitigation
AB In this paper, we have used the simulation model IMAGE/TIMER to develop a set of energy and emission scenarios for China between 1995 and 2100, based on the global baseline scenarios published by IPCC. The purpose of the study was to explore possible baseline developments and available options to mitigate emissions. The two main baseline scenarios of the study differ, among others, in the openness of the Chinese economy and in economic growth, but both indicate a rapid growth in carbon emissions (2.0% and 2.6% per year in the 2000-2050 period). The baseline scenario analysis also shows that an orientation on environmental sustainability can not only reduce other environmental pressures but also lower carbon emissions. In the mitigation analysis, a large number of options has been evaluated in terms of impacts on investments, user costs, fuel imports costs and emissions. It is found that a large potential exists to mitigate carbon emissions in China, among others in the form of energy efficiency improvement (with large co-benefits) and measures in the electricity sector. Combining all options considered, it appears to be possible to reduce emissions compared to the baseline scenarios by 50%. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI On promising niches and constraining sociotechnical regimes: the case of
   Dutch wheat and bread
SO ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING A
LA English
DT Article
AB Growing concerns about the consequences of large-scale production systems and, subsequently, the growing public demand for changing the dominant mode of agricultural production have become important issues on the European political agenda. In recent years the number of new or alternative food supply chains and networks that incorporate claims of sustainability and quality has grown impressively. However, compared to conventional food supply chains and networks these alternative chains and networks remain rather small. By using the example of Dutch wheat and bread, in this paper I demonstrate that the prevailing sociotechnical regime constrains the growth of new promising sustainable food supply chains and networks. Constraints are both of a technical and an institutional nature. Strategic niche management is proposed as a promising design tool to overcome some of the encountered constraints, with the aim of contributing to a transition towards a more sustainable sociotechnical regime.

TI Bushmeat and food security in the Congo Basin: linkages between wildlife

AB Tropical moist forests in Africa are concentrated in the Congo Basin. A variety of animals in these forests, in particular mammals, are hunted for their meat, termed bushmeat. This paper investigates current and future trends of bushmeat protein, and non-bushmeat protein supply, for inhabitants of the main Congo Basin countries. Since most bushmeat is derived from forest mammals, published extraction (E) and production (P) estimates of mammal populations were used to calculate the per person protein supplied by these. Current bushmeat protein supply may range from 30 g person(-1) day(-1) in the Democratic Republic of Congo, to 180 g person(-1) day(-1) in Gabon. Future bushmeat protein supplies were predicted for the next 50 years by employing current E:P ratios, and controlling for known deforestation and population growth rates. At current exploitation rates, bushmeat protein supply would drop 81% in all countries in less than 50 years; only three countries would be able to maintain a protein supply above the recommended daily requirement of 52 g person(-1) day(-1). However, if bushmeat harvests were reduced to a sustainable level, all countries except Gabon would be dramatically affected by the loss of wild protein supply. The dependence on bushmeat protein is emphasized by the fact that four out of the five countries studied do not produce sufficient amounts of non-bushmeat protein to feed their populations. These findings imply that a significant number of forest mammals could become extinct relatively soon, and that protein malnutrition is likely to increase dramatically if food security in the region is not promptly resolved.

AB This paper illustrates the opportunity for conservation offered by linking traditional agroecological knowledge and advances in adaptive management theory and practice. Drawing on examples from the Banawa-Marawola region of Central Sulawesi, Indonesia, a suite of traditional resource management practices premised on principles of adaptive management are identified and assessed, including: (1) resource management practices and regulations that are associated with the dynamics of complex systems; (2) procedural, planning and decision-making processes that foster learning; (3) sanctions and taboos that act as social mechanisms for the management and conservation of natural resources; and (4) ceremonies and social interactions that promote cultural internalization of the various practices, procedures and mechanisms. In addition, an emerging sociopolitical movement in the Banawa-Marawola region is explored. Premised on the strengthening of traditional rights and practices, the nascent Kamalise movement potentially provides the socio-political, institutional and organizational context needed to link traditional agroecological knowledge and adaptive management with broader conservation goals. Based on this analysis, two opportunities to enhance conservation in the region are identified: first, maintaining traditional agroecological systems and the associated adaptive resource management strategies used by local groups, and second, building upon the Kamalise movement to forge conservation alliances among communities, non-government and government organizations in which locally-evolved adaptive resource management strategies can be effectively applied. Both opportunities to combine traditional knowledge, adaptive management and conservation, however, are linked to the development aspirations of traditional groups: self-determination, acquisition of land rights and controlling the impacts of changes in livelihood.

DE Botswana; waste management; greenhouse gas emissions; climate change
AB Based on government and other relevant documentation, this paper explores the conceptual linkage between population, development, and waste management in Botswana and the implications of this relationship for global climate change. Population is increasing, albeit at a decreasing rate. Spatially, the population is becoming more and more concentrated as the rates and level of urbanization increase. Economic growth has remained consistently high. The combined effect of population dynamics and economic development are having a noticeable imprint on the environment in the form of increased waste generation. Poor waste management poses a real threat to environmental sustainability in general and climate change in particular because of inadequate technology, weak institutional mechanisms to enforce regulations, and low levels of sensitization among the public to deal with the problem. Mitigation measures are suggested to minimize the negative effects of waste management on climate change.

AB Improved data collection, quality control, analysis, and data management will provide a firm basis for future scientific understanding of the East Mediterranean coast of Turkey and will support long-term management. Various innovative procedures were proposed for a promising ecosystem-based approach to manage coastal wetlands in the Mediterranean: remote data acquisition with new technologies; environmental quality monitoring program that will provide a baseline for monitoring; linking a Geographic Information System (GIS) with natural resource management decision routines in the context of operational wetlands, fisheries, tourism management system; environmental sensitivity analysis to ensure that permitted developments are environmentally sustainable; and use of natural species to restore the wetlands and coastal dunes and sustain the system processes. The proposed management scheme will benefit the scientific community in the Mediterranean and the management/ planning community in Eastern Turkey.

   investment
SO ENVIRONMENTAL & RESOURCE ECONOMICS

DE consumption peak; net investment zero
ID SUSTAINABILITY
AB We investigate an intertemporal model with an exhaustible resource inflow which exhibits a single peak in consumption on the path of development. The peak follows the date at which net investment is zero. The "top" of consumption is higher and flatter and peaks later when the discount rate is lower. "Low" endowments of the exhaustible resource stock (and "high" discount rates) are associated with strictly declining consumption paths.

ID TRANSITION
AB The paper surveys Russia's engagement, both in terms of policy formulation and implementation, with the main initiatives outlined at the 1992 United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED). Although coverage extends through the entire period from 1992 to present, a particular focus is on recent developments under the Putin administration, a period characterized by an ostensibly utilitarian approach to environmental management. Russia's response to the recent World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD) is assessed in the broader context of the country's problems in effecting major environmental policy changes.

TI The business model concept: theoretical underpinnings and empirical
   illustrations
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article
ID INFORMATION-TECHNOLOGY; COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE; SUSTAINABILITY;
   PERFORMANCE
AB The business model concept is becoming increasingly popular within IS, management and strategy literature. It is used within many fields of research, including both traditional strategy theory and in the emergent body of literature on e-business. However, the concept is often used independently from theory, meaning model components and their interrelations are relatively obscure. Nonetheless, we believe that the business model concept is useful in explaining the relation between IS and strategy. This paper offers an outline for a conceptual business model, and proposes that it should include customers and competitors, the offering, activities and organisation, resources and factor market interactions. The causal inter-relations and the longitudinal processes by which business models evolve should also be included. The model criticises yet draws on traditional strategy theory and on the literature that addresses business models directly. The business model is illustrated by an ERP implementation in a European multi-national company.

DE Aral Sea; Central Asia; drought; salinisation; water security
AB The environmental adversities around the Aral Sea in Central Asia have been the subject of recent research. Attempts at sustainable provision of palatable drinking water in low chemical and microbial contaminants for the 4 million people in the two countries around the Aral littoral have been largely unsuccessful. In the last few years, severe drought has further depleted the amount of available water. This shortage has negatively impacted on agriculture, and accentuated the out migration of people. An appeal is made to assist the local population in this arid area to cope with the acute and chronic deterioration of water security.

AB The rotating presidency of the European Council is a curious, and unusual, institutional feature. I propose a formal theoretic model that compares a variety of decision-making procedures, including rotating the leadership position in a decision-making council, referendums on each policy issue, and electing a Council president. From the results of the model I conclude that the current version of the rotating presidency has a lot to recommend it. Rotating agenda-setting authority allows for the exploration of new mixtures of policies that might not be discovered or tried under other kinds of procedures. However, I also argue that, once the European Union expands to over 20 members, the procedure may no longer be sustainable.

The arguments supporting marine reserves are often based on both the nonmarket values of ecological amenities marine reserves provide and the pragmatic cost-saving advantages relating to reserve monitoring and enforcement. Marine reserves are, however, only one of a suite of possible policy options that might be used to achieve conservation and fisheries management objectives, and have rarely been the focus of rigorous policy analyses that consider a full range of economic costs and benefits, including the transaction costs of management. If credible analyses are not undertaken, there is a danger that current enthusiasm for marine reserves may wane as economic performance fails to meet presumed potential. Fully accounting for the value of ecological services flowing from marine reserves requires consideration of increased size and abundance of focal species within reserve boundaries, emigration of target species from reserves to adjacent fishing grounds, changes in ecological resilience, and behavioural responses of fishers to spatially explicit closures. Expanding policy assessments beyond standard cost-benefit analysis (CBA) also requires considering the impact of social capital on the costs of managing fisheries. In the short term, the amount of social capital that communities possess and the capacity of the state to support the rights of individuals and communities will affect the relative efficiency of marine reserves. Reserves may be the most efficient policy option when both community and state capacity is high, but may not be when one and/or the other is weak. in the longer term, the level of social capital that a society possesses and the level of uncertainty in ecological and social systems will also impact the appropriate level of devolution or decentralization of fisheries governance. Determining the proper balance of the state and the community in tropical fisheries governance will require broad comparative studies of marine reserves and alternative policy tools.

AB Mountains cover 24% of the Earth's land surface, are home to 12% of the global population, and include 28% of the world's forests. Mountain forests provide a wide range of benefits to both mountain and downstream populations, notably the protection of watersheds and of transport infrastructure. They are also important as centres of biodiversity; important sources of timber, fuelwood and non-wood products: places for tourism and recreation; and sacred places. Many are also being considered as possible carbon sinks to mitigate climate change. Mountain forests are subject to many forces of change, interacting in complex ways. The frequency of natural disturbances is increasingly influenced by human activities at local, regional, and global scales. Air pollution has influenced many forests down, wind of industrial areas, but climate change represents a greater and highly unpredictable force for change. It will require new types of decisions by all stakeholders, and new forest management approaches and policies. The International Year of Mountains, 2002, presents a unique opportunity to foster greater co-operation to ensure that mountain forests continue to provide benefits to a significant proportion of the world's population well into the 21(st) century and beyond.

AB This paper introduces the classification of Ecological Land Types (ELT) in eastern mountainous regions of northeast China and demonstrates ELT mapping for the Baihe Forestry Bureau on Changbai Mountain, lying along the border of China and North Korea. The development of ELTs will facilitate the adoption of ecological forest management and the restoration of native forest vegetation in northeast China. By overlaying forest inventory data with the ELT map, suggestions on ecosystem forest management are discussed in this paper.

AB Forest stand structure is an important element for biodiversity and, from a sustainable forest management perspective, uneven-sized stands should be managed in order to maintain the structural diversity over the landscape. The first objective of this study is to develop a statistical tool to characterize stand structure that can be used in forest management planning. The second objective is to classify the stand structure of two regions to illustrate a possible use for the tool. The statistical tool for characterizing stand structure has been developed from forest inventory data gathered by the ministere des Ressources naturelles du Quebec, using discriminant analysis. The analysis makes it possible to classify the stands into three types of structure, even-sized, uneven-sized and inverse J-shaped, with an error rate estimated at only 7%. Proportions of different structure types in Quebec's eastern black spruce forest region have been compared with those found in the western black spruce forest region. Nearly 90% of the western black spruce forest region is composed of pure black spruce stands, contrary to the eastern black spruce region, where there are more pure fir and mixed spruce-fir stands. Most of the western black spruce forest stands are even-sized (62%), while almost 70% of the eastern black spruce forest stands are uneven-sized or inverse J-shaped. Pure black spruce stands are more even-sized than pure fir stands, but regional differences are also found within pure black spruce stands. Our results show that it is possible to develop a robust tool that makes it possible to classify thousands of stands rapidly. Such tools are required if we want to consider stand structure for appropriate management prescriptions in the boreal forest.

AB In recent decades, the context in which institutions of forest management make decisions to formulate management priorities has changed radically. Today, it is widely accepted that members of the public should be involved in decision-making. Despite a tremendous gain in support, however, previous literature remains critical of the design, implementation and effectiveness of public participation processes. In seeking to identify the attributes that constitute successful public participation, we conducted a critical assessment of a current process. This paper reveals the results of a case study of a land use and forest management planning initiative in central British Columbia. Our primary data include: document review; qualitative interviews with citizen members actively involved in the process (n = 14); and a random telephone survey (n = 100) of local residents (response rate = 45.6%). Through the application of six a priori evaluation criteria, we establish strengths, weaknesses and gaps of the process. Results of the study reflect a lack of institutional mechanisms in place to ensure appropriate public access and adequate representation. The findings also indicate that the incorporation of teamwork, collaborative learning and two-way information flow are important as a basis for constructive and effective public participation. Finally, we argue that the value added by such attributes can be enhanced through better design and facilitation at both the structural and operational levels.

AB The Knysna Basin, a southern Cape catchment, drains into the Knysna estuary. The landscape characteristics are the product of a long geomorphic evolution resulting in high sensitivity to change. Consideration of the geomorphology is followed by examples of impacts on the estuary and adjacent areas. The need for sustainability in the context of development is argued. The paper is a southern African contribution to the landscape sensitivity issue.

AB Recently, microcredit has become a fashionable cure-all for most non-govern mental organizations (NGOs) in Bangladesh. The provision of services to the poor is by definition always difficult, and even NGOs have problems. NGOs in Bangladesh define the poor in different ways when creating their target groups. The policies of nearly all NGOs in Bangladesh are formulated by their senior managers, and field workers are rarely consulted. This paper will explore the opinions on microcredit of selected field workers of four types of NGOs in Bangladesh - on how the problem of microcredit might be solved. Problems of microcreclit programmes, they say, include non-accessibility to the poorest, low return, misuse and overemphasis on repayment. Field workers discuss what level of importance should be given to microcreclit as against services like education, health or awareness creation. Most conclude that NGOs are overemphasizing microcredit, which leaves little time and few resources for other problems of the poor, so bringing the whole 'development' effort of the NGOs into question. Most field workers think that many microenterprises are not sustainable and that in many cases clients will remain dependent on the NGOs for credit.

DE agenda 21; nutrition; environment; ecology; health protection agency
AB Nutrition ecology is the science that studies the impacts of human nutrition on the environment, on human health and on social systems. Environmental impacts are usually the result of intensive food production, food transport and foodpackaging; they include soil contamination and erosion, energy consumption, air contamination and waste disposals. Health impacts of contemporary western eating behavior concern nutrition-related diseases (diabetes, hypertension, gout, overweight etc) and their psychological and social consequences; nutrition ecology aims at a balanced diet and suitable eating behavior to reduce the risks of chronic disease. The social impacts of nutrition concern the effects of feed trade on poor working conditions and poverty, especially in developing countries. The strategies of nutrition ecology agree in many points with those of the agenda 21 and of Consumer Protection. As nutrition-related diseases are increasing further, the public health services in Germany discover nutrition as an important topic in health promotion and prevention. They will contribute remarkably to a sustainable development if they include the strategies of nutrition ecology in their projects.

ID SPECIES RICHNESS; HEALTH; CHINA
AB Aim To develop the first national databases on land use and agricultural land use intensity in Canada for a wide variety of environmental monitoring applications.
   Location Canada.
   Methods In this paper, we describe a new system for the construction of both land use and land use intensity (within agricultural regions) called LUCIA (land use and cover with intensity of agriculture). Our methodology combines the highly detailed Canadian Census of Agriculture and recent growing season composites derived from the SPOT4/VEGETATION sensor. Census data are of much coarser resolution than the remotely sensed data but, by removing non-agricultural pixels from each census sampling area, we were able to refine the census data sufficiently to allow their use as ground truth data in some areas. The 'refined' census data were then used in the final step of an unsupervised classification of the remotely sensed data.
   Results and main conclusions The results of the land use classification are generally consistent with the input census data, indicating that the LUCIA output reflects actual land use trends as determined by national census information. Land use intensity, defined as the principal component of census variables that relate to agricultural inputs and outputs (e.g. chemical inputs, fertilizer inputs and manure outputs), is highest in the periphery of the great plains region of central Canada but is also very high in southern Ontario and Quebec.

AB The implications for the agricultural productivity of the UK upland sheep systems of reducing nitrogen fertilizer application and lowering stocking rates on perennial ryegrass/white clover swards were studied over 4 years at a site in Wales. The system involved grazing ewes and lambs from birth to weaning on swards maintained at a constant height with surplus herbage made into silage, thereafter ewes and weaned lambs grazed on separate areas until the onset of winter with adjustments to the size of the areas grazed and utilizing surplus pasture areas for silage. Four stocking rates [SR 18, 15, 12 and 9 ewes ha(-1) on the total area (grazed and ensiled)] and two levels of annual nitrogen fertilizer application (N 200 and 50 kg ha(-1)) were studied in five treatments (N200/SR18, N200/SR15, N50/SR15, N50/SR12 and N50/SR9). Average white clover content was negatively correlated with the level of annual nitrogen fertilizer application. White clover content of the swards was maintained over the duration of the experiment with an increasing proportion of clover in the swards receiving 50 kg N ha(-1). Control of sward height and the contribution from white clover resulted in similar levels of lamb liveweight gain from birth to weaning in all treatments but fewer lambs reached the slaughter live weight by September at the higher stocking rates and with the lower level of fertilizer application. Three of the five treatments provided adequate winter fodder as silage (N200/SR15, N50/SR12 and N50/SR9). Because of the failure to make adequate winter fodder and the failure of white clover to fully compensate for reduction in nitrogen fertilizer application, it is concluded that nitrogen fertilizer can only be reduced on upland sheep pastures if accompanied by reduced stocking rates.

AB The restoration and development of health care systems in post-conflict situations and complex emergencies are attracting attention. Kosovo is,unique in being a post-conflict situation, in a former socialist country, with an unclear political future, under temporary UN administration. The World Health Organization (WHO) led a process of developing a health policy framework for the emergency period that included elements of health sector reform, a somewhat controversial initiative. Reform elements of the policy were consistent with normative health policies in much of eastern and central Europe. There was tension between the need to have a policy in place rapidly and the desire to be participatory. Policy to deal with emergency situations that is not available at the time required is of limited value. Although there was some tension between relief and development agendas, the policy process did direct significant resources and effort in directions that contributed to longer-term reform and development. A policy framework does not ensure compliance with policy unless issues of authority, mandate, and leadership are clear. A rapidly developed health policy framework at the onset of an emergency is desirable. Policy developers should be experienced, seen as being neutral and be relatively independent of any specific donor or interest group. WHO is well situated to play this role if it meets certain conditions. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI The SAZA study: implementing health financing reform in South Africa and
   Zambia
SO HEALTH POLICY AND PLANNING
LA English

   policy analysis; policy process; South Africa; Zambia
AB This paper explores the policy-making process in the 1990s in two countries, South Africa and Zambia, in relation to health care financing reforms. While much of the analysis of health reform programmes has looked at design issues, assuming that a technically sound design is the primary requirement of effective policy change, this paper explores the political and bureaucratic realities shaping the pattern of policy change and its impacts. Through a case study approach, it provides a picture of the policy environment and processes in the two countries, specifically considering the extent to which technical analysts and technical knowledge were able to shape policy change.
   The two countries' experiences indicate the strong influence of political factors and actors over which health care financing policies were implemented, and which not, as well as over the details of policy design. Moments of political transition in both countries provided political leaders, specifically Ministers of Health, with windows of opportunity in which to introduce new policies. However, these transitions, and the changes in administrative structures introduced with them, also created environments that constrained the processes of reform design and implementation and limited the equity and sustainability gains achieved by the policies. Technical analysts, working either inside or outside government, had varying and often limited influence. In part, this reflected the limits of their own capacity as well as weaknesses in the way they were used in policy development. In addition, the analysts were constrained by the fact that their preferred policies often received only weak political support. Focusing almost exclusively on designing policy reforms, these analysts gave little attention to generating adequate support for the policy options they proposed. Finally, the country experiences showed that front-line health workers, middle level managers and the public had important influences over policy implementation and its impacts. The limited attention given to communicating policy changes to, or consulting with, these actors only heightened the potential for reforms to result in unanticipated and unwanted impacts.
   The strength of the paper lies in its 'thick description' of the policy process in each country, an empirical case study approach to policy that is under-represented in the literature. While such an approach allows only a cautious drawing of general conclusions, it suggests a number of ways in which to strengthen the implementation of financing policies in each country.

AB Over the last two decades there has been growing interest in the potential of Social Health Insurance (SHI) as a health care financing mechanism in low- and middle-income countries. SHI schemes exist in many countries of Latin America and have also been introduced across Asia in recent years. However, few countries in Africa have implemented SHI. Despite the sustained interest in SHI, there are growing concerns about whether it will achieve equity and financial sustainability objectives. It is clear that the design of SHI is of critical importance in this regard. South Africa has debated whether or not to implement SHI for nearly a decade and a half, and the design of SHI proposals has changed dramatically over that period. This paper considers lessons that can be drawn from the South African experience of developing and adapting SHI design, in conjunction with recent evidence from other low- and middle-income countries. The paper illustrates how SHI design may be affected by the trade-offs that are made to accommodate key actors' views, an accommodation that may even undermine the achievement of key objectives. A critical design requirement to promote equity and sustainability is a common contribution and risk pool across the SHI and any existing private insurers. In addition, given the complexity of SHI reforms, and the fact that SHI is usually only one component of a broader package of health sector reforms, the appropriate sequencing of implementation of the SHI and associated, supporting organizational and financing reforms is essential. As SHI evolves within a country, it is important to benchmark the changing nature of its design against pre-determined objectives in order to protect the final integrity of the policy.

AB This paper compares recent experience in the use of the planning system to facilitate the provision of affordable housing in rural areas of Scotland and England. Following an introduction summarising key issues arising from the relevant literature, the paper first sets out the scale of need for rural affordable housing in the two countries and then summarises the differing planning policy frameworks. Scale of delivery is then addressed and an attempt is made to establish the extent to which differences in performance reflect variations in policy, delivery mechanisms or differing housing markets. The hypothesis is advanced that Scotland, although a more rural country, has made less use of planning policy to tackle issues relating to the need for rural social housing. In both countries scale of provision has lagged behind perceived need and a major reason for this would appear to be the tensions in planning policy between environmental and social sustainability objectives, with the scales so far weighted towards the environmental rather than the social imperative.

AB Conceptualizing environmental problems as sustainability problems contributing to local and global environmental change requires an understanding of how societies cope with their natural environment. Indicators for society-nature interactions are fairly well developed for national-level analyses. This study adapts some of these indicators to the local level and relates them to a qualitative assessment of economic and cultural change in a single community. Indicators are derived from material and energy flow accounting methods and address two major objectives: Firstly, to identify mutual influences between the global and the local level. Secondly, to assess future potentials of environmental pressures and impacts that can be expected to occur as such communities follow a path of further modernization. This study of a small rice-farming community in Northeast Thailand deals with physical as well as sociocultural aspects in order to produce a broad picture of society nature relations. The indicators developed portray a society in the midst of transition and rapid modernization. This becomes apparent when comparing the results to those of similar studies in traditional and industrial societies. What we see is a community struggling to adapt to global influences, while at the same time maintaining subsistence with traditional coping mechanisms.

AB Despite new research on agricultural intensification, we still have limited knowledge of the determinants of technology adoption in low-density, limited-market regions, particularly in humid tropical forests. This lacuna has led to divergent opinions about the impacts of intensification on land use in the Brazilian Amazon, well-known for deforestation of fragile tropical ecosystems. This paper takes up the case of the Amazon to address two questions concerning the adoption of agricultural technologies: 1) what are its social determinants, and 2) what are its land use correlates. Empirical data come from a recent survey of smallholders along the Transamazon highway. The first part of the analysis, consisting of models of eight agricultural technologies, shows that households with more labor and capital are more likely to adopt technologies. The second part shows that for all technologies, adopters have more land cleared than do non-adopters. These findings raise questions for further research on intensification while also suggesting policy prescriptions to mitigate deforestation.

   TRENDS
AB Development policy makers increasingly focus on the informal sector as an area to alleviate poverty and promote gender equity. Female self-employment is especially encouraged because higher incomes for women empower them, improve the health of their families, and alleviate poverty in society at large. In this context, development institutions have been urged to increase female participation in artisanal mining. However, knowledge about the gains and costs to women who earn a living in informal, artisanal mines is sparse. This study analyzes women's self-employment in artisanal gold mines in Suriname, South America. The results suggest that if long-term social and health conditions are considered, work in the informal mining sector is not likely to improve the quality of life in the interior of Suriname. The analysis contributes to informal-sector research by focusing on women and on rural regions, two areas of investigation that have received relatively little attention. The author cautions against development policy that narrowly focuses on economic growth and efficiency, and argues that public policy that anticipates long-tern health, cultural, and social outcomes has a better chance of being sustainable.

AB The, development, of heat, sinks for, microelectronic applications, which are compatible with sustainable development, involves the achievement of a subtle balance between a superior thermal design, minimum material consumption, and minimum pumping power. This presentation explores the potential for the least-energy optimization of natural and forced convection,cooled rectangular plate heat sinks. The results are evaluated in terms of a heat sink Coefficient of Performance, relating the cooling rapability to the energy invested in the fabrication and operation of the heat sink, and compared to the entropy generation minimization methodology (EGM).

ID INITIATION; INVITRO
AB Leptadenia reticulata (Retz.) Wight. & Arn., an important herbal medicinal plant, belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae. This plant has been known for its medicinal uses since 4500 bc. Presently this is an endangered species. There is a need for applying non-conventional methods of propagation for conservation and sustainable utilization of biodiversity of Leptadenia reticulata. We developed a micropropagation method for mass multiplication of L. reticulata. Explants harvested from greenhouse-maintained and field-grown plants were used to establish cultures of L. reticulata. The nodal shoot segments were surface-sterilized and cultured on Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium along with additives (25 mg l(-1) each of adenine sulfate, arginine, and citric acid, and 50 mg l(-1) ascorbic acid) containing 0.6 muM indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) and 9 muM N-6-benzyladenine (BA). Three to four shoots differentiated from each node within 25-30 d at 26 +/- 2degreesC and 36 mumol m(-2) s(-1) spectral flux photon (SFP) for 12 h d(-1). Shoots were further multiplied by (1) repeated transfer of mother explant on fresh medium containing 0.6 muM IAA and 2.2 muM BA, and (2) subculture of in vitro-differentiated shoots on MS medium with 6.6 muM BA and 0.6 muM IAA. After three or four subcultures, the basal clump with shoot bases was divided into three or four subclumps and multiplied on the fresh medium. From each clump 15-20 shoots regenerated within 25 d. Ninety percent of the in vitro-produced shoots rooted ex vitro if these were pulse-treated with 123 muM each of indole-3-butyric acid and beta-naphthoxyacetic acid. The plantlets were transferred to bottles containing sterile 'soilrite' (soilless compost and soil conditioner) moistened with half-strength MS macrosalts. Ninety-five percent of the plantlets were hardened in the bottles within 15 d. The hardened plants were then transferred to black polybags in the nursery. Field transferred plants are growing normally and have flowered. The protocol developed is reproducible. From a single nodal segment about 1700 hardened plants could be regenerated within 174 d.

AB A field experiment was conducted at the Central Arid Zone Research Institute, Jodhpur, during 1998-2001, to assess the production potential and economic feasibility of clusterbean or guar [Cyamopsis tetragonoloba (L.) Taubert]-based cropping systems. Treatments comprised 2 cropping systems, viz. guar-mustard [Brassic juncea (L) Czernj. & Cosson] and guar-blond psyllium or isabgol (Plantago ovata Forsk.), with 4 fertility levels to guar crop (control, one-third of RDF, two-thirds of RDF and full RDF, i.e. 20 kg N + 40 kg P2O5/ha). Maximum seed yield of guar was recorded under full recommended dose of fertilizers (RDF) which was significantly higher over the control and one-third of RDF in all the seasons. Application of full recommended dose and two-thirds RDF to guar had also carry-over effect on succeeding mustard as well as isabgol crops. However, the residual effect of one-third RDF was not significant. The sustainability-yield index was maximum (0.85) in case of guar-mustard rotation with RDF and two-thirds of RDF, followed by one-third RDF However, maximum gross and net returns per annum were higher in guar-isabgol cropping system than guar-mustard system with RDF.

AB In our study, we empirically examined the relationships among perceived environmental uncertainty (PEUN), the level of the strategic applications and the facilitators of IS strategic alignment. Using a systems approach, we also showed some ways that these relationships impact the performance of a firm. Apparently, PEUN has an indirect effect on IS strategic applications through the facilitators of alignment. An uncertain environment, a high level of strategic applications and well-arranged facilitators of alignment can contribute more to the improvement of performance than in a less uncertain or stable environment. Therefore, the benefits of a high level of strategic applications can still be realized in a competitive and uncertain environment. However, when the environment is stable (low PEUN), an excessively low level of strategic applications may decrease a firm's performance. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Digital divide in India: Need for correcting urban bias
SO INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND LIBRARIES
LA English
DT Article
AB A digital library is a capital- and technology-intensive project. It is a great challenge to develop digital libraries in countries like India in light of the problems of shrinking budget; high initial and recurring expenditure; and social and economic problems of illiteracy, population growth, poor health conditions, inadequacy of resources for development programs, and weak inftastructure. While access to digital information is possible in more than two hundred cities in India, "voice telephony" is still a major medium of information transfer in villages. This paper discusses the social and economic issues that need to be considered to bridge this digital divide between rural and urban populations in order to ensure sustainable development of the country.

TI Overcoming the scientific generation gap in Africa: an urgent priority
SO INTERDISCIPLINARY SCIENCE REVIEWS
LA English
DT Article
AB Based on recently completed studies,this paper attempts to provide a realistic picture of the scientific profession in Africa today. Activities in science and technology (S&T) have gone through a process of institutionalisation and professionalisation in Africa over the last thirty years, but,these efforts have not been sufficient to create a sustainable dynamic of scientific production or of regeneration of national scientific communities. The situation today is critical, with S&T systems and the working environments of scientists deteriorating in many countries. While institutional mechanisms such as centres of excellence and S&T diasporas can, under certain conditions, contribute to the regionalisation and internationalisation of African science, they will never substitute for the weaknesses of national research systems. In the battle for sustainable development in Africa, nothing will replace home grown scientific capacities, and it is high time for the conditions for their renewal to be created. The results of empirical studies discussed in this article not only provide a vivid picture of the present day conditions of the scientific profession on the African continent, they also contribute to a diagnosis of the situation as one of political urgency.

TI What do criteria and indicators assess? An analysis of five C&I sets
   relevant for forest management in the Brazilian Amazon
SO INTERNATIONAL FORESTRY REVIEW

DT Article
DE criteria and indicators; sustainability; forest management; Amazon
   region
AB The diversity of criteria and indicators (C&I) sets is often a cause for uncertainty and confusion, and probably one of the reasons for the still unsatisfactory acceptance of C&I as a support for implementation of sustainable forest management. In order to address this erosion of confidence in C&I this paper evaluates the diversity of five C&I sets (CIFOR, ACM, FSC, ITTO and Tarapoto) relevant for the Brazilian Amazon by analysing frequencies of C&I in relation to parameters about content and quality. The study demonstrated that the C&I sets, although addressing the social, technical, ecological and economic dimensions of sustainability, exhibit different thematic foci. A general lack of validity was attested as well as missing specificity and practicability of the indicators. In order to increase objectivity and transparency, the C&I have to reflect more clearly and unambiguously what is actually assessed. It is recommended to include a discussion about verifiers and assessment methods in the development of C&I sets. To avoid misunderstandings and to introduce the possibility for less complex and more practicable C&I sets, the authors recommend constriction of the objective of the assessment to more clearly serve the potential clients and frame-conditions for its application.

AB The objective of this study was to assess the perceptions of Forest Department (FD) staff and local people regarding the implementation of Joint Forest Management (JFM). The study involved an investigation of I 10 people from 14 village forest committees falling under seven forest divisions of two forest circles Hoshangabad and Jabalpur of Madhya Pradesh State of India. Both FD staff and local people indicated a trend towards developing positive perceptions towards each other and a significant improvement in the inter relationship between the two was found. Both sides perceived that JFM has instilled a participatory approach in the functioning of the FD and committees to some extent. However, both also consider that JFM is yet to be institutionalised and joint efforts on their part are essential to make it sustainable for use in the future.

While successful in establishing an extensive network of teacher trainers and a standardised approach to teacher professional development, observations indicate that the teaching practices of many teachers remained unaffected. This unique approach is examined in terms of the. sustainability of the teaching methodologies promoted by the project.

AB Background Following the introduction of the public long-term care (LTC) insurance in Japan on 1 April 2000, funding that had been split between the health and social welfare sectors was unified. All elderly people 65 and over have become entitled to receive benefits according to their eligibility level, regardless of income or family support. Except for those assessed as in the least dependent group, individuals can choose either community care or institutional care, with only the cost of food an additional payment for the latter.
   Method Review of the development and implications of long term care insurance provision for older people and analysis of quality based on resident level data.
   Results Despite the structural changes, the impact of the new programme has had minimal impact upon the providers of institutional care. The three types of facilities that had provided LTC have continued to function independently, basically retaining the same staffing requirements and charges. For indicators adjusted for risk, the quality of care tended to be higher in designated LTC hospital beds.
   Conclusions Appropriate balance between institutional and community care and triaging among the three different types of facilities remains difficult because decisions rest with the individual. Indicators of quality must take into account differences in case-mix among the facility types. However, there are few incentives for providers to improve quality because demand is likely to be increasingly greater than supply. Whether the generous provisions of the new programme will prove to be sustainable remains to be seen. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

DE hydrogen economy; sustainable development; long-term scenario
ID GREENHOUSE-GAS EMISSIONS; ENERGY TECHNOLOGIES; DYNAMICS; WORLD
AB A long-term hydrogen-based scenario of the global energy system is described in qualitative and quantitative terms here, illustrating the key role of hydrogen in a long-term transition toward a clean and sustainable energy future. In an affluent, low-population-growth, equity and sustainability-oriented B1-H-2 world, hydrogen technologies experience substantial but plausible performance and costs improvements and are able to diffuse extensively. Corresponding production and distribution infrastructures emerge. The global hydrogen production system, initially fossil based, progressively shifts toward renewable sources. Fuel cells and other hydrogen-using technologies play a major role in a substantial transformation toward a more flexible, less vulnerable, distributed energy system which meets energy needs in a cleaner, more efficient and cost-effective way. This profound structural transformation of the global energy system brings substantial improvements in energy intensity and security of supply and results in an accelerated decarbonization of the energy mix, with subsequent relatively low climate impacts. Such energy-system path might still not be sufficient to protect against the risk of high climate sensitivities, but hydrogen-based technologies emerge as flexible options for the energy system and, thus, would be prime candidates for a risk management strategy against an uncertain climate future.

TI Fair trade as a strategy for international competitiveness
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND WORLD ECOLOGY

DT Article
DE sustainable development; globalisation; free trade; fair trade
AB At the centre of the debate surrounding sustainable development is a recognition that companies can make a major contribution by being environmentally and socially responsible and that tools associated with these concepts can enhance the competitiveness and economic performance of the firm. In this paper we go further in arguing that in a world of globalisation it is equally important to look at issues of international trade.
   In an examination of free trade we argue that it is neither fully consistent with sustainable development nor to the benefit of business. We point to a new imperative to develop sound sourcing, and equitable and fair trading relationships. We identify issues associated with fair trade (including issues of human rights, fair wages, sustainability reporting procedures and codes of conduct on ethics) and associated tools of analysis (guaranteed prices, codes of conduct and end price audits).
   The paper argues that in a world of globalisation with greater transparency and information availability it will be important for companies to be clear about their policies on supply chain management and trade. Indeed, with the growth of an active and sophisticated civil society, it will be argued that policies associated with sound sourcing, equitable trade and fair trade could provide companies with a new competitive strategy based on ethical standards communicated to the consumer through a strategy of differentiation. We explore strategies for the integration of fair trade policies, strategies and standards, and the opportunities for new markets and niches that this presents. It is argued that the integration of fair trade into a business strategy can enhance competitiveness.

   water; environment; eco-design; Vietnam
AB In many Asian cities the public water Supply is characterised by low pressure, frequent interruptions and occasional contamination. Hence, private households have to store water and increase pressure individually to ensure an uninterrupted supply at sufficient pressure and water for drinking has to be boiled or supplied separately in bottles. In this study the present water supply system in Hanoi and a number of modification options were analysed from an environmental point of view through life cycle assessment (LCA) in order to identify the most sustainable solutions for future water supply. It was found that the boiling of water for drinking was the largest source of impacts in the present system. Impacts could be reduced significantly if the public supply network was improved and private pumping and storage could be avoided and if the water could be used directly for drinking. It was also found that impacts could be reduced if consumers used bottled water for drinking instead of boiling tap water. Finally, it was demonstrated that even if drinking water cannot be supplied directly through the public network, a reliable public water supply at high pressure is environmentally advantageous. Sensitivity analyses revealed that the conclusions of this study are likely to be applicable to other cities with similar water supply systems.

DE consumerism; materialism; sustainability; biophilia; economic growth;
   ecosystem integrity; biospheric life support system
AB Conflicts over global resources involving war or terrorism, or both, destroy natural capital and, thus, make resources scarcer. Sustainable use of the planet will require a fairer, more equitable distribution of resources not only among humans but with the millions of other species with which humans share the planet. The quest for greater material possessions - materialphilia - is unsustainable on a finite planet that has a growing population and greater expectations per capita of material affluence. However, biophilia, the innately emotional affiliation of human beings to other living organisms, should, if widely practiced, result in a greater accumulation of natural capital. This strategy should lead to greater protection of the planet's ecological life support system, which is a primary need for sustainability.

AB Ecological accounting is concerned with providing information to assist managers with performance appraisal, control, decision-making and reporting for an organisation or region. It is based on ecological concepts and on ecological measures and values in addition to the familiar economics ones. The implementation of sustainable development requires a cultural change and ecological accounting would represent a part of this change within both organisations and wider society. In many ways, ecological accounting could help bring sustainable development into common sense and give it a place as a day-to-day business goal.

AB Guangzhou has ambitions to build itself into a world class metropolis by 2010. Sustainable development is the only way to achieve this magnificent goal. Based on the ecological perspective of sustainable development and the principles of ecosystem integrity, this paper develops an approach for evaluation of sustainable development in Guangzhou between 1986 and 1995. A hierarchical evaluation system of four tiers of sustainability indicators was established. Using the method of fuzzy multistage synthetic evaluation, sustainability development level index, QIx, was calculated for the indicators at the B, C, D, and E tiers. Development stages were identified based on these index values. The coordination degree among the economic, social, and natural subsystems was also computed. Further, an overall sustainability index for each year was computed by combining the development level index and the coordination degree. It was found that the urban ecosystem in Guangzhou had generally become more sustainable, in spite of fluctuations in coordination degree. The development level index of the economic subsystem has surpassed that of social and natural subsystems since 1995. Appropriate measures must be taken to ensure coordinated development among the subsystems for the purpose of sustainable development.

TI Displacement, host governments' policies, and constraints on the
   construction of sustainable livelihoods
SO INTERNATIONAL SOCIAL SCIENCE JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
AB After brief discussion of the general losses refugees incur in connection with displacement, the paper examines empirically the structural and institutional factors that discourage refugees from taking initiatives to recoup their losses and to construct sustainable livelihoods in countries of asylum, as well as the conditions that perpetuate poverty, vulnerability, and marginalisation. The paper argues that in developing countries refugee status, regardless of duration, leads to the acquisition of neither nationality nor denizenship. Basic rights and sources of. livelihoods are apportioned on the basis of nationality and not residence. Lack of belonging to a spatially bounded community of geo-political state entity is therefore the single most important factor that prevents formulation and implementation of long-term development programmes.

AB Objectives: To describe a home-based treatment (HBT) service. To profile the patient population using HBT. To determine why HBT was used and to record disposal.
   Method: All patients treated by HBT during the first two years of this new service were identified from the HBT logbook. A checklist recording demographic, diagnostic, presenting complaint data and details of HBT contact was used to analyse the patients' charts. A statistical package JMP was used to analyse the data.
   Results: Two hundred and six patients (275 episodes) were treated using HBT. These were 101 (49.1%) males and 105 (50.9%) females. Of these, 89 (43.2%) were single. Forty-eight (19.4%) lived alone and 53 (25.7%) were unemployed. The most common presenting complaint was severe depression (39.3%). A depressive disorder was the most frequent diagnosis (28.7%). Twenty six (13%) episodes of HBT ended in admission. One hundred and eighty five (67.3%) were referred to outpatients and 26 (9.5%) were discharged to the GP.
   Conclusions: Home-based treatment is feasible for a wide range of patients with an array of presenting complaints. This model of service delivery is viable in a rural setting. Admission will still be required for some patients. Further work is needed to examine its sustainability and its generalisability to other Irish settings.

AB The increasing scarcity of water in dry areas is now a well-recognized problem. According to the World Commission on Environment and Development, approximately 80 countries with 40% of the world population already suffer from serious water shortages.
   At present, water shortages have led most of and and semi-arid countries to increase food imports because the local agricultural sector is not able to produce sufficient food to fill the existing food gaps. The increasing food gaps are posing serious challenges beyond the economic and political capacity required for the necessary adjustments concerning the allocation and use of water in all sectors, particularly agriculture.
   The agricultural sector is by far the largest user of water in the world. On a consumptive use basis, 80-90% of all the water is consumed in agriculture. Unfortunately, water use efficiency in this sector is very poor not exceeding 45% with more than 50% water losses; thereby, enormous water saving could be achieved in the agricultural sector comparable with other sectoral water uses.
   The growing water scarcity and the misuse and management of the available water resources are nowadays major threats to sustainable development for the various sectors, especially domestic, industrial and agricultural.
   Today, in most countries suffering water shortages, at the heart is the question of whether a water crisis can be averted or whether water can be made productive. Increasing the productivity of water is central to producing food, to fighting poverty, to reducing competition for water and to ensuring that there is enough water for nature. The more we produce with less water and/or with the same amount of water, the less the need for infrastructure development, the fewer the conflicts among the sectoral water uses, the greater the local food security and the more water for agricultural, household and industrial uses, and the more that remains in nature. However, to achieve such goals, major improvements are still required in water resource use and irrigation technology and management. Meeting such challenges will require a far greater effort and significant changes in how water is managed. What needs to be changed? What are the improvements required to cope with increased water scarcity?
   These are the issues to be discussed in this paper: addressing the appropriate techniques and proper tools to be adopted for increasing the productivity of water through water saving, and improving the rates in water use efficiency in the irrigation sector coupled with better management systems for water conveyance, allocation and distribution.

AB The history of water management in The Netherlands shows how the original natural landscape was transformed into a man-made landscape and has led to a never-ending struggle with the water. Water comes from all directions into the lowlands: over land via rivers (floods), from the sea side (surges), from above (excessive rainfall) and from the subsoil (seepage). Human intervention is continuously needed to be able to survive with effective solutions. History has shown that since men started intervening in nature, in particular in the alluvial water-saturated soft soils where Dutch society has settled and developed, the need for these measures will never stop. Anyone measure leads to counter and correcting measures later on. This is clearly visible today and it will definitively continue in the future. It sets the mind of Dutch society in its continuous struggle for life and can be a lesson learned for others, living and developing in areas with similar water-related characteristics.

AB I examine why the performance of an organization is often subject to gradual erosion. I assume that players are motivated partly by psychological factors, norms and morale, and that they are willing to exert extra efforts if others do so. I show that repeated random shocks induce the erosion of the extra efforts supported by norms and morale, but they do not completely decay; in the long run a certain range of efforts are sustainable. Hence different organizations typically enjoy diverse norms and morale, which persist for a long time, in the vicinity of the equilibrium determined by material incentives.

AB Aim. To examine the relationship between sustained work with quality improvement (QI) and factors related to research utilization in a group of nurses.
   Design. The study was designed as a comparative survey that included 220 nurses from various health care organizations in Sweden. These nurses had participated in uniformly designed 4-day basic training courses to manage a method for QI.
   Method. A validated questionnaire covering different aspects of research utilization was employed. The response rate was 70% (154 of 220). Nurses in managerial positions at the departmental level were excluded. Therefore, the final sample consisted of 119 respondents. Four years after the training courses, 39% were still involved in audit-related activities, while 61% reported that they had discontinued the QI work (missing = 1).
   Results. Most nurses (80-90%) had a positive attitude to research. Those who had continued the QI work over a 4-year period reported more activity in searching research literature compared with those who had discontinued the QI work (P = 0.005). The QI-sustainable nurses also reported more frequent participation in research-related activities, particularly in implementing specific research findings in practice (P = 0.001). Some contextual differences were reported: the QI-sustainable nurses were more likely to obtain support from their chief executive (P = 0.001), consultation from a skilled researcher (P = 0.005) and statistical support (P = 0.001). Within the broader health care organization, the existence of a research committee and a research and development strategy, as well as access to research assistant staff, had a tendency to be more common for nurses who had continued the QI work.
   Conclusion. Sustainability in QI work was significantly related to supportive leadership, facilitative human resources, increased activity in seeking new research and enhanced implementation of research findings in clinical practice. It appears that these factors constitute a necessary prerequisite for professional development and the establishment of evidence-based practice.

AB The chemical and nutritional properties of microalgae are well known, which has led to an ever expanding industry for foods and dietary supplements both in terms of quantity and products. Little has been done to regulate or control quality and assurance in the applied phycology industry and it is known that it varies considerably. Nutritional aspects of produced biomass and consumption as dietary supplements have become issues of concern, especially since the industry is lucrative and fast growing. Various claims are made regarding dietary and food supplements that include health, nutrition, structure and functioning, many often unsubstantiated. Although quality is a subjective term many organisations are involved in testing, controlling and determining criteria. Today quality is more than just standards where it is an "integrated quality management approach" involving amongst others "hazard analyses and critical control points" (HACCP) practices. Microalgae are not recognised as a food or food supplement and they are also not categorised under herbals or botanicals, but as "other supplements". Produced microalgal biomass is subject to contamination from the entire range of contaminants and pathogens. Contamination of products by algal toxins in mixed culture populations also occurs. The industry has largely regulated itself, but there is considerable scope for improvement. There is a need for support and dissemination of information in the industry.

AB The socially responsible investment industry (SRI) is slowly changing from a screening, avoidance paradigm to a comprehensive paradigm that seeks to affect corporate behavior. Credible rating systems are a key component of this sea change. Reliable and recognizable social and environmental metrics are critical to this progress. The Total Social Impact (TSI) rating approach is a new social metric scheme based on a comprehensive rating of stakeholder issues. This paper describes the evolution of SRI ratings and the role that TSI hopes to play in affecting business behavior by promoting principled business leadership.

   Reporting Initiative; guidelines; information; investment; reporting;
   screening; social responsibility; stakeholders; sustainability
AB Social screening of investments calls not only for investment policy and criteria, but also for information about companies, their policies, practices and performance. The Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) and its June 2000 Sustainability Reporting Guidelines have the potential to significantly improve the usefulness and quality of information reported by companies about their environmental, social and economic impacts and performance. The GRI aims to develop a voluntary reporting framework that will elevate sustainability reporting practices to a level equivalent to that of financial reporting in rigour, comparability, auditability and general acceptance. This will be a welcome and efficient supplement to the questionnaires, interviews, press releases, media reports and other sources of information traditionally used for screening in investment decision making - social/ethical and mainstream. The Dow Jones Sustainability Group Index, the Jantzi Social Index and the Innovest EcoValue'21 analytical platform, together with the SRI community, are all likely to benefit from GRI-style sustainability reports. One of the GRI's key challenges is to accommodate the broad variety of disclosure needs and expectations of a wide range of report users and company stakeholders. To maximize the usefulness of the GRI Guidelines, report users, including the SRI community, need to be engaged in the process of developing and refining the Guidelines over time. The GRI Guidelines are emerging as an important instrument in enabling companies to communicate with their stakeholders about performance and accountability beyond just the financial bottom line.

ID SEA-DEFENSE; UK; RETREAT; ESTUARY
AB With the potential threat of global climate change leading to sea-level rise, policy makers and engineers are looking towards managed realignment as a genuine attempt to provide a more sustainable coastal defence strategy. Public perceptions and attitudes towards this approach have generally indicated that it is not a favoured defence option as local residents often view managed realignment as 'giving in to the sea'. Brancaster West Marsh is the first of three ongoing studies that will attempt to identify changes in public acceptance of managed realignment and the Environment Agency (the main statutory body responsible for these works). It is hypothesised that local residents win show the most support for this type of strategy once it is fully established rather than at the inception or during the construction phases. A postal questionnaire, composed mainly of attitude statements was used to elicit resident perceptions and attitudes on the local environment, coastal flooding, coastal defence and managed realignment. Findings from the current Brancaster scheme suggest that residents who have a higher regard for the Environment Agency are generally more accepting of the scheme, however, the results could not conclusively determine whether the majority of the respondents support the scheme. Qualitative data also highlighted conflicting views among residents on the issues of sustainability, hard and soft defences, economics, the environment and consultation. This was thought to have resulted from information feedback deficiencies between the public and operating authorities. The study concludes that the information needs of local residents and access to information are integral components in the process of public understanding and should be addressed and assessed on a case-by-case basis.

AB The paper analyses a two-sector model of endogenous growth with two common features of economic development: stages of sustained growth and underdevelopment traps. The model also demonstrates the transitional issues of a temporary underdevelopment trap, seemingly sustainable growth, and a slowdown in productivity growth. The temporary underdevelopment trap occurs when an economy exhibits a regime of extensive growth (i.e. slowly declining growth in physical capital with no growth in human capital), but thereafter starts a transition to sustained growth. Seemingly sustainable growth happens when an economy exhibits a regime of intensive growth (i.e. both capitals grow initially) but the growth of human capital subsequently ceases and the economy eventually finds itself in a zero growth trap. The model also exhibits the possibility of a slowdown in productivity growth as a temporary phenomenon during the transition from the low growth stage to the high growth stage of an economy facing a new "industrial" revolution.

AB The development of novel information technologies has been in extraordinarily rapid progress, and some new techniques and tools have yet to be applied to environmental management. In many cases, however, the roles of these technologies have been limited in the provision of improved convenience for system implementation and presentation. Although these roles are meaningful for extensive transfer of new methodologies and convenient access of research outcomes, they do not directly contribute to methodology development. Therefore, further development of high performance computing and knowledge management potentials associated with artificial intelligence techniques is desired to promote long-term viability of environmental informatics. In this paper, recent developments, advancements. challenges, and barriers associated with practices of environmental informatics research are analyzed. A number of related methodologies. applications, and policy considerations are examined. Issues of the needs for environmental systems analysis, the challenges of environmental systems modeling, and the impacts of environmental informatics are discussed. Perspectives of the environmental decision-making in the 21st century are investigated, demonstrating many demanding areas for enhanced research efforts.

   environmental assessment
AB An industrial district is a group of firms housed in a limited geographic area and specialized in one or more stages of a given production cycle. The concentration of firms in a limited area characterizes unique environmental problems in conjunction with local communities that need to be carefully assessed. This paper presents an assessment of the environmental impact of industrial districts that is carried out using an input-output accounting, model in connection to relevant materials and energy flows within an industrial district. Resources used, wastes produced and energy consumed in the system of concern are quantified by the input-output accounting model to provide invaluable information for both private and public managers leading to meet the sustainable development goals in local communities. Also, information for screening the technologies in conjunction with recycling, re-use, and recovery strategies can be drawn. Two case examples, related to the Italian industrial districts of Sassuolo and Matera, in North and South Italy, have been analyzed using such input-output accounting model as a tool.

AB Soil quality is one of the most important environmental factors in sustaining the global biosphere and developing sustainable agricultural practices. A study was initiated in Wolong Nature Reserve, Sichuan Province, China to elucidate the soil quality changes of natural secondary succession, forest planting and agricultural practices after deforestation in the humid mountainous region. The soil qualities of six land use types (natural forestland, grassland, shrub land, secondary forestland, cultivated land and reforested land) were compared using two quantitative methods: the integrated soil quality index (QI) and soil deterioration index (DI). The QI values of natural forestland, grassland, shrub land, secondary forestland, cultivated land, reforested land were 0.8039, 0.3277, 0.9127, 0.6881, 0.0285 and 0.3183, respectively. The DI values were 0 %, - 14 %, 12 %, 1 %, - 26 % and - 18 % respectively. Both indexes suggested that shrub, land can restore soil properties. To compare the two methods more directly, a deduced index QI' based on QI value was developed. The results showed that DI and QI' had a very high linear correlation coefficient (r = 0.9775) despite the values were different. Both methods were efficient in evaluating the soil quality levels and DI was a more simple way in soil quality assessment, while QI could show more ecological meanings.

AB As an important resource and the living environment of mankind, wetland has become gradually a highlight, strongly concerned and intensively studied by scientists and sociologists. The governments in the world and the whole society have been paying more and more attention on it. The Dongting Lake of China is regarded as an internationally important wetland. For a rational development and protection of the wetland, an investigation and studied on its resources and its value to tourism in the South Dongting Lake was conducted, to create an assessment system of the ecological landscapes, and to evaluate qualitatively and quantitatively the value of wetland landscape to the ecotourism. The results showed that the scenic value of the South Dongting Lake Wetland satisfied the criterion of AAAA grade of China national scenic attraction. The eco-tourism value of the landscape cultures in the South Dongting Lake Weiland was discussed with emphasis. It were formulated that a principle and frame of sustainable exploitation of the wetland landscapes and it was proposed as well that establishing a Weiland Park and developing eco-tourism in the South Dongting Lake. Weiland is a fragile ecosystem with low resistance to the impact of the exploitation. Thus, we must pay intensively attention to the influence of exploitation on the landscape, take the ecological risk in account to employ a right countermeasure and avoid the negative affection.

SO JOURNAL OF FORESTRY

DT Article
DE certification; international forestry; silviculture; tropical forests
AB Forestry in lowland Bolivia has taken great strides in the past few years, progressing from a virtual absence of management to a system of regulated management planning. Nearly 1 million hectares of natural forests are now certified by the Forest Stewardship Council. To ensure sustainable forest management, however, Bolivian foresters need,to go beyond the basics of planned logging and apply silvicultural treatments to secure regeneration, improve tree growth, and maintain stand quality. This change is a tall order in a developing country battered by a deep economic recession, where timber-mining interests are still powerful and silviculturists are in short supply.

TI Reductions in fluvial sediment discharge by coastal dams in California
   and implications for beach sustainability
SO JOURNAL OF GEOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID RIVER; COLORADO
AB The long-term sustainability of California's beaches depends on periodic deliveries of sand and gravel from coastal rivers and streams. To assess the long-term health of California's beaches, this study characterized the current state of fluvial sediment delivery and quantified, on a littoral cell basis, the cumulative impacts of dams in decreasing annual discharge. Presently, more than 500 dams impound more than 42,000 km(2) (or 38%) of California's coastal watershed area. Flow modeling suggests that by diminishing flood hydrographs, these dams have reduced the average annual sand and gravel flux to 20 major littoral cells by 2.8 million m(3)/yr (or 25%). In 70% of the streams considered in this study, suspended sediment loads during equivalent discharge events have declined over the past three decades, which indicates that dams have also significantly reduced downstream sediment supplies. Approximately 23% (or 274 km) of the 1193 km of beaches in California are downcoast from rivers that have had sediment supplies diminished by one-third or more. Moreover, 192 km (or 70%) of these threatened beaches are located in southern California, where most of the state's beach recreation and tourism activities are concentrated. Although past large-scale nourishment activities associated with coastal construction and harbor dredging have offset fluvial sediment supply reductions, particularly in southern California, many of these threatened beaches can be expected to undergo long-term erosion in the future.

AB Field research and laboratory experiments suggest that, under certain circumstances, people using group support systems (GSS) can be significantly more productive than people who do not use them. Yet, despite their demonstrated potential, GSS have been slow to diffuse across organizations. Drawing on the Technology Transition Model, the paper argues that the high conceptual load of GSS (i.e., understanding of the intended effect of GSS functionality) encourages organizations to employ expert facilitators to wield the technology on behalf of others. Economic and political factors mitigate against facilitators remaining long term in GSS facilities that focus on supporting nonroutine, ad hoc projects. This especially hampers scaling GSS technology to support distributed collaboration. An alternative and sustainable way for organizations to derive value from GSS lies in an approach called "collaboration engineering": the development of repeatable collaborative processes that are conducted by practitioners themselves. To enable the development of such processes, this paper proposes the thinkLet concept, a codified packet of facilitation skill that can be applied by practitioners to achieve predictable, repeatable patterns of collaboration, such as divergence or convergence. A thinkLet specifies the facilitator's choices and actions in terms of the GSS tool used, the configuration of this tool, and scripted prompts to accomplish a pattern of collaboration in a group. Using thinkLets as building blocks, facilitators can develop and transfer repeatable collaborative processes to practitioners. Given the limited availability of expert facilitators, collaboration engineering with thinkLets may become a sine qua non for organizations to effectively support virtual work teams.

AB A range of works on people's understandings of their surroundings express a recurring assumption that, as societies become more urban and capitalist, people are decreasingly likely to engage in practical and material ways with their surroundings, and are consequently more likely to stand at a distance from those surroundings culturally. This assumption implies that practical engagement is the only form of engagement that leads people to meaningful and consequential relationships with their surroundings, that the alternative to such engagement is something like the tourist gaze or the flaneur. Using a study of some environmental activists, this article raises questions about this assumption.

SO JOURNAL OF POSITIVE BEHAVIOR INTERVENTIONS

DT Article
AB Researchers and educators have recognized that typical school-wide approaches to discipline and the prevention and management of problem behavior are often insufficient to address the needs of many students in inner-city schools with high base rates of problem behavior. This article outlines critical issues and lessons learned in the planning and implementation of effective and self-sustaining Positive Behavior Support (PBS) efforts in inner-city schools. Among these issues are methods for the facilitation of school-university partnerships, the incorporation of PBS into existing comprehensive school improvement efforts, the maintenance of school-wide PBS efforts, and the formalization of exit strategies and arrangements for subsequent technical assistance. The importance of service integration, family support, youth development, and community development are emphasized in ensuring the effectiveness and sustainability of school-wide PBS efforts in inner-city settings.

AB This paper suggests that a public service employment (PSE) or job guarantee (JG) program run on the principle's of functional finance can be designed to promote environmental sustainabiliiy. Unregulated or poorly regulated capitalist economies are both macroeconomically unsatisfactory (here focusing on unemployment, but also including price stability) and environmentally unsustainable. Traditional approaches addressing either unemployment or environmental degradation are insufficient to achieve full employment or environmental sustainability, and often proposals to attain one of these goals appear inconsistent with the other A PSE program based on functional finance can achieve full employment, and may also present opportunities to promote environmental sustainability. A functional finance approach to ecological tax reform presents an opportunity to promote both macroeconomic and environmental goals. The flexibility of a PSE system also can be utilized to promote sustainability in a number of ways. PSE workers may also perform an array of environmental services, including monitoring, clean up, recycling, education, and more.

SO JOURNAL OF PUBLIC ECONOMICS

DT Article
DE affirmative action; statistical discrimination; general equilibrium;
   asymmetric information; human capital
AB We consider a model of endogenous human capital formation with competitively determined wages. Discrimination is sustainable in equilibrium in the presence of two distinguishable, but ex ante identical groups of workers. An affirmative action policy consisting of a quota may 'fail' in the sense that there still may be equilibria where groups are treated differently. However, the incentives to invest for agents in the discriminated group are improved by affirmative action if the initial equilibrium is the most discriminatory equilibrium in the model without the policy. The welfare effects are ambiguous. It is possible that the policy makes the intended beneficiaries worse off: even if the starting point is the most discriminatory equilibrium the expected payoff may decrease for all agents in the target group.

DE pensions; human capital; international migration
ID IMMIGRATION; INEQUALITY; NATIVES
AB The aim of the paper is to investigate the joint redistributive effects of migration and pensions and to reassess the sustainability issue raised in the existing economic literature. The paper first develops a theoretical framework to analyse the impact of international migration on the labour market. The model allows for heterogeneity across native-born individuals and for migrants to affect both the wages and the education decision in the recipient country. It then explicitly focuses on pensions under alternative migration scenarios. The analysis shows that migration causes redistributive effects which increase across-group wage inequality. However, the endogenous educational response by residents partially offsets the redistributive impact of migration while creating additional interest groups. Migration helps the financial sustainability of the pension scheme but the interaction between migration and pensions causes complex inter- and intragenerational redistributive conflicts, which are analysed in the paper.

AB Soil erosion has been linked to stream sedimentation, ecosystem degradation, and loss of rangeland productivity. However, knowledge of soil loss, as it affects rangeland productivity or ecosystem sustainability is lacking. We evaluated the effects of 3 levels of vegetation cover reduction (0, 27%, and 43%) and soil removal (0, 12, and 24 tonnes ha(-1)) on soil surface runoff and sediment yield in a sagebrush [Artemisia tridentata var. vasseyana (Rydb.) Beetle] steppe under simulated rainfall. Time to runoff initiation was affected by the vegetation cover reduction treatments, but not by the soil removal treatments. The 43% vegetation canopy reduction treatment resulted in a shorter time to runoff initiation than did the 27% and 0% canopy reduction treatments (p=0.002). Results from analysis of covariance indicated that vegetation reduction and soil removal did not significantly affect sediment yield or runoff quantities in the first year following treatments. Multiple regression analysis revealed total sediment yield was related to forb cover, sand in the upper soil profile (0-5 cm), and the amount of bare ground. Time to runoff initiation was positively correlated with slope. Despite the lack of significant treatment differences, we do not conclude that these soil removal and vegetation reduction treatments had no affect on soil surface hydrology and sediment yield. There are numerous studies that show a strong relationship between vegetation reduction and soil erosion. Future research at this site may reveal long-term treatment effects that were not apparent in first year results.

AB Information technology (IT) has been asserted to be a source of sustainable competitive advantage. Empirical evidence has shown that IT can improve a company's performance and competitive position. We examine the factors that are believed to lead to a sustainable competitive advantage due to an IT-enabled strategy, and test these factors empirically. Our findings show that managerial IT skills are positively related to sustainability, and competitor's knowledge of competitive advantage is negatively related to sustainability. There was no support for technical IT skills or IT infrastructure as a source of sustainable competitive advantage. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

DT Article
AB Sustainability has emerged as a major theme in planning. Urban environmental planners frequently recommend greenways as one approach to making places greener, healthier, and more livable. This case study examines whether the greenways system in Indianapolis, Indiana, is sustainable using a framework based on six principles of sustainability recently proposed in the planning literature. Goals of the greenways master plan are linked to principles of sustainability, and indicators from an ad hoc set of empirical studies of the greenways are used to assess progress towards goals and sustainability. Planners can apply this framework elsewhere by linking,goals developed in local planning processes to these principles, using available information to develop indicators, and, as part of continuing, iterative planning processes, designing data collection programs that yield more comprehensive sets of indicators over time.

AB Nickel impregnated Pt/H-beta and Pt/H-MOR catalysts with different Ni content were prepared and subjected to hydroisomerization of n-hexane in the presence of flowing H-2 gas. The states of Pt and Ni were identified by ESCA. The particle size measured by TEM shows that average particle size increases with increasing Ni loading. The acidity of the catalysts was measured by TPD of ammonia. The catalytic activity of Ni containing and Ni free Pt/H-beta and Pt/H-MOR catalysts was compared and found that addition of Ni up to a threshold value (0.3 wt% for beta and 0.1 wt% for MOR) increases the n-hexane conversion and dimethyl butanes selectivity due to better metal-acid synergism and decreases the amount of cracked products. When the Ni amount exceeds the threshold values the conversion decreases and cracked products increase. Further the Ni impregnation of Pt containing acidic supports increases the sustainability of the catalysts and was found to favor the protonated cyclopropane (PCP) intermediate mechanism in n-hexane isomerization. beta zeolite was found to be a better potential support than mordenite and the isomerized product mixture shows better octane number.

AB The spread of consortial licensing and the 'Big Deal' has been rapid and far-reaching. While there would appear to be many advantages associated with this purchasing model, there are also reservations about its impact on librarian choice and concerns that it may serve to further consolidate the dominant position of some of the biggest STM publishers. However, until recently little qualitative or quantitative research had been undertaken into the impact this purchasing model is having upon the scholarly communication system. This article summaries the findings of a research programme run by the Ingenta Institute in 2002 which consisted of three separate independent studies into the perceived advantages and disadvantages of the consortial site license for libraries, institutions, publishers and end-users. Preliminary conclusions suggest that while this model has brought many benefits to all stakeholders, it is unlikely to continue in its current form, with significant adaptation and development anticipated at the next round of consortial license renewal. While the number of consortial deals may indeed increase in the future, these deals will not necessarily be 'Big Deals'.

AB There has been considerable growth in the number of organic farms, including livestock, in the EU over the last few years. Livestock production, and especially ruminant livestock production, forms an integral part of many organic farms due to its role in nutrient recycling on farms. In 14 out of 16 European countries, livestock products were within the top five organic products. The recent development of organic farming represents the penetration of important aspects of recent major changes in society at large into agriculture. The development can be attributed to increased consumer interest in organic products while, at the same time, farmers are interested in converting to organic production methods, often stimulated by government support or subsidies. It is important that the organic production systems can fulfil the expectation of each of these stakeholders if organic livestock production is to increase further. This is discussed in detail. It is, argued that organic livestock production in future will be carried out by farmers who are committed to organic ideals and, therefore, it is important that new livestock systems are developed which comply to a higher degree with these ideals. The consumer's interest in organic farming seems mainly to be related to care of their own health and the environmental impact of agriculture, but also to considerations of animal welfare. Large regional differences also exist as regards consumers' priorities. In European countries and the EU support for organic fanning is justified as an element in stimulating/regulating the agricultural sector to be more supportive of rural development, diversifying production, and reducing the environmental load of agriculture. The different priorities in different regions in Europe reflect the different concerns as regards agricultural development in the individual regions. In central and Eastern European countries there is also growing interest in organic production methods, mainly because these systems are expected to offer a more profitable and sustainable production system based on low input. So it appears that organic livestock production systems have to reflect different expectations. Livestock rearing should contribute to more balanced overall farm production, food safety (in a broad sense) should be enhanced, and animal welfare should be improved compared to conventional production methods. Also, the systems should support rural development, nature conservation, and the environmental load should be low. The success of the expansion of organic systems will depend on how far these different expectations can be fulfilled without resulting in the premium prices of the products being too high. Research, development, and advisory service have major roles in supporting the development of such a livestock system, which addresses major current societal concerns. There probably is a need for better interaction between mainstream agricultural research and research groups specializing in areas of importance for organic farming. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB The aim of the paper is to evaluate the feasibility and constraints of organic farming to increase the sustainability of Mediterranean small ruminant livestock systems. The paper analyzes the factors affecting sustainability of small ruminant livestock systems in the Mediterranean basin, such as seasonal forage availability or suboptimal pasture utilisation due to overgrazing but also the factor of undergrazing. The paper considers how the application of practices of organic farming may contribute to promoting sustainable land use and improving environment conservation, animal welfare, and product quality. Also the prospects of new information-based technologies, like geographic information systems and global positioning systems, to improve sustainability are presented. A model of pasture-based dairy sheep production system is proposed, with special emphasis on the organisation of a farm forage system to meet animal nutritional requirement. Some options for an integrated strategy for the control of parasitic disease in small ruminant production systems are discussed. These are based on a combination of general prevention methods (i.e. risk control and identification), grazing management (i.e. multifunctional grassland management), nonchemical treatments (i.e. homeopathic herbal preparations) and novel approaches (i.e. biological control and bioactive forages). Comparative effects of phytotherapy and conventional treatment on dairy sheep helminthic disease and on metabolic status and animal welfare are presented.
   The prospects of organic farming are of particular interest for the less favoured Mediterranean areas, where it may contribute to the safeguard of agricultural functions, like care and preservation of landscape, and safeguarding of rural villages with positive effects on the quality of life in rural communities. Some activities would be particularly appropriate in natural parks, where small ruminants and other domestic animals interact with wildlife and where biodiversity must be preserved.
   For positive results a new collaborative decision-making process is required between rural and urban communities, businesses and government. In addition, strong supports from scientific research and the extension services are needed to correct and fully utilize new information technologies to exploit the magnitude and potential of organic farming for enhancement of sustainable small ruminant production systems in the Mediterranean region.

AB Organic farming which experienced a constant rise over the last two decades is a system based on sustainability and on a concept tending towards functional integrity. Legislation as well as the wish to produce separately from conventional farming raise the question whether organic farming should be conducted completely apart from conventional farming or not. This paper discusses the aspects that affect animal breeding under these circumstances, e.g., maintaining genetic diversity by using local breeds and possible G X E interactions which might occur when breeds adapted to conventional farming systems are used in organic farming. Ways of modelling G X E are presented, moreover examples of G X E in dairy cattle, swine, and poultry are given. Trends in selection index theory-designing multi-trait breeding goals including functional traits on one hand, and developing methods for using customised selection indices on the other hand-support breeding work for organic farming systems. It is concluded that before the technical issues can be addressed, all parties involved, farmers, consumers as well as legislators, have to agree on the socio-cultural conditions under which organic farming should be conducted.

AB Following the Earth Summit in 1992, most UK local authorities have pursued sustainable development through Local Agenda 21 (LA21) partnerships. However, few academic or practitioner studies have examined the degree to which partnership processes are suitable for LA21. Local Agenda 21 seeks to be inclusive of all community interests and stresses the need to involve local businesses. This paper reports on research undertaken between 1998 and 1999 examining the proposition that partnership arrangements may inhibit business involvement with LA21. While the study suggests that a partnership approach to LA21 may not deter business involvement, partnership structures and processes appear to be critical in engaging and sustaining business participation, particularly among SMEs. Local authorities need to be sensitive to private sector perceptions of the LA21 process and to consider alternative methods of engaging the business community in the search for a cross-sector approach to local sustainable development.

DT Article
AB In the present article, the objective is to examine the methodological challenges and the epistemological stakes involved in the use and evaluation of a virtual learning environment. The frame of reference suggests a model where synchronous and non-synchronous technopedagogical mediation creates new interactive modes between trainer, learner and the knowledge content. The experimental activity took place as part of a distance-learning course linking the University of Quebec at Trois-Rivieres and the University of Ottawa. The methodology derives from three instruments: an observation checklist, a questionnaire and two focus groups. The discussion deals with the challenges inherent to the methodologies used: the complementarity of the quantitative and qualitative methods and the complementarity of the instruments used. The pros and cons of the educational technologies are analyzed: different learning and teaching strategies, the cognitive information content, the social sharing of knowledge. The conclusion deals with the scientific relevance and limitations of the research activity.

AB In this article the role and performance of UK business schools are examined to determine the extent to which they provide support for business organizations and other stakeholders in the efforts they are making to lay the foundation for a state of sustainable development both nationally and globally. A wide variety of data are analysed relating to research into, and published material about, environmental management and sustainability, the incorporation of these topics into MBA and other postgraduate programmes, and the research context within business schools. This reveals how little attention business schools appear to be paying to such fundamental issues. Finally, there is a discussion of the values that motivate current practice in an attempt to account for the situation. Suggestions are also made concerning some possible ways of relating recent debates about management research strategies to the goal of sustainable development.

AB The population structure and growth rates of stony corals may provide important information concerning their processes of turnover and recovery on coral reefs, yet for most corals such information is lacking. We quantify here the population dynamics of solitary free-living mushroom corals on a fringing reef at Eilat, northern Red Sea. Population models were applied to estimate growth, mortality, and lifespan in members of four common taxa: Ctenactis echinata, Fungia scutaria, F. fungites, and the subgenus F (Danafungia) spp. Individuals of C. echinata and F. scutaria grew allometrically: their oral disc length increased more rapidly than width, leading to an oval body shape. Individuals of F. fungites and F. (Danafungia) spp. grew isometrically, retaining a circular body shape. A population of F. scutaria on the intertidal reef flat was characterized by young individuals (mean age=2 years), with high mortality and short lifespan (13 years). In contrast, populations of the other three mushroom coral taxa on the reef slope consisted of older individuals (mean age=4-9 years), with lower mortality and longer life-spans (24-46 years). Demographic patterns appeared to vary with species characteristics, and possibly with the level of disturbance in each reef habitat. Minimum sizes at which these mushroom corals may be removed sustainably from the populations range from 7 to 22 cm. polyp diameter (5-14 years of age). We conclude that the Beverton and Holt population dynamic model is applicable to the management of stony corals with solitary or compact, upright growth forms that rarely fragment.

AB Improvements in stocking strategy and management could increase the yield of mussels that are on-grown from harvested wild seed mussel resources and thereby enhance the sustainability of this shellfishery. A field experiment was undertaken to ascertain shell characteristics (compression strength and thickness) of seed mussels grown at different shore heights, whether these characteristics changed after a period of growth under identical conditions, and if these characteristics reduced predation losses by crabs and birds. Results indicated that mussels grown at higher shore levels attained shell characteristics beneficial to predation resistance and that these were maintained after a period of growth at a lower shore level. A novel management plan for mussel cultivation was formulated from the results of this study by manipulating shore position according to the attainment of these predator resistant shell attributes and the spatial distribution of the main natural mussel predators (crabs and birds). This technique was expanded to address the mussel cultivation problem of low natural seed settlement.

AB This article deals with Sino-Japanese fishery relations from the 1950s to date. It first reviews the early efforts made by both sides, and stresses the importance of new legal and environmental challenges which affected the Sino-Japanese joint fishery regime and which required the two countries to make a new arrangement accordingly. The new bilateral fishery agreement is assessed and the remaining issues are analysed. Finally, it is pointed out that the joint fishery regime is a first step for the necessary regional cooperation in fishery management towards sustainability. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

SO MATHEMATICAL BIOSCIENCES
LA English
DT Article
DE data assimilation; dynamic parameter estimation; fishing mortality
ID DATA ASSIMILATION; MANAGEMENT
AB A non-traditional approach of fitting dynamic resource biomass models to data is developed in this paper. A variational adjoint technique is used for dynamic parameter estimation. In the variational formulation, a cost function measuring the distance between the model solution and the observations is minimized. The data assimilation method provides a novel and computationally efficient procedure for combining all available information, i.e., the data and the model in the analysis of a resource system. This technique will be used to analyze data for the North-east Arctic cod stock. Two alternative population growth models: the logistic and the Gompertz model are used for estimating parameters of simple bioeconomic models by the method of constrained least squares. Estimates of the parameters of the models dynamics are reasonable and can be accepted. The main inference from the work is that the average fishing mortality is found to be significantly above the maximum sustainable yield value. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

ID INJURIES
AB A prospective study was carried out of the health effects and sustainability of a low-cost trauma training program for non-graduate village healthcare workers. From 1996 to 1999, a core group of 44 health workers from mine-infested rural communities in Cambodia and Northern Iraq were trained and equipped to deliver low-cost life support to trauma victims. They in turn trained a network of 2800 layman village first responders. Training was done in makeshift camps at village level ('Village Universities'). A total of 813 patients were managed by the rural rescue system from 1997 to 1999. The mortality rate for trauma victims decreased from 22.6% in 1997 to 13.7% in 1999 (95% CI for difference 1.8% to 16.0%). Management by village first responders had a significant impact on in-field response times and trauma mortality. The rescue system replicated itself during the study period as an indicator of sustainability. The study showed that after trauma care training at rural makeshift training centers, non-graduate health workers can build efficient and sustainable rural rescue systems.

TI Sustainable social security: What would it cost?
SO NATIONAL TAX JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
ID UNITED-STATES; MORTALITY
AB The standard measure of the 75-year Social Security imbalance is 1.87 percent of payroll, but raising taxes this much would not make finances sustainable. We consider exact and approximate infinite horizon measures based on different strategies for extending the projections past 75 years. These indicate imbalances of 3.1 to 5.7 percent of payroll. We also suggest a simpler common sense measure: the tax increase necessary to make the Trust Fund Ratio equal in the 74th and 75th years. Under the Trustees' mortality projection, it indicates 3.1 percent imbalance, with a more rapid mortality decline of 4.2 percent. All sustainability measures indicate greater imbalance than is currently thought.

TI Disaster management and community planning, and public participation:
   How to achieve sustainable hazard mitigation
SO NATURAL HAZARDS
LA English
DT Article
DE public participation; community planning; sustainable hazard mitigation;
   disaster management planning
AB The paper offers first a brief historical overview of disaster management planning. Second, it reviews Australian and American research findings and show that they urge the field of disaster management to shift its focus from response and recovery to sustainable hazard mitigation. It is argued that in order for this shift to occur, it is necessary to integrate disaster management and community planning. Current practice seldom reflects such a synthesis, and this is one of the reasons why hazard awareness is absent from local decision-making processes. Third, it is asserted that if mitigative strategies are to be successfully implemented, then the disaster management process must incorporate public participation at the local decision-making level. The paper concludes with a case study of California's Portola Valley, which demonstrates that when public participation is integrated into disaster management planning and community planning, the result is sustainable hazard mitigation.

DT Article
DE vulnerability; community; health; sustainable; mitigation; social;
   physical environment
AB The growing appreciation of mitigation is highlighting the need to develop a better understanding of what makes some people more vulnerable to the impacts of a disaster. Health researchers have asked a similar question regarding the varying vulnerability to illness within a population. This has lead to the identification of a set of social, physical and economic factors that are now referred to as the determinants of health. These factors are the same as those commonly associated with disaster vulnerability. Recognizing that these same concepts are being applied in both the health and disaster management contexts presents an opportunity to also achieve a shared objective of reducing vulnerability within a population.

   detention
AB Flood of 1997 affected a large number of residents in the Red River Basin. Life disruption, economic damage, lengthy recovery process, physical and emotional trauma motivated a number of main initiatives to improve the level of preparedness in case of future floods. This review will focus on the involvement of the International Joint Commission (IJC). Personal experience is used in this review to emphasize a number of important lessons, of special relevance to Canadian portion of the basin, from the post flood activities. Level of preparedness for, and potential damage from future floods will benefit from focusing very serious effort on the improvement of the Canadian database, exchange of data with the U. S. and standardization of data collection, exchange and use. Tools for sustainable floodplain management are improving. However, the Red River Basin with its characteristics requires a special set of sophisticated tools that will enhance flood flow forecasting, planning of new flood control measures (structural and non-structural) and emergency operations of existing flood protection system. City of Winnipeg, being the largest population centre in the basin deserves a special attention. Additional protection of 670,000 people is required that will take into consideration temporal and spatial distribution of economic and social costs and benefits.

AB This article assesses the current and future management of water resources, and provision of water services, in Scotland. New quality and technical standards continue to require increased investment, whilst higher charges focus public discontent and sustainable development principles bring greater citizen participation in decision making. Previous public campaigns have affected political strategy for industry reform and may do so again with the proposed introduction of competition to a public water supply. The role of the public will be analysed alongside the particular management problems arising from an abundant resource.

TI Coalbed methane development: The costs and benefits of an emerging
   energy resource
SO NATURAL RESOURCES JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
AB Coalbed methane has rapidly become an important source of natural gas, particularly in the Intermountain West. The rapidity of its development has resulted in significant pressure on communities to deal with its environmental consequences. Coalbed methane production often results in large quantities of water that are released as byproducts of production; in some cases, the water may inundate sensitive and ecosystems, worsen surface water quality, and diminish underground water supplies. Noise, dust, and increased traffic; impairment of visibility and conflicts with recreation and other land use; impacts on wildlife and ecosystems; and other consequences of development have generated opposition in many communities. Particularly vexing has been development on split estates, where surface owners do not own the mineral rights underneath their property and are required to cooperate with development that may disrupt the use and control of their land. This article examines the problems associated with coalbed methane development and offers a variety of suggestions for how conflicts could be reduced and how development could proceed in ways that are ecologically sustainable.

DE Ebenezer Howard; garden cities; metabolic rift; urban planning; urban
   reform; sustainability
AB Ebenezer Howard advocated the construction of garden cities to reduce the alienation of human society from nature. The social world was to be reorganized and integrated into the surrounding environment to ensure sustainable interactions. In Garden Cities of To-morrow, Howard provided an outline of a garden city that promised a clean environment, free from air and water pollution, and an abundance of parks and open spaces. Social production was organized for local demands with the goal of creating self-sustaining communities, thus reducing the need for long-distance trade. Howard insisted that the long-term sustainability of garden cities was founded on abiding by the law of restitution, where all wastes were recycled back to the soil to ensure the continued productive potential of the land. In this, Howard's garden cities dissolved the divide between town and country and provided a model for an ecologically sustainable society.

SO OUTLOOK ON AGRICULTURE
LA English
DT Article
DE countryside stewardship; social capital
ID AGRI-ENVIRONMENTAL SCHEMES; PARTICIPATION; CONSTRAINTS; UK
AB The EU provides farmers with incentives to adopt Countryside Stewardship Schemes (CSS) using subsidies in the framework of the agri-environmental regulation of the EU (2078/92), now included in the more general regulation on rural development. In this paper, a case study of 36 farmers in the village of Bierbeek was carried out to investigate the determinants of the willingness to adopt a scheme involving taking care of arable field margins in particular. Bivariate and multivariate logit analysis confirmed not only the importance of personal, structural and financial factors, but also showed the importance of social capital. Farmers who are more open to both professional and non-professional contacts are more likely to adopt a CSS. Hence, government and extension agencies should undertake more efforts to involve farmers as much as possible in activities of a professional and/or non-professional nature to stimulate them to adopt sustainable farming practices.

AB Fiscal rules in a monetary union should (1) be simple; (2) ensure the solvency of the state; (3) relate to the consolidated general government and central bank; (4) be neutral as regards the size of the public sector; (5) avoid pro-cyclical behaviour of the fiscal policy instruments; (6) also make sense in the long run; (7) allow for important differences in economic structure and initial conditions; (8) aggregate into behaviour that makes sense at the level of the union as a whole; (9) be credible; and (10) be enforced impartially and consistently. The paper reviews the rules of the Stability and Growth Pact, the UK's golden rule and sustainable-investment rule, and Buiter and Grafe's permanent-balance rule from the perspective of how well they meet these ten criteria.

TI The future of the 'Radical Centre' in Northern Ireland after the Good
   Friday Agreement
SO POLITICAL STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
AB The 1998 Good Friday Agreement has provided a new political dispensation in Northern Ireland. Through the management of the competing aims of unionism and nationalism, the Agreement hopes to promote cross-community consensus and forge a new, moderate centre. However, the segmental autonomy evident under the consociationalism of the Agreement poses questions of the existing political centre in Northern Ireland. Traditionally, the centre, as represented by the Alliance Party, has rejected unionism and nationalism, believing either to be ideologies to be overcome, rather than accommodated. Under the post-Agreement political arrangements, Alliance has already been obliged to bolster pro-Agreement unionism, through the temporary tactical redesignation of three of its Assembly members as Unionist and through tacit support for selected unionist election candidates. Using the first ever membership survey of the existing centre party in Northern Ireland, this article examines whether its vision of a radical third tradition is sustainable in a polity in which unionist and nationalist politics are legitimised.

AB Thermoplastic starch (TPS), as opposed to dry starch, is capable of flow and hence when mixed with other synthetic polymers can behave in a manner similar to conventional polymer-polymer blends. This paper presents an approach to preparing polyethylene/thermoplastic starch blends with unique properties. A one-step combined twin-screw/single screw extrusion setup is used to carry out the melt-melt mixing of the components. Glycerol is used as the starch plasticizer and its content in the TPS is varied from 29 to 40%.
   Under the particular one-step processing conditions used it is possible to develop continuous TPS (highly interconnected) and co-continuous polymer/TPS blend extruded ribbon which possess a high elongation at break, modulus and strength in the machine direction. The PE/TPS (55:45) blend prepared with TPS containing 36% glycerol maintains 94% of the elongation at break and 76% of the modulus of polyethylene. At a composition level of 71:29 PE/TPS for the same glycerol content, the blend retains 96% of the elongation at break and 100% of the modulus of polyethylene. These excellent properties are achieved in the absence of any interfacial modifier and despite the high levels of immiscibility in the polar-nonpolar TPS-PE system. The 55:45 blend possesses a 100% continuous or fully interconnected TPS morphology, as measured by hydrolytic extraction. This highly continuous TPS configuration within the blend should enhance its potential for environmental biodegradation. The elongation at break in the cross direction of these materials, although lower than the machine direction properties, also demonstrates ductility at high TPS concentrations. At a glycerol content of 36% in the TPS, the blends demonstrate only very low levels of sensitivity to moisture. A high degree of transparency is maintained over the entire concentration range due to the similar refractive indices of PE and TPS and the virtual absence of interfacial microvoiding.
   Effective control of the glycerol content, TPS concentration and processing conditions can result in a wide variety of morphological structures including spherical, fiber-like, highly continuous and co-continuous morphologies. These various blend morphologies are shown to be the determining parameters with respect to the observed mechanical properties.
   This material has the added benefit of containing large quantities of a renewable resource and hence represents a more sustainable alternative to pure synthetic polymers. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI An empirical environmental Sustainability Index derived solely from

SO POPULATION AND ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
DE sustainability; nighttime imagery; ecosystem services
ID POPULATION
AB This paper describes a crude yet simple Environmental Sustainability Index (ESI) derived solely from the ratio of two classified satellite images with global coverage. An ESI is calculated for each nation of the world by dividing the amount of light energy emitted by that nation as measured by a nighttime satellite image into the total value of that nation's ecosystem services as measured by a land-cover dataset and ecosystem service values estimated,by Costanza et. al. (Costanza, d'Arge et al., 1997). The strength of this ESI is its simplicity and global coverage (other ESIs involve hundreds of variables which usually entail many 'data gaps'). The utility of this ESI is not as 'the' measure of environmental sustainability but as 'a' measure that can be compared to other ESIs in interesting and informative ways. Measuring environmental sustainability is a difficult challenge that is being undertaken by more and more people and institutions using a wide variety of methods. If independent measures of sustainability do not correspond reasonably well with one another then the practical utility of deriving ESIs will be undermined because the exercise will be perceived as more political than scientific. Two sophisticated ESIs are examined and compared to this simple one: 1) The 2001 Environmental Sustainability Index derived as an initiative of the Global Leaders of Tomorrow Environment Task Force, World Economic Forum, and 2) Ecological Footprints of Nations: How much Nature do they use? How much Nature do they have? developed by Mathis Wackernagel and others as a "Rio + 5" forum study and financed by The Earth Council in Costa Rica. These two indices are a composite of many sub-indices some of which correlate highly; however, the final nationally aggregated figures of the 2001 Environmental Sustainability Index and the comparable Ecological Footprint index do not correlate at all. The Eco-Value/Night Light index described here corresponds strongly with the Ecological Footprint Index and not at all with the Environmental Sustainability Index. Some of the implications of the lack of coherence between these three measures are discussed.

AB The market share of alternative fuels in UK road freight transport is less than 1%, despite several promotional initiatives. However, the use of fuels other than diesel in heavy goods vehicles is potentially one of the key methods of improving the environmental performance of transport and therefore making it more sustainable. This paper investigates a number of factors that affect the actual and potential adoption of alternative fuel technologies within the UK road haulage industry. The study focuses on the political and commercial environment surrounding the uptake of alternative fuels and suggests how the distribution network structure may determine the level of penetration of alternative fuels into the road-based freight transport sector. UK policy initiatives such as Powershift are important in this context.

AB Trees fulfil important aesthetic, social and environmental functions in urban areas. However, tree life is increasingly under stress, leading to poor vitality and tree decline, particularly in urban streets. The requirements for healthy tree life are broadly known. Criteria for the design of planting sites in streets, choice of tree species and maintenance requirements are outlined in the paper. However, a European survey reveals the wide variance of tree planting and management practice. UK cities and towns performed poorly against criteria such as level of expenditure for trees, street tree quality and site preparation. Evidently, trees are very much undervalued and only an afterthought in the process of planning, design and management of streets. There is an urgent need to develop and apply comprehensive concepts for sustainable urban forests and specifically for street tree plantings. Standards for site planning, as well as increased knowledge of suitable tree species and tree quality standards are key to achieving this goal. Information on best practice needs to be more widely disseminated. The European pilot survey was a first step towards establishing an information network across Europe to collect the information needed for this purpose. There is a need for close collaboration between civil engineers and landscape architects from a very early stage to integrate tree plantings into the design of streets, in order to maximise their benefits and avoid potential conflicts with traffic and utilities.

AB This paper is concerned with the risk assessment of person-entry utility tunnels as a fundamental design and operational parameter, analysing the potential hazards for each of the utilities. Accessibility and maintainability of distribution systems are key factors in selecting underground tunnels over other methods of utility distribution. However, underground tunnels present synergistic aspects, becoming highly complex and difficult to manage. Utility tunnels must be designed to minimise the potential for personal injury and illness. Nevertheless, for urban areas utility tunnels are potentially one of the most sustainable urban underground facilities. They must therefore be considered as an option in urban planning, even though their design and operational risks might seem discouraging.

DE supply chain; food production network; simulation game; governance;
   sustainability; trust
AB This position paper introduces a simulation gaming environment for enacting a production network. The environment aims to be an integrative laboratory for investigating supply networks, as well as being a versatile training tool. The primary focus is on food production networks. The environment enables a number of teams of participants, each representing one actor in a food chain, to conduct business together. The teams can have the role of auction, co-operation, wholesaler, factory, retail chain, and retail outlet. Producers and consumers are either enacted or simulated. The game leaders freely determine the products and production methods in each run of the game. The gaming environment takes performance, process and institutional aspects of chains into account. It is particularly suited for investigating issues of sustainability and trust. Currently the gaming environment is under development. The paper presents version 1B. This version can be found at http://www.chaingame.org. It runs on the Web, enabling to model distributed chains.

DT Article
DE environmental audit; bench mark; solid waste; golf course;
   sustainability
AB This paper provides non-hazardous solid waste audit procedures and bench mark audit data for golf courses (GCs). The paper also demonstrates the narrow scope of solid waste audit data, and the need to move towards a broader auditing scope such as that contained in sustainability auditing frameworks. A case study of Clear Lake Golf Course, located in southwestern Manitoba, Canada was completed. Annual waste generation rates at the GC were estimated to be 46.2 tonnes/year with 83% of this material compostable. Grass clipping material generated from the putting greens accounted for 79% of the waste stream. The GC achieved a solid waste diversion rate of 81% (waste generated not destined for landfill per total waste material generated). A future, realistic target of 97% diversion was also identified. The 7 day audit period was found to be unsuitable for estimating grass clipping generation rates. Implementation of a broader sustainability framework for future audits will harmonize many existing management functions such as solid waste auditing, waste characterizations, pollution prevention, green procurement, customer satisfaction, and the efficiency of the operations.

AB The greenhouse gas emissions of a steel mill have already been described rather extensively from a process metallurgy point-of-view (3) and the potential impact of alternative technologies has been estimated, especially by taking into account innovative concepts that still need long term development. To progress further, it is necessary to carry out the analysis at a broader scale than the steel mill itself. Downstream, it is possible to utilize slag in the cement industry to replace natural resources, blast furnace gases in an energy optimized power plant and coke oven gas to produce hydrogen to be used as a fuel to power a fuel cell driven electrical automobiles. Upstream, it also makes sense to use secondary raw materials and secondary energy sources instead of coal or natural gas. Moreover, sustainable recycling, i.e. carried out an indefinite number of times, reduces emissions drastically.

AB Engineers have a duty of care to end users of the systems they design under current statutes and at common law. Considerations such as cognitive compatibility and usability of equipment and system design are becoming issues of increasing importance, as society becomes more reliant on information technology and automation. That engineers contribute to human error in these systems through latent design error and poor management decision-making is well documented. Therefore, the role of engineers can be considered integral to positive outcomes in workplace safety.
   This research offers an opportunity to understand why engineering design work may be contributing to human error on part of the operator, and offers hope toward a future when engineers will embrace safe design principles. This cross sectional study examines the relationship between professional engineering education and ergonomics. This research specifically addresses the attitudes of engineers to the inclusion of ergonomic principles in engineering practice and in undergraduate engineering curriculum.
   It was found that the surveyed members of the Australasian Association for Engineering Education (AAEE) had a positive attitude toward the inclusion of ergonomic principles in their design practice. The intensity of their attitude was more positive if they had some previous exposure to ergonomic training. At present few engineering faculties systematically include ergonomic principles in their design courses. The most encouraging finding was the overwhelming support for the inclusion of ergonomic principles in undergraduate engineering curriculum. This finding was complimented by current literature suggesting a changing engineering paradigm, one that would facilitate and embrace these concepts, encouraging promotion of sustainable engineering design well into the future.

ID WORLD; FOOD
AB This article analyses the inter-relationships among food consumption practices, marketers' representations of sugar, and the history and political economy of sugar production. It focuses on the 'supermarket narratives-stories regarding place and production that appear on commodity packaging-used to market sugar in the USA. It explores bow competition within the sweetener industry, as shaped by the material qualities of sweeteners, has given rise to supermarket narratives that seek to differentiate sugars on the basis of ideas of place, freshness and environmental sustainability. It also examines how, at the same time, sweetener users have co-operated to maintain and increase consumption in the USA. The article begins with a discussion of historical patterns of sweetener consumption in the USA, and then looks at the genesis of the primary sugar industry lobbying organization. The case study of Florida sugar producers is used to demonstrate the historical antecedents of supermarket narratives and the contemporary geographical specificity of the political economy underlying supermarket narratives.

TI Thresholds of leaf nitrogen for optimum fruit production and quality in
   grapefruit
SO SOIL SCIENCE SOCIETY OF AMERICA JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
ID YIELD; MANAGEMENT; CITRUS
AB Fertilization is critical for sustainable production of citrus on sandy soils. However, information on nutritional diagnosis standards for grapefruit (Citrus x paradisi Macfad.) is lacking and this information is needed for implementation of best management practices (BMPs). A field experiment was conducted from 1997 to 2000 on a Riviera fine sand (loamy, siliceous, hyperthermic, Arenic Glossaqualf) with 30-yr-61d+ white Marsh grapefruit trees on sour orange (Citrus aurantium L.) rootstock to evaluate irrigation and fertilization effects on fruit yield and quality, and to validate leaf nutrient concentration standards for guiding fertilization of grapefruit. Fertilizers were applied as water soluble granular (WSG, 3 applications yr(-1)) by fertigation (FRT, 15 applications yr(-1)), or controlled-release fertilizers (CRF, 1 application yr(-1)) and at five rates (0, 56, 112, 168, or 224 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)) with an N:P:K blend (1.0:0.17:1.02). Fruit yield and quality were not affected by irrigation treatments or fertilizer sources. There was a significantly positive correlation between leaf N concentrations and N rates (r = 0.98**). Fruit yield was linearly related to N rates or leaf N concentrations. At 90% of maximum yield, leaf N concentrations (dry weight basis) were 22 to 23 g kg(-1). Fruit quality parameters such as soluble solid concentration (SSC), juice, and total soluble solids (TSS) were positively correlated with leaf N concentrations, whereas fruit titratable acidity (TA) was negatively related to leaf N concentrations or N rates. The effect of N rate on TA outweighed that on SSC and consequently, the SSC/TA ratio decrease increasing N rates or leaf N concentration. Fruit size was quadratically related to N rate or leaf N concentration. Overall, fruit sizes and SSC/TA ratios were acceptable. for fresh marketing or processing at leaf N concentrations of 22 to 23 g kg(-1). Therefore, this leaf N concentration of 22 to 23 g kg(-1) can be considered the optimal concentration guideline for fertilization of grapefruit provided that other nutrients are sufficient.

AB Soil organic carbon (SOC) concentration was evaluated under three land use practices on sloping land of Kolombangara in Solomon Islands (5-12degreesS, 155-170degreesW). Three soil management treatments were: (1) natural forest, (2) traditional farming practice, and (3) topsoil removal. The SOC concentration was high in the surface layer of soil under natural forest and decreased sharply with depth. The SOC concentration of the 0-15 cm depth was significantly greater under natural forest (67 g kg(-1)) compared to the traditional farming (24 g kg(-1)) and topsoil removal (7 g kg(-1)) treatments. The depletion of SOC concentration in traditional farming and topsoil removal treatments decreased the mean weight diameter (MWD) of water stable aggregates. In this strongly structured soil, the traditional farming treatment had no detrimental effect on water stable macroaggregates (WSA) for either of the two depths. WSAs in natural forest had significantly higher SOC concentration compared to the microaggregates. There was no difference in SOC concentration among different aggregate size fractions in the topsoil removal treatment. The traditional farming treatment based on slash-and-burn agriculture depleted the SOC pool in the top 30 cm layer by 52.2 Mg C ha(-1) compared with natural forest. The loss of SOC pool in the topsoil removal treatment was 94.8 Mg C ha(-1) compared with natural forest. Severe erosion, leading to a complete loss of topsoil as in the case of the topsoil removal treatment, has drastic adverse impacts on productivity and quality of the exposed sub-soil. Thus, there is a strong need to identify viable alternatives to slash-and-burn agriculture now widely practiced in the Solomon Islands. In this regard, a judicious use of chemical fertilizers and biosolids may be crucial to achieving sustainable production. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In spite of the growing interest in sustainable advantages, there has been little effort by strategy researchers to investigate market dominance. In this paper, the extent of dominance by leading firms is linked to the ability to develop and exploit their reputation as a key resource. Results from a wide spectrum of consumer product markets indicate that the advantages that stem from reputation are typically tied to specific industry characteristics. In particular, dominance is more likely to be observed in industries that offer consumer products that are purchased frequently and have lower prices. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

AB Some strategy scholars and practitioners contend that markets have become increasingly hyper-competitive in recent years. We examine this contention by analyzing industry and business performance patterns in a broad sample of firms drawn from the Compustat Industry Segment database for the 1978-97 period. We find little support for the argument that markets have become more hypercompetitive. From the late 1970s to the late-1980s we observe decreased performance and market stability, consistent with increasing hypercompetition contentions. From the late 1980s to the mid-1990s, however, trends reverse and performance and market stability increase. For strategy research, our results suggest that hypercompetitive perspectives are important but no more so now than they were in recent years. For practice, our results suggest that managers today face markets no more dynamic and opportunities to gain and sustain competitive advantage no more challenging than in the past. Accordingly, they should continue developing a portfolio of skills to manage businesses whether conditions are increasingly stable or unstable. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

AB Achieving more sustainable land and water use depends on high-quality information and its improved use. In other words, better linkages are needed between science and management. Since many stakeholders with different relationships to the natural resources are inevitably involved, we suggest that collaborative learning environments and improved information management are prerequisites for integrating science and management. Case studies that deal with resource management issues are presented that illustrate the creation of collaborative learning environments through systems analyses with communities, and an integration of scientific and experiential knowledge of components of the system. This new knowledge needs to be captured and made accessible through innovative information management systems designed collaboratively with users, in forms which fit the users' 'mental models' of how their systems work. A model for linking science and resource management more effectively is suggested. This model entails systems thinking in a collaborative learning environment, and processes to help convergence of views and value systems, and make scientists and different kinds of managers aware of their interdependence. Adaptive management provides a mechanism for applying and refining scientists' and managers' knowledge. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

SO TECHNOLOGICAL FORECASTING AND SOCIAL CHANGE
LA English
DT Article
AB The concept of economic development appeared during the postwar period as the basis and the source of a very strong hope of eradicating extreme poverty from the face of the Earth. All along the three first decades of this period-the second half of the 20th century-this promise did not seem questionable. It was thought that there were clear signs that material progress reaching larger sectors of the population and economic growth were parallel processes, linked to urbanization. A new style was thus c established - that of modem large cities, However, the dynamics of this period appears to be strongly associated with the economic activity related to the basic construction of one's own lifestyle. The effects of structural market saturation and the limits of the redistribution of income began to be noticed in as far back as the end of the 1960s, and even more clearly so towards the end of the 1970s. That was the moment when population growth in the megalopolises and large cities in general began to become stable and even to decline in absolute value. It was also the time when the acceleration of technological innovation began to play a major role in development policies, while low social inclusion and marginalization problems became evident. This paper delves into this hypothesis on the basis of ample empirical evidence. Numerous conclusions are drawn from the analysis, which are useful for a serious restatement of the controversial issue of Sustainable Development. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

DE (Waste) water management; leather fabrication; developing countries
AB In developing countries adequate water management related to technical production systems can reduce major health and environmental problems.
   This paper describes a general model of industrial water metabolism, using a leather factory as a case study. Here, integral chain management is the most important tool. Methods showing how mass balances can be constructed when insufficient data are available, are the main focus. The model is useful for mapping industrial activities and comparing them with corresponding systems in industrialised countries. The figures presented in this paper serve as a frame of reference.
   The main reason for realising clean and sustainable production systems in industrialised Countries is the very strict environmental legislation and control systems. Nevertheless, the desired results are not always obtained. Moving activities to countries with weaker environmental legislation can aggravate problems. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

TI Telemedicine in the state of Maine: A model for growth driven by rural
   needs
SO TELEMEDICINE JOURNAL AND E-HEALTH

ID TELEHEALTH; SERVICE; DIFFUSION; BARRIER; SUCCESS; CARE
AB As of mid-2002, Maine had one of the largest state-wide telemedicine systems, comprising over 150 facilities among 90 health, mental health, and social service provider organizations in two collaborative networks. The rapid growth of telemedicine in this rural, economically disadvantaged state is largely attributable to collaborative development and the service activities of the Maine Telemedicine Services division of a rural community health center, HealthWays/Regional Medical Center at Lubec (RMCL). Annual clinical uses of the system across a broad array of interactive videoconferencing applications currently exceed 1, 000 instances for institutional telemedicine and 800 instances for home telehealth. The major applications include mental health/psychiatry, endocrinology/diabetes management, primary care, specialty pediatrics, genetics, and dermatology. Primary care usage derives from a relatively novel use of a mobile telemedicine boat to serve small islands off mid-coastal Maine. Strong future growth is expected in prison telemedicine, emergency medical triage, and non-traditional services such as video relay interpretive services for the deaf, domestic violence advocacy and legal services, and case management for community reintegration of juvenile offenders. The relative success of the two large networks managed by RMCL's Maine Telemedicine Services is evident from the criteria that system usage (1) addresses defined clinical needs, (2) has demonstrable organizational support, (3) is accepted by physicians and patients, (4) exhibits measurable cost and clinical benefits, and (5) is moving toward sustainable operations. Potential bases for this success are discussed in comparison with other networks.

AB Manufacture of pulp or paper results in the production of several byproducts including pulp sludge, wood yard debris, bark, and ash. Mill sludges are either landfilled or anaerobically digested by placing them in treatment ponds. Aerobic composting is a technically feasible and environmentally sustainable alternative that is being explored by the pulp and paper industry. This article reports on aerobic composting of seven different virgin Kraft mill sludges (three untreated, three anaerobically treated for 6 months, and one anaerobically treated for 18 months) and compares these treatments using dry matter degradation, compost stability, and compost maturity at the end of 30 d of composting as indicators. Results confirm that the type of sludge (i.e., degree of pretreatment) significantly affects the amount of degradation during aerobic composting and the stability of the product after 30 d of composting. Average dry matter loss during composting of untreated primary sludges, 6-month treated secondary sludges, and 18-month treated tertiary sludges were 20.5%, 11.4%, and 0.4%, respectively. Average stability indices at the end of test were 0.39 and 0.25 mg-O-2/g-VS/h for primary and 6-month treated secondary sludges, respectively. Maturity indices of compost products at the end of 4 weeks of aerobic treatment were found to be independent of the type of sludge (primary, secondary, or tertiary).

AB The attainment of a sustainable transportation system necessitates changes in the travel behavior of individuals. In this article, a descriptive presentation of travel survey data as well as attitude surveys tests the hypothesis that women are potentially more adaptable to a sustainable transportation system than men are. This is accomplished in four parts. First, results from Swedish travel survey data have found that men travel more kilometers per year, use the car more than women with regard to the number of kilometers traveled per day, and make more trips as the sole occupant of a car. Second, results from attitude surveys show that women are more environmentally concerned and express more criticism of automobility than men. Third, women are more positive towards proposals that reduce or eliminate the environmental impact of car use to a greater extent than men. Fourth, women express more willingness to reduce their use of the car than men. In general, while there are not large differences between men and women and their attitudes towards automobility, women consistently show more support of ecological issues and are more positive towards measures which entail reductions in car use, such as improving and expanding public transportation. Women were furthermore more prepared to participate in ecologically benign activities to a greater extent than men, which included reducing car use. Because of the tendencies shown in the empirical results presented here, women are judged to have more potential for accommodating an ecologically sustainable transportation system in Sweden than men are.

DE car dependence; Hong Kong; traffic reduction
AB Reducing car traffic to improve transport sustainability has become a major goal of transport policy. This is also the case in Hong Kong where car ownership and use is, by international standards, very low. The objectives here are first to determine why people own cars in Hong Kong, second to explore how dependent car owners are on their cars and third to identify the policy implications. Based on a survey of 401 car owners, the finding is that despite the existence of excellent public transport, once a car has been acquired, people become dependent on it for virtually all journey purposes. To achieve greater sustainability, therefore, car ownership and use must be controlled. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

SO TROPICAL GRASSLANDS
LA English
DT Article
AB A survey was conducted in Dubluk, Medecho, Did-Hara, Did-Yabello, Web and Melbana grazing areas of Borana to analyse the pastoralists' traditional practices and strategies for sustainable resource use. A total of 36 sites were selected and data were collected by formal and informal interview using a questionnaire and group discussion, respectively. Among the 288 (17 female and 271 male) pastoralists interviewed, 144 (50%) reported that traditional grazing practices, although effective for sustainable resource use, are becoming highly marginalised due to ranching, allocation of communal grazing areas to private investors, cultivation and privately reserved pasture areas (Kalo). Recent increases in human and livestock populations, and decreases in grazing lands, have eroded the effectiveness of traditional management to mitigate risks of livestock losses during drought, and resilience of the rangelands, with a severe impact on the livelihood of the pastoralists. A decline in total biomass production and animal performance in the study areas was observed during recent years. Participatory planning and development intervention strategies based on traditional knowledge and values were suggested for sustainable resource use and development.

ID SOCIAL EXCLUSION; EMPOWERMENT; LOCALISM; POLITICS; LESSONS; STATE
AB The meteoric rise of 'participation' in urban policy is premised upon the supposed benefits it brings in terms of added project 'efficiency', 'sustainability' and even 'empowerment' of participants. Yet, even as participation appears to reach its very zenith, it comes under heightened criticism from a growing chorus of observers. Some critics have suggested, for example, that 'participation', and contemporary urban regeneration's preferred institutional vehicle for it, 'partnership', can have a capacity for tyrannical decision-making. The article draws upon a diverse range of literature, including the rich experience of almost 20 years of 'participation' in the 'developing world', as well as the findings of a research project looking at a major regeneration programme on Merseyside, in order to highlight the multifaceted problems of--and possibilities for--participation. Ultimately, whether participation can alter social stratification within communities is unclear, it may even (re)produce inequalities. The difficulties should not mean that the participatory project is jettisoned. Rather, the article is a call for a research and policy debate characterised by a greater degree of honesty and maturity concerning participation.

AB This study seeks to provide information on water pricing in Ghana. It looks at the experiences in water pricing practices, the problems and successes encountered in the country. It outlines the reforms instituted in the water sector for the provision and sustainability of urban, rural, and agricultural water supplies to address the problems. Also discussed are the institutional arrangements put in place to ensure the coordinated management of the country water resources. Finally, the study makes suggestions on how the problems on water pricing can be effectively addressed particularly in ensuring consumer protection and investor interest with the obvious introduction of the private sector in the urban water service delivery.

TI Urban water management in Greece - Present conditions and perspectives
   of sustainability
SO WATER INTERNATIONAL

   water policy; water pricing
AB Greece, a developing Mediterranean country in Southeastern Europe, faces serious water problems. A series of geomorphological, meteoroogical, and hydrological conditions, in addition to the particular social, economic, and administrative circumstances are currently making sustainable water management a rather complex, difficult, and frustrating task. Present water resource management practices have proven insufficient to integrate both socio-economic development and environmental ecosystem integrity. The results of a survey on the economic and demand management aspects of the urban water policy in Greece are presented and evaluated in this paper Water shortages, which occur mainly during the summer and especially on the islands, high-water consumption rates, a wide variety of water pricing policies, lack of public participation, sectoral and fragmented rather than integrated water management, and the fact that water is considered to be a social commodity are only some of the findings of the survey. The present situation is evaluated and discussed, and the perspectives of a new, demand-oriented urban water management are investigated in an effort to shift urban water policy in Greece towards sustainability.

TI Water and the CGIAR: A strategic framework
SO WATER INTERNATIONAL
LA English
DT Article
DE water management; water use efficiency; water productivity; watersheds;
   aquatic ecosystems
AB Among the many institutions addressing development issues at the international level, the 16 research centers of the Consultative Group of International Agricultural Research (CGIAR)focus on the goal of reducing poverty, hunger, and malnutrition by sustainably increasing productivity of resources in agriculture, forestry, and fisheries. The CGIAR has certain comparative advantages in carrying work in water at the various scales, from the farm up to global, that should be offered to the international community. This discussion paper addresses the question: what are the major water issues relevant to the CGIAR goal? The paper also presents a justfication of the research needs and opportunities as well as some initial ideas for the development of a specific research agenda on each area. While other international organizations are very active in many international initiatives, the CGIAR is one of the few that could contribute much needed research information in many world areas. The CGIAR must focus more on water in relation to the plight of the poor in particular There is a need to increase the adaptive capacity of the poor and to manage the water supply and quality constraints. This could be achieved by focusing at the community level and by developing inexpensive, easy to use monitoring tools that would alert the communities of forthcoming problems and provide them with means to take remedial action. This action is often needed long before there is any hope of changes in policy and other macro-level interventions. The fundamental issue of water as a food requires that attention be given to the quantity and quality of water available for domestic use in poor households and communities. Health issues associated with domestic supply and with irrigation management have been important research themes in the CGIAR and demand increasing attention. Given the current composition, activitiesm and comparative advantages of the CGIAR, it is proposed that research on water management should focus on the following four broad general areas: (1) improving the efficiency of water use in agriculture through increased water productivity; (2) management of watersheds for multiple functions; (3) management of aquatic ecosystems, in particular those sharing boundaries with terrestrial ecosystems; and (4) policy and institutional aspects of water management. As the aim of water management research is to address water constraints and issues in an integrated manner the four areas cannot be treated in isolation from each other There is thus a need for the fifth area for achieving integration at and across different scales.

AB dIt is becoming increasingly clear that prescriptions for rangeland weed control are not sustainable because they treat the symptoms of weeds rather than their cause. Future restoration of invasive plant-infested rangeland must be based on ecological principles and concepts that provide for predictable outcomes. A generalized objective for ecologically based weed management is to develop and maintain a healthy plant community that is largely invasion resistant. Successional management based on ecological principles involves modifying the processes controlling the three general causes of succession: disturbance, colonization, and species performance. The processes controlling plant community dynamics can be modified to allow predictable Successional trajectories. Successional management can lead to biomass optimization models for grazing management, spread vector analysis, and using resource availability to direct weedy plant communities toward those that are desired. Our challenge is to develop ecological principles on which management can be based.

ID POPULATION-STRUCTURE; BEHAVIOR
AB On 15 July 2000, a pod of about 80 long-finned pilot whales Globicephala melas was driven to the coast at Sandavagur, the Faroe Islands (62.055degreesN, 7.157degreesW) for the purpose of tagging selected whales with satellite-linked radio transmitters. A transmitter was attached to the anterior flank of the dorsal fin of four beached whales. After the tagging, all four whales were reunited with their pod and the entire pod was driven to sea. The positions of three of the four whales were tracked (one for a period of 47 days) and the results show that the whales separated after a few days and eventually went in different directions. After 10 days, two of the whales were observed together in a pod, and after 19 days two of the whales were located at positions determined to be within 2.3 km of each other. The whales showed a strong affinity for the deep water off the continental shelf. The sex and relatedness of the four, tagged whales were determined from skin biopsies. The tagged whales comprised one adult female with one juvenile in puberty, possibly her male offspring, and two adult males, one of which could be the offspring or the sibling of the female. The swimming speed of the whales was estimated at 0.2-14.5 km/hour, and they travelled average distances of 70-111 km/24 hours with a maximum of 200 km in 24 hours. Considering the mobility of the whales, it seems likely that the catches that occur at the Faroe Islands are recruited from a larger area in the North Atlantic than previously presumed. This suggests that the whales are taken from a larger population than that estimated from coastal areas around the Faroe Islands, hence increasing the probability that the harvest is sustainable.

TI Tight money in a post-crisis defense of the exchange rate: What have we
   learned?
SO WORLD BANK RESEARCH OBSERVER
LA English
DT Article
AB Critics of the tight monetary policies pursued by some of the countries hurt by the 1997 Asian financial crisis have questioned the presumption that tight money can help sustain the value of a currency, The issue is actually an empirical one because theory does not unambiguously predict the effect of tight money on the exchange rate under the circumstances faced by the crisis countries. This article reviews the empirical research and shows that the evidence does not yet support strong statements about post-crisis links between monetary policy and the exchange rate. Proposed deviations from a sustainable medium-term monetary policy stance should thus be viewed with skepticism.

AB Historically, desert mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus crooki) were distributed across the Chihuahuan Desert region in Mexico. Overgrazing and illegal hunting have been responsible for the dramatic reduction in the desert mule deer population. Through the introduction of hunting fees, desert mule deer could represent an important source of income for Mexican producers. In addition it could stimulate programs favoring sustainable management of Chihuahuan Desert ecosystems. Twenty sample units were established across Chihuahuan Desert regions in Coahuila and Nuevo Leon, Mexico. The deer population in each unit was surveyed using diurnal and nocturnal transects. Pellet group counts were conducted to provide an additional index to deer density. In each sampling unit, 50 2 X 5 in plots were established. Vegetation cover and diversity were also determined. We used range indicators to establish vegetation condition and trend. Correlation analyses were used to evaluate relationships between the deer population and habitat variables. Desert mule deer were present in only two of the sampling units. Range condition was at risk in 18 of the 20 sampled areas and poor in the other 2. Grass cover (%) (r = 0.56), ground cover (r = 0.53), range deterioration index (r = -0.29) and downward trend index (r = -0.42) were the highest correlated variables with mule deer occurrence.

AB In urban rivers, flow regime and channel morphology are the drivers of physical habitat quality for aquatic species. Peak discharges are increased at high flows as a result of impermeable catchments and channel engineering for flood protection schemes. Hazardous conditions and flashy hydrographs mean that measurement of velocities at high flows is a difficult task. This research uses a three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics (3D-CFD) model to simulate hydraulic patterns in two urban river channels. A 3D-CFD code, called SSIIM, was used to simulate hydraulic conditions in two engineered river reaches of the River Tame, Birmingham, UK. These two sites represent channels with different levels of engineering. Models were calibrated and tested using field measurements. Results show that modelled water surface levels and velocity profiles are well simulated. Calibrated roughness heights are compared with those derived from field measurement of sediment size. Numerical experiments are used to assess the relationship between grid resolution in the vertical dimension and the form of the modelled velocity profiles. Biologists have used laboratory experiments to determine maximum sustainable swimming speeds (MSSS) of fish, often in order to assess what level of a particular pollutant may be tolerable. In this work, simulations of high-flow hydraulic patterns are used to compare velocity patterns with fish MSSS. Results show that when the water levels rise to fill the, first channel of the two-stage channels at the sites, which occurred 16 times in 2000, MSSS are surpassed in the majority of available habitat, suggesting that excessive velocities at high flows are one factor that limits fish habitat. A comparison between the two reaches shows that there is less available habitat in the more modified reach. Conclusions suggest that an approach that integrates water quality issues and physical channel characteristics must be taken in river rehabilitation schemes, as improvements to water quality alone may not be sufficient to improve habitat quality to the desired level.

AB Paper recycling industries are oriented towards re-use and sustainability. These effects are combined in different ways to achieve the requirements on printing and writing papers. Biodeinking is an alternative analysed in this study. Cellulase uses improve ink detachment from old newspapers giving similar or better results when cellulase is used in place of classical chemicals. Cellulase needs an optimal contact time with the pulp suspension. Ink detachment can also be optimised by means of defibering efficiency and specific energy consumption. Increasing the consistency and decreasing the repulping time enhance savings and therefore sustainability. These two parameters are analysed in terms of shear factor lambda.

AB Performances of five deep tubewell (DTW) and ten shallow tubewell (STW) projects of the Rajbari district of central Bangladesh have been evaluated using some selected standard indicators, broadly classified into three groups: hydraulic, agricultural and socio-economic. For the quantitative and qualitative assessments of the indicators, field measurements and questionnaire survey of farmers and tubewell owners were made during the 1998-99 dry season. Analyses of hydraulic indicators showed that the performances of both the projects (DTWs and STWs) in terms of discharge and water delivery were better than those in the past. Equity in water delivery was not ensured in both the projects mainly because of low canal density. Agricultural performance, evaluated in terms of irrigated area, yield and production performance, was almost the same for both the projects and was greater than the respective national averages. Socio-economic indicators showed that both the projects were financially viable and sustainable. Hydraulic, agricultural and socio-economic indicators used in this study are recommended for evaluation of performances of irrigation projects and also to for comparative analysis of performances of similar irrigation projects.

AB Winter wheat monoculture occupies a large area of the Loess Plateau dryland region of China. Its yield is mainly limited by available water and fertilization. From the mid- 1980s, yield of winter wheat increased with fertilizer application, and this increased productivity may increase soil-water depletion and reduce available soil-water at planting. Besides rainfall during the growing season, an important source of water for the crops is stored soil-water at planting. In the long run, increasing fertilization may not be sufficient to maintain higher yield. To develop better dryland crop and water management practices, a 15-year experiment of winter wheat monoculture was conducted at the Changwu Agri-ecological Station of the Loess Plateau from 1984 to 1999. Different levels of productivity were implemented by the application of chemical fertilizers and manure. The experimental design consisted of a control treatment (CTL) and three fertilizer treatments: nitrogen, phosphorus and manure (NPM), nitrogen and phosphorus (NP), and manure (M). Compared to CTL, on average, treatments NPM, NP and M increased yield by 148, 110 and 59%, and decreased soilwater at planting by 102.6, 59.1 and 31.6 mm within the 300 cm profile, and soil-water at harvest by 142.3, 102.5 and 70.2 mm, respectively. There was a decrease of soil-water with time for fertilizer treatments. Crop yield with high fertilization treatments responded more to rainfall variations. Considering the importance of soil-water at planting for crop yield in dryland farming, winter wheat monoculture with high fertilization does not appear to be a sustainable management practice in the Loess Plateau dryland region of China.

TI Advanced access - Reducing waiting and delays in primary care
SO JAMA-JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION
LA English
DT Article
AB Delay of care is a persistent and undesirable feature of current health care systems. Although delay seems to be inevitable and linked to resource limitations, it often is neither.. Rather, it is usually the result of unplanned, irrational scheduling and resource allocation. Application of queuing theory and principles of industrial engineering, adapted appropriately to clinical settings, can reduce delay substantially, even in small practices, without requiring additional resources. One model, sometimes referred to as advanced access, has increasingly been shown to reduce waiting times in primary care. The core principle of advanced access is that patients calling to schedule a physician visit are offered an appointment the same day. Advanced access is not sustainable if patient demand for appointments is permanently greater than physician capacity to offer appointments. Six elements of advanced access are important in its application: balancing supply and demand, reducing backlog, reducing the variety of appointment types, developing contingency plans for unusual circumstances, working to adjust demand profiles, and increasing the availability of bottleneck resources. Although these principles are powerful, they are counter to deeply held beliefs and established practices in health care organizations. Adopting these principles requires strong leadership investment and support.

AB Secondary phenolic metabolites play an important role in plant defense mechanisms, and increasing evidence indicates that many are important in human health. To date, few studies have investigated the impact of various agricultural practices on levels of secondary plant metabolites. To address this issue, the total phenolic (TP) content of marionberries, strawberries, and corn grown by sustainable, organic, or conventional cultural practices were measured. Additionally, the effects of three common postharvest processing treatments (freezing, freeze-drying, and air-drying) on the TP content of these agricultural products were also investigated. Statistically higher levels of TPs were consistently found in organically and sustainably grown foods as compared to those produced by conventional agricultural practices. In all samples, freeze-drying preserved higher levels of TPs in comparison with air-drying.

ID MOSQUITOS
AB Malaria is endemic in India and its control has become a formidable task,. The Planning Commission of the Government of India estimates that 26.1% of the population of India lives below the poverty line. We have examined during 1999-2000, the status of malaria since 1965 in states below the poverty line. Reduction in poverty to about half since 1970 resulted in improvement in the situation in well-performing states. In contrast, the situation either deteriorated or remained unchanged in states with populations exceeding. the national average. Malaria control by chemicals is failing because of its transient nature and the convergence of many inherent technical and financial problems, thus making malaria control more refractory and its treatment enormously expensive. Sustainable control requires that the twin problems of poverty and environment be addressed in a holistic manner.

ID BENEFITS; CONTEXT
AB Since the mid-1980s, policy makers and planners in North America and Europe have been paying significantly more attention to measures designed to foster sustainable development and improve the quality of life in urban areas. One issue that has received widespread political support has been the cleanup and redevelopment of under-utilized brownfield sites in urban areas. In Canada and the US, the focus of policy-making and redevelopment efforts has been on redeveloping brownfield sites for industrial, commercial, or residential uses that provide economic benefits through tax revenues and/or jobs. However, there has been a growing recognition among community groups and environmental organizations that brownfields hold enormous potential for "greening" city environments, through the implementation of parks, playgrounds, trails, greenways, and other open spaces. The objectives of the current research are to examine the issues, obstacles and processes involved in remediating potentially contaminated urban brownfield sites and converting them into green spaces, to identify the benefits that these green spaces can bring to the community and culture, and to understand the specific planning processes that it involves. Data for this study were collected through a review of 10 pertinent "greening" case studies and personal interviews with relevant stakeholders. Toronto's brownfield-to-green space redevelopment experience has implications for cities across North America undergoing brownfield planning and seeking to enhance urban quality of life.

AB Urban expansion has been a hot topic not only in the management of sustainable development but also in the fields of remote sensing and geographic information science (GIS). After land reform initiated in 1987, Chinese cities are facing a new development wave, which is the mixture of urban expansion and redevelopment. Local urban planners are also facing a huge challenge to require the understanding of complex urban growth process, which involves various actors with different patterns of behavior. Modeling an urban development pattern is the prerequisite to understanding the process. This paper presents a spatial data analysis method to seek and model major determinants of urban growth in the period 1993-2000 by a case study of Wuhan City in PR China. The method comprises exploratory data analysis and spatial logistic regression technique. The former is able to visually explore the spatial impacts of each explanatory variable. The latter can provide a systematic confirmatory approach to comparing the variables. The study shows that the major determinants are urban road infrastructure and developed area, and master planning is losing its role in the specific period. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Brisbane Water is an estuary located at Gosford, 50 km north of Sydney on the east coast of Australia. It contains seagrass, mangrove and saltmarsh habitat. As part of a more widespread trend along the southeast coast of Australia, between 1954 and 1995 saltmarsh habitat within the estuary declined by 78.2% while mangrove habitat fluctuated with initial decline, recovery and further decline to 1995 with an overall increase by 3.7% and exhibiting a marked migration of mangroves into saltmarsh areas. No single factor is responsible for the changes. A combination of both natural and human induced processes is responsible. The loss of diversity and the sustainability of mangroves and saltmarshes require a strategic planning approach towards their management. Such an approach needs to ensure that estuarine and catchment processes are considered in an integrated manner. The influence of human activities on natural processes, which affects the extent and distribution of estuarine wetlands, can also be managed through an integrated planning process.

AB The proposed introduction of genetically modified herbicide tolerant (GMHT) crops, with claims of improved weed control, has prompted fears about possible environmental impacts of their widespread adoption, particularly on arable weeds, insects and associated farmland birds. In response to this, we have developed a novel weed-management system for GMHT sugar beet, based on band spraying, which exploits the flexibility offered by the broad-spectrum partner herbicides. Here, we show the results from two series of field experiments which, taken together, demonstrate that, by using this system, crops can be managed for enhanced weed and insect biomass without compromising yield, thus potentially offering food and shelter to farmland birds and other wildlife. These results could be applicable widely to other row crops, and indicate that creative use of GMHT technology could be a powerful tool for developing more sustainable farming systems in the future.

AB The rice-wheat cropping system, occupying 24 million hectares of the productive area in South Asia and China, is important for food security. Monitoring long-term changes in crop yields and identifying the factors associated with such changes are essential to maintain and/or improve crop productivity. Long-term experiments (LTE) provide these opportunities. We analyzed 33 rice-wheat LTE in the Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGP) of South Asia, non-IGP in India, and China to investigate the extent of yield stagnation or decline and identify possible causes of yield decline. In treatments where recommended rates of N, P and K were applied, yields of rice and wheat stagnated in 72 and 85% of the LTE, respectively, while 22 and 6% of the LTE showed a significant (P < 0.05) declining trend for rice and wheat yields, respectively. In the rice-wheat system, particularly in the IGP, rice yields are declining more rapidly than wheat. The causes of yield decline are mostly location-specific but depletion of soil K seems to be a general cause. In over 90% of the LTE, the fertilizer K rates used were not sufficient to sustain a neutral K input-output balance. Depletion of soil C, N and Zn and reduced availability of P, delays in planting, decreases in solar radiation and increases in minimum temperatures are the other potential causes of yield decline. A more efficient, integrated strategy with detailed data collection is required to identify the specific causes of yield decline. Constant monitoring of LTEs and analysis of the data using improved statistical and simulation tools should be done to unravel the cause-effect relationships of productivity and sustainability of rice-wheat systems.

AB Recognising the ecological importance of Himalayan forests in terms of their intrinsic values as life support system for the local people and as repository of regional biodiversity, the present study was conducted. It aimed at assessing the status of available forest resources, current levels of pressure on them and sustainability of current land use practices in a part of district Uttarkashi in Garhwal Himalaya. We quantified available standing biomass, regeneration and population of highly preferred species and their consumption patterns. The study revealed a spatio-temporal variation in resource extraction. The standing biomass of preferred woody species at low altitude permanent villages and high altitude summer camping sites (Kharaks) were 140.68 +/- 26.91 and 477.46 +/- 31.8 t/ha, respectively. Average fuel wood consumption per household at permanent villages was 14.65 +/- 0.78 kg/day whereas consumption per,temporary hut (Chhans) at camping sites was 36.42 +/- 3.35 kg/day. Higher per capita consumption of fuel wood in the camping sites due to seasonal migration of local as well as transhumants locally known as Gujjars had put immense pressure on sub-alpine forests. An increase in the demands for natural resources was noticed due to an augmented influx of tourists, which would further lead to the degradation of already scarce resources in the sub-alpine areas. Thus increased resource extraction from the low as well as high altitude forests simultaneously, may not be sustainable in the long run. In near future this might affect the status of the undisturbed forest at middle elevation, which has relatively high available biomass and regeneration capacity. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB In order to contribute to a better understanding of the impact of air pollution and other environmental factors on forest ecosystems, a Pan-European Programme for Intensive and Continuous Monitoring of Forest Ecosystems has been implemented in 1994. Results of the Programme must contribute to a European wide overview of impacts of air pollution and the further development of its control strategies, being described in air pollution protocols. Objectives of the Intensive Monitoring Programme related to air pollution are the assessment of: (i) responses of forest ecosystems to changes in air pollution; (ii) differences between present loads and critical loads (long-term sustainable inputs) of atmospheric deposition; and (iii) impacts of future scenarios of atmospheric deposition on the ecosystem condition. Furthermore, the Intensive Monitoring Programme contributes to the assessment of 'criteria and indicators for sustainable forest management', such as the maintenance of forests as a net carbon sink to reduce the build up of atmospheric greenhouse gasses and the maintenance of species diversity of ground vegetation.
   The Intensive Monitoring Programme, which is carried out on approximately 860 selected plots, comprises monitoring of crown condition, forest growth and the chemical status of soil and foliage at all plots and monitoring of deposition, meteorology, soil solution and ground vegetation in a subset of the plots. In order to meet the major objectives of the Intensive Monitoring Programme, studies have been or are presently carried out with respect to the assessment of: (i) correlations between site and stress factors and the "forest ecosystem condition"; (ii) trends in stress factors and/or ecosystem conditions; (iii) critical loads, by evaluating the fate of atmospheric pollutants in the ecosystem with input-output budgets; and (iv) large-scale and long-term impacts of climate and deposition on forests and vice versa. Examples of those studies are given and the potential of the Programme to fulfil the objectives is evaluated. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Above- and below-ground biomass and nutrient pools were measured in an uneven-aged stand of predominantly hard beech (Nothofagus truncata) in a warm-temperate climatic zone of New Zealand. The total amount of organic matter in the ecosystem was 680 t ha(-1). The total live tree biomass (includes all above- and below-ground tree and shrub components) was 479 t ha(-1) with hard beech contributing 89%. Of the hard beech, 32% was harvestable stemwood, 22% was roots and the root/shoot ratio was 0.28. Dead roots amounted to 17 t ha(-1). Coarse woody debris (CWD) was the largest detritus component and represented 7% of the ecosystem organic matter. The ecosystem stored 344 t C ha(-1), of which 62% was in hard beech and 16% was in the soil organic matter (0-60 cm depth). The amounts of N, P, K, Mg and Ca stored in trees (including shrubs) were 625, 219, 836, 128 and 1507 kg ha(-1), respectively. Twenty-seven percent of the N in hard beech was in the leaves and fine roots (0-5 mm diameter). The equivalent percentages for P, K, Mg and Ca were 10, 12, 21 and 9%, respectively. Hard beech root/shoot ratios for N, P, K, Mg and Ca were 0.24, 0.40, 0.34, 0.47 and 0. 18, respectively. Much larger quantities of Ca were present in the bark than in the wood, with this ratio as high as 5:1 in the non-harvestable stems and branches. In the detritus the amounts of N, P, K, Mg and Ca were 249, 23, 74, 35 and 238 kg ha(-1), respectively. The pattern of ecosystem nutrient totals (K > Ca > Mg > N > P) reflected the relative total amounts in the soil. The amounts of exchangeable K, Mg and Ca were approximately I % of the respective total soil values whereas soil organic P was 68% of the total soil P. Estimates of the amounts of C and nutrients directly removed in 15 stems ha(-)1 proposed under a "near-natural forest management" system would represent <3% of the C and nutrients stored in the combined tree, detritus and dead root pools before stem removal. Debarking the stem before removal would substantially reduce the estimated loss of N, P, Mg and Ca from the forest ecosystem. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

ID CRITERIA; SYSTEMS
AB Criteria and indicators (C&I) have become primary tools in implementing the principle of sustainable resource management. To carry out this principle, it is necessary to develop methodologies that can holistically and systematically generate relevant indicators for a particular forest or resource management unit. This paper describes some methodologies that can be used as tools to carry out structured analysis of C&I. Multi-criteria analysis (MCA) is used as a decision-making tool to analyze and evaluate multiple C&I under a participatory group decision-making environment. Use of the method enables the generation of C&I, estimation of their relative importance, estimation of the performance of each indicator relative to its desired condition, and assessment of the indicators' combined effect or impact. In addition to generating C&I and estimating their relative importance and performance, the paper also presents a soft methodology, called cognitive mapping, which can be used to assess the crossindicator interaction, linkages, and connectivities of the indicators. The method attempts to evaluate the overall cumulative impacts of all indicators, individually and collectively, as they impact sustainability directly and indirectly through their interactions with other indicators.

TI Process stream management in the steel industry taking the example of
   ThyssenKrupp Stahl and voestalpine Stahl
SO STAHL UND EISEN
LA German
DT Article
AB A high level of protection for the environment is an essential aspect of sustainability. Representing an important part of environmental protection is the conservation of resources and waste management, which nowadays are geared internationally to the hierarchical basic principles of avoidance, recycling and disposal. The aim of this paper is to compare the approaches to process stream management in the steel industry, taking as examples ThyssenKrupp Stahl AG and voestalpine Stahl GmbH at their respective flat steel making locations of Duisburg and Linz. The two enterprises pursue different concepts of process stream management for their ferriferous residual materials. The aim of ThyssenKrupp Stahl has been to optimally recycle the ferriferous residual materials as a function of their economic, technical and ecological evaluation, and to return them to the production processes generally within its plants and facilities. The use of the OxiCup Shaft Furnace, developed for this purpose, will make it possible in future to avoid the disadvantages inherent in this concept, not to mention make extensive use of the solid and gaseous residuals. The most cost-effective concept for voestalpine Stahl GmbH at the present time is based on a decentralised approach to process stream management involving close co-operation with specialised downstream processing enterprises. The reason for the difference in approach lies primarily in the relatively low volumes of materials involved. It is expected that the currently existing system limits will be pushed back further, the co-operation with customers, neighbours and municipal bodies expanded, and additional materials integrated into the production chains of iron and steel mills. It is also well imaginable that the future approaches to process stream management pursued by iron and steel mills will lead to a synthesis of the described concepts.

DE ecosystem function; state indicators; river health
AB Some of the modern criteria for assessing ecosystem health are compared with current understanding of ecosystem function in rivers. Owing to the predominance of catchment imports over autochthonous primary production, most rivers are naturally heterotrophic. This does not make them unhealthy but,the pristine condition is that much harder to determine. The case is put for an index of ecosystem health and sustainability that takes into account the system's capacity for processing its resources, the species richness and its interdependence and its resilience to external forcing. Although these are not easily quantified, the qualitative indicators of healthy ecosystem function are easily checked. The sensitivity of organisms in suspension to fluvial flow may seem to counter the suitability of plankton as a reliable state indicator of river health. On the other hand, the rules governing the assembly of planktic communities in rivers are often strict and quantifiable: this makes them attractive candidates to act as indicators of the ecological condition of rivers.

AB A three-year grazing experiment (1998-2000) was conducted with first-season grazing cattle (FSGC) on improved pastures in central-eastern Sweden. Comparison was made between five groups with 10 calves in each group where four of these were set stocked and either (I) untreated, (2) ivermectin bolus treated, (3) subjected to biological control with the nematophagous fungus Duddingtonia flagrans, or (4) treated with a copper wire particle bolus. The fifth treatment was an evasive grazing strategy, whereby untreated calves were turned out onto pasture used by older cattle the previous year and then these calves were moved to silage aftermath in mid-July. To introduce low-levels of parasite infection to the experiment, each animal received a 'priming dose' of approximately 5000 Ostertagia ostertagi and 5000 Cooperia oncophora infective third stage larvae immediately prior to the start of the first grazing year of the trial.
   Results showed that efficient and sustainable parasite control of FSGC was possible to achieve without the use of anthelmintics by using turnout pastures that the previous year had been grazed by older cattle, in combination with a mid-July move to aftermath leys. Biological control also proved beneficial but the efficacy was impaired if high faecal egg counts coincided with rapid dung pat degradation due to heavy rainfall. No indication of parasite control was observed with the copper wire particle bolus. It was also demonstrated that the impact of gastrointestinal (GI) parasitism varied,between years and that the level of overwintering contamination is important but likewise, is unpredictable. Although faecal egg counts in 1999 were low, due both to a delayed turnout and drought for the major part of the grazing season, deposited eggs successfully developed to infective larvae and overwintered in large numbers. The population of overwintered infective larvae at the time of turnout in early May played an important role in the course of infection in 2000 and resulted in an average 65 kg advantage of the ivermectin treated calves compared with the untreated calves.
   Thus, this three-year grazing experiment has emphasised the importance of subclinical gastrointestinal nematode infections in FSGC in Sweden. In addition, the study has shown that adequate parasite control may be achievable without the use of anthelmintics. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The phenomenon referred to as waterhammer can be used to create the pressure required for reverse osmosis of seawater, this has been described in a previous paper [1]. A subsequent paper then investigated economic feasibility and concluded that it could achieve significant cost savings as well as eliminating the need to burn fossil fuel energy for seawater desalination [2]. It is necessary to investigate the theoretical feasibility of using hydro-ram for this purpose. A major question is whether the hydro-ram (typically used for pumping relatively small quantities of river water to a higher level) can pump the large quantities of seawater required for desalination. Literature is reviewed in respect of the various designs and especially large designs and the theories of its operation are explained. Formulas for determining the output of a particular size of ram are identified. Seawater corrosion is also considered. It is concluded that it is both economically and technically feasible for this simple piece of apparatus to be used for the desalination of seawater.

DE UNESCO; water resource management; sustainable development; Arab states
AB Most of the Arab countries are located in and and semi-arid zones known for their scanty annual rainfall, very high rates of evaporation and consequently extremely insufficient renewable water resources. Sustainable management of water resources is a must as water scarcity is becoming more and more a development constraint impeding the economic growth of many countries in the region. The International Hydrological Programme of the UNESCO (I HP) is a vehicle through which member states can upgrade their knowledge of the water cycle and thereby increase their capacity to better manage and develop their water resources. It aims at the improvement of the scientific and technological basis for the development of methods for the rational management of water resources. In UNESCO, current concentration areas of IHP in the Arab Region are Groundwater Protection and Rainfall Water Management, with special emphasis on Wadi Hydrology. Concentration areas are selected during the regional meeting of Arab IHP National Committees, held each biennium. Activities in the Arab Region include both research and training. The sixth phase of IHP strives to minimize the risks to vulnerable water resources systems, taking fully into account social challenges and interactions and developing appropriate approaches for sound water management. Assessing the global time and space distribution of freshwater availability and use, developing approaches to reduce the vulnerability of hydrosystems and their supporting ecosystems and improving water resources management for vulnerable areas are among the main objectives. Capacity-building and water education and training, as well as institutional development (with emphasis in the use of information and communication technologies for water resources research and training) are reinforced, and the social and ethical views of water users are incorporated into the development of conflict prevention and resolution. Many extra budgetary projects are initiated in UNESCO Cairo Office: the UNESCO/Flanders Funds-In-Trust Project on Capacity Building and Training on Environmental Planning and Management in Palestine. A FRIEND (Flow Regimes from International Experimental and Network Data Sets) Project for the river Nile is recently launched. FRIEND is one of IHP's success stories which is considered as a cross-cutting theme in IHP-VI. The FRIEND/Nile project has selected various research projects, being carried out by research groups with members of all riparian Nile countries. The urgent need for comprehensive assessment of the world's freshwater has been emphasized by the UN Commission on Sustainable Development. It urged a collective initiative to this effect. This led to the launch of the UN system-wide World Water Assessment Programme (WWAP) led by UNESCO, which aims to improve the assessments of the state of world water resources and their response to the pressure posed by escalating human demands, as well as by factors related to global change. Therefore, UNESCO Cairo Office is implementing efficiently the themes of the IHP relevant to the Arab Region. It is taking the lead in groundwater protection and dry land hydrology through two concentration areas of groundwater protection and wadi hydrology, respectively. The strategy is to consolidate efforts between various national, regional and international agencies in these areas to address these themes. Human resources development and capacity building has been a prime objective of UNESO Cairo Office activities. UNESCO Cairo Office is actively following the UNESCO approach of result based management in all its activities.

AB Fresh groundwater resources in Egypt contribute to some 20% of the total potential of water resources in Egypt. The Ministry of Water Resources and Irrigation (MWRI) increasingly recognizes its importance in the overall water resources management. The need for a more comprehensive groundwater management approach has led to the establishment of the Groundwater Sector (GWS) in December 1999. The GWS is now the sole responsible governmental agency for management of all groundwater resources and related water resources. The mandate of the GWS is: formulating and implementing the general policy for developing and managing groundwater and related water resources (flash floods, rainwater harvesting and desalinated water) on the national, regional and sub-regional level. Desalination of brackish groundwater in Egypt has a great potential. with respect to the availability of the resource. All major aquifer systems in Egypt contain vast quantities of brackish groundwater. The exploitation of this resource is still limited. With the current low price of brackish water desalination there is a growing interest towards its exploitation. Brackish water desalination plants in Egypt confirm the potential of this solution. Other uses for brackish groundwater that are being considered are agriculture (salt tolerant crops) and fisheries (shrimp farms). The elements of the vision for desalination of brackish groundwater are: environmental sustainability through recycling of water and re-infiltration; public-private partnerships for exploitation, especially in the tourism sector; private sector financing through accepted modalities (BOT, DBO, etc.). With the input of experience from the Netherlands through the GWS project a new program for desalination was started. This program aims to provide the necessary concepts and data on desalination of brackish groundwater in Egypt to allow the GWS to formulate a clear policy in this regard.

AB Jordan has recently given distinguished attention to its single and extremely limited sea outlet - Aqaba. An innovative governing system is being established. Aqaba has been declared as a Special Economic Zone Authority. The main objectives of the new authority are to develop Aqaba as a haven for commerce, a destination for tourism, and an incubator for technology. A strong limiting factor to this ambitious planning is the scarcity of fresh water. The conventional water resources utilized to satisfy the increasing water demand will reach the maximum sustainable yield in less than 5 years. At present, water supply is abstracted from groundwater aquifers and amounts to about 16.4 million m(3)/y (MCM/y). According to the final master plan of the ASEZA, the total consumption is expected to increase by about 5 MCM/y in the first 5 years, 11 MCM/ y in the following 5 years, and about 30 MCM/y by the end of 20 years. The ultimate allocation for ASEZA from the conventional water recourses from the Disi non-renewable aquifer does not exceed 17.5 MCM/y. This identified gap in water supply has definitely to be filled by unconventional water resources such as desalination of seawater and brackish water. The location of ASEZ alongside the Red Sea and over partly brackish aquifers does qualify it for desalination. However, the ASEZA Environmental Commission is currently identifying significant issues to be considered in the mitigation measures when designing desalination plants in order to alleviate adverse environmental impacts to the ecosystem. This paper discusses the expected future water demands, the ASEZA acceptable water standards for the different water uses, and the environmental impact of the desalination plants and their respective mitigation measures.

DE water shortage; desalination; North Africa; applications; sustainability
AB The population of the states of North Africa (NA) will increase from 150 million in 2000 to about 250 million in 2025 with a corresponding increase in water demand for municipal, industrial and agricultural purposes. With this demand rapidly exceeding the water resources capacities, these states will soon face water shortages with serious adverse impacts on the sustainability of the region's environment and development. Desalination provides an alternate source of water which is reliable and readily available to the region's states. Desalination technologies have been in use in the region since the early seventies with a total installed capacity of over one million cubic meters per day presently. Cost factors have limited the uses of desalination to municipal and industrial applications. However, recent advances in desalination technologies have made desalination more competitive with new hard-to-find conventional water resources. The objective of this paper is to assess the potential of desalination as a viable alternate water source for the NA states through analysis of the water supply and demand situation in the region and the experience gained in desalination process applications. The future trends and challenges associated with water shortages and the desalination technologies potential in the region are discussed leading to conclusions and recommendations regarding the role of desalination as a viable supplemental source of water that will be progressively more feasible and cost effective particularly for satisfying the needs of the urban coastal communities in the region.

AB Amsterdam is building a new housing estate IJburg. It will house 45,000 residents. A dual water supply system, supplying drinking water and household water to the customers, appears to be an attractive alternative. Household water will be used for toilet flushing and for washing clothes. This concept has environmental advantages, while it is economically feasible. Household water will be produced from local surface water by a local production plant and must be sustainable. A treatment scheme, comprising coagulation-flotation-filtration and nanofiltration, complies with all the requirements. Direct nanofiltration with air flush may be an attractive alternative, provided that it results in a stable and robust operation. Direct nanofiltration with air flush will be compared with the originally system of coagulation/flotation followed by rapid filtration and spiral-wound nanofiltration. In a pilot plant research at Amsterdam Water Supply air flush nanofiltration was investigated in a 20 runs trial using IJ-Lake water with only a micro screen before the capillary nanofiltration. Quality and operational aspects of this system were investigated. From a membrane autopsy a lot of clay and organic fouling was found.

AB Information on soil-plant nutrient balance in India and elsewhere is scarce and mostly generalized. A review of earlier studies on nutrient balances was done to assess their relevance for researchers, policy makers, and farmers' understanding, to manage soil fertility for sustainable crop productivity. An on-farm nutrient balance study during 1995/1996 and 1996/1997 was designed to understand nutrient balances resulting from farmers' practices in semi-arid tropical regions of India. This diagnostic study targeted sorghum-based cropping systems and groundnut-based cropping systems in low rainfall areas of the Indian SAT. Selection of farmers for this study was done through a systematic survey and analyses of factors effecting farmers' decision making for nutrient inputs. Intensive plot-specific nutrient input and output measurements were carried out on 53 farmers' fields for sorghum-based systems and 45 farmers' fields for groundnut-based system in this study. Topsoil mineral nitrogen (N) content observed in 2 years at the beginning of the crop season in two locations of Andhra Pradesh, India, was surprisingly high and exchangeable potassium (K) contents also indicated sufficient supply in most fields. Available phosphorus (P) in the majority of fields in both locations was around threshold levels, and just sufficient for most crops. The nutrient balance in sorghum-based systems indicates a moderate to higher negative balance of potassium leading to soil mining for potassium supply in these systems. Nitrogen and P balances were generally positive. Although the groundnut-based system accumulated 53% of its N requirements through BNF, negative balances of N and K were observed mainly due to low applications of these nutrients. Application of K along with options for improving BNF of groundnut are suggested. Better nodulating groundnut cultivars and efficient rhizobium strains need to be introduced. High positive balances were observed in the systems whenever commercial crops like castor and cotton were sown in the rotation. This indicates farmers' preferences for applying excess quantities of FYM to commercially important crops even in dryland farming systems. The replenishment costs of mined nutrients annually in different cropping systems were calculated based on current market prices of inorganic fertilizers. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Applying Ru(OCOCF3)(2)(CO)(PPh3)(2), the so called Robinson catalyst, several secondary alcohols could be dehydrogenated with high selectivity into the corresponding ketones in relatively short reaction times. Highly effective atom utilization could be realized avoiding solvents and giving hydrogen gas as the sole by-product. However, in contrast to Robinson's work the catalytic dehydrogenation of primary alcohols appeared to be problematic due to decarbonylation with concomitant catalyst deactivation and aldol condensation under the strong acid or basic conditions applied.

AB Although much biological research depends upon species diagnoses, taxonomic expertise is collapsing. We are convinced that the sole prospect for a sustainable identification capability lies in the construction of systems that employ DNA sequences as taxon 'barcodes'. We establish that the mitochondrial gene cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) can serve as the core of a global bioidentification system for animals. First, we demonstrate that COI profiles, derived from the low-density sampling of higher taxonomic categories, ordinarily assign newly analysed taxa to the appropriate phylum or order. Second, we demonstrate that species-level assignments can be obtained by creating comprehensive COI profiles. A model COI profile, based upon the analysis of a single individual from each of 200 closely allied species of lepidopterans, was 100% successful in correctly identifying subsequent specimens. When fully developed, a COI identification system will provide a reliable, cost-effective and accessible solution to the current problem of species identification. Its assembly will also generate important new insights into the diversification of life and the rules of molecular evolution.

AB A 3-year demonstration study was conducted in four western New York apple orchards to evaluate current approaches of sustainable pest management in representative commercial orchards. Pests that could be tolerated were regulated by natural antagonists, including predatory mites that were introduced to supplement endemic populations, while those with lower tolerance levels were managed with a schedule of selective pesticides, e.g., insect growth regulators and horticultural mineral oil. Pesticide application decisions (timing and materials) were made on the basis of current state extension guidelines, which involved a combination of protectant and threshold-based sprays determined through timely scouting and sampling procedures. Only non-toxic or minimally toxic pesticides to the principal mite and aphid predators were applied in the orchards. By the third season, effective conservation biological control of European red mite was achieved in all orchards, and fruit quality at harvest was equal or superior to that in comparison blocks managed using the growers' conventional practices.

TI Localisation of UK food production: an analysis using land area and
   energy as indicators
SO AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
DE UK food production; localisation; sustainable development
AB A variety of policy strategies have been proposed and argued as capable of delivering more sustainable food systems, and accompanying indicators have been developed to analyse the implications of these strategies for specific situations. This paper focuses on the policy strategy suggesting that localisation of food production leads to more sustainable societies. A case study of UK food production, and imports and exports of foodstuffs, is presented to explore the feasibility of operationalising this strategy, using land area and energy use as indicators. Novel features of the method used in the case study include: analysis at country level in specific foodstuff categories, and use of actual data on production and consumption of foodstuffs. The results show that, based on the land use indicator, localisation of UK food production is possible, although this would involve considerable changes in individuals' food consumption patterns. However, would implementation of such a strategy actually contribute to a more sustainable society? Using the indicators of land area and energy use, this question cannot be answered without additional consideration of the trade-offs between the UK and other countries in yields from equivalent crops, and energy requirements for agricultural production.

AB In the Zona da Mata Mineira of Southeastern Brazil the development of sustainable land requires the integration of crops with trees. The objectives of this study then were to (i) characterize prunings from the main tree species in an agroforestry system; (ii) determine the effects of the physical and chemical characteristics of the prunings on their decomposition patterns in the laboratory; (iii) assess the effect of mixing leaves of different species on decomposition rates; and (iv) propose a decomposition index for the residues studied. The study was carried out with pruning residues from Cajanus cajan, Solanum variable, Cassia ferruginea, Piptadenia gonoacantha, Croton urucurana, and Melinis multiflora. The materials were characterized for total C, N, P, Ca, Mg and K contents; lignin, cellulose, hemicellulose and soluble polyphenols contents. The pruning residues had high polyphenols and lignin contents, high C: N and C: P ratios, and low contents of Ca, Mg, and K. The low decomposition rates of the prunings were related to the P, K, hemicellulose and polyphenol contents. The rates of N mineralization from most of the residues indicate that there is a potential to supply the needs of a crop of maize. The residues of some species, if decomposed alone, would not supply sufficient nutrients, and need to be mixed with leaves of other species.

AB India has a very extensive coastline of about 7515 km, rich in diverse living resources. These resources continue to deteriorate with rampant harvesting or are altered for other uses such as aquaculture and fisheries. The present paper deals with degrading coastal habitats in northeastern India, and projects the intensity of the stress arising from the collection of tiger prawn seeds (Penaeus monodon) for aquacultural farms and molluskan shells for poultry feed and edible lime. Indiscriminate exploitation of these resources leads to a heavy reduction of the species concerned and other associated marine communities. The magnitude of such destruction has been quantified. The impacts of biodiversity loss and their after-effects on the ecobalance of this coastal system have become a matter of great concern to ecologists to maintain security and sustainability. The authors propose a public awareness program on themes relating to the importance of biodiversity for human livelihoods.

AB Clinkers of high alumina cements are separated into three granular formulations with particle sizes in the range 0.6-0.71 mm, 0.71-1.18 mm and greater than 1.18 mm. These are used to manufacture consolidated samples of porous concrete in an autoclave. The acoustic and microscopic properties of loose and consolidated porous samples of concrete are investigated using both experimental methods and mathematical modelling. Values of porosity, flow resistivity, tortuosity and parameters of the pore size distribution are determined and used to predict closely the sound speed, acoustic attenuation and normal incidence absorption coefficient of these materials. It is shown that high alumina cements do not require additional binders for consolidation and that the structural bonds in these cements are developed quickly between individual clinkers in the presence of water. The hydration product build-up during the consolidation process is insignificant which ensures good acoustic performance of the consolidated samples resulting from a sufficient proportion of the open pores. The value of porosity in the consolidated samples was found to be around 40%, which is close to that measured in some commercial acoustic absorbers. This work provides a foundation for the development of acoustically efficient and structurally robust materials, which can be integrated in environmentally sustainable concrete and masonry structures.

ID MILL
AB Olive oil production industry is characterized by relevant amounts of liquid and solid by-products [olive mill wastewater (OMW) and olive husk (OH)], and by economical, technical and organizational constraints that make difficult the adoption of environmentally sustainable waste disposal approaches.
   In this context, waste treatment technologies aimed at energy recovery represent an interesting alternative. In the paper, a technical and economical analysis of thermal disposal plant solutions with energy recovery has been carried out. The considered plants enable the combined treatment of OMW and OH which, although penalizes the energy recovery, proves to be feasible and profitable in a future legislative scenario when stricter limitation on OMW disposal will force oil producers to bear high disposal costs. Results are compared by using economic performance measures, including revenues from produced energy and avoided disposal costs. A sensitivity and risk analysis is also performed in order to assess the economic profitability of the proposed solutions. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Coastal aquaculture can contribute to eutrophication of receiving waters. New technologies and improved management practices allow the aquaculture industry to be more sustainable and economically viable. Current practices, however, do not provide an additional use for effluent water. Nitrogen, phosphorus and other effluent compounds could be valuable plant nutrients. Inflow and effluent water from an inland, low-salinity shrimp farm, were monitored. Bi-weekly analysis included total nitrogen, ammonia-nitrogen, nitrite-nitrogen, nitrate-nitrogen, total phosphorus, reactive phosphorus, alkalinity, chemical oxygen demand (COD), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), total suspended solids (TSS) and volatile suspended solids (VSS), as well as temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen and pH. Alkalinity and total nitrogen decreased during the in-pond residency. The other parameters increased while in the ponds. The potential benefit of having nutrient enriched wastewater to irrigate field crops was substantial, supplying between 20 and 31% of the necessary nitrogen fertilizer for wheat production.

TI BDI position on energy policy and energy market deregulation
SO ATW-INTERNATIONALE ZEITSCHRIFT FUR KERNENERGIE
LA German
DT Article
AB Secure energy supplies are indispensable for our modern way of life and our economy. Energy policy is a part of economic policy and must be shaped within the magic triangle of objectives, i.e. security, competitiveness, environmental compatibility.
   As a result of their outstanding role, electricity and natural gas, with respective shares of 70% in industrial energy use and 85% in energy costs, are in the focus of energy policy interest of the Federation of German Industries (BDI). One important development over the past few years has been the deregulation of the markets for electricity and gas. However, the markedly lower electricity rates to be paid by industry, commercial tariff consumers, and private customers are being offset by new burdens arising from government intervention and taxes. Other dirigistic interventions into the energy market by the red-green federal government since 1998, referred to as "turning point of energy policy," are invalidating what market opening had been achieved. With a view to a sustainable energy policy for the future, BDI pleads in favor of a broad energy mix. In a mix neutral with respect to competition, this includes the classical energy sources, the renewables, and low-cost, environmentally friendly nuclear power. In principle, it is the forces of the market, coupled with responsible action, which are to steer further developments.
   On a European level, speedy implementation of the opening of the electricity and gas markets, as decided, should be urged.
   It is important that the leeway won as a result of deregulation not be constrained again by new regulations. More market, less regulation, and more direct responsibility must provide room for a powerful energy supply system under the premises of the triangle of objectives referred to above.

AB One of the most important decisions taken in energy policy in recent years is the "Act on the Planned Termination of the Use of Nuclear Power for Industrial Generation of Electricity." A technology incorporating the hazard of catastrophic accidents, environmental pollution, and detrimental consequences to health, as well as the open question of managing radioactive waste, is not fit for the future.
   This turnaround in energy policy marks the beginning of the required entry into the solar age. Changing our energy supply is necessary in the light of the threatening scenarios of global climate change and the finite nature of fossil sources of energy, and needs a clear political dimension.
   The framework conditions to be established by politics for a sustainable power economy thus rest on three pillars:
   Expansion of renewable energy sources, improvement of energy efficiency, an ddecentralized structures in energy supply.
   The success of our national energy policy also offers incentives to other countries and for exports.
   At EU level, important decisions in the interest of the consumer must be supported.

DT Article
AB The decision by the red-green federal government to opt out of the use of nuclear power has considerable consequences for the power industry and the national economy of Germany. In addition, there are additional burdens resulting from the Renewable Energies Act and the Cogeneration Act. Besides economic aspects, there are ecological benefits to be considered in favor of nuclear power. In addition to renewable energy sources, it is one of the important sources of energy which are free from CO2 emissions.
   In opt-out decision also jeopardizes the role of Germany as a partner in international cooperation, with an acknowledged standard of nuclear know-how and a cutting-edge position in technical safety.
   The approaches towards a future energy supply system were put into specific terms together with the CDU/CSU within the activities of the parliamentary committee of inquiry on "sustainable Energy Supply Under Conditions of Globalization and Deregulation." The growing dependence on external energy sources, and the goals of climate protection, are other important tasks of future energy policy within the European framework. The Green Book by the EU Commission constitutes a remarkable basis for discussion in this respect. Current problems connected with nuclear power should be discussed seriously in order for nuclear power to continue successfully to contribute to energy supply in Europe.

AB In situ, on-farm conservation is an important complement to ex situ conservation of traditional crop varieties. In Yunnan Province, China, management for crop diversity by mixed planting (intercropping) of traditional and hybrid rice varieties provides a possible means for sustainable on-farm conservation of traditional rice varieties. Since the adoption of this form of crop diversity management in 1997, the number of traditional rice varieties in cultivation has increased dramatically and now includes some varieties that were formerly locally extinct. The cultivated area of traditional varieties has also been greatly expanded. This form of management is easy to implement and links farmers' economic concerns with conservation. Management for crop diversity can promote on-farm conservation of rice, and potentially other crops too, in a feasible and sustainable way.

AB There is a long tradition of research and development in building envelopes. With a globally growing awareness of the importance of sustainable development and the necessity of reducing CO2 pollution building envelopes are in focus again. Basically this is because the envelope of a building protects the indoor environment from outside. In the present state of knowledge new approaches in improving the function of building envelopes are important, where one of the main questions is: 'Can we do that on the basis of existing knowledge alone?' and from there: 'What kind of research and development is necessary to extend the existing knowledge on building envelopes?'
   The project that this article focuses on has been realised within the frame of the International Energy Agency (IEA) 'Implementing Agreement Energy Conservation in Buildings and Community Systems' and started with those questions. This article describes the considerations, the methodological approach and goes deeper into the products that are available from this research. Also there is much attention for applicability in practice. This latter subject as well is treated as an intermezzo from Government Buildings Agency, focused on the upgrading of the historic Rietveld building that accommodates the Van Gogh museum in Amsterdam.

AB Fuel cell-based automobiles have gained attention in the last few years due to growing public concern about urban air pollution and consequent environmental problems. From an analysis of the power and energy requirements of a modern car, it is estimated that a base sustainable power of ca. 50 kW supplemented with short bursts up to 80 kW will suffice in most driving requirements. The energy demand depends greatly on driving characteristics but under normal usage is expected to be 200 Wh/km. The advantages and disadvantages of candidate fuel-cell systems and various fuels are considered together with the issue of whether the fuel should be converted directly in the fuel cell or should be reformed to hydrogen onboard the vehicle. For fuel cell vehicles to compete successfully with conventional internal-combustion engine vehicles, it appears that direct conversion fuel cells using probably hydrogen, but possibly methanol, are the only realistic contenders for road transportation applications. Among the available fuel cell technologies, polymer-electrolyte fuel cells directly fueled with hydrogen appear to be the best option for powering fuel cell vehicles as there is every prospect that these will exceed the performance of the internal-combustion engine vehicles but for their first cost. A target cost of $ 50/kW would be mandatory to make polymer-electrolyte fuel cells competitive with the internal combustion engines and can only be achieved with design changes that would substantially reduce the quantity of materials used. At present, prominent car manufacturers are deploying important research and development efforts to develop fuel cell vehicles and are projecting to start production by 2005.

DT Article
AB Age-structured models are used to calculate catches and revenues of the principal stocks in the northeast multispecies groundfish fishery over the 1982-1997 period assuming alternative control rules on fishing effort had been employed. Various static levels of nominal effort are compared with controls that maintain fishing mortality below overfishing thresholds for all stocks. An unambiguous result from this analysis is that substantial reductions in fishing effort would have increased the value of the fishery even if resulting increases in spawning stock biomass (SSB) had not increased recruitment. Simple controls on nominal effort designed to maximize revenues would have provided nearly equivalent revenues to those achieved by maintaining fishing mortality for each stock at its individual maximum sustainable yield (F-MSY) but would have led to overfishing of some stocks. Without the ability to tune the relative catches across stocks, strict controls on effort designed to prevent overfishing on individual stocks would likely have resulted in significantly lower and more variable revenues. Achieving SSB targets for three stocks would not have been possible given the observed recruitment.

AB We compared height growth and nutrition (foliar nutrient concentrations and retranslocation rates from 1-year-old needles) of second-growth plantations on imperfectly drained, lower productivity cedar-hemlock-salal forests with those of more productive ecosystems of north coastal British Columbia. Soils ranged from deep organic profiles to well-drained mineral soils derived from igneous to metamorphic bedrock. Leader increments on imperfectly drained sites were smaller than on well-drained sites, averaging 42% less for western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla (Raf.) Sarg.), 56% less for Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis (Bong.) Carriere), and 32% less for western redcedar (Thuja plicata Donn ex D. Don). Strong linear correlations were found between leader increment and foliar N, P, and S concentrations for all three tree species, and baseline foliar data for productive sites were presented. The foliar N ratios with P, S, and K were consistent across sites and indicated that many key foliar nutrients increased proportionally to the availability of N. A comparison of nutrient concentrations between current and 1-year-old foliage generally showed little difference on poorer sites, which suggested that there had been no retranslocation of nutrients from young needles within trees to compensate for low soil nutrient availability. This study confirmed the inherently low productivity of cedar-hemlock-salal forests, especially on granodiorite and gneissic diorite bedrock types, and suggested the need for site treatments or long rotations for sustainable management.

AB This paper reviews the ecological aspects of mined soil restoration, with special emphasis on maintaining a long-term sustainable vegetation on toxic metal mine sites. The metal mined soils are man-made habitats which are very unstable and will become sources of air and water pollution. Establishment of a vegetation cover is essential to stabilize the bare area and to minimize the pollution problem. In addition to remediate the adverse physical and chemical properties of the sites, the choice of appropriate vegetation will be important. Phytostabilization and phytoextraction are two common phytoremediation techniques in treating metal-contaminated soils, for stabilizing toxic mine spoils, and the removal of toxic metals from the spoils respectively. Soil amendments should be added to aid stabilizing mine spoils, and to enhance metal uptake accordingly. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Accra, the capital and major economic city in Ghana. is undergoing a major restructuring of much of its infrastructure and, more important. its physical form and appearance. Much of Accra's growth parallels the introduction of liberalization policies since 1983. During this time the economic foci of the urban economy have been shifting away from the old colonial city to a more diffuse spatial organization. Uneven economic and residential development is associated with these trends. Accra is developing independently of any spatial urban planning. Present-day Accra is characterized by fragmented economic and residential geographies that if left unchecked will undermine sustainable urban development. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB Marine protected areas are possible solutions to the problems of protecting the integrity of marine ecosystems and of sustaining harvested marine populations. We report demographic data for red abalones ( Haliotis rufescens ) at nine sites along the California coast. Six of our sites are within marine protected areas, and four of those six sites are occupied by sea otters ( Enhydra lutris ). Sea otters are known abalone predators and are believed to have an important role in facilitating biodiversity within coastal kelp forest communities along the North Pacific Rim. We asked whether marine protected areas intended to conserve ecosystems are compatible with use of marine protected areas for abalone fishery sustainability. We found that both sea otters and recreational harvest alter the density, size distribution, and microhabitat distribution of red abalones in qualitatively similar ways. Red abalone populations in marine protected areas outside the current sea otter range have higher density, are composed of larger individuals, and occur in more-open microhabitats compared with populations in locations lacking sea otters but subject to harvest and with populations in locations with sea otters. The effects of sea otters are stronger than the effects of harvest. Characterization of harvest effects on density may be confounded by other uncontrolled factors. We conclude that coastal marine protected areas off California cannot enhance abalone fisheries if, in the interest of ecosystem integrity, they also contain sea otters. Where restored top carnivores limit the sustainability of commodity harvest, it may be possible to resolve conflicts with two categories of spatially segregated, single-use marine protected areas, one focusing on ecosystem restoration and the other on fishery development.

AB Changes in cropping systems can significantly impact pest population dynamics and management. Field experiments were conducted from 1998 to 2000 to study the effect of summer cover crop and in-season management system on weed infestations in lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.). The experiment was a factorial with summer cover crop and management system as the two factors. Cover crops were cowpea [Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp.] incorporated into the soil in the fall (CWPI), cowpea used as mulch in the fall (CWPM), sudangrass (Sorghum vulgare) incorporated into the soil in the fall (SDNG), and dry fallow (DFLW). Management systems were organic (ORG), integrated crop management (ICM), and conventional (CNV). In general, there was no interaction between cover crop and management system. Weed species richness was greatest early in the growing season and was affected by cover crop. Fewer species emerged in CWPM plots in general but perennial species became important with time. The DFLW showed greater weed populations than all cover crop treatments. Weed populations were similar in all management systems in 1999. However, in 2000, there was better weed suppression in the ORG and ICM systems than in the CNV system. CWPI significantly increased lettuce yield and DFLW yield declined the second year. Yield under the ORG system was low in 1999 and equivalent to that in the CNV and ICM systems in 2000. These results indicate that a prior summer cover crops can improve both conventional and organic vegetable production systems. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Human demands on the world's available freshwater supplies continue to grow as the global population increases. In the endeavor to manage water to meet human needs, the needs of freshwater species and ecosystems have largely been neglected, and the ecological consequences have been tragic. Healthy freshwater ecosystems provide a wealth of goods and services for society, but our appropriation of freshwater flows must be better managed if we hope to sustain these benefits. and freshwater biodiversity. We offer a framework for developing an ecologically sustainable water management program, in which human needs for water are met by storing and diverting water in a manner that can sustain or restore the ecological integrity of affected river ecosystems. Our six-step process includes: (1) developing initial numerical estimates of key aspects. of river flow necessary to sustain native species and natural ecosystem functions; (2) accounting for human uses of water, both current and future, through development of a computerized hydrologic simulation model that facilitates examination of human-induced alterations to river flow regimes; (3) assessing incompatibilities between human and ecosystem needs with particular attention to their spatial and temporal character; (4) collaboratively searching for solutions to resolve incompatibilities; (5) conducting water management experiments to resolve critical uncertainties that frustrate efforts to integrate human and ecosystem needs; and (6) designing and implementing an adaptive management program to facilitate ecologically sustainable water management for the long term. Drawing from case studies around the world to illustrate our framework, we suggest that ecologically sustainable water management is attainable in the vast majority of the world's river basins. However, this quest will become far less feasible if we wait until water supplies are further over-appropriated.

AB Using ecological criteria as a theoretical framework, we describe the steps involved in designing a network of marine reserves for conservation and fisheries management. Although we-describe the case study of the Channel Islands, the approach to marine reserve design may be effective in other regions where traditional management alone does not sustain marine resources. A group of agencies, organizations, and individuals established clear goals for marine reserves in the Channel Islands, including conservation of ecosystem biodiversity, sustainable fisheries, economic viability, natural and cultural heritage, and education. Given the constraints of risk management, experimental design, monitoring, and enforcement, scientists recommended at least one, but no more than four, reserves in each biogeographic region. In general, the percentage of an area to be included in a reserve network depends on the goals. In the Channel Islands, after consideration of both conservation goals and the risk from human threats and natural catastrophes, scientists recommended reserving an area of 30-50% of all representative habitats in each biogeographic region. For most species of concern, except pinnipeds and seabirds, information about distributions, dispersal, and population growth was limited. As an alternative to species distribution information, suitable habitats for species of concern were used to locate potential reserve sites. We used a simulated annealing algorithm to identify potential reserve network scenarios that would represent all habitats within the smallest area possible. The analysis produced an array of potential reserve network scenarios that all met the established goals.

AB The theory underlying the design of marine reserves, whether the goal is to preserve biodiversity or to manage fisheries, is still in its infancy. For both of these goals, there is a need for general principles on which to base marine reserve design, and because of the paucity of empirical experience, these principles must be based on models. However, most of the theoretical studies to date have been specific to a single situation, with few attempts to deduce general principles. Here we attempt to distill existing results into general principles useful to designers of marine reserves. To answer the question of how fishery management using reserves compares to conventional management, we provide two principles: (1) the effect of reserves on yield per recruit is similar to increasing the age of first capture, and (2) the effect of reserves on yield is' similar to reducing effort. Another two principles answer the question of how to design reserve configurations so that species with movement in various stages will be sustainable: (3) higher juvenile arid adult movement lowers sustainability of reserves for biodiversity, but an intermediate level of adult movement is required for reserves for fishery management, and (4) longer larval dispersal distance requires larger reserves for sustainability. These principles provide general guidelines for design., and attention to them will allow more rapid progress in future modeling studies. Whether populations or communities will persist under any specific reserve design is uncertain, and we suggest ways of dealing with that uncertainty.

ID MANAGEMENT
AB We compare and contrast the design of networks of marine reserves for two different; commonly stated goals: (1) maintaining high yield in fisheries and (2) conserving biodiversity, in an idealized setting using simple models. The models describe larval dispersal over a system of evenly spaced reserves of equal size, assuming sedentary adults. We initially demonstrate that, since populations in reserve systems can be sustained either by covering a minimal fraction of the coast with small reserves or by covering a smaller fraction of the coast with few large reserves, cost considerations dictate that the conservation goal would be best met by reserves as large as practically possible. In contrast, the fisheries goal of maximizing yield requires maximizing larval export outside of reserves, which we show means that reserves should be as small as practically possible. Meeting the fisheries goal is ultimately more costly because it suggests a larger area of the coastline should be in reserves, but it also improves on conservation goals by enhancing sustainability for species dispersing longer distances.

ID GROWTH
AB E.F. Schumacher used the phrase, 'the failure of the modern experiment.' By modern experiment he meant two interrelated things. In its 300-year or so duration, modernity occupies an eye blink of time in the vast span of millennia of human history. Secondly, it is an experiment because this is the first time in this vast history that a society attempted to live without motives and principles that were higher than the material or economic, that is, without some form of the transcendental. Schumacher proposed that this experiment is a failure because in its brief history modern society is well on its way to destroying both the natural and the social world. The absence of higher motives or principles means that another organizing and motivational principle takes its place, and that this principle becomes the core characteristic of modern society. The thesis is advanced here that this principle is the profit motive, both as a personal psychology, and as an economic institution. In other words, the absence of the transcendental means the presence of the profit motive, and the failure of modern society means the failure of the profit motive. Since the profit motive means the continuous expansion of economic wealth, a society based on the profit motive must by necessity be a society committed to perpetual economic growth. Modern society, then, present us with a yield equation of terms: Self-interest --> Profit Motive-Growth. Many writers advocating sustainability still endorse this equation, and expect the profit motive, with proper manipulation, to yield a sustainable society. They do not recognize that traditional economic motivation must be replaced by something else if this new sustainable economic world is to come into being. This article makes the claim that the replacement of the profit motive does not require a change in human nature, but a restoration of human nature. In this restoration, the profit motive will be replaced by a concern for the common good (which can be seen as a practical implementation of the transcendental). As an illustration of how this can be brought about, it is shown that the motivational principle of the common good can be instituted through two policies: a maximum wage that is a ratio of the minimum wage, and the statutory transformation of all companies into non profit. Then we have: Common good-->Non profit --> Sustainability. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Ecological economics occasionally makes universal claims about how to understand and measure change in systems of human-environmental interaction. In terms of environmental policy, one of the most influential universal concepts that has come out of the ecological economics literature recently is ecological efficiency (or eco-efficiency). This article uses eco-efficiency as a vehicle to illustrate that universal indicators of human-environmental interaction are theoretically unfounded and practically problematic. Population ecology and neo-classical economics are identified as two theoretical approaches that have contributed to the emergence of universal concepts such as eco-efficiency. The limited applicability of the approaches is highlighted by putting them in comparative context with approaches that make less universal claims, namely, systems ecology and institutional economics. Investigating indicators of human-environmental interaction from disciplinary perspectives that are rarely found in indicator literature offers novel insights on what indicators are for and how they should be applied. The article concludes with a call for scale sensitive generalization in the development of future indicators. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The recent process of globalisation of international markets has managed to sustain the economic growth of the countries that have actively participated in this process. The available empirical evidence suggests, however, that it has been accompanied by a worldwide increase in environmental degradation and economic inequality. Therefore, there is growing concern that these features of the globalisation process may jeopardise its social and environmental sustainability. In order to clarify to what extent the recent process of globalisation may be considered as sustainable, this paper draws some hints from a critical assessment of the literature on the Kuznets curve and the environmental Kuznets curve. In particular it is argued that the optimistic implications of this literature on the sustainability of globalisation are ungranted and that the Kuznets approach is in principle unable to give reliable answers to the questions raised in this work. These curves, however, may be generalised as Kuznets relations whose analysis allows a clarification of a few basic conditions for sustainable globalisation. We conclude that these conditions can be met by implementing a systematic policy strategy aimed at shifting both Kuznets relations downwards. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB For some time now, ecological economists have been putting forward a 'threshold hypothesis'-the notion that when macroeconomic systems expand beyond a certain size, the additional cost of growth exceeds the flow of additional benefits. In order to support their belief, ecological economists have developed a number of similar indexes to measure and compare the benefits and costs of growth (e.g. the Index of Sustainable Economic Welfare, ISEW, and the Genuine Progress Indicator, GPI). In virtually every instance where an index of this type has been calculated for a particular country, the movement of the index appears to reinforce the existence of the threshold hypothesis. Of late, a number of observers have cast doubt over the validity of these alternative indexes. One of the concerns commonly expressed is the supposed lack of a theoretical foundation to support the ISEW, the GPI, and other related indexes. By adopting a concept of income and capital outlined by Fisher (Nature of Capital and Income. A. M. Kelly, New York, 1906), this paper demonstrates that these alternative indexes are theoretically sound but, in order to be broadly accepted, require the continuous development of more robust valuation methods.

AB Detailed topographic and hydrologic surveys were conducted in five intertidal cove marshes in an outer coastal plain landscape to test the hypothesis that the equilibrium geologic state of intertidal habitats residing in similar landscape situations conforms to a consistent geometric form. The equation V= 1571.84A(1.70) (R-2 = 96.2%) describes the relationship between hectares of marsh (A) and cubic meter volume at mean high tide (V). An empirical relationship between tide height and volume was found to obey the power series V-p = L-2.38 (R-2 = 99.6%), where V-p is volume as a percent of full pool and L is water height as a percent of mean high tide. A dimensionless index describing the relationship between area and volume is consistent for each marsh and approaches 0.10. A channel form parameter describing width to channel depth ratios is of consistent value for four of the five marshes. These provide evidence of deterministic rather than stochastic geologic development. The benefits of applying natural basin shape patterns in the design and engineering of created/restored intertidal marshes are highlighted and a generic basin is modeled (based on the geometrical section of a paraboloid retained by simple integration) as an example of the potential applicability of the study.

AB This paper deals with the application of emergy analysis of industrial systems in considering wastes. Making process system engineering decisions that are ecologically conscious requires emergy analysis of both industrial and ecological processes. The traditional emergy analysis methods of a natural ecological system usually do not consider the impact of wastes. This paper considers the impact of wastes and improves existing emergy analysis methods for industrial system. A new index of sustainability for industrial processes is presented.

AB Renewable energy sources have been important for humans since the beginning of civilisation. For centuries, and in many ways, biomass has been used for heating, and cooking. Many centuries ago, mankind was already utilizing the clearly visible power of water for mechanical drive purposes, as was also the case with wind. Today, water mills are still used in our villages, although their numbers are going to diminish. On the other hand, Turkey is an energy importing country with more than half of the energy requirement being supplied by imports, and air pollution is becoming a great environmental concern in the country. In this regard, renewable energy resources appear to be one of the most efficient and effective solutions for sustainable energy development and environmental pollution prevention in Turkey. Turkey's geographical location has several advantages for extensive use of most of the renewable energy sources. Because of this and the fact that it has limited fossil fuel resources, a gradual shift from fossil fuels to renewables seems to be serious and the sole alternative for Turkey. This article presents a review of recent studies on the renewable energy sources, their potential and present use in Turkey. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The major objective of this article is to show that in the context of sustainable development, coal and its downstream power generation industry could complement petroleum and hydroelectric industries in the national power generation scheme.
   The continued utilization of coal in power generation schemes in the world as well as environmental pollution caused by other fossil fuels were examined. These were presented as justifications for the proposed reintegration of coal as a complement to hydropower and oil/gas sources of electric energy in Nigeria.
   The scheme of power generation in the Oji-River thermal station was reviewed to enhance the appreciation of the retrofit models to be presented for the revitalization of the plant.
   Subsequently, 2 sustainable development retrofit models were considered for the revitalization of the Oji-River thermal power station and enhanced industrial civilization of the Oji neighborhood, as this article will show.
   To ensure self-sufficiency, this article will show how the 2 retrofit models will depend on abundant locally available resources, namely, coal, limestone, water and air.

TI On Heyes' IS-LM-EE proposal to establish an environmental macroeconomics
SO ENVIRONMENT AND DEVELOPMENT ECONOMICS
LA English
DT Article
AB A decade has now passed since Daly made a plea for an environmental macroeconomics. Despite an expanding literature on 'green' national accounting and the efforts of ecological economists to measure the sustainable net benefits of a growing macroeconomy, it is only recently that Daly's plea has been adequately answered. This has been achieved with the incorporation by Heyes of an 'environmental equilibrium' or EE curve into the familiar IS-LM model. However, the IS-LM-EE model proposed by Heyes is incomplete. By extending Heyes' model to include the role of technological progress and the sustainable net benefits of economic activity, this paper shows that conclusions regarding the desirability of expansionary fiscal and monetary policies alter quite radically. Moreover, it sends out a clear message that environmental concerns should be incorporated into macroeconomic models. They should not be solely confined to microeconomics.

ID INDUSTRIES; SKILL
AB Excess capacity and overfishing are problems in the open-access, common-pool fisheries of the Java Sea. Data development analysis is used to estimate excess fishing capacity and the number of vessels to decommission in three Java Sea fisheries of Indonesia, the purse seine, mini purse seine, and longline. First- and second-best policy measures are discussed to reduce the excess capacity and give sustainable management and development. The importance of incentive design, asymmetric information, and the regulator's principal-agent problem are emphasized in license limitation programs.

TI Achieving 'sustainable business': a study of perceptions of
   environmental best practice by SMEs in South Yorkshire
SO ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING C-GOVERNMENT AND POLICY
LA English
DT Article
ID GREEN
AB This paper provides an account of a questionnaire-based study of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and their responses to the current requirements of environmental best practice. The study was based within South Yorkshire. We aim to explore the current relationship between SMEs and the environment and how this affects their concept of 'sustainable business'. The main finding reported is that most manufacturing and service organisations surveyed believe environmental issues affect their business. However, meeting environmental requirements is seen as a business cost that is not transferable to customers in terms of added benefits and few organisations could show that it led to a competitive advantage. SMEs have only a generalist awareness of environmental legislation, and information provided by most local support services is not presented in a format that is efficient or effective. Our recommendations are that the assistance provided by local support agencies with regards to environmental best practice should be critically reviewed, and this review should seek to understand the reluctance and real difficulties faced by SMEs in comprehension and implementation of environmental legislation. This paper should therefore be used in conjunction with associated information when considering the best way to help prepare SMEs for greater involvement in environmental best practice and the achievement of sustainable business.

AB An integrated hydrogeological investigation was made to delineate the socioeconomic problems in the agro-based rural environment of the crystalline terrain of Guntur district; Andhra Pradesh, India. The integrated investigation comprised geoelectrical (GE) surveys, remotely recorded data and pumping tests. The subsurface layer parameters obtained from the sounding interpretation are presented in the form of GE sections and a fence diagram. Characteristic resistivities of various layers were obtained by correlating the known lithology with the GE sounding data. Total transverse resistance (TTR) and total longitudinal conductance (TLC) were computed from the interpretation of the sounding data. The TTR map was compared with the depth of bedrock map and the values of TLC were correlated with the thickness of geoelectrical layers and water quality. Lineaments were mapped from the satellite imageries: Hydraulic properties were determined; using the standard pumping test analysis. Potentiality of aquifer zones was assessed, after comparing the known thickness of aquifer formations with the corresponding discharge (Q) values. The integrated study helps to evolve a criterion to classify the groundwater potential zones (GPZ) into medium and high; based on the thickness of the aquifer. zone and its corresponding resistivity, TTR, TLC and Q. A management plan has been proposed TLC,and Q. A management plan has been for sustainable development of groundwater in the region on to eliminate water scarcity and its related problems.

AB The BOSAWAS Natural Resource Reserve of Nicaragua was established in 1991, to protect a portion of the remaining tropical rain forest and to promote the sustainable use of the region's resources. Information required to effectively manage the reserve includes the extents and locations of present land-cover types and recent land-cover changes in the management use zones that were delineated by local indigenous communities. These zones include areas designated for conservation, limited resource extraction, agriculture, and watershed protection. Land-cover for 1986 and 1995 was identified for three of the communities from remotely sensed images and then input into a geographic information system database to identify land-cover types within these management use zones. For both dates of the analysis, advanced forest was the dominant land cover, with the conservation zones entirely forested. The amount of both agricultural land and scrub/early secondary forest increased between the two dates, with much of these land-cover classes occurring in the agriculture zones. Conflicts between the land-cover present and designated use were identified in some of the limited-use buffer and watershed protection zones. Changes between 1986 and 1995 were identified by overlaying the two land-cover data sets. Three change processes were identified as occurring: deforestation, reforestation, and reconversion. Changes were concentrated in the agriculture zones but were found to occur in every type of zone, except for conservation. The results of this study will establish baseline information for the future management of the BOSAWAS Reserve, an important component in uniting conservation areas along the Central American isthmus.

AB We briefly review the metabolism of the chloroplast stroma, and describe the structural modelling technique of elementary modes analysis. The technique is applied to a model of chloroplast metabolism to investigate viable pathways in the light, in the dark, and in the dark with the addition of sedoheptulose-1,7-bisphosphatase (normally inactive in the dark). The results of the analysis show that it is possible for starch degradation to enhance photosynthetic triose phosphate export in the light, but the reactions of the Calvin cycle alone are not capable of providing a sustainable flux from starch to triose phosphate in the dark. When reactions of the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway are taken into consideration, triose phosphate export in the dark becomes possible by the operation of a cyclic pathway not previously described. The effect of introducing sedoheptulose-1,7-bisphosphatase to the system are relatively minor and, we predict, innocuous in vivo. We conclude that, in contrast with the traditional view of the Calvin cycle and oxidative pentose phosphate pathway as separate systems, they are in fact, in the context of the chloroplast, complementary and overlapping components of the same system.

AB A comparative analysis of the fish condition (Fulton's K) of 10 cod stocks in the north Atlantic in relation to the temperature of their habitat, growth rates and their reproductive potential is presented. It is shown that the cod stocks in the north Atlantic display different levels of mean condition, which is partly due to the different temperature regimes of their habitats. Cod living in colder waters, e.g. Greenland, Labrador and Grand Bank stocks, were found to be in poorer condition than cod living in warmer waters, e.g. North Sea and Irish Sea stocks.
   Poor condition causes reduced productivity in terms of slow growth and low recruitment potential. Stocks in better condition display significantly higher weights at age 4 than stocks in poor condition. The a coefficients (function's slopes) obtained from standardised Ricker's recruitment-spawning stock biomass (SSB) relationships were defined as indicators for the recruitment potential of stocks. These a coefficients were found to be positively correlated with the mean condition factor of the 10 stocks analysed. This indicates that stocks consisting of individuals in poor condition appear to be very susceptible to reduced recruitment at low SSB, while the stocks that consist of fish in good condition seem to behave more robustly with a higher probability of good recruitment at low SSB. The positive effect of the cod condition on their reproductive potential generally implies that the stocks' in good condition in the temperate regions of the northeast and west Atlantic can sustain higher exploitation rates than stocks in poor condition in the colder regimes of the northwest Atlantic (Greenland, Labrador and Grand Bank). This is confirmed by the positive relationship established between the estimated biological management reference points F-med and the mean cod condition factors, as well as by the recent status of these stocks.

ID FISHERIES; STRATEGIES; STABILITY
AB Many fisheries have alternative target stocks and selectively exploit the one with the highest expected income. Although target switching is very common in practice, few attempts have thus far been made to study target switching. In this paper, we investigated the potential effects of target switching on the yield and sustainability of fish stocks by equilibrium analysis and stochastic simulation. The equilibrium analysis showed that we can increase F-extinction by switching. The stochastic simulation revealed that well-planned target switching increases yields and simultaneously decreases the risk of the stocks collapsing. Target switching decreases fishing pressure on the less-abundant stock and helps the declined stock to recover. Therefore, the minimum stock level is increased by switching. As switching keeps both stocks at productive levels, the total yield is increased by switching. Target switching is effective, especially when the catchability increases with the depletion of a stock population. Target switching depends on the availability of information on stock abundance. Thus, we examined the vulnerability of switching to stock assessment errors. If the stock assessment is very uncertain, then little or no switching is recommended. Target switching can have substantial effects on fisheries. Therefore, we must investigate the mechanisms of switching and incorporate switching into management plans.

TI Assessing wood procurement management systems in the forest products

SO FOREST PRODUCTS JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
AB Nonindustrial private forestlands (NIPFs) are a key supplier of raw materials to the forest products industry in the United States. In response to concerns about the sustainability of harvests on NIPFs, forest products firms are striving to improve their wood procurement operations. An industry-wide survey of he forest products industry was conducted to measure the development of wood procurement management systems designed to improve forest management on NIPFs. The results indicated that operations with production capacities greater than 30 MMBF or with more than 500 employees, as well as those participating in the Sustainable Forestry Initiative standard, had moderately developed or well-developed wood procurement management systems. Sawmills producing less than 10 MMBF, especially those that did not adhere to any forest management standard, had poorly developed or undeveloped wood procurement management systems, which will make it difficult for these sawmills to improve their environmental performance and gain access to NIPFs and future markets.

TI Modelling the pension system
SO FUTURES
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper argues that pensions modelling should be a parsimonious process using different methodologies for different purposes. A range of methodologies exists and is being extensively used in different countries and quarters. Very simple aggregate accounting models can yield robust results as for the sustainability of pension systems, an issue that worries most analysts and governments. While more sophisticated formally derived models have the advantage of yielding results that take into account general equilibrium effects, ad hoe models have the advantage of being better able to cope with the fine structure of pensions programmes and formulae. Focusing on the Spanish pension system to illustrate the output of an ad hoc model, several applications are briefly presented: sustainability indicators up to the horizon 2050, effects of increased migratory flows and an evaluation of recent pension reform legislation. Some attention is paid to the fact that societal issues and behaviours are intertwined with pensions in a way difficult to be captured by standard modelling methodologies.

AB Ethnopedology, a hybrid discipline nurtured by natural as well as social sciences, encompasses the soil and land knowledge systems of rural populations, from the most traditional to the modem. Using this statement as a starting point, the first part of the paper defines ethnopedology in terms of conceptual scope, methodological approaches and dominant research themes. Initially, classic ethnographic studies focused on the linguistic analysis of local soil and land classification systems, while the comparative approach aimed at establishing similarities and differences between local knowledge and scientific information. More recently, interest has shifted towards a more integrated approach, which recognizes the relevance of the cultural context in local sustainable land management. Ethnopedological research covers a wide diversity of topics centered around four main issues: (1) the formalization of local soil and land knowledge into classification schemes, (2) the comparison of local and technical soil classifications, (3) the analysis of local land evaluation systems, and (4) the assessment of agro-ecological management practices. In the second part of the paper, the current status of ethnopedology in a worldwide perspective is assessed from a compilation of 895 references, with respect to the abundance, distribution and diversity of ethnopedological studies (EPS). These EPS are distributed over 61 countries, mainly in Africa, America and Asia, and cover 217 ethnic groups. The geographical density of EPS is positively correlated with linguistic and biological diversities. Most EPS have been carried out in fragile agro-ecological zones, where communities living with limited resources have developed efficient land and water management systems to compensate for resource scarcity. Of the three main components of ethnopedology i.e. Corpus, Praxis and Kosmos-more attention has so far been given to local cognitive systems (Corpus) and local management systems (Praxis) than local belief and symbol systems (Kosmos). Shifting the research emphasis to the cosmovision of local peoples would improve the contribution of EPS to the formulation and implementation of rural development programmes.

ID INDIGENOUS KNOWLEDGE
AB The increasing attention paid to local soil knowledge in recent years is the result of a greater recognition that the knowledge of people who have been interacting with their soils for long time can offer many insights about the sustainable management of tropical soils. This paper describes two approaches in the process of eliciting local information. Case studies show that there is a consistent rational basis to the use of local indicators of soil quality and their relation to improved soil management. The participatory process used is shown to have considerable potential in facilitating farmer consensus about which soil-related constraints should be tackled first. Consensus building is presented as an important step prior to collective action by farming communities in integrated soil management at the landscape scale. Taking advantage of the complementary nature of local and scientific knowledge is highlighted as an overall strategy for sustainable soil management. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

AB The objective of this paper is twofold: first, to describe the dynamics of the traditional farming system (TFS) of a rural indigenous community in Central Mexico and second, to detect the contribution of local knowledge to potential indicators of sustainable development.
   The method included the following steps: (a) field description of the TFS; (b) survey of local knowledge on both landscape and land qualities; (c) soil and maize grain yield sampling; and (d) statistical analyses relating local knowledge to field and laboratory data. A participatory approach was used; every field technique was carried out together with local producers.
   Statistical analyses of both field and laboratory data proved the consistency of peasant-defined land quality classes. Land quality was related to the distribution of available P, slope position and depth of recent volcanic ash cover. In addition, we detected a well-structured relief and soil quality knowledge-base.
   The TFS is a highly complex integrated scheme serving as a conceptual basis for decision-making procedures. The TFS does not attempt to maximize profit in cash. Its goal is self-sufficiency. These principles are at the core of decision-making procedures. The system represents a substantial part of the culture of Nuevo San Juan traditional producers. Family participation in the TFS is a key element; self-sufficiency gives security to the family. This explains the survival of the TFS despite its drawbacks, basically of a social nature rather than a technical nature. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

ID LOCAL KNOWLEDGE
AB Small holder farmers throughout Bangladesh operate in small but diverse ecosystems and possess a deep intimate knowledge of local soils. They have developed soil management strategies that helped them to attain a high degree of sustainability. In this study, a group of small holder farmers from a village in the saline water ecosystem in southwestern Bangladesh were interviewed to explore the depth of their knowledge of soils. Data collected from a parallel scientific study done in the same village revealed that the village farmers possessed considerable knowledge of local soils, their classification, and management problems. Farmers' typology of soils differed from their scientific classification because of the diversity in objectives and approaches to study the village soils. Despite their lack of knowledge of the soil genesis and morphology and soil chemistry, farmers qualitatively identified major typology, properties, and constraints of topsoil, and have developed strategies through generation-long practical on-farm experiments that helped them to maintain a sustainable agricultural system in the village. Farmers' knowledge of soils is, therefore, a vast resource that should be tapped and incorporated in the national scientific database and utilized in formulating future agricultural development policies.

AB It is now widely recognized that local farmers possess an important body of knowledge concerning soils and their use for agriculture. This article argues that in order for that knowledge to be useful for sustainable development interventions, it is necessary to go beyond the collection of indigenous soil taxonomies and also explore the theories farmers have on soil formation and degradation processes. Based on field research in eastern Burkina Faso, the article demonstrates that farmers' theories of soil go beyond practical rules of thumb and include complex concepts about soil processes and fertility. In this sense they are similar to scientific theories of soil. It is argued that understanding the similarities and differences in soil related concepts, such as that of soil fertility, could do much more to improve communication between farmers, researchers and development workers than only comparing taxonomies. Furthermore, capturing the grammar (theories) rather than the sentences (taxonomies) provides a much clearer insight to how farmers will deal with changing circumstances and new crops than the static way in which local taxonomies are often treated. Finally, local soil theories are a better point of departure in terms of creating the necessary comprehension of fanner practices required for effective collaboration towards sustainable development.

   management
AB Local names have been used for centuries to name land, plots or sites and soils in the Netherlands [Vlam (1948)]. Most of these names can still be found on old topographic maps. The naming of land on the farm was similar to the custom of naming cattle, as the fanner knew his plots in great detail. Unfortunately, neither oral nor written traditions exist today concerning the use of specific names to identify soils and/or their properties. Only in rare cases could examples be found. The custom to name land decreased after the introduction of the land registry which introduced a numerical classification rather than names [Vlam (1951)]. In addition, extensive re-allocation works creating ever-bigger parcels of land caused the disappearance of many names. The introduction of the soil names at the Subgroup level of the Dutch Soil Classification System is seen as a valuable combination between the scientific name and the name of the locality or field, where a particular soil is well represented [Boor en Spade XV (1966) 25]. Examples are given of the development and names of two farming systems in different geographic regions in the Netherlands.
   The soil/land management practices were often governed by the biophysical position of the farms. On the higher sandy areas soil fertility was a major constraint for sustainable farming, whereas on the lower, clayey regions soil workability and water management were important issues. The farmers applied their local knowledge of the soil/land systems consistently and in a holistic manner. Their approach illustrates the influence of ethnopedology as described by Barrera-Bassols and Zinck [Geoderma (2002) this issue] on the development of modem agriculture in the Netherlands.

AB Our understanding of the role of institutions and property-rights regimes in natural resource management has matured through the work of new institutional economists and common-property theorists. Even so, this literature has yet to establish clear connections between successful resource management, and a given property regime's spatio-temporal fit. Examining people-forest interaction within a state-managed forest regime in India's Western Ghats, this paper argues that regime efficacy in satisfying user needs, hinges on appropriately reflecting particular sociospatial contexts and incorporating temporal flexibility into its normative structure. To these ends, this study analyzes institutional structure regulating forest use and management, and examines data collected through extensive fieldwork, in-depth interviews and informal conversations with local villagers and foresters. The results suggest that user responses to access conditions, and their rationales for engaging in particular extraction practices, vary based on caste/class-based perceptions of regime legitimacy, distributional equity, and historical proprietorship rights. Furthermore, the analysis questions the viability of locally managed regimes under such heterogeneous social settings. Rather, this research recognizes the state's vital role in mediating resource access. It suggests that regime efficacy can be fostered through state-civil society partnerships, widely distributed stakeholder-ship and firmly embedded regimes that adapt to changing sociospatial contexts through modifications to conditions of use and access. Based on the analysis, this paper explores an initial set of sociospatial and temporal parameters that promote institutional efficacy in management, and thus lays the groundwork-for future studies in institutional and political ecology.

AB In accordance with Senegal's decentralisation policy, important forest management tasks, including the right to allocate charcoal production rights, have been transferred to rural councils. This paper investigates the impact of these institutional reforms on charcoal production practices using the environmental entitlement framework developed by Leach et al. [Environmental entitlements: dynamics and institutions in community-based natural resource management. World Development 27 (2) (1999) 225]. The councils have not been able to turn their new endowments into entitlements, because they lack sufficient strength and legitimacy. Informal institutions, notably the coalition between merchants, state agents and village chiefs, continue to run the charcoal business and are hardly affected by decentralisation efforts. Most rural people, especially those relying solely on agriculture for sustenance, do not benefit at all from the charcoal trade. They do suffer from the environmental costs it brings with it, however. Although tensions between pro-exploitation actors and pro-conservation actors are evident, the pro-exploitation actors' firm grip on the informal institutions will probably lead to a prolonged subversion of the laws that seek to enhance local control and to sustain the forest.

AB Contaminant-induced alterations in genetic diversity or allele/genotype frequencies can occur via genetic bottlenecks, selection, or increased mutation rate, and may affect population growth, sustainability, and adaptability. Determination of causality of genetic effects requires demonstration of some or all of the following criteria: (1) Strength of association: use of multiple reference and contaminated populations, and demonstration of effect s that cannot otherwise be explained by evolutionary theory; (2) Consistency of association: effects corroborated by other studies, in other species, or with multiple genetic markers; (3) Specificity of association: concordance of genetic effects with exposure/effect bioindicators, genotype-dependant fitness and biomarkers, and consideration of confounding factors; (4) Temporality of effects: use of phylogenetics and analysis of genetic diversity using different methodologies to differentiate historical vs. recent events; (5) Biological gradients: sampling sites that are known to have differing levels of contamination; (6) Experimental evidence: exposure of small populations to contaminants in laboratories, mesocosms, or in situ cages, or measurement of genotype-dependant biomarkers; (7) Biological plausibility: existence of contaminants at levels great enough to affect fitness, recruitment, or mutation rates, or a demonstrated mechanism for selection. Application of these criteria to population genetic studies is illustrated by case studies involving RAPD analysis of mosquitofish populations.

AB Two international exchange programs in engineering between universities in Japan and Canada, are described in order to explain the significant benefits gained by the undergraduate and graduate students, as well as the academic staff who participate, and to highlight key principles generally followed in the design and execution of exchange programs. One notable and successful engineering exchange program is. between the University of Waterloo, located in Southern Ontario, Canada, and Tottori University in Japan, while the other is between the University of Waterloo and Kyoto University in Japan. Both of these programs include foreign students taking courses for credit or audit at the host university, and, for the case of graduate students, also receiving guidance in their research. Moreover, upon completion of one academic semester in Japan, all of the undergraduate Waterloo students studying at Tottori University are employed in Japanese industry for three to four months before returning to Canada. Of paramount importance to the education of the participating undergraduate and graduate students is the opportunity to learn, by first-hand experience, the language and culture of a foreign country. In fact, one of the key findings of a survey completed by Canadian and Japanese students who took part in the exchange programs, is that living in a different culture greatly enhanced their own personal development. The addition of this international perspective to a solid education in engineering opens many doors of opportunity for exchange program alumni, who are well prepared to fully participate in the global marketplace of the 21st century, and to assist society in responsibly reaching an equitable and sustainable future.

AB Recently, it has been proposed that in planning oral health care services in non-established market economy (non-EME) countries, and for under-served communities throughout the world, high priority be given to a basic package of oral care (BPOC). This package contains three key components: emergency care (oral urgent treatment - OUT), exposure to appropriate fluoride (affordable fluoride toothpaste - AFT) and appropriate treatment technology (atraumatic restorative treatment - ART). These three components are embedded in the supporting context of oral health promotion (OHP). There is a lack of experience in implementing BPOC and besides, there is not much known about the effectiveness, efficiency and sustainability of the proposed components of BPOC, either individually or as a package, under local conditions. An effective approach in one setting may not be successful in another setting due to many factors such as a lack of acceptability by the community or local government or because of insufficient financial and human resources. It is therefore recommended to consider small scale demonstration projects for effectiveness, efficiency and sustainability assessments of the various components of BPOC before embarking on large scale programmes. The purpose of this paper is to highlight the different aspects related to the planning, implementation and evaluation of oral health demonstration projects for under-served communities.

TI Policy options towards a sustainable urban transportation strategy for
   Bangkok
SO INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT PLANNING REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
ID CITIES; WORLD
AB This paper examines the critical urban transportation problems of Bangkok and evaluates feasible policy options. The problems include severe traffic congestion reflected in very slow traffic speeds; the very low share of urban land devoted to roads; excessive reliance on cars and insufficient provision of the cheaper forms of public transport; major environmental problems with respect to air pollution and noise; the proliferation of agencies involved in transportation; and political obstacles in the way of effective policy innovation. Several policy options are assessed: banning private cars in the core city; investing in more railways; promoting TODs (transit-oriented developments); improving bus services; implementing demand restraints, especially on car travel; designing effective traffic management schemes; facilitating private-sector participation in transportation; and encouraging more decentralisation and suburbanisation. All these policy options are complementary palliatives, not panaceas. Whether sustainable transportation is possible in Bangkok remains problematic.

   policies in Bangladesh
SO INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT PLANNING REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
ID NONGOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS; NGOS
AB Field workers should be the movers and shakers of their non-governmental organisations (NGOs). They implement NGO policies, but unfortunately they are rarely consulted during the making of these policies. Their problems and opinions remain unheard, or are not accounted for. This article presents their voices and views, based on research in Bangladesh. Field workers face professional problems, such as a lack of promotion opportunities and unwanted transfers. They also face problems specific to their NGOs, including top-heavy administration and/or bureaucracy, involvement in politics, the sustainability of local groups, and competition between NGOs for clients. The article concludes that field workers should be empowered to make NGOs more effective, and thus more useful to the poor and the disadvantaged.

AB The Federal Dairy Research Station (FAM) was established at the beginning of the last century. It is one of six agricultural research stations of the Swiss Department of Agriculture and the leading national research institute in dairy technology and consulting. It is part of the Swiss Centre of Competence for Animal Production and Foods of Animal Origin. Its mission is to improve the competitive position of the Swiss milk producers and dairy industry. The institute is organized into three functional areas corresponding to its well-established core competencies: (1) production of raw milk cheese and microorganisms for fermentation, (2) knowledge transfer and consultation for the dairy industry and beekeeping, and (3) testing of, and providing expertise on dairy and bee products. Research work is carried out using a multidisciplinary approach in a matrix organization. Two product- and customer-orientated technology units and one unit for consulting, contractual work and other services for the dairy industry are supported in their projects by three scientific and technical units (microbiology; chemistry, physics and sensory analysis; engineering and production) as well as by a unit offering central services. The 4-year research programmes are based on the strategic goals of the agricultural policy as well as on the current needs of the dairy industry. An advisory board oversees the preparation and execution of the projects. FAM is connected to an international network for both scientific work and supervisory tasks. Work is carried out within the background of the political strategy of a sustainable development including economic, ecological and social aspects. A primary research focus is therefore the avoidance of excessive processing of milk and dairy products, and keeping products natural and free of residues by applying only minimal, unavoidable treatments and additives.

AB We used immature-to-adult female ratios (IFR), which indicate replacement rates, to assess changes in and viabilities of nonhuman primate groups and populations Heltne et al. (1975) concluded that the howling monkey (Alouatta palliata) population at La Pacifzca (Guanacaste, Costa Rica) was declining, as the IFR was < 1.5, the ratio thought needed for a sustainable population. Our population surveys of 1984,1991, and 1998 revealed that the number of Monkeys in the population was stable, but the number of groups had increased and mean group size decreased. To examine these group-level changes, we present the IFR and immature-to-adult (IAR) ratios for La Pacifzca Groups 2 and 18, which we have studied longitudinally for 18 and 10 years, respectively. Group 2 was larger than Group 18, but both groups showed similar mean IFRs for the study periods The mean IFR for each group exceeded the population IFR. The annual IFRs varied more in the smaller group than in the larger group, and the IARs for these groups varied more than the IFRs did. All annual IFRs in the groups were below the hypothesized critical value of 1.5. Given these group and population values, we examined this critical IFR value with respect to mantled howler life history characteristics, particularly interbirth intervals and juvenile emigration, both of which preclude ratios &GE;1.5, and compared the La Pacifzca mantled howler population ratios with those of other populations Group size, in conjunction with these ratios, might be more predictive of sustainable groups and populations.

ID UNITED-STATES; INSURANCE; POPULATION
AB The uncertain need for long-term care services is a risk best protected by insurance. However, the current funding relies heavily on personal payment and public welfare, and only lightly on social and private insurances. This method, akin to sitting on a two-legged stool, is unlikely to be sustainable. To incorporate insurance as a key component of funding and to mobilize public and private resources more effectively, we propose a three-legged-stool funding model under which social insurance would provide a basic protection, to be supplemented by private insurance and personal payment. When these sources do not provide sufficient protection for some individuals, Medicaid as public welfare would serve as a safety net. This article (a) discusses how to implement this funding model by using the trade-off principle in both the public and private sectors when resources for long-term care are scarce, and (b) analyzes several objections to this model from cognitive psychology/behavioral economics.

AB Soil degradation and depletion of soil nutrients are among the major factors threatening sustainable cereal production in the Ethiopian highlands. Fertilizer use as a means of mitigating nutrient depletion has become widely accepted. The fate of fertilizer nitrogen (N) applied to a semidwarf bread wheat system was determined in microplots receiving 41 kg N ha(-1) in the form of urea labelled with 5.617 % atom excess (15) N, without and with the application of phosphorus (P) at 20 kg P ha(-1) . The study was conducted in three different agro-ecological zones at 2200, 2400 and 2800 m above sea level (masl) (Kulumsa, Asasa and Bekoji, respectively) in the south-eastern Ethiopian highlands. Yield and yield response to N diminished with elevation, while the response to P increased with elevation, with a significant increase in wheat grain yield observed at Bekoji (2800 masl). N harvest index and N use efficiency improved in response to P application at Asasa (2400 masl). Crop removal accounted for 25-64 and 36-64 % of the applied N without and with P, respectively. The corresponding fractions of (15) N recovered in the soil ranged from 2.9 to 3.5 % and from 3.2 to 3.7 %, respectively. Recoveries of applied (15) N were 67 and 52 % at Kulumsa and Asasa, but only 25 % at the highest elevation site, Bekoji. Fertilizer P significantly enhanced N recovery at Asasa (60 %) and Bekoji (36 %), but not at Kulumsa, where the soil had a high level of residual P from previous applications. The fraction of (15) N recovered in the soil-plant system was rather low at Bekoji. However, the rate of (15) N recovery was significantly improved (by 37 %) when fertilizer P was added to the soil. Across all locations, the unaccounted (15) N may have been lost primarily through denitrification and volatilization.

TI The influence of rainfall on zebra population dynamics: implications for

AB 1. Where wildlife is not formally protected in Africa, abundant species are often consumptively managed, for benefit, control, or both. Such management should preferably be based on some understanding of the ecological processes regulating populations, the extent to which wildlife conflicts with livestock, and the rates at which wildlife can be harvested on a sustainable basis.
   2. We report the results of a simulation modelling analysis of the dynamics of a plains zebra population in Laikipia District, Kenya. This largely unfenced, non-protected area of 9666 km(2) is comprised of privately, publicly, and communally owned properties supporting livestock and wildlife. We examined the influence of rainfall on zebra abundance, and evaluated the sustainability of alternative harvesting regimes.
   3. The model was stage- and sex-structured, corresponding with age/sex classes recognizable in the field. Vital rates and age at first reproduction were adjusted annually using two alternative approaches, both involving annual re-calculation of carrying capacity as a function of rainfall. The first adjustment factor was simply a function of carrying capacity - a solely 'Rainfall-Dependent' (RD) mechanism. The second adjustment factor was proportional to the ratio of carrying capacity to population size - a Rainfall-Mediated Density-Dependent (RMDD) mechanism.
   4. Both versions of the model reconstructed known zebra dynamics over the last 16 years within the precision afforded by sample counting. However, RMDD gave a better fit, yielded parameter settings that were meaningful ecologically, and better predicted the impact of a severe drought than did RD. We infer that rainfall strongly influences the abundance of Laikipia's zebras by a mechanism involving adjustments in the strength of density dependence.
   5. Simulations using RMDD suggested that previously allocated annual harvest quotas in Laikipia (up to 15%) might not have been sustainable, but a 6% annual harvest would be a sustainable harvest.
   6. Synthesis and applications: The model captures a fundamental feature of the mechanism by which rainfall limits large-bodied savanna ungulates: populations typically decline faster during dry phases than they can increase during wet phases. As a result, the greater the variation in annual rainfall, the greater the proportion of time the population spends below carrying capacity. The model has been adopted as the basis for zebra management in Laikipia. To our knowledge, this is the first population-specific model to be used to guide the consumptive management of a wild ungulate in Kenya.

AB Overoptimistic stocking rates are the leading cause of rangeland degradation. The phenomenon of patch-selective grazing means that the stocking rate on heavily used patches is much higher than that intended for the area as a whole. In addition, the differential use of preferred areas in the landscape results in uneven distribution of animal impact. Landscape heterogeneity increases as grazing unit size increases, resulting in heavier impact on preferred areas. Such phenomena compound over time and have a major long-term impact on the environment and primary and secondary production. This study investigates whether rotational grazing allows reduction of, and recovery from, degradation caused by patch-selective grazing in large (1800-2100 ha) paddocks by providing adequate rest between grazing events. From 1995 through 1998, herbaceous basal area and bare ground changes were measured on adjacent heavily and lightly grazed patches in rotationally and continuously grazed paddocks.
   Although weather was a dominating influence (pless than or equal to0.0001), the eight-pasture rotation system resulted in greater perennial herbaceous basal area (p = 0.0987) and lower proportions of bare ground on bottomland soils (p = 0.03) and clay-loam soils (p = 0.052) than the continuously grazed control. The increases in basal area with rotational grazing were primarily due to increases in perennial C-4 mid- and shortgrasses, Grazing treatment did not influence species aerial biomass composition (p>0.1). This study provides evidence that in large paddocks, rotational grazing allows recovery from and reduces degradation caused by patch overgrazing. Planned rotational grazing addresses the root cause of patch overgrazing and deterioration. It is, therefore, a key tool in managing for sustainable use and restoration of rangeland.

AB To obtain a sustainable competitive advantage, companies must analyze the resources and capacities they possess in order to select strategies likely to offer the best returns. Therefore, the consistency that exists between a company's set of resources and capacities and its strategic orientation has constituted a fundamental subject of study in strategic management [Adm. Sci. Q. 25 (1980) 317; Strategic Manage. J. 6 (1985) 273; J. Manage. Stud. 23 (4) (1986) 401]. However, it has been argued in the literature that the company's achievement of a sustainable competitive advantage depends not only on the resources and capabilities that constitute its competitive basis, nor on the consistency of these with its strategy, but also on the degree of coincidence or overlap between its resources and the set of strategic industrial factors (SIFs) that are critical for success in its markets [Strategic Manage. J. 14 (1993) 33; Barney, J. Integrating organizational behavior and strategy formulation research: a resource based analysis. In: Shrivastava P., Huff A., Dutton J., editors. Advances in Strategic Management, vol. 8. Greenwich, CT: JAI Press, 1992. pp. 39-62]. From the starting point of these theoretical considerations, we have defined three hypotheses aimed at analyzing the linkage between the resources and capabilities possessed by companies and their strategic orientation, and at determining the influence exercised by competitive market factors on the choice of a particular strategy. For the empirical testing of these hypotheses, we took a sample of 130 out of the 500 largest Spanish companies, subjecting the data obtained to various techniques of multivariant analysis.

AB Horseshoe crabs, Limulus polyphemus, are the preferred bait in the eel and conch fisheries along the east coast of the United States. However, recent management measures have restricted the availability of horseshoe crabs to commercial fisheries, creating the need for sustainable, alternative bait sources. In this study, we examined the chemistry underlying the predator-prey attraction to determine if specific, isolable attractant metabolites from the horseshoe crab could be identified and characterized for incorporation into an artifical bait. Initial assays with the mud snail, Ilyanassa obsoleta, suggested that the chemoattractants were concentrated in L. polyphemus eggs. Chemical analyses and biological assays of the egg extract indicated the primary cue was a heat-stable, proteinaceous compound (>10 kDa). A carbohydrate-rich fraction of low molecular mass (<10 kDa) also enhanced mud snail chemotaxis. Analysis of egg digests with SDS-PAGE confirmed the presence of glycoproteins or carbohydrate-binding proteins in the horseshoe crab egg extract. Because the attractant appears to be a complex protein or glycoprotein, conventional chemical synthesis is unlikely. However, the tools of modern biotechnology offer the potential to produce this attractant in a system independent of the horseshoe crab. Such an attractant could be incorporated into an artificial bait, providing an ecologically sound alternative for commercial eel and whelk fisheries.

TI Peer education for HIV prevention in the socialist republic of Vietnam:
   A national assessment

ID DRUG-USERS; AIDS; PROJECTS; PROGRAM; IMPACT
AB In 2000, the government of Vietnam conducted the first assessment of its national peer education program for HIV prevention. Twenty (32%) of Vietnam's 61 provinces and urban areas had functioning peer education programs, and program coordinators of all 20 were interviewed regarding their programs. In addition, on-site reviews were done for 10 of the 20 programs, including inter-views of peer educators and high-risk persons in each program.
   The assessment found that a total of 500 peer educators were functioning either independently or as part of one of 79 teams. In the 20 provinces, the peer educators made an estimated 7,000 total contacts per month with high risk persons, but many persons were likely contacted repeatedly. Despite this, coverage was limited: some provinces with high numbers of persons reported with HIV/AIDS had few peer educators. Although most provinces targeted IDU and many targeted CSW, few provinces targeted sex partners of IDU or CSW. The definition of peer education and composition of teams varied substantially by province; only one province included persons living with HIV/AIDS as peer educators. The services provided by peer educators were primarily distributional: delivering information either through word of month, pamphlets, or brochures, providing condoms, and sometimes providing clean syringes and needles. Skills building or goal setting interventions aimed at HIV risk reduction were rarely provided. Most provinces had concerns about ongoing funding and sustainability of the programs. Based on the assessment, specific recommendations were provided for strengthening and expanding Vietnam's peer education programs.

AB The present paper provides some evidence regarding the thermal electrical power production sector of Greece evaluating performance indicators as signposts of sustainability. The methodology used was data envelopment analysis applied for each one of the yearly activities of thermal electrical power production sector. In the present study two evaluations are carried out. The first one takes into account only corporate data (i.e., inputs and outputs of production process), though in the second one environmental impact data (i.e., NOx and SO2 emissions) are also included. According to the results, in the late 1980s the performance of Public Power Corporation, the exclusive electricity producer, was efficient compared to the previous yearly activities considered here.

AB Agri-environmental schemes (AES) have been introduced as part of European Union's (EU) Common Agricultural Policy and are now an important part of this. A methodological approach to analyse the policy effects of AES is outlined, in which we distinguish between performance effects (on agricultural practices) and outcome effects (environmental impact). The performance effects are further approached including measurement of improvement and protection effects based on 12 indicators on changes/maintenance of land use and agricultural management.
   Data from personal interviews of participating and non-participating farmers in AES measures in nine EU Member States and Switzerland were used to analyse policy effects, including single indicator effects on agricultural practices as well as combined effects at the agreement level. Significant effects were found for mineral N-fertiliser use, stocking density reduction, maintenance of a minimum livestock density and pesticides. For AES agreements regulating grassland management, fertiliser use and pesticides, clear indications of combined improvement and protection effects were found. In addition clear improvement effects of agreements regulating fertiliser and pesticides use on mainly arable lands were revealed. It is concluded that the approach presented including the 12 selected indicators has proven to be operational. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Rapid decline of plant resources due to their conventional use needs ex-situ and in-situ conservation, training of the community regarding collection of medicinal plants and their marketing. In this regard, the Bulashbar valley, Astore, District Diamer was identified as a case study. The main objectives of this activity were to enlist economic, medicinal and aromatic plants including their occurrence, general distribution and abundance in the project areas; to determine traditional use and pharmaceutical values of each medicinal plant species found in the project area. Ethnobotanical studies of the area revealed that 33 plants were being used by the local communities for medicinal purposes. Two species, Bunium persicum and Ephedra gerardiana, are recommended for in vitro cultivation to obtain quick benefits. While Hippophae rhamnoides can be sustainably used for socio-economic uplift of the local communities. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A synthetic version of the CRY1Ac gene of Bacillus thuringiensis has been used for the transformation of loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) using particle bombardment. Mature zygotic embryos were used to be bombarded and to generate organogenic callus and transgenic regenerated plants. Expression vector pB48.215 DNA contained a synthetic Bacillus thuringiensis (B.t.) CRY1Ac coding sequence flanked by the double cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S promoter and nopaline synthase (NOS) terminator sequences, and the. neomycin phosphotransferase II (NPTII) gene controlled by the promoter of the nopaline synthase gene was introduced into loblolly pine tissues by particle bombardment. The transformed tissues were proliferated and selected on media with kanamycin. Shoot regeneration was induced from the kanamycin-resistant calli, and transgenic plantlets were then produced. More than 60 transformed plants from independent transformation events were obtained for each loblolly pine genotype tested. The integration and expression of the introduced genes in the transgenic loblolly pine plants was confirmed by polymerase chain reactions (PCR) analysis, by Southern hybridization, by Northern blot analysis, and by Western blot analysis. Effective resistance of transgenic plants against Dendrolimus punctatus Walker and Crypyothelea formosicola Staud was verified in feeding bloassays with the insects. The transgenic plants recovered could represent a good opportunity to analyse the impact of genetic engineering of pine for sustainable resistance to pests using a B. thuringiensis insecticidal protein. This protocol enabled the routine transformation of loblolly pine plants that were previously difficult to transform.

   documentation; facilities; management
AB With increasing evidence that sustainable design and construction results in more energy-efficient, lower-cost, less environmentally damaging, and more occupant-friendly facilities, organizations have begun to seek guidance on integrating concepts of sustainability into their capital programs. A growing number of guidance documents have been developed to support these sustainability efforts. While these documents contain a broad spectrum of information on sustainable buildings, they are not necessarily written or organized suitably for stakeholders associated with the postconstruction phases of the facility life cycle. This paper presents a critical parametric analysis of nine such documents intended to educate facility decision makers on sustainability. The analysis revealed that these documents, with some exceptions, do not address all of their intended audiences equally, with most information focusing on designers and owners and comparatively less information targeted to others such as facilities managers. Given the crucial role facilities managers play in ensuring the ongoing sustainable performance of facilities, there is a need to modify or extend existing guidance documents to better address the needs of facilities managers.

TI Solar powered water pumps: The past, the present-and the future?
SO JOURNAL OF SOLAR ENERGY ENGINEERING-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME
LA English
DT Article
ID DC MOTORS; SYSTEMS
AB Solar (photovoltaic) powered water pumps could be a real instrument for the alleviation of water related deaths and illnesses in developing countries through the provision of clean water However despite the benefits that access to sustainable potable water supplies can bring, solar powered water pumps have a long way to go before they even begin to meet the needs of those who could use them. This paper addresses some of the complex, inter-related social and technical issues that have prevented solar powered water pumping from reaching its full potential and shows how future efforts should be directed in order to respond to these issues.

   partnership; experiential learning
AB The objective of this article is to open a dialogue on integrating service-learning into community based watershed management programs and to discuss opportunities and challenges that a service-learning program presents to universities and communities. The article presents the concept and definition of service-learning, and arguments concerning why institutions of higher education and university faculty and students should be involved with community based watershed management programs. The article describes a case study for developing a service-learning program for watershed management at Virginia Tech and discusses lessons learned from the case study. The paper concluded that to make a service-learning program sustainable, there should be a long term plan, regular and effective communication with the stakeholders, and some incentives for faculty and students for long term commitment to the community based watershed management programs.

TI A symbolic representation of field-forage-ruminant relationships using
   polar form on the complex plane
SO JOURNAL OF THE FACULTY OF AGRICULTURE KYUSHU UNIVERSITY
LA English
DT Article
AB In the ruminant production from meadows or pastures, close relationships among fields, forages and ruminants are of great importance to the cycling of nutrient elements (Whitehead, 2000a, b), because this will lead to sustainable systems of ruminant production from forages (Mannetje, 1994; Peel and Lloveras, 1994; Spedding, 1995). Our previous report (Shimojo et al., 2002) suggested an example of analytic description of field-forage-ruminant relationships by introducing a concept of an intersection of forage production and ruminant production, where animals were related to fields through forages eaten and feces excreted. There will be other analytic ways that might be expected to give symbolic descriptions of these relationships. We tried to apply the complex representation to analytic studies of digestibility or indigestibility changes with growth of forages (Shimojo et al., 1998a, b). In some cases of scientific studies, the complex representation of a subject might be helpful to its understanding when described using polar coordinates and subjected to rotations on the complex plane.
   The present study was designed to give a symbolic representation of field-forage -ruminant relationships using rotations on the complex plane of polar coordinates describing digestible and indigestible dry matter of forages connected with fields.

ID SUSTAINABLE COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE; IDENTIFYING CORE COMPETENCE
AB Recent transitions from the industrial to knowledge economy suggest an immediate and wholesale retraining scenario so that many organisations can remain at the cutting edge of technology. The dynamics of the job market is creating a challenge for many organisations in recruiting and retaining their core staf. In fact, many companies are in fear of losing critical business knowledge when their employees leave. In this paper, systems dynamics is employed to illustrate the relationship between recruitment, training, skills, and knowledge in a causal loop form. Strategies for human resource management are developed by conducting time-based dynamic analysis. We anticipate that systems dynamics modelling would help organisations to devise efficient human resource management strategies.

AB Despite two decades of debate, there remains little consensus about what sustainability is, and how it should be achieved. Economists primarily portray sustainability as a macro-level concern, but there has been less attention on the implications of this social objective for policies related to the management of individual resources. This paper derives guidance for sector-level planning and project analysis from a macro-level norm of intergenerational fairness. Optimal sustainable management involves making tradeoffs between sectors. We derive a criteria for sector-level planning and project analysis that help make those tradeoffs without losing site of the sustainability goal.

AB Selected habitats in Berlin (Germany) were investigated with a focus on the diversity of flora and land use patterns. On the one hand, the correlation between the number of plant species and the diversity of land use patterns is shown for a transection running from the center to the outskirts of Berlin. The greatest variety of land use patterns and the highest number of species per square kilometer can be found in the transition zone between the city center and the outskirts where urban structures are closely associated with open spaces like large parks, urban forests, and larger wastelands. In accordance with the intermediate disturbance hypothesis, the mosaic of land use patterns in the transition zone with moderate frequencies or intensities of disturbance positively affects habitat diversity, as well as overall species diversity on the landscape level. Furthermore, in residential areas built in the 1920s and 1930s, the flora was studied from both a historical and a present-day perspective in order to assess the diversity of wild-growing indigenous and non-native plant species, wild-growing ornamental plant species, and planted trees. The highest numbers of species were recorded in less intensively managed habitats. In addition to structural factors (e.g. land use patterns) determining the diversity of flora and vegetation in cities, this study also demonstrates the importance of the historical factor for biodiversity. The differences in land use throughout the last 70 years (pre- and post-World War 11 era) can be seen as an explanation for the relatively high diversity of the flora in the investigated residential areas.
   Cities have to be regarded as a new type of environment with species compositions and habitats peculiar to urban-industrial areas. Future research and planning of nature conservation and sustainable development of urban-industrial areas should take the biological diversity in cities fully into account. Recommendations are given for the maintenance and development of biological diversity in cities, focussing on landscape and habitat as well as species diversity.

AB This paper develops an integrated framework of risk management and strategic competitive advantage that incorporates behavioural and economic notions of risk. The resulting model argues for the importance of risk-taking to sustainable competitive advantage and ultimately to firm performance. The model integrates framing effects of attainment discrepancy, transaction costs from implicit contracts theory and capital costs from finance theory. The proposed model suggests that continuous risk-taking by firms may help sustain competitive advantage and thus lower firm risk. This, in turn, effectively increases market returns to shareholders by ensuring earnings growth while simultaneously reducing the risk premium discount attached to a firm's future income stream.

TI Influence of constituents of concrete on its tensile strength and shear
   carrying capacity
SO MAGAZINE OF CONCRETE RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
AB Research in concrete technology has served the interests of durability, competitiveness and sustainability of concrete construction through development of mix design. Work in this field is mainly aimed at making efficient use of aggregate and developing binders with optimum cement content and industrial by-products as binder components, for example, pulverised fuel ash and ground granulated blast furnace slag. Compared with the traditional Portland cement concrete, concrete elements made with such mixes are expected to have enhanced durability that is attributable to improvement in their microstructure, reduction in voids and increase in resistance to ingress of moisture, gases, etc. This paper examines whether such attributes of different concretes could also improve their engineering properties, e.g. increase in the ratio of flexural tensile strength to compressive strength, better bond between steel and concrete and, in the end, enhanced shear capacity. It is also proposed to examine whether flexural tensile strength should be used as a parameter in the design rules to obtain realistic estimates of shear capacity, in place of the compressive strength. This approach could promote the use of modern mix design techniques and it may have some positive influence on economy of concrete construction, particularly flat slabs, where depth of a concrete member is often governed by contribution of concrete to the shear capacity.

SO MOUNTAIN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

DT Article
AB Water scarcity is a serious problem in Koppal, a semi-arid district, with-barren rocky hills in northern Karnataka, India. The hills were denuded of forests and trees in the past. Resource depletion continues l to occur because of rock blasting and. stone cutting. This has led to low groundwater recharge, a problem further aggravated by the digging of bore wells to a depth at which only saline water is available. High-input agriculture combined, with: saline water has caused the: soil to become unproductive. Farmers thus find it more profitable to leave the land uncultivated. As agriculture or other resources in the region do not secure supply of food, people in the area face a severe livelihood crisis. Moreover, the local population and the government do not link the exploitation of rocks and hills to ground water depletion. There is ab urgent need for solutions. People respond to their livelihood crisis at the household level and do not come together as a community at address issues. External facilitators are needed to generate a discussion of problems and alternative solutions. Short-term solutions only increase the predicament of the people. Long-term perspectives and investments are required to ensure sustainable management of natural resources as well as livlihoods in this semi-arid area.

AB The article outlines the development of Iceland's fishery rights and the extension of its territorial waters between the 1950s and the mid-1970s, whereby Iceland gained exclusive control and use of the marine resources of the waters within 12, later 50, and ultimately 200 nautical miles around the island. The article concentrates on four of Iceland's main fisheries: shrimp, herring, capelin and cod. These four fisheries are discussed separately and in depth, presenting the beginnings and growth of the industry and detailing the development of management practices and the corresponding legislation and regulatory measures. Iceland's initial concern was to gain control over the marine resources surrounding the island, but once this was achieved, the focus of attention shifted to managing first the economic and soon also the ecological aspects of its tremendous resource. Informed mainly by indigenous expertise, Iceland's concern was to limit overfishing, manage its fisheries sustainably both from the economic and ecological points of view, and find the best ways to distribute the revenues from the marine harvest.
   The article looks at each of the four fisheries to clarify how the individual transferable quota (ITQ) system came into being, how initial quota holdings were allotted, and analyses the circumstances under which the ITQ system became the management tool of choice.
   For each fishery, the process of regulatory evolution was quite unique. At the same time, there is a common pattern to all the fisheries, which may be summarized as follows. Firstly, serious attempts to reform management practices only got underway when the fishery had collapsed or was close to collapse. Secondly, stakeholders invariably started the process of regulation by limiting access to the fishery. Thirdly, a variety of rules were implemented to allocate rights to participate in the fishery to additional entrants once membership had been closed. Finally, prior to the invention of the ITQ system, prices were used to manage fisheries in Iceland. It may be concluded that the management of fisheries by ITQs may be a historical accident, rather than the end point of a logical evolution.

ID RESOURCES
AB Environmental accounts bring together economic and environmental information in a common framework to measure the contribution of the environment to the economy and the impact of the economy on the environment. They enable governments to set priorities, monitor economic policies more precisely, enact more effective environmental regulations and resource management strategies, and design more efficient market instruments for environmental policies. This article uses examples from the regional environmental accounting programme in southern Africa to demonstrate the usefulness of environmental accounts to policy-making and natural resource management. The examples address the contribution of natural capital endowments (minerals and fisheries) to sustainable development in Botswana and Namibia; the economic importance Of non-market forest goods and services in South Africa; and the socio-economic impact of current water allocation and pricing policies in Botswana, Namibia and South Africa. While there are many additional policy applications, these few provide a powerful argument for the use of environmental accounts in all countries.

AB It is becoming more common for public authorities in charge of dam construction and management to inform the population living in the area soon to be submerged by a proposed dam. However, populations living further downstream along a river to be dammed, have often been left to find out by chance, despite the fact that the changes to the river flow regime will have an important impact on their lives, sometimes serious negative impacts. This article makes a comparison between two dams, one at Bort-les-Orgues across the upper Dordogne River in southern France, the other the Bagre Dam over the Nakambe (or White Volta) River in south-eastern Burkina Faso. The article discusses dam construction and operation from the point of view of the concerned populations living in the reservoir and downstream areas.
   In 2000, a study was carried out in the Dordogne Valley to ascertain downstream impacts of dam operations and information needs of the population. Suggestions from local river users related mostly to improving public information about predicted and actual flow rates and actual flow in real time along the 300 km course of the Dordogne between the dams and the estuary. Such information should be disseminated as widely as possible through available media, including the Internet, and also displayed visibly in key locations along the length of the river.

AB Major mining companies have recently embraced the sustainable development paradigm, in seeking to improve their competitiveness and increase shareholder returns. Successful mine closure is one important element of this process. Improved performance in this area is essential if surrounding communities are to see mining companies as responsible corporate and social partners.
   In Indonesia, the new approach has coincided with the development of specific mine closure legislation. To facilitate the legislation, a consortium of mining companies joined to form the Industry Mine Closure Steering Committee. This Committee has lobbied the Government, actively negotiating to incorporate sustainable development ideals and practices into the new legislation. The Committee's aim has been to foster continued development of the mining industry, while taking account Of variation in environmental, social and community conditions. In describing the process, this article seeks to provide guidance for the development of mine closure legislation in other nations.

DT Article
DE energy; sustainable development; transport
AB This article presents an assessment of the effectiveness of national and international energy policies directed toward the objectives of sustainable development contained in Agenda 21. Following a brief overview of energy and transport sector trends over the past ten years, the article discusses whether and to what extent energy policies for sustainable development have impacted on poverty reduction, energy security, equitable access to energy, and transition to a more efficient and environmentally sound energy system.
   The impact of policies is assessed considering that such a transition involves appropriate combinations of energy efficient technologies and usage patterns, wider use of renewable energy, and gradual induction of advanced energy technologies. The article then examines the extent to which such policies have been based on integrated assessments of the needs and priorities in economic growth, social development and environmental protection and identifies some of the main constraints and barriers hampering the implementation of energy for sustainable development. The article also examines whether decision-making processes ensure multi-stakeholder participation in policy development and support a fair sharing of commitments, responsibilities and benefits among the participating stakeholders in policy implementation. Selected case studies of policies that have made a tangible difference in promoting energy for sustainable development are outlined.
   Finally the article discusses the challenges facing energy for sustainable development and discusses various options to accelerate the implementation of its goals.

TI Assessment of alternative harvest regulations for sustaining
   recreational fisheries: Model development and application to bull trout

DT Article

   WALLEYES; ANGLERS; LIMITS
AB Regulations designed to protect recreational fisheries from overexploitation can fail. Regulations such as size and bag limits restrict harvest by individual anglers but not angler effort and therefore not total harvest. Even when individual harvest limits are set to zero (i.e., catch and release), a combination of hooking mortality and noncompliance may lead to fishing mortality rates that are not sustainable if angling effort is sufficiently high. These assertions were tested and quantified by using simulation experiments on a size- and age-structured model developed for a fishery on an adfluvial bull trout population. The functions and rates describing the biology and fishery were derived from a variety of sources, including published and unpublished information on bull trout and, where such sources were unavailable, from other salmonid species. The model predicts that a 40-cm minimum size limit for harvest would maintain viable populations at an annual effort up to 4 angler-hours . ha(-1) . year(-1), a 65-cm minimum size limit up to 10 angler-hours . ha(-1) . year(-1), and a catch-and-release fishery up to 18 angler-hours . ha(-1) . year(-1). The quality of the fisheries that developed under these three alternative regulations varied substantially with the amount of angler effort imposed. Uncertainty in the minimum population size necessary to ensure sustainability, recruits per unit stock, catchability, hooking mortality rate, and noncompliance rate modifies quantitative predictions, but the qualitative patterns are general. If anglers respond dynamically to variation in the quality of fishing, then the ability of size limit regulations to sustain fisheries is further compromised. The combination of life history and fishery traits such as slow growth, late age at maturity, low fecundity, longevity, and high catchability render adfluvial bull trout particularly susceptible to overfishing, even within relatively narrow bounds of angler effort.

   CHARR; MODEL
AB Data collected over 7 consecutive years were used to examine the population dynamics of the exploited brook trout Salvelinus fontinalis of Meach Lake in central Ontario. Numbers of age-1 and older trout averaged 975 among years. The largest trout were 490 rum long and weighed 1,807 g. Few trout lived beyond age 4. Annual mortality rates varied among age-classes and between sexes; average total instantaneous mortality was 0.95 and average total and fishing mortalities were 78% and 44%, respectively. Exploitation was greatest for age-2 and age-3 brook trout of both sexes. Catchability was uncorrelated with abundance. There was evidence of density-dependent growth at age-2 or age-3 but no indication of density-dependent mortality. A "hockey stick" model appeared to best describe the stock-recruitment relationship. Abundance of potential competitors was not correlated with brook trout size, although abundance of white suckers Catostomus commersoni was correlated with numbers of age-2 male brook trout. We conclude that total mortality rates are naturally very high and existing levels of harvests in this lake may not be increasing total mortality. To ensure the sustainability of brook trout fisheries, lake-dwelling populations should be managed to maintain total mortality rates below those observed in this study.

AB The paper reviews the need for clean, safe, and reliable energy and highlights the current energy review being undertaken by the UK government. Concern is expressed at the increasing reliance being placed on imported gas and the risk to security of supply. BNFL believe that nuclear power provides safe, clean and secure electricity and should be a key component of future sustainable energy supply strategies. An overview of new designs, the AP1000 and the Pebble Bed Modular Reactor, are provided with an explanation of the potential benefits each can offer developed and developing countries. Reviews of progress made in the US and Finland on waste disposal are highlighted. Finally the paper discusses holy the nuclear industry has developed from safe to sustainable over its fifty-year history.

ID AVAILABILITY; PROFITABILITY; TECHNOLOGIES; CULTIVATION; SYSTEMS; AFRICA
AB The possibilities of integrated nutrient management for sustainable rice cultivation are investigated for rainfed, lowland rice in Sukumaland, northwestern Tanzania. Typical, hardpan rice soils in Sukumaland have rather low levels of organic matter, total nitrogen and available phosphorus, and a low to medium amount of exchangeable potassium. Consumption of mineral fertilizers in rice is, however, very low due to availability problems and sharply increased prices of fertilizers. Use of locally available resources for soil fertility improvement is hampered by the additional inputs of farm household labour involved. High labour inputs per hectare without increases in capital inputs lead to lower marginal and average products per hour of labour. Furthermore, in semi-arid Sukumaland biomass production of green manures is seriously restricted by climate. The amount of kraal cattle manure is insufficient and half the households have no easy access to it. Using rice straw as cattle feed and thatching material has priority over soil fertility improvement. Some farmers indicate that at present there is not yet an urgent need for improved integrated nutrient management in Sukumaland rice cultivation. Adoption of integrated nutrient management based technologies depends on conducive socio-economic, agro-ecological and public policy circumstances. Farmer investment in learning and a favourable policy environment are thus no guarantee for worldwide adoption of these technologies by farm households.

TI Fallows, forage production and nutrient transfers by livestock in Niger
SO NUTRIENT CYCLING IN AGROECOSYSTEMS

DE fallow; forage production; manure; Niger; nutrient transfers
AB In southwest Niger, West Africa, fallows contribute little to crop land fertility restoration through crop and fallow cycles, because of their short duration and the intensity of their use as a source for forage. However, they indirectly play an important role in crop land fertility, because they form the origin of a large part of livestock-mediated nutrient transfers from rangelands to crop lands, at least for households owning large herds. This study was carried out in the village of Ticko, where forage resources originated from crop residues on fields during the dry season, and from plateau and fallow rangelands throughout the whole year. Fallow areas comprised 23% of the grazing resources. Their forage production was relatively low: 1903 kg DM ha(-1) on average, during the period 1996-2000, but they provided 38% of the palatable forage resources. Fields are manured every 5 years by night corralling of livestock on crop land. The average amounts of manure deposited on manured areas were 10.5 t DM ha(-1) yr(-1). Despite a stocking rate of 24 Tropical Livestock Units (TLU) km(-2) (250 kg liveweight), equal to the carrying capacity, manured areas comprised only 9% of all crop lands. In total 394 t DM of manure was transferred from natural grazing areas and non-manured crop lands to manured fields, 62.5% originating from fallow areas and 31.5% from non-manured crop lands. This leads in the medium term to a decrease in fertility of a large part of the fields owned by farmers and smallholder agro-pastoralists. Consequently, if this trend continues the system is not sustainable in the long term.

AB Sustainable land management (SLM) is the key to harmonizing environmental and ecological concerns of society with the economic realities of producing adequate food and fiber of high quality and ensuring a basic minimal quality of life. The aim of SLM is to maintain the integrity of the biophysical land resource base, but it can only be realized if land users understand the impacts of land management options on their lands but also on other off-site areas and can optimize the socioeconomic and environmental benefits of their choice. To facilitate this, the contribution of soil survey organizations would be through the assessment and monitoring of land quality. Land quality is a measure of the ability of land to perform specific functions and is derived by an integration of soil survey information with other environmental, and if necessary, socioeconomic information. The desired reliability influences the operational scale of the assessment. Such an assessment would assist in: 1) locating homologous areas for research sites or for transferring technologies; 2) providing the geographic basis for systems analysis (e.g. by modeling; 3) serving as a basis for local, national and global resource assessment and monitoring; 4) providing an ecosystem context for land use, assessments of temporal and spatial variability, and impact of human interventions; 5) serving as a framework for more detailed assessment for all levels of interest; and 6) evaluating global issues such as food security, impacts of climate change, biodiversity monitoring, and addressing desertification.
   Based on an evaluation of the progress made in soil resource inventories and considering the demands of the environment focused world, the paper considers the need for countries to mount such a program. The authors believe that this is the next demand of soil science and that we can fulfill our social contract by periodically providing such information on the state of a nation's land resource.

ID NEW-ZEALAND SOILS
AB New Zealand is highly dependent on its soil resource for continued agricultural production. To avoid depleting this resource, there is a need to identify soils and associated land management practices where there is a risk of soil degradation. Environmental integrity and ecosystem services also need to be maintained. Accordingly, to ensure sustainable production, the on- and off site environmental impacts of land management need to be identified and managed. We developed a structural vulnerability index for New Zealand soils. This index ranks soils according to their inherent susceptibility to physical degradation when used for agricultural (pasture, forestry and cropping) purposes. We also developed a rule-based model to assess soil compaction vulnerability by characterising the combined effects of resistance and resilience. Other soil attributes have been appraised using seven chemical, physical and biological indicators of soil quality. These indicators have been applied in a nation-wide project involving data collection from over 500 sites for a range of land uses. These soil quality data can be interpreted via the World Wide Web - through the interactive decision-support tool SINDI. The land-use impact model is a framework to assess agricultural land management and environmental sustainability, and may be applied to land units at any scale. Using land resource data and information the model explicitly identifies hazards to land productivity and environmental integrity. It utilises qualitative expert and local knowledge and quantitative model-based evaluations to assess the potential environmental impacts of land-management practices. The model is linked to a geographic information system (GIS), allowing model outputs, such as the environmental impacts of site-specific best management practices, to be identified in a spatially explicit manner. The model has been tested in New Zealand in an area of pastoral land use. Advantages of this risk identification model include: utilising current knowledge of the causes and effects of land-management practices on soil degradation; linking land management practice to both on- and off-site environmental consequences; identifying important gaps in local knowledge; and providing spatially explicit information on the environmental impact of land-management practices.

DE coastal lowland; land shortage; paddy rice land; slopeland; sustainable
   land use
AB Tropical Asia is a region comprising South and Southeast Asia and under strong influence of the Asian monsoon climate. It is characterized by an extremely high population density and by high land use intensity. Paddy rice cultivation is the most important form of agriculture in the greater part of the region. Soil resources of tropical Asia have a specific feature in comparison with tropical Africa and America. Ultisols dominate in uplands, and lowland soils like Inceptisols and Histosols are relatively abundant. The latter point is made clearer if we take the landforms of the region with a vast extent of lowlands into consideration. Geologically, tropical Asia with the Himalayan orogeny and active volcanism exhibits a conspicuous contrast to tropical Africa and America with the dominance of the shield structure. This along with the monsoon climate should have determined the basic features of landforms and soil, and accordingly all the agricultural and social characteristics of tropical Asia today. Although paddy rice cultivation in the lowland is highly sustainable, upland cultivation in extensive Ultisol areas tends to be handicapped by low fertility and high erodibility of the soil, resulting in low sustainability. Land shortage is compelling people to exploit slopelands in hills and mountains, on the one hand, and thus far unutilized coastal lowlands, on the other. Both of these new reclamations are facing to serious land degradation problems today. Tropical Asia will continue to be the most densely populated region of the world with ever-increasing population. In order to meet the increasing food demand lowland rice cultivation should be intensified by the infrastructure development to ease the stresses on slopelands and vulnerable coastal lowlands. At the same time, upland crop production in Ultisol areas should be stabilized and enhanced, providing integrated nutrient management and measures for soil conservation.

AB One of the consequences of inadequate soil management is its compaction that causes the loss of its sustainability and reduction of its productivity. The objective of this study was to evaluate the structural changes and the compressive behavior of a Latosol (Oxisol) under native vegetation, "Cerrado" (C), no-till (NT) and conventional till (CT) system, after two decades of use. The undisturbed soil samples were used to characterize the soil bulk density, the porous space and to perform the uniaxial compression test. The disturbed soil samples were used for soil physical and chemical characterization analyses in the analyzed depth. The bulk density varied in the following order: NT = CT > C (0 to 5 cm) and CT > NT > C (20 to 30 cm). Organic matter data showed that in the C = NT > CT (0 to 5 cm) and C = NT = CT (20 to 30 cm), showing the NT capacity of increasing organic matter. The preconsolidation pressure changed in the following order: NT = C > CT (0 to 5 cm; tension -1,500 kPa), and CT > C = NT (20 to 30 cm; tension -1,500 kPa).

AB Sugar beet is a valuable arable crop providing a large proportion of world sugar supplies. It is susceptible to a range of fungal and viral diseases, to most of which there is inadequate genetic resistance. Control instead relies largely on the use of pesticides. To increase the sustainability of sugar-beet cultivation, strong and durable genetic resistance is urgently needed. This review describes an IACR-Broom's Barn programme devoted to evaluating Beta germplasm for novel resistance to major viral and fungal diseases, and its progress in elucidating the numbers and locations of the genes responsible.

ID SOIL
AB A series of single extractions and short-term plant tests were performed in order to test a variety of inexpensive mineral amendments for the in situ inactivation of trace elements on the fine-grained spoil of the former gold mine of Jales, Portugal. Based on the results of these tests, mesocosms (lysimeters) were constructed and a small-scale semi-field trial was carried out since 1998. The long-term effect of steelshots (SS, iron grit), beringite (B), and municipal compost (C) as spoil amendments was investigated. Vegetation establishment on the treated spoils was successful with Holcus lanatus L. in year 1 and Pinus pinaster Ait. in year 2. Therefore, a detailed monitoring program was implemented for determining the sustainability of trace elements in situ inactivation by C (5%), CB (5% compost combined with 5% beringite), CSS (5% compost combined with 1% steelshots), and CBSS (5% compost combined with 5% beringite and 1% steelshots) treatments (all amendments are expressed by soil dry weight) and of the revegetation. After 3 years, revegetation was excellent in the CSS treatment, and successful for the CBSS. Volunteer plant species became established in treated spoils during year 2. In contrast, the trees planted on the C treated spoil declined from year 2 and some died. In year 3, the trees on the CB treatment started to decline. Arsenic and zinc exposure are suggested to explain the negative effects on pine growth. In agreement with results of single extractions, compost addition in the spoil increased long-term arsenic percolation. Lead leaching was also enhanced. The CBSS and CSS treatments were the most effective for limiting water-soluble As and decreasing long-term metal leaching.

AB The physical and chemical characteristics of bauxite residue sand (BRS) affect the availability of a number of nutrients to plants, especially manganese (Mn). Lucerne (Medicago sativa L.) has been chosen as a BRS revegetation species because of its deep-rooting habit and tendency to tolerate moderately alkaline and saline soils, even though it is still prone to Mn deficiency stress. Sixteen commercially available lucerne genotypes were grown in BRS after addition of 5, 50 or 500 mug Mn g(-1) BRS in a glasshouse. Manganese deficiency and toxicity symptoms were observed in 5 and 500 mug g(-1) treatments, respectively. Symptom expression varied in severity between genotypes. Relative tolerance to Mn deficiency was defined by shoot dry weight at 5 mug Mn g(-1) as a percentage of shoot dry weight at 50 mug Mn g(-1). Salado, a genotype tolerant to Mn deficiency, and Sirosal, a genotype intolerant to Mn deficiency, were then grown with 0, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200 or 800 mug Mn g(-1) BRS and found to have critical shoot Mn concentrations of 17.7 (Salado) and 26.6 mug g(-1) (Sirosal). The use of genotypes with high relative Mn deficiency tolerance is recommended to help improve sustainability of BRS revegetation as well as to improve productivity on Mn-fixing agricultural soils.

AB Soil fertility and leaching losses of nutrients were compared between a Fimic Anthrosol and a Xanthic Ferralsol from Central Amazonia. The Anthrosol was a relict soil from pre-Columbian settlements with high organic C containing large proportions of black carbon. It was further tested whether charcoal additions among other organic and inorganic applications could produce similarly fertile soils as these archaeological Anthrosols. In the first experiment, cowpea (Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp.) was planted in pots, while in the second experiment lysimeters were used to quantify water and nutrient leaching from soil cropped to rice (Oryza sativa L.). The Anthrosol showed significantly higher P, Ca, Mn, and Zn availability than the Ferralsol increasing biomass production of both cowpea and rice by 38-45% without fertilization (P<0.05). The soil N contents were also higher in the Anthrosol but the wide C-to-N ratios due to high soil C contents led to immobilization of N. Despite the generally high nutrient availability, nutrient leaching was minimal in the Anthrosol, providing an explanation for their sustainable fertility. However, when inorganic nutrients were applied to the Anthrosol, nutrient leaching exceeded the one found in the fertilized Ferralsol. Charcoal additions significantly increased plant growth and nutrition. While N availability in the Ferralsol decreased similar to the Anthrosol, uptake of P, K, Ca, Zn, and Cu by the plants increased with higher charcoal additions. Leaching of applied fertilizer N was significantly reduced by charcoal, and Ca and Mg leaching was delayed. In both the Ferralsol with added charcoal and the Anthrosol, nutrient availability was elevated with the exception of N while nutrient leaching was comparatively low.

AB A novel, biocompatible fungicide, CD-2346, was evaluated for management of defoliation associated with greasy spot (Mycosphaerella citri Whiteside) in orange (Citrus sinensis (L.) Osbeck) and grapefruit (Citrus x paradisi Macfad.). This product contains potassium bicarbonate, potassium carbonate. urea, and a surfactant. CD-2346 (7.0 kg/ha) and a half-rate combination of CD-2346 + benomyl (0.55 kg/ha) were compared with a higher rate of benomyl (1.1 kg/ha) and commercial standards of oil (petroleum distillate FC-435-66 [70 to 93.5 liters/ha]) or oil (46.8 liters/ha) + copper sulfate (2.2 to 2.8 kg/ha). Fungicide efficacy was assessed using the area under the defoliation progress curve (AUDPC) and final defoliation in entire trees or final greasy spot severity in individual leaves. All fungicide treatments reduced the AUDPC, and all but benomyl reduced either final defoliation percentage or disease severity in individual leaves. CD-2346 and the reduced-rate combination of CD-2346 + benomyl were generally equal or superior to the full rate of benomyl in decreasing the AUDPC; CD-2346 + benomyl was equivalent to oil in reducing the AUDPC. Oil and CD-2346 treatments similarly reduced final defoliation, but oil + copper sulfate was superior to CD-2346 in reducing the AUDPC and final greasy spot defoliation or severity.

AB Treatment of suspension-cultured cells of rice (Oryza sativa L.) with cell wall extract of rice blast fungus (Magnaporthe grisea ) elicits a rapid generation of H2O2, alkalinization of culture medium, and eventual cell death. To elucidate genes involved in these processes, we exploited SAGE (Serial Analysis of Gene Expression) technique for the molecular analysis of cell death in suspension-cultured cells treated with the elicitor. Among the downregulated genes in the elicitor-treated cells, a BI-1 gene coding for Bax inhibitor was identified. Transgenic rice cells overexpressing Arabidopsis BI-1 gene showed sustainable cell survival when challenged with M. grisea elicitor. Thus, the plant Bax inhibitor plays a functional role in regulating cell death in the rice cell culture system.

AB Innovations in timber construction are relatively rare these days, However, a modest utility building at an open-air museum in Sussex has attracted worldwide attention for the novel features of its double-layer timber gridshell roof Apart from being the first such structure in Britain, it was the first built with 'optimised' green oak, the first designed in accordance with the new timber Eurocode and the first to use a new patented node joint system. it sets a new benchmark for lightweight, sustainable, cost-effective construction.

DT Article
ID AGE
AB Intelligence test's scores decline with age, but such decline change for fluid and crystallized tests. However, little effort has been put to investigate what cognitive abilities are responsible for such decline. The present paper focuses on that issue. A hierarchical factor analysis (performed through the Schmid-Leiman transformation) followed by the method of correlated vectors let us to answer that question. Both procedures were applied to the Spanish standardization sample of the WAIS-III. Results show that g and performance factors are responsible for the decrease on the scores. The verbal factor (Gc) does not account for such decline. Therefore, results draw a more fined-grained view about the Horn's model distinguishing vulnerable and sustainable cognitive abilities.

AB Since the 1980s, decentralisation has become a key development theme in Francophone West Africa for various reasons. Perhaps most significant is the great dissatisfaction with centralised approaches of the past. Despite the heavy interest in decentralisation, however, progress of implementation has been rather slow and problematic. Except in Senegal, decentralisation is a relatively new phenomenon in Francophone West Africa and even there the decentralisation process is far from complete. Other more recently decentralising countries have taken very different paths. Burkina Faso, for example, is gradually phasing in decentralisation in the rural areas, while Mali created local governments across the entire country simultaneously. Such differences in approach can be a justifiable response to variations in the political and social climate across countries. One factor that has been uniformly given inadequate attention in decentralisation efforts is the role of traditional local institutions and how they respond to the introduction of new local institutions. This and other aspects of decentralisation in Francophone West Africa require further careful study if policymakers are to better understand how to design and implement more effective and sustainable decentralised systems.

AB The general capability of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) for monitoring forest ecosystems is well documented. However, the majority of SAR studies of forest dynamics use only imagery acquired by one SAR system and are thus limited to the lifecycle of a particular satellite. The synergistic analysis of SAR data from one of the earliest spaceborne SAR missions, the SEASAT mission, with the Japanese JERS-1 satellite-borne SAR is presented. Biophysical parameters frequently retrieved from SAR are tree biomass using backscatter and tree height from the interferometric phase. One potential application that has not been thoroughly examined is mapping of incremental tree growth from SAR backscatter changes. Tree growth measures biomass changes over time, and is correlated to the amount of carbon sequestered by the trees. This paper examines the retrieval of tree growth from multitemporal spaceborne L-band SAR. A SEASAT SAR image from 1978 and a JERS-1 SAR image from 1997 over Thetford forest, UK are used to retrieve tree growth of Corsican Pine stands. Incremental growth was estimated from the changes in backscatter coefficient, and compared to the expected tree growth from general yield class models used by the UK Forestry Commission. The accuracy of the retrieval algorithm depends on the minimum forest stand size included in the analysis. For managed forest plantations, multitemporal L-band SAR has some potential for detecting incremental biomass to support sustainable forest management. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

AB Background: A previous study in an inner city emergency department (ED) in Baltimore, Maryland, showed a high prevalence of gonorrhea and chlamydia infection among ED patients.
   Goal: The goal was to compare results from an inner city ED to results from an urban ED in Baltimore, in terms of study population and setting, risks for infection, and factors associated with nonparticipation in the study.
   Methods: This was a cross-sectional study of patients aged 14 to 44 years at two EDs. Outcomes for multivariate logistic regression analyses were (1) positive for gonorrhea or chlamydia by urine ligase chain reaction assay and (2) nonparticipation in the study. Comparative analyses were limited to patients aged 18 to 31 years.
   Results: Patients differed significantly between EDs by participation rate, distribution of race/ethnicity, healthcare access, and behavioral risks, although the prevalence of infection did not differ. Risks for infection at the inner city ED were younger age, history of STD, and recent number of sex partners. Risks for infection at the urban ED were female gender and recent number of sex partners. At both EDs, being African American was associated with increased chance of participating, whereas lack of any genitourinary complaint was associated with nonparticipation. At the urban ED, women and patients approached for study enrollment during the day were also less likely to participate.
   Conclusion: ED-based screening for STDs can be an effective intervention for unrecognized infections. However, assessing population characteristics is necessary to develop targeted screening methods and clinical algorithms and to improve participation of patients and program sustainability.

TI International NGOs and primary health care in Mozambique: the need for a
   new model of collaboration

AB In keeping with the neo-liberal emphasis on privatization, international aid has been increasingly channeled through non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and their expatriate technical experts to support primary health care (PHC) in the developing world. Relationships between international aid workers and their local counterparts have thus become critical aspects of PHC and its effectiveness. However, these important social dynamics of PHC remain understudied by social scientists. Based on three years of participant-observation in Mozambique, this paper presents an ethnographic case study of these relationships in one central province. The Mozambique experience reveals that the deluge of NGOs and their expatriate workers over the last decade has fragmented the local health system, undermined local control of health programs, and contributed to growing local social inequality., Since national health system salaries plummeted over the same period as a result of structural adjustment, health workers became vulnerable to financial favors offered by NGOs seeking to promote their projects in turf struggles with other agencies. It is argued that new aid management strategies, while necessary, will not be sufficient to remedy the fragmentation of the health sector. A new model for collaboration between expatriate aid workers and their local counterparts in the developing world is urgently needed that centers on the building of long-term equitable professional relationships in a sustainable adequately funded public sector. The case study presented here illustrates how the NGO model undermines the establishment of these relationships that are so vital to successful development assistance. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

TI Sex/Gender: Which is which? A rejoinder to Mary Riege Laner
SO SOCIOLOGICAL INQUIRY
LA English
DT Article
ID GENDER; SEX
AB This article is a challenge to Mary Riege Laner's exhortation to "Let sex be sex and let gender be gender" as expressed recently in the pages of Sociological Inquiry (Laner 2000, p. 471). I examine the theoretical and linguistic underpinnings of such a view, critique the sex/gender distinction on which it is based, and endorse the maneuvers of a number of poststructuralist thinkers who have sought to problematize that very distinction. I argue instead that the classic sex/gender distinction of second-wave feminism goes wrong on (at least) three counts: (1) it is ahistorical in an area where historical specificity matters; (2) it rests on a simplistic and untenable account of language; (3) the conceptual dichotomy it posits-demarcating gender from sex-is not sustainable and cannot withstand close scrutiny. Finally, I question whether the import of the poststructuralist critique necessitates a move to epistemological and ethical relativism in the field of sex/gender studies.

ID SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
AB This paper suggests ways in which 'the environment' needs to be reconfigured so that it better-resonates with how people are experiencing politics, nature and everyday life. Through empirical research on environmental concerns and everyday practices, this paper sketches a framework through which the values associated with contemporary environmentalism might be,developed in a more reflexive relationship to wider transformations in society. In , particular, the research critically evaluates the standard storyline of a 'global nature' under threat and in need of collective action by a global imagined community. In contrast to rhetorics of the global environment, this paper explores ways in which the environment is being embodied, valued and experienced in an array of social practices. The paper further outlines the significance of such embodied practices as significant yet undervalued points of connection for wider, global environmental issues.

AB Although much of the recent attention on the environmental problems has focused on climatic change, there is also increasing concern that accelerated soil erosion and associated land degradation represent a major problem for sustainable development and environmental protection. There is an urgent need to obtain reliable quantitative data on the extent and rates of soil erosion worldwide to provide a more comprehensive assessment of the magnitude of the problems and to underpin the selection of effective soil conservation measures. The use of environmental radionuclides, in particular Cs-137, affords an effective and valuable means for studying erosion and deposition within the landscape. The key advantage of this approach is that it can provide retrospective information on medium-term (30-40 years) erosion/deposition rates and spatial patterns of soil redistribution, without the need for long-term monitoring programmes. Advantages and limitations of the technique are highlighted. The launching of two closely linked International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) research networked projects in 1996 involving some 25 research groups worldwide has made a major contribution to co-ordinating efforts to refine and to standardise the Cs-137 technique. The efficacy and value of the approach has been demonstrated by investigations in a number of environments. Significant developments that have been made to exploit its application in a wide range of studies are reported in this review paper. Other environmental radionuclides, such as unsupported Pb-210 and Be-7 offer considerable potential for use in soil erosion investigations, both individually and complementary to Cs-137. The IAEA through research networks and other mechanisms is promoting further development and applications of these radionuclides in soil erosion and sedimentation studies for a sustainable resource use and environmental protection.

AB The purpose of this research was to evaluate the applicability of conventional Cs-137 sampling and a simplified approach, for estimating medium-term fillage- and water-induced soil erosion and sedimentation rates on agricultural land in Chile. For this purpose, four study sites under contrasting land use and management were selected in central-south Chile. First, a conventional Cs-137 approach, based on grid sampling was applied, adapting a mass balance conversion model incorporating soil movement by tillage to the site specific conditions of the study region. Secondly, using the same conversion model, the feasibility of estimating soil redistribution rates from measurements of Cs-137 inventories based on composite soil samples taken along contour lines was also tested at all four sites. The redistribution rates associated with tillage and water and the total rates estimated using both methods correlated strongly at all four sites. The conventional method provides more detailed information concerning the redistribution processes operating over the landscape. The simplified method is suitable for assessing soil loss and sediment accumulation in areas exhibiting simple topography and almost similar slopes along the contour lines. Under these conditions, this method permits faster estimation of soil redistribution rates, providing the possibility of estimating soil redistribution rates over larger areas in a shorter time. In order to optimise the costs and benefits of the methods, the sampling and inventory quantification strategy must be selected according to the resolution of the required information, and the scale and complexity of the landscape relief. Higher tillage- and water-induced erosion rates were observed in the annually ploughed cropland sites than in the semi-permanent grassland sites. Subsistence managed crop and grassland sites also show greater erosion effects than the commercially managed sites. The Cs-137 methods used permit discrimination between redistribution rates observed on agricultural land under different land use and management. The Cs-137 technique must be seen as an efficient method for estimating medium-term soil redistribution rates, and for planning soil conservation and sustainable agricultural production under the climatic conditions and the soil type of the region of Chile investigated.

AB The integration of photovoltaic (PV) systems in apartment buildings in a new residential area, Hammarby Sjostad in Stockholm, has been studied using an interdisciplinary approach including e.g. interviews with actors and modelling of PV systems in PVSYST. Four of the ten construction companies represented in the area will install PV systems. The yearly electricity production from these systems has been estimated to be 63 MWh or equal to an electricity demand of 38 (out of 2300) households in the area. Interviews reveal that obstacles for the integration of PV in buildings are e.g. perceived expense and a lack of knowledge. The choice of PV technology is based more on economy, aesthetic appearance, and a wish to demonstrate environmental concern, than on optimal system performance. By integrating renewable energy technologies in the buildings, the construction companies will lay a ground for an ecologically sustainable living, but how these opportunities are utilised by future residents, managers, and caretakers of the buildings will be of decisive importance for the final outcome.

TI The sustainability treaty between the Netherlands and Costa Rica: A new
   perspective on environmental and development cooperation
SO SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB In this article, we analyse a new type of bilateral cooperation aimed at promoting sustainable development. The keystone of this new structure is the sustainability treaty that the Netherlands has arranged with Costa Rica (the statement of intent dates from 1992). This treaty was conceived to assist both countries in their efforts to promote sustainable development through specific measures. The basis for the cooperative effort is a platform of equality, reciprocity and participation. Thus, the treaty fits in with - or may even be seen as a pilot for - a shifting perspective on development cooperation. We conclude that Costa Rica has been engaged in a learning process; this is much less if at all the case in the Netherlands. On the grounds of the analysis, we formulate several conditions for a new. (environmental) development paradigm. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.

TI Minimum requirements for sustainable use of forests in national forest
   programmes. Elements and principles developed for a study of Swiss
   forest policy
SO SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB Both the United Nations Conference on Economic Development in 1992 and the European Union have called for the creation of national forest programmes (NFPs) as a means of ensuring the sustainable development of forests. In recent years, international organizations have also discussed and defined several elements that such NFPs should incorporate. Different concepts prevail, however, and policy experts have not yet reached a uniform and coherent understanding of the concept. In this paper, we develop minimum requirements for a Swiss NFP on the basis of a discussion and comparison of different definitions of NFPs and national environmental plans. We argue that a range of process, content and objective-oriented elements should be included. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.

TI An index of sustainable economic welfare for Poland
SO SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB The index of sustainable economic welfare (ISEW) developed by HE Daly and JB Cobb Jr is an attempt to create a measure of sustainable development. In this paper, we have computed the ISEW for Poland for the years 1980-97.
   It turns out that after some fluctuations in 1980-85, a decline of the index in 1986-90 is observed. The ISEW reached its lowest values in 1989-90. Up to 1995, we can observe a growth dynamic at the beginning and:falling in succeeding years, which eventually shows a tendency back downward that started in 1996.
   It seems that the recent decrease in ISEW can be attributed to categories such as long-term environmental damage, ozone layer depletion, losses caused by commuting and road accidents. Moreover, growing welfare inequalities penalize the value of ISEW in recent years much more significantly than before. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ER P Environment.

TI Lessons in promoting sustainable development in EU structural funds
   programmes
SO SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper assesses and compares the experiences of 12 Objective 1 and 2 regions across the EU which conducted pilot projects on methods of promoting sustainable development by means of Structural Fund programmes. It demonstrates how the regions translated the concept of sustainable development into practical applications that are compatible with structural funding procedures, relevant to the needs of specific programme areas and acceptable to programme partnerships. The paper analyses their experiences in terms of developing new methodologies, redesigning programme objectives, adapting management tools and opening up procedures to greater participation and dialogue. A central argument is that the success of the efforts to promote sustainable development via structural funding depends to a considerable extent on the ability of those involved to address local or regional issues of concern, to build on existing procedures and objectives of programme management and to respect the institutional framework of operation.

TI Factors contributing to calcium oxalate scale at the Simpson Tacoma
   Kraft mill
SO TAPPI JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
AB Simpson Tacoma Kraft Company's bleached kraft pulp mill in Tacoma, Washington, USA, experienced severe calcium oxalate scaling in the D0 stage washer and bleach plant sewer heat exchanger. After removing the calcium oxalate, the mill implemented two process changes to contend with the calcium oxalate: pH control in the D0 stage and a partial re-opening of the counter-current washing strategy. A study was undertaken to determine the relative impact of washing strategy and D0 stage pH on calcium oxalate formation. Extensive testing performed at the mill was used to tune a computer model of the bleach plant. Various operating strategies were simulated and the data were compared to published kraft bleaching filtrate solubility data. We determined that strict countercurrent washing did not cause the calcium oxalate scale outbreak. D0 stage pH also had minimal impact on calcium oxalate precipitation in the washer. It was a factor in the sewer heat exchanger where temperatures are lower. These results allowed the mill to run strict countercurrent washing with more confidence and save 8.6 m(3)/air dried metric tons (150 L/min) of hot water in the bleach plant. The mill has also been able to shorten the list of potential causes of the scale outbreak and believes that good pH control is the key to sustainable operation.

AB Integration of business and technology strategies is an attractive approach for industries in developing countries. However, to be successful, these strategies cannot be implemented according to a company's objectives alone regardless of the involvement of other players. Furthermore, consideration of interrelated technologies should be included if a product resulting from the strategy is expected to perform well and be sustainable. This article attempts to give a broader view of factors to be considered in implementing business technology strategies in developing countries. Supporting evidence is given from the rolling stock industry in Indonesia, which has been implementing a type of business technology strategy. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Postcolonial (in)securities, the BJP and the politics of Hindutva:
   broadening the security paradigm between the realist and
   anti-nuclear/peace groups in India
SO THIRD WORLD QUARTERLY
LA English
DT Article
AB Using the realist and neo-realist theoretical approaches to International Relations, this article will highlight the tensions between the realist and the anti-nuclear/peace movements in India, identify the different perspectives existing within the two groups, and the rationale behind them. Extending the realist and the neo-realist approaches, the article will also analyse how certain postcolonial (in)securities perceived by the current Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government of India, expressed through Hindutva, has further aggravated the tensions between the realist and the anti-nuclear/peace groups. The article suggests that these groups should broaden their interpretation of India's security paradigm and reconfigure the traditional concept of India's national interest along more sustainable lines. Through discursive analysis of the Indian media and journalistic reports, the article will highlight the contradictory viewpoints and nuances involved in the debates between the realist and anti-nuclear movements and will analyse, expose and link their diverse standpoints to substantiate the logic necessitating the redefinition of India's security paradigm. It is suggested that such a redefinition will enable India to view security beyond its traditionally conceived military domain to one also encompassing non-military domains, thereby contributing towards the stability of India's national and, subsequently, South Asian regional, security.

DE globalization; scenarios; transport; spatial organization
AB This article considers the development of the international transport sector based on four globalization scenarios. These four images of the future transportation market are constructed at three different levels (global, European and Dutch). The possible consequences of these scenarios are mapped out not only by key aspects such as modal split and spatial organization but also by providing empirical insights into expected transport flows for both passenger and freight transport in 2020 based on data from 1995.

TI On the estimation of phreatic aquifer parameters by the tidal response
   technique
SO WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT
LA English

   efficiency; tidal fluctuation; tidal response technique
ID NONLINEAR DIFFUSION; COASTAL AQUIFER; FLUCTUATION
AB This paper focuses on the effects of tidal fluctuations on groundwater in the Konan groundwater basin of Japan and the methodology for estimating aquifer parameters by the tidal response technique. The field investigation revealed that the two wells (H-5 and I-2) near the coastline are significantly affected by seawater intrusion, and the water quality is not suitable for most beneficial uses. The tidal cycle further aggravates the groundwater contamination by seawater intrusion into the basin. Using the tidal response model, the aquifer hydraulic conductivity (K) at these two sites is estimated to be 4.5 x 10(-3) and 5.1 x 10(-3) m s(-1), respectively. It was also indicated by the inverse modeling that the tidal fluctuations affect the study area up to about 1 km from the coastline. Further, the tidal efficiency was determined in the range of 20 to 21% at Site I-2 and 38 to 41% at Site H-5. The estimates of the storage coefficient (S) based on the time lag equation were not found reliable for the phreatic aquifer. However, the tidal efficiency-factor equation yielded reliable S estimates in this study. Finally, it is concluded that the tidal response technique is effective and reliable for estimating aquifer parameters in the coastal region, and that the Konan basin must be managed judiciously to ensure sustainable utilization of its vital groundwater resources.

TI Sphagnum in peatlands of Australasia: Their distribution, utilisation
   and management
SO WETLANDS ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
DE Australia; moss harvesting; New Guinea; New Zealand; peat industry; peat
   mining; restoration; sustainability
AB In comparison to the northern hemisphere, Sphagnum peatlands are an unusual and infrequent component of the Australasian landscape. Most peatlands in Australasia are primarily composed of either Restionaceous or Cyperaceous peats. Sphagnum peatlands in Australia and Papua New Guinea/Irian Jaya (now West Papua) are largely located in montane and alpine environments, but also occur down to sea level in New Zealand and as moss patches on some subantarctic islands. Fire is a major determinant of the characteristics of peatlands in Australasia. Peatland management in Australasia is hindered by the need for increased understanding of peatland processes to enable a sustainable balance of conservation of a small resource with localised utilisation. The management focus in Australasia has largely been on ensuring ecologically sustainable Sphagnum moss harvesting, with limited peat mining. We have found that general recovery of Sphagnum after moss harvesting can be enhanced by harvesting larger peatlands, and by leaving one-third of the acrotelm to regenerate. The largest upland peat swamp in mainland Australia, Wingecarribee Swamp, suffered a major collapse in 1998 following peat mining. Environmental and management consequences of this collapse havemajor ramifications for rehabilitation options. Sphagnum peatlands in Australasia are likely to be adversely affected by drainage, burning, grazing, trampling, global warming and peat mining.

TI Peatland restoration: A brief assessment with special reference to
   Sphagnum bogs
SO WETLANDS ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
DE bog; fen; mire; paleoecology; peatland; restoration; Sphagnum
AB Recent literature on peatland restoration indicates as a general goal repairing or rebuilding ecosystems by restoring ecosystem structure, trophic organization, biodiversity, and functions to those characteristic of the type of peatland to which the damaged ecosystem belonged, or at least to an earlier successional stage. Attainment requires provision of an appropriate hydrological regime, manipulating surface topography, improving microclimate, adding appropriate diaspores, manipulating base status where necessary, fertilizing in some cases, excluding inappropriate invaders, adaptively managing through at least one flood/ drought cycle to ensure sustainability, and monitoring on a scale of decades. Several matching conditions favoring or opposing restoration are suggested.
   In the restoration of peatlands, successes have generally been those of short-term repair. Periods of restoration have been much too short to ensure progression to, or even well toward, a fully functional peatland reasonably compatible with the pristine state of similar peatlands elsewhere, although with altered surface patterns.
   Long-term monitoring of peatland-restoration projects is essential for a better understanding of how to carry out such restoration successfully. Paleoecology is suggested as an underutilized tool in peatland restoration.

   model
AB The South African Water Act of 1998 stipulates that future water resource developments should be environmentally sustainable and that a component of the natural flow of rivers should be reserved to ensure some level of ecological functioning. Detailed methods for quantifying the environmental instream flow. requirements of rivers have been available internationally and in South Africa for some time, but the implementation of the new act introduced a degree of urgency and pointed towards the need for rapid, low-confidence assessments that could be used for initial planning. The desktop reserve model was developed to fulfil this requirement, but since its development in 1999 there have been many more detailed IFR determinations. During 2001 the model underwent a complete review based on the results from 97 detailed IFR determinations involving groups of specialists applying the building block methodology (BBM). The paper explains the conceptual links between the,BBM and the model, describes the algorithms that constitute the model and discusses some of the problems associated with developing a model of this type from limited data and limited scientific understanding of the underlying principles. Most of the problems are related to the lack of a consistent understanding of the relationships between hydrological variations and ecological functioning of rivers across a range of river types within a large geographic region (South Africa, for example). The paper indicates that despite these problems the model has found a niche in the water resource management industry within South Africa land has the potential to be improved as our scientific understanding of eco-hydrology improves.

AB Reactive sputtering of dielectrics suffers from an anode problem, which appears when the anode becomes coated with a dielectric layer. A solution to the anode problem is a self-cleaning anode system. It can consist of two anodes and a single magnetron driven by a mid-frequency AC power supply via a center-taped transformer. The anodes are connected to the ends of the secondary coil of the transformer, while the magnetron to its center tap. Such a novel configuration is called dual-anode sputtering system, and has been developed in this work. This configuration creates a self-cleaning regime for both anodes, and provides dynamically cleaned and sustainable anodes. To provide biasing, the substrate holder is connected to the magnetron through a resistor and/or additional floating power supply. Introducing dual anodes does not restrict application of closed-loop control for high rate deposition of transparent and scratch-resistant Al2O3 films. High-rate deposition of dielectrics, using biased dual-anode reactive sputtering, has been proved to be a reliable technology for making dense Al2O3 and other films. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB It is now accepted that investment in health is an important contributor to poverty reduction; however failure to immunise the world's children with readily available life-saving vaccines results in more than 3 million premature deaths annually.
   The Vaccine Fund-a new structural tool with a clear mission "every child every where" and the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI)-a true alliance of all global stakeholders, are working together to build sustainability of immunisation and immunisation capacity in the world's poorest countries.
   Substantial funding for immunisation has been raised but more is needed to complete the task of fully immunising the world's poorest children. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

DT Article
AB The somlata plant (Ephedra gerardiana Wall.) has acquired importance in Indian medicine because it yields alkaloids that are effective in the treatment of asthma and hay fever. Tincture of Ephedra is used for cardiac and circulatory stimulation. Its demand as medicine has intensified the pressure on landscapes hearing this species. This has necessitated bioprospection and active planning to ensure safe conservation of the existing. gene pool and sustainable utilization of this land resource. On account of its importance, an attempt has been made, using remote sensing and geographical information system to identify and map Ephedra-dominant sites. IRS 1C/1D LISS-III false colour composite has been used for stratification of gerardiana bearing landscape in the present study. Test sites were used to evaluate the napping results and promising accuracy has been achieved. The study highlights the possibility of snapping. gerardiana in complex terrain conditions. Through this study it is also emphasized that the methodology can be used for bioprospection of species in the whole Lahul and Spiti district.

AB Marine demosponges (phylum Porifera) are rich sources for potent bioactive compounds. With the establishment of the primmorph system from sponges, especially from Suberites domuncula, the technology to cultivate sponge cells in vitro improved considerably. This progress was possible after the elucidation that sponges are provided with characteristic metazoan cell adhesion receptors and extracellular matrix molecules which allow their cells a positioning in a complex organization pattern. This review summarizes recent data on the cultivation of sponges in aquaria and with main emphasis-of primmorphs in vitro. It is outlined that silicon and Fe(+++) contribute substantially to the formation of larger primmorphs (size of 10 mm) as well as of a canal system in primmorphs; canals are probably required for an improved oxygen and food supply. We conclude that the primmorph system will facilitate a sustainable use of sponges in the production of bioactive compounds; it may furthermore allow new and hitherto not feasible insights into basic questions on the origin of Metazoa.

AB Low native soil nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) availability coupled with their low level of application through fertilizer is a major constraint limiting the productivity of groundnut-based cropping systems in India. We, therefore, evaluated in a 4-year field experiment (1994/1995-1997/1998) the optimum fertilizer-NP schedules for post-rainy season crops and sustainability of groundnut-based cropping systems based on total system productivity (TSP), sustainable yield index (SYI), agronomic efficiency (AE), partial factor productivity (PFP) and soil organic carbon (SOC). One fallow treatment was maintained for comparison. The treatments comprised two rainy season treatments (groundnut and fallow) and five post-rainy season crops (wheat, mustard, chickpea, sunflower and summer groundnut), each crop being tested at four nitrogen and phosphorus levels (0, 50, 100 and 150% recommended NP). The economic optimum NP (kg ha(-1)) rates of post-rainy season crops estimated from response curves were 203.2 (N = 155.9, P = 47.3) and 188.5 (N = 145.0, P = 43.5) for wheat; 68.5 (N = 42.5, P = 26.0) and 66.3 (N = 41.4, P = 24.9) for mustard; 28.7 (N = 15.1, P = 13.6) and 26.2 (N = 13.8, P = 12.4) for chickpea; 68.6 (N = 47.3, P = 21.3) and 52.0 (N = 35.9, P = 16.1) for sunflower; 68.5 (N = 36.8, P = 31.7) and 55.1 (N = 29.6, P = 25.5) for summer groundnut in groundnut and fallow-based systems, respectively. The TSP was 128.8% higher in groundnut-based than in fallow-based systems and was in the order, groundnut-groundnut (2.43 t ha(-1)) > groundnut-chickpea (2.23 t ha(-1)) > groundnut-wheat (1.96 t ha(-1)) > groundnut-mustard ( 1.90 t ha(-1)) > groundnut-sunflower (1.78 t ha(-1)). The SYI was greater in groundnut-groundnut (0.673) and low was in the groundnut-mustard (0.376) system. Values of AE for N (AE(N)) and P (AE(P)), and PFP for N (PFPN) and P (PFPP) were greater in summer groundnut. The SYI increased significantly due to 100% NP level, whereas AE(N), AE(P), PFPN and PFPP were greater at 50% NP level than at 100% NP level. The SOC declined in all the treatments after 4 years except in wheat plots. The available P status of soil showed a significant build up due to continuous application of fertilizer NP. Groundnut-groundnut and groundnut-wheat systems were found to be productive and sustainable cropping systems as these had greater TSP, SYI and highly significant effect of SOC on yield (R-2 = 0.92 and 0.86, respectively, *P < 0.05).

AB Durum wheat cropping in semi-arid areas of West Asia and North Africa is frequently integrated into a cereal-livestock farming system. The wheat straw, mostly used for feeding animals, represents an important commodity, its average sale price per unit weight being not less than 40% of that of grain in three recently surveyed areas. There is uncertainty whether the widespread, short-statured wheat plant type could be economically preferable in these environments relative to a tall type, especially when considering straw yield. Within the Mediterranean durum wheat gene pool, mediterraneum typicum germplasm possesses a markedly tall stature, implying high straw yield. In a first phase of evaluation under prevailing conditions of northern Syria, 13 entries characterized by early heading and good agronomic performance were identified from a collection of about 2000 Tunisian and Algerian accessions. In a second phase reported here, these entries were evaluated in relation to two widely grown adapted cultivars, i.e., the semi-dwarf variety 'Cham 1' and the local landrace 'Haurani', across four environments of northern Syria diversified for rainfall and soil characteristics. In an economic assessment, the straw value was expressed in terms of grain-equivalent, defining an economic yield as: grain yield + (0.40 x straw yield). Compared with the control cultivars, the mediterraneum typicum entries were taller but tended to later heading with a similar grain filling duration. However, a few entries as early as the controls were also found. Almost all exotic entries outperformed 'Haurani' for economic yield. Two entries showed significantly higher (P < 0.05) economic yield (> 12%) and aerial biomass across environments than 'Cham 1', owing to higher straw yield and similar grain. yield. They compensated for the relatively lower spike fertility by heavier kernels. Genotype x environment interactions were generally limited for yield-related traits. Straw yield was closely associated with plant height (r = 0.76, P < 0.001) but not with number of fertile tillers. No trade-off between grain and straw yields was apparent. The results support the interest of a tall durum wheat plant type derived from the mediterraneum typicum gene pool for enhancing the profitability as well as the sustainability of semi-arid Mediterranean farming systems.

AB The profitability of uncontrolled logging can be a significant obstacle to sustainable forest management, especially in the tropics. Rice et al. [Scientific American 273 (1997) 34] have argued that not only does traditional selective logging provide higher returns but also incurs less damage to forests than sustainable forest management systems that involve harvesting of many species and the creation of large gaps in the forest canopy to foster regeneration of light-demanding species. They claimed that protected areas were the only viable way to conserve forest ecosystems and proposed that loggers be allowed to log forests selectively once, after which the forests should become parks. Here, we respond to the challenge posed by Rice et al. by exhaustively reviewing the evidence regarding the viability and desirability of sustainable forest management in the tropics. Following Rice et al., we use the term conventional timber harvesting to refer to existing practice, which typically pays little attention to maintaining long-term timber supply. Sustainable timber management implies taking steps to ensure forests continue to produce timber in the longer-term, while maintaining the full complement of environmental services and non-timber products of the forest.
   Empirical studies tend to confirm the conclusion of (Rice et al. [Scientific American 273 (1997) 34]) that although sustainable timber management sometimes provides reasonable rates of return, conventional timber harvesting is generally more profitable. This implies that without additional incentives, one cannot expect companies to adopt sustainable management. The shortsightedness of many loggers, the slow rise in international timber prices, political uncertainty, and tenure insecurity simply reinforce this tendency. However, we reject the claim that sustainable timber management generally damages forests more than conventional logging. Rice et al. base their conclusion largely on the particular case of mahogany extraction in Bolivia, and even there it may not hold. In many cases, sustainable timber management performs better in terms of carbon storage and bio-diversity conservation than conventional logging approaches, as well as producing more timber. If new carbon markets emerge, sustainable forest management might compete effectively with conventional timber harvesting. Timber certification systems may also provide a sufficient incentive for sustainable forest management in certain circumstances. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Nesting habits of highly social stingless bees (Meliponini) were studied in lowland dipterocarp forests in Sabah, Borneo. A total of 275 nests of 12 species of bees were located. All nests were closely associated with living (91.5%) or dead (8.5%) trees, either within pre-formed cavities in the trunk (cavity nests) or situated in or under the tree base (base nests). Species of bees differed in nesting habit. The majority of species (seven) were cavity nesters, but the majority of nests (81%) were base nests. Nests were often aggregated (mean of 1.94 nests/nest tree), with up to eight colonies and three species in a single tree. Nest trees were mostly large to very large (86.1% above 60 cm dbh) commercial timber trees; 47.3% of nest trees were dipterocarps. According to visual inspection nest trees were of significantly lower expected timber quality then randomly chosen control trees. Taking into account information on tree species, size and expected timber quality, we estimated that 34.0 or 42.6% of nest trees were potential harvest trees, depending on harvesting regulations (reduced impact logging (RIL) versus conventional). Lower percentages under RIL guidelines were mostly due to size restrictions that protect very large trees (>120 cm dbh). Harvesting is likely to kill bee colonies associated with the respective tree. Therefore, and because meliponine colonies are long-lived and have low fecundity, direct impact from logging may have lasting effects on bee populations. Harvesting guidelines that retain high proportions of large and hollow trees should be promoted in order to preserve meliponine pollination in sustainable forest management.

AB Catalysis is a key technology to achieve the objectives of sustainable (green) chemistry. After introducing the concepts of sustainable (green) chemistry and a brief assessment of new sustainable chemical technologies, the relationship between catalysis and sustainable (green) chemistry is discussed and illustrated via an analysis of some selected and relevant examples. Emphasis is also given to the concept of catalytic technologies for scaling-down chemical processes, in order to develop sustainable production processes which reduce the impact on the environment to an acceptable level that allows self-depuration processes of the living environment.

AB The man-made orbital debris population is growing rapidly, dominating the meteoroid environment in all but the micrometre size range. Of most concern are objects between 1 cm and 10 cm, referred to as the lethal population as they cannot be tracked or catalogued and can cause catastrophic damage when colliding with a satellite. In order to address this problem, a series of mitigation measures have been identified to protect spacecraft from the existing debris population, and to minimize the future growth of objects in orbit. This paper outlines the current status of the environment and discusses some of the measures proposed.

AB Freshwater availability has been recognized as a global issue, and its consistent quantification not only in individual river basins but also at the global scale is required to support the sustainable use of water. The WaterGAP Global Hydrology Model WGHM, which is a submodel of the global water use and availability model WaterGAP 2, computes surface runoff, groundwater recharge and river discharge at a spatial resolution of 0.5degrees. WGHM is based on the best global data sets currently available, and simulates the reduction of river discharge by human water consumption. In order to obtain a reliable estimate of water availability, it is tuned against observed discharge at 724 gauging stations, which represent 50% of the global land area and 70% of the actively discharging area. For 50% of these stations, the tuning of one model parameter was sufficient to achieve that simulated and observed long-term average discharges agree within 1%. For the rest, however, additional corrections had to be applied to the simulated runoff and discharge values. WGHM not only computes the long-term average water resources of a country or a drainage basin but also water availability indicators that take into account the interannual and seasonal variability of runoff and discharge. The reliability of the modeling results is assessed by comparing observed and simulated discharges at the tuning stations and at selected other stations. The comparison shows that WGHM is able to calculate reliable and meaningful indicators of water availability at a high spatial resolution. In particular, the 90% reliable monthly discharge is simulated well. Therefore, WGHM is suited for application in global assessments related to water security, food security and freshwater ecosystems. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Phytoremediation, the use of plants and their associated microbes to accumulate, detoxify and/or stabilise contaminants, is an environment-friendly and sustainable means of remediating contaminated soil and water. Phytoremediation has been an important aspect of constructed wetlands, which have been used successfully to detoxify large volumes of wastewater with dilute concentrations of contaminants. The usefulness of phytoremediation appears to extend to a wide variety of contaminants, and a recent study demonstrated its possible application for selenocyanate. Genetic engineering approaches are currently being used to optimise the metabolic and physiological processes that enable plants to phytoremediate sites contaminated with heavy metals and metalloids. Over-expressing enzymes catalysing rate-limiting steps in the sulphate assimilation and phytochelatin synthesis pathways has been shown to confer increased tolerance to and the ability to accumulate higher concentrations of selenium and cadmium, respectively. Recent research in our laboratory is aimed at determining the regulatory genes involved in heavy metal accumulation and detoxification in hyperaccumulating plants that could then be transferred to fast-growing, high biomass plant species for phytoremediation. Microbes isolated from highly contaminated environments represent another potentially huge reservoir of new genes and unique metabolic capabilities that could be transferred to plants to enhance their phytoremediation potential.

We propose a realistic and sustainable approach called Active Logistical Cache as a framework to support an efficient caching of multimedia streaming inside the Internet. The approach is based on active networking support (dynamicity, new services and protocols) merged with logistical storage. The tools proposed are the Tamanoir(1) execution environment combined with the Internet Back-plane Protocol middleware. By describing a scenario, we illustrate the realistic potential of this approach.

AB We control a population of interacting software agents. The agents have a strategy, and receive a payoff for executing that strategy. Unsuccessful agents become extinct. We investigate the repercussions of maintaining a diversity of agents. There is often no economic rationale for this. If maintaining diversity is to be successful, i.e. without lowering too much the payoff for the non-endangered strategies, it has to go on forever, because the non-endangered strategies still get a good payoff, so that they continue to thrive, and continue to endanger the endangered strategies. This is not sustainable if the number of endangered ones is of the same order as the number of non-endangered ones. We also discuss niches, islands. Finally, we combine learning as adaptation of individual agents with learning via selection in a population.

AB The fundamental policy and regulatory framework for a post-apartheid dispensation to manage commercial fisheries in South Africa was put in place with the publication of the White Paper on Marine Fisheries Policy in 1997, and the enactment of the Marine Living Resources Act (MLRA) in 1998. In order to achieve equity within the fishing industry, a way had to be found to address the under-representation of historically disadvantaged individuals or companies. This presented a massive challenge to a government department that was, at the time, ill-equipped to implement the MLRA. Inadequate administrative capacity in the department, together with major new responsibilities, resulted in a virtually permanent state of crisis management, which was complicated by a system of annual fights allocations. A strategy for building a rational, legally defensible and transparent allocation system that met critical transformation targets was initiated in 2000. The new, medium-term rights-allocation system contains a number of key features designed to ensure a fair and equitable process. The allocation of fishing rights in 2001/2002 yielded mixed results in terms of meeting transformation targets, emphasizing once more that transformation is a complex process that can only be achieved over a period of time. Management interventions to optimize the potential social and economic benefits of marine resources continue to be constrained, primarily by institutional capacity. The challenge to government, the private sector and civil society is to build a partnership based on the three pillars of the MLRA: equity, economic efficiency and sustainability.

AB When a proposal was advanced in 1991 to harvest the wedge clam Donax serra in the Eastern Cape, South Africa, for commercial gain, it elicited a huge public outcry. In order to shed light on the issue, a social cost-benefit analysis (CBA), based on a biologically sustainable extraction rate of 100 ton of clams per year, was carried out on its commercial exploitation. Because fishery activities might exact a price on society in the form of negatively altering the quality of people's recreation experience in the area, as well as damage the aesthetic and ecological attributes of the beach system, such external effects were identified and valuated. Results from the CBA yielded positive net present values (NPVs) for project options involving live clams being sold on the export market (to Hong Kong) for R24.70 kg(-1) and negative NPVs for domestic market options (Johannesburg and Cape Town), where the clam would be sold for R6.50 kg(-1). Assuming a discount rate of 8%, the highest NPV was obtained for the scenario in which total production was sold on the foreign market and the firm rented facilities of an existing organization. The external cost was the single largest component of the cost of the fishery. The conclusion drawn is that the social benefit of the project exceeds the social cost - a conclusion which supports commercial exploitation of clam stocks along the St Francis Bay beach, but one which does not include the costs associated with policing.

AB Assessment of the status of southern bluefin tuna (SBT) by Australia and Japan has used a method (ADAPT) that imposes a number of structural restrictions. and is similar to methods used for a number of stocks worldwide. A flexible method for assessment of the SBT population is presented that is much less restrictive and has potentially wide applicability. The three key features are: (1) all fitting to data is within the context of maximum likelihood, (2) catch-at-age data are not assumed to be without error (as in existing methods), but rather to be random variables, while age-specific selectivity is allowed to change over time within the bounds of specific structure, and (3) autocorrelation in recruitment processes is considered within the likelihood framework of the model. While the results suggest the stock has been depleted considerably from it, virgin biomass, and are generally consistent with previous assessments, they also indicate that it is not as much below the biomass that will produce maximum suitable yield as previously estimated and that the extent of stock rebuilding necessary may not be as large as has been argued. The available data are shown to provide little information on the steepness parameter of the stock-recruitment function, and hence on sustainable catch levels for the stock.

AB Under-reporting of fishery catches can severely affect the precision of stock assessment estimates, which require accurate information on catch and catch rate. Under-reporting of catches of South Coast rock lobster Palinurus gilchristi over the past decade was estimated from verified daily catch rates and the number of days spent at sea by the commercial fleet. The malpractice increased sharply between the 1997/98 and 2000/01 fishing seasons. The index of abundance for the resource (standardized catch per unit effort) increased by 2% for 1998/99, 12% for 1999/00 and 14% for 2000/01, after eliminating under-reported information from the input data. An age-structured production model, with the adjusted abundance index as an input, and including known and estimated over-catches between 1991/92 and 2000/01, increased the maximum sustainable yield estimate from 360 to 390 tons tail mass. The Total Allowable Catch (TAC) management regulation that was historically used in the fishery failed to address over-harvesting as a result of poor compliance. A combined TAC and Total Allowable Effort management strategy was introduced in 2000/01 to restrict fishing effort (days at sea) on the basis of quota size and vessel efficiency. Changes in management strategy, which include cancellation of the license of a fishing company responsible for systematic under-reporting and over-harvesting, decrease in fishing effort, reduction in over-capacity of vessels and other infrastructure and stabilization of trap catch rates have improved the outlook for the fishery.

AB Objective: to define with a simple test the power sustainable by older people during everyday occupations.
   Methods: nine healthy subjects (65-71 years) performed two series of 5-6 trials on bicycle and arm ergometers at constant power. Throughout the exercise they reported their evaluation of the effort, referred either to perceived whole body exertion or to the working muscles, using Borg's category-ratio, CR10, scale. The exercise was interrupted when CR7 was attained. From a linear regression of the individual data of the work done from the start of each trial to the transition from CR4 to CR5, corresponding to 'somewhat heavy' and 'heavy', and the corresponding duration it was possible to calculate the slope of the work/time relationship. This was considered as the value of power sustainable for leg or arm muscles.
   Results: on average the sustainable power for the work done on the bicycle ergometer represented 55% of the maximal mechanical power. During the control trial on the bicycle ergometer at a power corresponding to their sustainable power the subjects were able to exercise for 30 min without symptoms of fatigue or discomfort, with an average CR of 3. The average heart rate was 114 bpm and the blood lactate concentration at the end of the exercise was always lower than 4 mmol/l. Sustainable power calculated for the arm muscles was about one quarter that of the leg muscles, but all subjects reported the evaluation of the effort as more difficult.
   Conclusion: the determination of power sustainable for the leg muscles with this simple test appears reliable and accurate.

AB The native reserves of phosphorus (P) in Finnish soils are sizeable but poorly available to plants. The P status has been generally poor, but large rates of P applied since the 1940s have substantially enhanced the supply of P from the soil. As a means of optimising P fertilisation of crops grown in the improved soils and promoting agro-environmental sustainability of agriculture, long-term field experiments were established in 1977-1981 on various soil types around Finland, between the latitudes of 60 and 65 N. The experimental sites (8 Cambisols, 9 Regosols, 6 Histosols, 1 Podsol) were moderately acidic (pH(w) 5.6, range 4.6-6.6) and contained 1.6-31.2% organic C, and (mineral soils) 3-74% clay. The concentration of total P was 1.22 (0.66-1.87) g kg(-1), and the inorganic fraction separated with fluoride and hydroxide extractions (AI,Fe-P) was 8.2% (4.5-12.4%) of oxalate extractable Al+Fe (P saturation index). In mineral topsoil the pool of AI,Fe-P was 850 kg ha(-1), which is 300 kg ha(-1) larger than was obtained in the early 1960s and 600 kg ha(-1) larger than found in virgin soils. The soil test P value was 13.1 (3.7-60) mg dm(-3) by the acid ammonium acetate method, 11.5 (1.6-42) mg dm(-3) by a water extraction method (1:60 v/v) and 61 (23-131) mg kg(-1) with a modified Olsen method. The intensity factor of soil P status has remained at a relatively low level in a major part of the cultivated area.

AB Water containing high concentrations of nitrate is unfit for human consumption and, if discharging to freshwater or marine habitats, can contribute to algal blooms and eutrophication. Nitrate pollution of groundwaters in coastal Northeastern Australia is of particular concern because of its proximity to environmentally sensitive areas (e.g. the Great Barrier Reef) and the large number of people (in cities and rural areas) relying on groundwaters for drinking water. This study determined the extent of nitrate contamination in groundwater in this region based on information from 1454 wells, and examined the likely source of the nitrate by comparing delta(15)N values of groundwaters to those of possible industrial or organic nitrogen contaminants. In wells where nitrate concentrations were elevated, and therefore, likely to be a result of human activities, concentrations were subsequently monitored to provide an assessment of temporal trends in nitrate concentrations. Overall, groundwaters were relatively free from excessive nitrate contamination, with nitrate concentrations in only 3% of wells above the maximum permissible limit for drinking water (50 mg/1). However, a further 11% had elevated nitrate concentrations (greater than or equal to20 mg/1) with the greatest occurrence (14-21% of wells affected) of elevated nitrate concentrations in the Burdekin, Mackay and Bundaberg areas. These percentages are similar to those found in many other intensive agricultural areas. Nitrate in approximately half of these wells was likely to have come directly from fertilizer. Nitrate in only eight wells was likely to have come from organic sources, such as sewage, septic or feedlot overflows. Nitrate in the remaining wells could not be attributed to a particular source. Thus, improvement of nitrogen fertilizer management practices is a key activity in managing groundwater nitrate concentrations. In the Burdekin and Mackay areas, there was no general trend in groundwater nitrate concentrations over 2 years of monitoring of wells with initial nitrate concentrations >20 mg/l. However, there was considerable variability within wells between sampling times and further monitoring is required. In Bundaberg, nitrate concentrations in 40% of wells significantly declined over 6 years (1993-1999) of regular monitoring. The results for this area suggest that nitrogen fertilizer inputs during the monitoring period were not excessive relative to the local aquifer's nitrogen balance. The opportunities for improved management of nitrogen fertilizer in the study region are discussed. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Livestock manure contains considerable salt and continued application to agricultural land may result in an accumulation of salt in soil. This study reports on the impact of 25 annual cattle feedlot manure applications on soil salinity and soluble salt content and composition of a clay loam soil in the semi-arid region of southern Alberta, Canada. Cattle manure has been applied at rates of 0, 30, 60 and 90 Mg ha(-1) per year under non-irrigated and at 0, 60, 120 and 180 Mg ha(-1) per year under irrigated conditions each fall since 1973. Soil salinity was assessed in the fall each year before manure application by examining the electrical conductivity (EC) using saturated paste extraction methods. The soluble ions, sodium adsorption ratio (SAR) and potassium adsorption ratio (PAR) were also determined each year. Soil EC values increased with the cumulative amount of manure used over the years and the increases were greater under non-irrigated than irrigated conditions. For every tonne of salt applied through the cattle manure, the average soil EC (0-150 cm) increased by 0.1108 dS m(-1) under non-irrigated conditions. The soluble Na+, K+, Mg2+ Cl-, HCO3-, SAR and PAR all increased with the cattle manure application and the increases were greater under non-irrigated than irrigated conditions. On the other hand, under both conditions, Ca2+ decreased in surface soil (0-15 cm) but increased at depths below 30 cut. The K+ ions became the dominant cation in manured surface soil. The increases in EC and soluble ions were lower under irrigation due to greater downward movement. High rates of manure application are not sustainable because they lead to soil salinization under non-irrigated conditions and leaching losses of soluble salts that could potentially pollute groundwater under irrigated conditions.

AB This paper summarizes several studies on N recycling in a tropical silvopastoral system for assessing the ability of the system to increase soil fertility and insure sustainability. We analyzed the N-2 fixation pattern of the woody legume component (Gliricidia sepium), estimated the recycling rate of the fixed N in the soil, and measured N outputs in tree pruning and cut grass (Dichanthium aristatum). With this information, we estimated the N balance of the silvopastoral system at the plot scale. The studies were conducted in an 11-year-old silvopastoral plot established by planting G. sepium cuttings at 0.3 m x 2 m spacing in natural grassland. The plot was managed as a cut-and-carry system where all the tree pruning residues (every 2-4 months) and cut grass (every 40-50 days) were removed and animals were excluded. No N fertilizer was applied. Dinitrogen fixation, as estimated by the 15N natural abundance method, ranged from 60-90% of the total N in aboveground tree biomass depending on season. On average, 76% of the N exports from the plot in tree pruning (194 kg [N] ha(-1) yr(-1)) originated from N-2 fixation. Grass production averaged 13 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1) and N export in cut grass was 195 kg [N] ha(-1) yr(-1). The total N fixed by G. sepium, as estimated from the tree and grass N exports and the increase in soil N content, was about 555 kg [N] ha(-1) yr(-1). Carbon sequestration averaged 1.9 Mg [C] ha(-1) yr(-1) and soil organic N in the 0-0.2 m layer increased at a rate of 166 kg [N] ha(-1) yr(-1), corresponding to 30% of N-2 fixation by the tree. Nitrogen released in nodule turnover ( < 10 kg [N] ha(-1) yr(-1)) and litter decomposition (< 40 kg [N] ha(-1) yr(-1)) contributed slightly to this increase, and most of the recycled N came from the turnover or the activity of other below-ground tree biomass than nodules.

AB In the subsistence-agricultural region of eastern Zambia, less than 10% of the households have adequate supply of maize (Zea mays L.), the staple food, throughout the year. A major constraint to increasing crop production in the region is poor fertility status of the soil. In order to address this problem, improved fallow has been introduced as a technology for improving soil fertility within a short span of two to three years. Farmers have been testing the technology and a number of empirical studies have been undertaken over the years to identify the factors influencing farmers' decision to adopt the technology. This paper presents a synthesis of the results of adoption studies and highlights generic issues on the adoption of improved fallows in Zambia. The synthesis indicates that farmers' decision on technology adoption does not have a simple directed relationship of some technological characteristics only, but constitutes a matrix of factors including household characteristics, community level factors, socioeconomic constraints and incentives that farmers face, access to information, local institutional arrangements and macro policies on agriculture. The adoption of improved fallows is not strictly speaking a binary choice problem but a continuous process in which farmers occupy a position along a continuum in the adoption path. Further, adoption of improved fallows may not take place in a policy vacuum but needs to be facilitated by appropriate and conducive policy and institutional incentives. Several questions and issues that require further study emerge from the synthesis. These include determination of the relative importance of the factors in the adoption matrix, identification of the conditions under which farmers use a combination of inputs and their profitability under changing price scenarios, exact definition to delineate between 'non-adopters', 'testers' and 'adopters' of agroforestry technologies, and understanding the impact of cash crop farming in farmers' adoption decisions of improved fallows ( where off farm opportunities exist). Further, there is a need to determine the inter-relationship between household poverty, labor availability and the adoption of improved fallows and, to evaluate a combination of policy interventions at both national and local level to promote the adoption of agroforestry-based soil fertility management.

AB Little information is available on soil respiration and microbial biomass in soils under agroforestry systems. We measured soil respiration rate and microbial biomass under two age classes (young and old) of a pecan (Carya illinoinensis) - cotton (Gossypium hirsutum) alley cropping system, two age classes of pecan orchards, and a cotton monoculture on a well-drained, Redbay sandy loam (a fine-loamy, siliceous, thermic Rhodic Paleudult) in southern USA. Soil respiration was quantified monthly during the growing season from May to November 2001 using the soda-lime technique and was corrected based on infrared gas analyzer (IRGA) measurements. The overall soil respiration rates ranged from 177 to 776 mg CO2 m(-2) h(-1). During the growing season, soil respiration was higher in the old alley cropping system than in the young alley cropping system, the old pecan orchard, the young pecan orchard, and the monoculture. Microbial biomass C was higher in the old alley cropping system (375 mg C kg(-1)) and in the old pecan orchard (376 mg C kg(-1)) compared to the young alley cropping system (118 mg C kg(-1)), young pecan orchard (88 mg C kg(-1)), and the cotton monoculture (163 mg C kg(-1)). Soil respiration was correlated positively with soil temperature, microbial biomass, organic matter, and fine root biomass. The effect of alley cropping on soil properties during the brief history of alley cropping was not significant except in the old systems, where there was a trend of increasing soil respiration with short- term alley cropping. Over time, different land use and management practices influenced soil properties such as soil temperature, moisture, microbial biomass, organic matter, and fine root biomass, which in turn affected the magnitude of soil respiration. Our results suggest that trees in agroforestry systems have the potential to enhance soil fertility and sustainability of farmlands by improving soil microbial activity and accreting residual soil carbon.

AB Domestication of Irvingia gabonensis, a fruit tree grown in agroforestry systems in West and Central Africa, offers considerable scope for enhancing the nutritional and economic security of subsistence farmers in the region. Assessments of phenotypic variation in ten fruit, nut and kernel traits were made on twenty-four ripe fruits from 100 Irvingia gabonensis trees in Ugwuaji village in southeast Nigeria, a center of genetic diversity for this species. There were important differences between the young planted trees of this study and the older unplanted trees of a similar study in Cameroon. Significant and continuous tree-to-tree variation was found in fruit mass (69.0-419.8 g), flesh mass (59.5-388.8 g), nut mass (9.5-40.6 g), shell mass (4.9-30.9 g) and kernel mass (0.4-17.58 g); fruit length (49.2-89.3 mm) and width (46.2-100.5 mm) and flesh depth (12.9-31.4 mm), as well as considerable variation in flesh colour, skin colour, fruit taste and fibrosity. Some fruits were considerably bigger than those found in Cameroon. These quantitative results will help in the development of cultivars within participatory approaches to agroforestry tree domestication, and so promote poverty alleviation and sustainable agriculture.

AB Pruning of agroforestry trees, while reducing shade of the crops, usually reduces both biomass production and nitrogen fixation. Short pruning cycles are often not sustainable on the long run, because tree production declines over subsequent pruning cycles. We compared biomass and labile carbohydrate dynamics of Erythrina lanceolata Standley (Papilionaceae) shade trees under total and partial pruning regimes in a vanilla ( Vanilla planifolia L.) plantation in South-western Costa Rica. The highest biomass production was measured in the unpruned control, followed by trees with 50% of the leaf pruned every three months, while total pruning every six months resulted in the lowest biomass pruduction. In the more productive treatments, a higher proportion of the production was in branches. Because, the N content of woody branches was high, they were important for nitrogen cycling. In the partial pruning treatment more nitrogen was returned to the soil from litter and woody branches than from pruned leaf. Sugar concentrations were not different between treatments and the dynamics of non-structural carbohydrates ( sugar and starch) seems to depend more on plant phenology than pruning treatment. However, the starch concentrations in the total pruning were lower than in the other treatments.

AB Web based teaming provides an unprecedented flexibility and convenience to both learners and instructors. However, it also creates a great number of lonely learners. Hence, there is an urgent need for finding an efficient way to help the learners share their teaming experiences and exchange their learning materials during the teaming process. This paper reports on an attempt to construct a flexible and effective self-organization system that groups similar learners according to their preferences and learning behaviors. We use a multi-agent mechanism to manage and organize learners and learner groups. Furthermore, we present effective award and exchange algorithms, so eventually learners with similar preferences or interests can be clustered into the same community. Experiments based on real learner data have shown that this mechanism can organize learners properly, and has sustainably improved speed and efficiency of searches for peer students owning relevant knowledge resources.

AB Sunflower is an annual dicotyledonous plant, herbaceous, erect and native of North America. It is thermo- and photo-insensitive, hence, can be grown round the year in sub-tropical and tropical countries. Only two spp. H. annuus and H. tuberosum are cultivated for food, remaining spp. are ornamentals, weeds and wild plants. However, H. annuus is allelopathic and inhibit the growth and development of other plants thus reducing their productivity. Much information is available about the allelopathic effects of sunflower crop on following crops in crop rotations. Although it is harmful to all crops, but, is less harmful to crops of Graminae family than other families. It seems that the harmful effects of sunflower in crop rotations are due to release and accumulation of root exudates during crop growth in soil. Soil incorporation of its fresh (green manure) or dry biomass in soil is inhibitory to both crops and weed spp. Several allelochemicals have been characterized from the H. annuus, which inhibit the seed germination and seedling growth of A. albus, A. viridis, Agropyron repens (Elymus repens), Ambrosia artemsiifolia, Avena fatua, Celosia crustata, Chenopodium album, Chloris barbara, Cynodon dactylon, D. sanguinalis, Dactyloctenium ageyptium, Digitaria ciliaris, Echinochloa crus-galli, Flaveria australasica, Parthenium hysterophorus, Portulaca oleracea, Sida spinosa, Trianthema portulacastrum, Veronica perisca The inhibitory effects of this crop may be used for weed management with less herbicides for sustainable agriculture.

AB Self-sterile Coffea canephora and self-fertile C arabica are important cash crops in many tropical countries. We examined the relative importance of insect, wind, and spontaneous self-pollination and the degree of self-fertility of these two coffee species in 24 agroforestry coffee fields in Indonesia. In both species, open pollination and cross pollination by hand led to the highest fruit set. Wind pollination (including self-pollination) led to 16% lower fruit set than open pollination in C canephora and to 12.3% lower fruit set in C. arabica. Self-pollinated flowers and unmanipulated controls achieved an extremely low fruit set of. 10% or less in the self-sterile species, and of 60% and 48%, respectively in the self-fertile species. These results constitute experimental evidence that cross pollination by bees causes a significant increase in fruit set of not only the self-sterile, but also the self-fertile coffee species. The practical implication is that coffee yield may be improved by managing fields for increased flower visitation by bees.

ID RISK REDUCTION; PROJECT; PREVENTION
AB Purpose. Coalitions can be a successful way to promote healthy initiatives throughout a community. To properly measure the success of coalition-based interventions, it is important to conduct a Process evaluation of coalition activities and establish a system for evaluating outcomes. This article describes a process evaluation of a monitoring and feedback system for community coalitions targeting chronic disease risk reduction.
   Methods. Community coalitions in six rural, southeast Missouri counties collaborated with the Missouri Department of Health and Saint Louis University to track coalition events using the process described in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention manual Evaluating Community Efforts to Prevent Cardiovascular Diseases.
   Summary. First, we describe the methodology used to monitor monthly activities and to evaluate satisfaction with the process. Next, we discuss the data that resulted from the monitoring system and interviews with recorders. Third, we discuss changes made to the monitoring system and lessons learned along the way. Finally, we end with recommendations for incorporating this monitoring system in community practice.
   Conclusions. When used properly, this system is an effective way of evaluating and promoting sustainability of community interventions.

AB Over the last 30 years, there has been an epidemic of the white potato cyst nematode (wPCN, Globodera pallida). It has progressively replaced the yellow species (yPCN, G rostochiensis) throughout most of England and Wales and is now a widespread problem. As damaging populations of wPCN are enormous (> 10(9) eggs ha(-1)), several crops of potato cultivars resistant only to yPCN were required to produce this change. The threat it poses is reflected in an increase in the numbers of soil samples being tested and in nematicide use, which has increased to > 25 000 ha of potatoes being treated annually. Computer modelling shows that current management of wPCN is mostly ineffective and populations will continue to increase. The multiplication rate of wPCN is inversely related to its population density at planting and, because of this, modelling shows that sufficient eggs are likely to survive to enable large populations of wPCN to "rebound" following nematicide treatment. This is supported by recent trial results showing that wPCN population increase was almost as great in nematicides-treated plots as in the untreated. Modelling also showed that current rotations (typically potatoes once every 5 or 6 years) are too short to prevent wPCN populations from progressively increasing, even when used in conjunction with a nematicide. Similarly, except with avirulent populations, the partially resistant cultivars currently available will not prevent wPCN from increasing. However, as the effectiveness of partially resistant cultivars is independent of population density, they can be very effective when integrated with a nematicide. Unfortunately, only c. 8% of the potato area is planted with partially resistant cultivars, and much of that is in land not known to be infested with wPCN. Consequently, the current epidemic of wPCN is likely to become progressively more serious. However, many farmers are failing to recognise and respond to this threat until it is too late because of the slow rate of increase of wPCN, the difficulties of detecting small populations and the costs of nematicides. To respond to the current epidemic of wPCN, the greatest priority is to have available an increased number of commercially-attractive partially resistant cultivars.

AB This paper details practical, engineering based solutions for the reliability engineer and logistician. It focuses chiefly on the defense industry, but the analysis techniques discussed apply equally to rail, air and other industries. The paper investigates the current methodology employed to assess sustainability, supportability and costs. It then argues for a more practical and accurate method of dealing with these problems and other related difficulties faced by those working in the logistic area.

AB This paper presents a critical assessment of the field of common property. After discussing briefly the major findings and accomplishments of the scholarship on the commons, the paper pursues two strategies of critique. The first strategy of friendly critique accepts the basic assumptions of most writings on common property to show that scholars of commons have discovered far more variables that potentially affect resource management than is possible to analyze carefully. The paper identifies some potential means to address the problem of too many variables. The second line of critique proceeds differently. It asks how analyses of common property might change, and what they need to consider, if they loosen assumptions about sovereign selves and apolitical property rights institutions. My examination of these questions concludes this review with an emphasis on the need to (a) attend more carefully to processes of subject formation, and (b) investigate common property arrangements and associated subject positions with greater historical depth.

AB As increasing proportions of the world's population, production, and consumption become concentrated in urban areas, the need for urban development patterns that are more ecologically sustainable becomes obvious. A large proportion of the world's urban population also has needs that are unmet. We review the scale and nature of urban change worldwide, the environmental impacts of these changes, and the potentials and the difficulties in better meeting sustainable development goals in urban centers. The discussion of the interaction between city-based production and consumption and the resources and sinks on which these rely that are outside city boundaries is a reminder that the goal is not sustainable cities but cities that contribute to sustainable development within their boundaries, in the region around them, and globally.

AB Water managers and planners are slowly beginning to change their perspective and perceptions about how best to meet human needs for water; they are shifting from a focus on building supply infrastructure to improving their understanding of how water is used and how those uses can best be met. This review discusses definitions of water use, explores the history of water use around the world and in characteristic regions, identifies problems with collecting and analyzing water data, and addresses the question of improving water-use efficiency and productivity in different regions and economic sectors. There is growing interest on the part of water managers around the world to implement these approaches to lessen pressures on increasingly scarce water resources, reduce the adverse ecological effects of human withdrawals of water, and improve long-term sustainable water use.

DE sustainability; indicators; measurement; assessment
AB Sustainable development has broad appeal and little specificity, but some combination of development and environment as well as equity is found in many attempts to describe it. However, proponents of sustainable development differ in their emphases on what is to be sustained, what is to be developed, how to link environment and development, and for how long a time. Despite the persistent definitional ambiguities associated with sustainable development, much work (over 500 efforts) has been devoted to developing quantitative indicators of sustainable development. The emphasis on sustainability indicators has multiple motivations that include decision making and management, advocacy, participation and consensus building, and research and analysis. We select a dozen prominent examples and use this review to highlight their similarities and differences in definition of sustainable development, motivation, process, and technical methods. We conclude that there are no indicator sets that are universally accepted, backed by compelling theory, rigorous data collection and analysis, and influential in policy. This is due to the ambiguity of sustainable development, the plurality of purpose in characterizing and measuring sustainable development, and the confusion of terminology, data, and methods of measurement. A major step in reducing such confusion would be the acceptance of distinctions in terminology, data, and methods. Toward this end, we propose an analytical framework that clearly distinguishes among goals, indicators, targets, trends, driving forces, and policy responses. We also highlight the need for continued research on scale, aggregation, critical limits, and thresholds.

AB Under a monetary dominant (MD) regime, the primary surplus adjusts to limit debt growth, permitting monetary policy to be conducted independently of fiscal financing requirements. In Brazil, some evidence favours an MD regime for 1995-1997, but not for the decade of the 1990s as a whole. While fiscal adjustments of 1999 yielded a primary surplus of about 3% of GDP, consistent with solvency, a credible MD regime would require further adjustments of the primary surplus if debt increases, growth falls, or interest rates rise.

AB Poland has rich geothermal water resources. Geothermal energy should be treated as one of the main renewable sources of energy. In particular, the space-heating sector has good prospects for its wide application. This will result in a considerable reduction in the use of traditional fuels and in the emissions generated in many regions. Among the main factors influencing the low official estimate of the potential for the use of geothermal energy are the low, competitive prices of fossil fuels, insufficient law regulations and lack of finance. This paper presents the main aspects of geothermal energy use in Poland. Basic information-is given referring to the plants in operation, under construction and further plans. Particular prospects for the development of geothermal energy in Poland include the use of abandoned wells for the exploitation of geothermal water; cascaded, integrated and distributed systems; heat extraction not only from large depths but also from shallow water and rock formations. Such solutions will result in the lowering of investment costs, increasing their effectiveness, extending the market and making geothermal energy competitive both with traditional energy sources and other renewables.

AB This paper considers the economics of using photovoltaic (PV) technology for developing remote areas. "East Owienat" in Upper Egypt is the chosen region: there, the feasibility of using PV systems for the pumping of ground water in comparison with using diesel units, taking into consideration the different parameters affecting the costs,and the present value of both systems, is considered. The study proved that PV-battery systems can be used efficiently for water pumping at East Owienat: the cost of the water unit pumped by PV systems is much less than that pumped using diesel systems, and the water cost is more sensitive to PV cells' prices than their life-time periods.

AB This paper details the status of renewable-energy (RE) developments in Arab countries (AC) as an essential element for the sustainable economic development of these countries, despite their wealth in oil and gas. The paper first presents a review of the RE resources in AC and sheds light on some achieved and/or ongoing RE projects in the region. It also examines the adequacy of the present national institutions responsible for RE developments, and evaluates the effectiveness of work programmes of major regional and international organizations supporting RE activities. Finally, the paper identifies major obstacles hindering the large-scale penetration of RE into the energy markets of AC, and draws conclusions for increasing RE contribution to those markets.

DE zero-till; cutter-planter; trash mulch; energy productivity
AB Zero tillage with trash mulch offers economical and sustainable agriculture to sugarcane (Sacharum species hybrid) growers-in India: An,on-farm research program was initiated in 1992 to investigate the effect of the level of tillage and trash.-mulch on energy use and savings, crop yield, soil bulk density, microbial activity, and irrigation water use efficiency. Sugarcane was grown in fine loamy non-calcareous soil in the sub-tropical zone of India with pulse (Vigna radiate) - mustard (Brassica campestris L.) as preceding crops. Planting was done using a sugarcane cutter planter with disk-type furrow openers. Experiments during 1992-96 showed that tillage before planting which required about one-third (936 MJ ha(-1)) of the total operational energy (2795 MJ ha(-1)) could be saved without. adversely affecting yield (48.5 t ha(-1) compared to 49.4 t ha(-1) for zero and conventional tillage treatments, respectively). The level of tillage did not have any significant effect on soil, irrigation and crop parameters. Treatments with trash mulch improved crop yield (49.4 t ha(-1) with no trash, to 73.0 t ha(-1), with trash, respectively); energy productivity (1.155 to 1.691 kg MJ(-1)), and irrigation water use efficiency (762 to 1192 kg (ha-cm)(-1)). Soil microbial activity was greater with trash mulch.

AB A non-linear stochastic model has been proposed and analized for fish harvesting. The model encompasses Gordon-Schaefer model and Pella-Tomlinson model that have been used in the study of extensive data on baleen whales, harp seals and Gulf of St. Lawrence cod. It has been established that the harvesting of those species is more profitable in terms of biomass for which data supports alpha > 2, as compared to that for which alpha less than or equal to 2, where alpha is general index in the model:

AB As experience with aquaculture grows worldwide, the concept of sustainable aquaculture is increasingly recognized to incorporate both spatial and temporal dimensions of environmental, economic, and social parameters. Practitioners have discovered that sustainable aquaculture must not only maximize benefits, but also minimize accumulation of detriments, as well as other types of negative impacts on natural and social environment. Therefore, sustainable aquaculture development must be advanced in a manner that is environmentally sustainable and that protects the quality of the environment for other users, while it is equally important for society to protect the quality of the environment for aquaculture. This paper provides a brief review of the worldwide aquaculture development in the last decade, and gives a few examples of sustainable aquaculture activities in the coastal areas that are using natural coastal habitats and ecosystems. Based on already existing national and international efforts to promote sustainable aquaculture, key recommendations are provided, including what should be the next proactive steps.

AB 1. Accumulations of maerl occur widely in ocean facing coastal waters (< 20-30 in depth) of the northeast Atlantic, that are sheltered from the direct SW approach of storm waves and have little terrigenous sediment supply.
   2. The different methods that have been used to assess the rate of formation of cool temperate, coralline algal gravels (maerl) are outlined.
   3. Formation rates of maerl may be expressed as short-term, branch growth rates (mm yr(-1)), as calcium carbonate production rates (g CaCO3 m(-2) yr(-1)), or as longer-term accumulation rates (m kyr(-1) = m 1000 yr(-1)).
   4. Branch growth rates of the free living, branching coralline algae that form maerl in northwest Spain and western Ireland vary from 0.1 to 1.0 mm yr(-1). Rates from Norway are either 0.05-0.15 or up to 1.0 mm yr(-1).
   5. Production rates vary from 30-250 g CaCO m(-2) yr(-1) in western Ireland, 876 g CaCO3 m(-2) yr(-1) in northwest France and 895-1423 g CaCO3 m(-2) yr(-1) in Norway.
   6. Accumulation rates vary from 0.08 m ky(-1) in Orkney to 0 5 m ky(-1) in Cornwall, to 0.8-1.4 m kyr(-1) in Norway.
   7. These production and accumulation rates are similar to the lower end of such rates from tropical coral reef environments. This is achieved by high standing crops that compensate for the lower growth rates of the temperate algae. Although rapid on a geological time-scale these accumulation rates are far too low for the maerl to be regarded as a sustainable resource for extraction for agricultural and industrial use.

ID RIVER HEALTH; FRAMEWORK; ENVIRONMENT
AB Hydropower use is responsible for a wide range of environmental disturbances to river systems. Over the past decades, aquatic science research has been successful in identifying a considerable number of relationships that exist between plant operation and ecosystem quality. This increase in scientific knowledge was, however, not matched by a corresponding reduction in environmental impacts stemming from hydropower. In the present paper, we show how aquatic science projects may be defined and implemented to better link scientific knowledge with the resolution of environmental problems.
   We base our analysis on a major aquatic science research project in which an eco-label for "sustainable hydropower" (Green Hydropower) was developed for Switzerland. We first assess the state of aquatic science research on alpine river systems. The Swiss history of hydropower shows that the limited adoption of this knowledge was due to a severe coordination and action problem. The Green Hydropower project aimed at establishing an environmental product label for hydropower plant operation, which should help overcome these problems. It had to deal with two major challenges: the integration of widely differing knowledge stocks and the management of a network of diverse stakeholders operating in a conflict-laden political environment. By carefully dealing with these two problem areas, the project was finally able to define a scientifically-based and broadly-accepted standard for Green Hydropower operation. We conclude by discussing lessons for the improvement of problem-oriented aquatic science research, in general.

AB Regions are significant for the way we understand and strategize food for health and economic development. They generally represent various food cultures and opportunities for food exchange based on proximity, historical linkages and complementarities. The example of North and West Africa represents an intersection of some of the most original of human eating experiences out of Africa and the enrichment of these by Arab traders, through the exchange of products, ideas, observations, beliefs and technologies. All of these will have encouraged diversity in food intake. However food diversity and, with it, biodiversity may not always have been recognized as important, and, therefore, secured and protected. Ultimately, food diversity cannot be sustained unless the food chain and the technologies to support it are environmentally appropriate. Cooking, without renewable energy sources, is a critical example. Additionally, human settlement has always required an adequate, a dependable and a safe water supply, although this same settlement tends to compromise these water characteristics. Water is a major factor in food diversity, whether as a source of aquatic food, or the basis of food production and preparation. The extent to which food diversity for human health is required will depend on the food component (essential nutrient and phytochemical) density of the foods represented. For example, fish, fresh lean meat, eggs and seed foods (grains, pulses, nuts) will reduce the requirement. Regional food diversity can support food diversity at the community level - where otherwise it might be fragile - by shared learning experiences, and by trade. Diversity can also be captured and enshrined in recipes with composite ingredients and by traditional emblematic foods - like soups and pies; and it provides the basis for food culture and cuisine. The evidence for food diversity (or variety) as a major factor in health has grown substantially over the last few years - as integrative indices of health like "maternal nutrition" and "successful pregnancy" (for example, through the inclusion of a variety of food sources of folate, increasing the bioavailability of iron, and the sustainable intakes of quality food protein and essential fatty acids); "adult mortality rates"; other "specific disease incidences" (like cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes and bone health) for "risk factors for disease" (like hypertension and abdominal fatness); and for "wellbeing" (palatable, enjoying and neurologically relevant food stuffs). Thus, there is an ongoing need to promote and maintain food diversity at the regional level and between communities.

AB There is general consensus that food-based approaches are viable and sustainable options for addressing vitamin A deficiency in populations. One such example is the fortification of food which, if properly monitored, could make a significant contribution towards improving the vitamin A status of populations throughout the world. Red palm fruit oil (RTO) with its high content of natural carotenoids, lends itself exceptionally well to this purpose at both household and commercial level. Results are now available from several feeding trials incorporating RPO into diets at household level or into commercially manufactured products. RPO in the maternal diet was shown to improve the vitamin A status of lactating mothers and their infants. Consumption of RPO incorporated in a sweet snack or biscuits significantly improved plasma retinol concentrations in children with subclinical vitamin A deficiency. There is evidence that if only 35-50% of the recommended daily intake for vitamin A were to be provided by RPO, it may be sufficient to prevent vitamin A deficiency (hypovitaminosis A). Red palm oil has a highly bioconvertible form of alpha- and beta-carotene, a long shelf life, and a higher cost/benefit ratio when compared to other approaches such as high-dose-vitamin A supplements and fortification of foods with retinyl ester fortificants. Consumption of RPO is safe and cannot produce hypervitaminosis A. Considering all the current information about RPO, the initiation of food-based interventions involving its use in developing countries with an endemic vitamin A deficiency problem, appears to be a logical choice.

AB The current energy policy. especially in the OECD countries, is characterized by the deregulation of the energy markets and the growing inclusion of aspects of sustainability in the evaluation of energy supply options. These factors are influencing decision-making right now, and will increasingly determine the public view. In the light of these aspects, the decision by Finland to build its fifth nuclear power plant also underlines the positive assessment of nuclear power.
   In the OECD countries, nuclear power plants are making a reliable and cost-effective contribution to the supply of energy, The technical reliability of nuclear power plants worldwide is reflected by high plant availabilities of, on the average, 83%, as well as in the low-cost generation of electricity associated with it. Safety at a high level is guaranteed as a result of the efforts made by industry and by the regulatory authorities.
   A decisive criterion for building new nuclear power plants can he the cost structure of these plants in electricity generation. Capital costs, though high. can be calculated reliably on a long-term basis. This can make electricity from nuclear power a robust factor in deregulated markets suffering from considerable price fluctuations of other sources of energy. Once their capital outlay has been written off, nuclear power plants are among the most favorable plants costwise.
   Another aspect to be considered are the low external costs of nuclear power - an important yardstick for evaluating energy supply systems, Advanced research and development work on nuclear systems of the kind carried out, for instance, by the International Generation IV Forum reveals additional perspectives for the future of nuclear power. Advanced safety systems, intensified use of fuel resources, possible uses of reactors beyond the generation of electricity, and new technologies of managing radioactive waste indicate the development potential inherent in nuclear power and to be tapped by research and development.

AB The U.N, World Summit on Environment and Development in Rio de Janeiro in June 1992 was the origin of the international framework for sustainable development. As a basis for joint, sustainable action by governments. organizations, industries, and the public, the participating Countries signed the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development, and drafted the associated action program, Agenda 21.
   Sustainable development comprises these three determinant factors:
   - Economy.
   - Ecology.
   -Social aspects.
   This is where entrepreneurial responsibility for society comes in. If industries want to generate overall positive effects, they must be efficient, competitive, and profitable on a long-term basis.
   Power supply systems meeting the criteria of sustainable development must be reliable. economically viable, socially acceptable, and environmentally compatible.
   The power supply in Finland is meeting these sustainability requirements in many waves. Finland's electricity supply is decentralize, using a variety of energy sources. Electricity can be generated and made available at low cost, The Finnish power industry is an important employer and a major factor in the economy, Moreover, electricity. is generated in advanced types of power plants.
   In this way, the structure of the Finnish power supply system incorporates important factors of sustainable development.

AB Plantation forestry in the Southern Hemisphere has grown dramatically in the last hundred years. This has largely been due to the exceptional growth and performance of exotic species, particularly Pinus, Eucalyptus and Acacia. It is generally recognised that the success of these plantations has, at least in part, been due to the separation of the trees from their natural enemies. In this regard, the trees have performed similarly to weeds. Indeed, in some situations, species regarded as highly desirable for forestry are also recognised as noxious weeds. The artificial barrier between exotic plantation species and their pathogens is, however, crumbling. Despite intensive efforts to exclude pests and pathogens from countries now dependent on plantations of exotic trees, new and seriously damaging incursions are occurring with increasing frequency. Cryphonectria canker of Eucalyptus caused by Cryphonectria cubensis provides an important and interesting example and is used in this paper to illustrate emerging trends. These include evidence to suggest that native pathogens, previously thought to be relatively host specific and non-threatening, are adapting to infect exotic plantation trees. Other than the damage that these pathogens are causing to exotics, they now pose a serious threat to the same or related tree species in their areas of origin. This tremendous threat is only just being recognised and it is little understood. This is, at least in part, due to a poor understanding of the taxonomy and ecology of even some of the better known tree pathogens. Intensive efforts will be required to protect the sustainability of exotic plantation forestry. They will also be needed to ensure that 'new pathogens' do not lead to destruction of the same or related tree species in their areas of origin.

AB We reviewed the decay patterns and lifetimes (time to reach 95% mass loss) of coarse woody debris (CWD) on the forest floor. The objectives were to identify the factors influencing the decomposition process of CWD and to provide estimates of lifetimes for CWD from Australian tree species. This information is required for greenhouse accounting of forestry activities and land use change as well as the sustainable management of CWD in forest ecosystems. The analysis of a global data set on decay rates of CWD showed that, in particular, the mean annual temperature was a main driver of decomposition, accounting for 34% of the variation in decay rates. The Q(10), the factor by which biological processes accelerate when temperature increases by 10degreesC, was 2.53. Additional determinants of CWD decay rates were the initial density of wood and the diameter of logs. Median and average lifetimes derived from 184 decay rates were 49 and 92 years, respectively, which is considerably higher than the 10-year default for all litter proposed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The pattern of decay in most cases followed a negative exponential curve. To overcome the paucity of information on decomposition of CWD in Australian forests and woodlands, decay rates for a large number of species were derived from wood durability and decay resistance studies. For native Australian species, lifetimes ranged from 7 years in Eucalyptus regnans to 375 years in E. camaldulensis. The lifetimes for timber durability Classes 1-4 were 54, 39, 26 and 11 years, respectively, below 30degrees latitude and without the influence of termites. However, the experimental conditions under which durability and decay resistance are commonly determined are substantially different from the situation under which CWD decomposes in the field. These estimates must therefore be regarded as minimum lifetimes for CWD of most species. To determine decay rates of CWD with greater certainty, long-term field experiments in a wide range of ecosystems are required.

TI Recognising a climate for sustainability: extension beyond transfer of
   technology
SO AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL AGRICULTURE
LA English
DT Article
AB Sustainable agriculture emphasises the fundamental role of the human component in a production system, as opposed to conventional agriculture, which centres on technologies. Therefore, it is characterised by the abilities and behaviours that farmers display, including the knowledge and skills they possess, decision-making processes they apply, and individual and collective actions they take. This has strong implications for extension development and organisation, in that the methodologies applied should be oriented towards enhancing farmer capacities favourable to sustainable agriculture, rather than towards achieving adoption of standardised technologies. These capacities include sound ecological knowledge, observational, analytical and experimental skills, and inclination towards collectivity to allow farmers to make better, informed decisions for location-specific agro-ecosystem management. Extension approaches favouring this type of learning are participatory, experience-based and adaptable. Needs and opportunity assessment, participatory technology development, defining the implications for farmers of the implementation of an innovation, and development of a learning curriculum (first for farmers and then for facilitators) are among the sequential phases for solid extension development for sustainable agriculture. Applying underlying principles of participatory capacity development, rather than fixed, condition-specific models, provides a generic framework for extension development under diverse ecological and socio-cultural settings.

TI Effects of lime on the botanical composition of pasture over nine years
   in a field experiment on the south-western slopes of New South Wales

AB Two permanent pastures (annual pasture v. perennial pasture) were established in 1992 as part of the long-term field experiment, MASTER - Managing Acid Soils Through Efficient Rotations. The primary objective of the experiment was to develop an agricultural system that is economically viable and environmentally sustainable on the highly acidic soils in south-eastern Australia. This paper reports on the effects of lime on the botanical composition changes of annual and perennial pastures over 9 years. In general, lime increased the proportion of the desirable species, such as phalaris (Phalaris aquatica) in perennial pasture and subterranean clover (Trifolium subterraneum) in annual pastures, and decreased the proportion of the undesirable species, such as Vulpia spp., in both annual and perennial pastures, ultimately improving the quality of feed-on-offer to animals. As a result, the limed pastures carried 24% more sheep than the unlimed pastures, while maintaining individual animal performance similar for both limed and unlimed pastures. The phalaris-based perennial pasture was more stable in terms of maintaining the sown species than the annual pasture. Lime improved the persistence of phalaris and the longevity of the phalaris-based pasture should be at least 10 years. Lime changed the direction of plant succession of annual pastures. Without lime, Vulpia spp. gradually became more dominant while ryegrass and subterranean clover became less dominant in annual pastures. With lime, barley grass (Hordeum leporinum) gradually invaded the sward at the expense of ryegrass, thus reducing the benefits of lime, but this effect was less for the perennial pastures than for annual pastures. Liming perennial pastures should be more beneficial than liming annual pastures because of the beneficial effects on pasture composition. In addition, previously published work reported that liming perennial pastures improved sustainability through better use of water and nitrogen.

DE weak and strong sustainability; economic; environment; social
   sustainability
AB This paper reviews the concepts of sustainable development in an economic, environmental and social context. Weak and strong versions of sustainable development are reviewed and applied to the agricultural sector. The paper demonstrates that despite any degradation of the natural resource base, the agricultural sector is more productive now than in the past. This has occurred because the rate of investment in research and development (resulting in increased reproducible capital) has more than offset the rate of degradation in the natural capital stock. Science, it is argued, is part of the economic system that allocates productive capacity between current and future generations. Increases in expenditure on agricultural R&D since the 1950s have ensured that past generations have transferred productive capacity to future generations. With respect to the environment, the authors argue that a strong version of sustainable development may be appropriate, particularly where there are uncertain and irreversible outcomes. Finally, it has been observed that a hybrid version of social sustainability has been adopted in Australia. While resource mobility in the agricultural sector has been generally encouraged (weak sustainability) this has been underpinned by a welfare system that ensures basic standards of well-being and opportunity (strong sustainability).

AB During the last decade, a range of indicators has been advocated for assessing soil, farm and catchment health. This paper assembles some recent experiences of the authors in developing and using indicators from paddock to national scales. Indicators are merely a subset of the attributes that are used to quantify aspects of catchment or farm health. Their selection and use in the past has led to criticism of indicators, but, given an explicit approach, most of the criticisms can be overcome. Reliable indicators provide positive and negative signals about the current status of natural resources and how these properties have changed over time. They are used both to identify potential risks and to confirm that current farming practices and systems of land use are effective in maintaining the resource base or economic status. They should be precursors for change and future on-ground investments when problems are observed or identified.
   A structured approach is needed to ensure indicators are selected and used efficiently. This approach involves: deciding local issues and selecting the most appropriate indicators to reflect those issues; interpreting both positive and negative signals from the monitoring process; taking appropriate action to resolve problems; and, using indicators to monitor the outcomes from the action taken.
   Finally, we have drawn on these and other experiences to compile a list of indicators that may be used to address sustainability issues associated with farm productivity, soil health and catchment health identified in recent strategic plans developed for the northern grains region of Australia, the focus of this special journal issue.

AB A variety of indicators have been developed and applied by farmers and scientists for the northern cereal belt. A general overview is presented of 'What are we trying to monitor?' followed by some example concepts; erosion hazard, salinity hazard, nutrient balance, production efficiency and participatory learning. These examples illustrate the complexity of indicator application and their dependence on context, purpose and scale. Emphasis is given to providing a rationale for developing indicators that focus on 'soft' system status (e.g. behaviour) as well as 'hard' system status. The propositions put forward are that indicators need to be integrated with the development of improved management systems, and that land managers (and community) as a collective, are key to this process. Some frequently asked questions about indicator development and application are responded to. Some 'Indicators for Indicators' that we have found useful in aiding indicator development, particularly in participatory fora are presented.

   monitoring and management for sustainability
SO AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL AGRICULTURE
LA English
DT Article
ID AGRICULTURE; SYSTEMS
AB Many factors influence the value to a farmer of monitoring a sustainability indicator. Based on an economic model, a survey of farmers and data on actual farmer monitoring of piezometers, a number of important insights are obtained, including the ones listed below.
   The value of monitoring indicators will vary by issue, by indicator, by region and by farm. In many cases, the value of continuing to monitor would fall over time as knowledge and understanding increase. For this reason, even successful programs to promote monitoring by farmers may have a limited life expectancy. If monitoring an indicator is to be valuable to a farmer, the indicator must be related to management options which make a difference in achieving the farmer's objectives. However, if the achievement of objectives is very sensitive to management choices, the optimal choice may be so obvious that there is little value in collecting further information about it. The greater the current level of uncertainty about a variable, the greater is the value of monitoring that variable, provided that monitoring does lead to reductions in uncertainty. The greater the degree of uncertainty about the consequences of different management strategies, the lower will be the value of a related indicator. It is not possible to conclude that monitoring indicators is, in general, a good thing.

AB Sustainability is a multifaceted concept. It is expressed here as 'to ensure that the past and current management and use of natural resources does not diminish their capacity to meet economic, environmental, social and aesthetic needs and opportunities of the present and future generations'. Sustainability indicators can be used to monitor responses in condition and trend as a result of natural resource management. We report here 2 case studies that demonstrate the significance of sustainability indicators in discerning trends in land and water resources in the southern Brigalow (Acacia harpophylla) Belt, a major region of the Queensland Murray - Darling Basin. First, soil organic matter was used as a sustainability indicator of soil productivity, soil aggregation, and its association with soil sodicity since these soil attributes affect infiltration rates, runoff and drainage. The second study involved comparing the trends in stream salinity ( electrical conductivity) over 35 years and sustainability indicators for a dominant Vertosol in a region used for cereal cropping. Groundwater level and electrical conductivity of a long-term monitoring bore in the Dalby - Chinchilla region, were also analysed to discern trends in salinity and association of the groundwater with soil and stream salinity.
   Soil organic matter declined exponentially as the cultivation period for cereal cropping increased. This resulted in a reduction in soil nitrogen supply, and lower grain protein and cereal grain yields. The associated effects were reduced soil aggregation and increased soil sodicity. Electrical conductivity of the soil as well as stream water showed weak but declining trends with time. Groundwater level from the long-term monitoring bore near the stream and groundwater salinity showed significantly declining trends over the 35 years sampling period. Groundwater salinity was similar to the Vertosol electrical conductivity at 240 - 300 cm depths, suggesting groundwater connectivity to the overlaying soil. Thus, use of sustainability indicators provided a strong association among the various attributes of the landscape. However, it is still a challenge to integrate the various sustainability indicators in a landscape context, integrated over space ( spatial and geographical distribution), attributes ( quality characteristics) and time ( trend).

AB Two issues prompted this paper. The first was the measured soil organic carbon decline in fertile northern Australian soils under continual cropping using traditional management practices. We wanted to see whether it was theoretically possible to maintain or improve soil organic carbon concentrations with modern management recommendations. The second was the debate about use of sustainability indicators for on-farm management, so we looked at soil organic carbon as a potential indicator of soil health and investigated whether it was useful in making on-farm crop decisions.
   The analytical results indicated first that theoretically the observed decline in soil organic carbon concentrations in some northern cracking clay soils can be halted and reversed under continuous cropping sequences by using best practice management. Second, the results and associated discussion give some support to the use of soil organic carbon as a sustainability indicator for soil health. There was a consistent correlation between crop input decisions ( fertilisation, stubble management, tillage), outputs ( yield and profits) and outcomes ( change in soil organic carbon content) in the short and longer term. And this relationship depended to some extent on whether the existing soil organic carbon status was low, medium or high.
   A stock dynamics relationship is one where the change in a stock ( such as soil organic carbon) through time is related not only to the management decisions made and other random influences ( such as climatic effects), but also to the concentration or level of the stock itself in a previous time period. Against such a requirement, soil organic carbon was found to be a reasonable measure. However, the inaccuracy in measuring soil organic carbon in the paddock mitigates the potential benefit shown in this analysis of using soil organic carbon as a sustainability indicator.
   These results are based on a simulation model (APSIM) calibrated for a cracking clay (Vertosol) soil typical of much of the intensively-cropped slopes and plains region of northern New South Wales and southern Queensland, and need to be interpreted in this light. There are large areas of such soils in north-western New South Wales; however, many of these experience lower rainfalls and plant-available soil water capacities than in this case, and the importance of these characteristics must also be considered.

AB This paper outlines work being undertaken with farmers in the Riverina of New South Wales to develop practical tools to help assess and monitor on-farm environmental performance. A Participatory Learning and Action Research approach was used which combined farmers' knowledge and interest in the environment with previous research undertaken on water losses in cropping systems. The hypothesis tested was 'that current water sustainability indicators developed by scientists were of limited use for on-farm application'. Using the participatory approach, 2 monitoring tools were produced and the approach was illustrated using a 'learning cycle'. The first tool assessed so-called 'perenniality' on a whole farm basis. The second tool allowed farmers to assess the 'leakiness' ( losses of water below the root zone of farming systems) of a paddock in a particular year using farmers' rainfall records, assessment of soil type and assumptions about the ability of plant species grown to dry out the soil. Water related sustainability indicators developed by scientists were not particularly useful in helping farmers assess their environmental performance. Using a participatory approach was a valuable way to develop environmental monitoring tools with participants learning much in the process.

AB If farmers are to determine whether their farm goals for resource condition are being met, and whether changes in farm management are leading towards a more sustainable farming system, then they need to be able to monitor these areas. Yet to date, an easy to use, practical and reliable method to be used by farmers to monitor trends in soil health has not been developed. This has been a consequence mainly of developing soil monitoring packages in isolation from the end user, and relying on 'expert' advice to guide farmers' management of the soil rather than empowering them to be more self-reliant in this area. This study sought to collaborate with farmers in the development of a soil health checklist. The research process acknowledged the importance of local conditions, farmers' existing knowledge on soils and their preferences for delivery and presentation of the final product. The study focused on farmers located in the north-west cropping region of New South Wales, Australia. This article reports on a prototype for a farmer's soil health checklist - the features they use, how they recognise those features, especially the language they use to describe a healthy and unhealthy soil, and finally the techniques they use to determine those features.

ID METHODOLOGY; AGRICULTURE; FRAMEWORK; LANDSCAPE; INDUSTRY
AB Despite the availability of numerous 'sustainability indicators' ( as defined by researchers and resource-management agency staff), many farmers do not routinely use these indicators for monitoring and measurement of their everyday farm management. Farmers' past experiences with such indicators have often been through their use by researchers ( trying to evaluate effects of management or quantify resource condition changes) or other external bodies ( usually regulatory agencies endeavouring to regulate environmental impacts). Such experiences have added little or nothing to on-farm management. Rather, farmers often rely on a diverse range of personally relevant indicators to assess the performance of their farm business. Such indicators may not be recognised by others as indicative of sustainability.
   The process used in environmental management systems ( EMS) implementation is predicated on the need for information to flow back to the manager to assist their management choices. In this way, the indicators of most use are those that the manager can determine and utilise. This paper describes the connection between environmental management systems, monitoring and indicators, and the importance of these linkages to the efficient and sustainable management of natural resources. It discusses a collaborative project between in New South Wales and Queensland grain farmers, and NSW Agriculture, to develop generic EMS guidelines based on the international standard for EMS, ISO 14001. While there are numerous recommended sustainability indicators, research with these farmers has found that it is more critical to determine which issues are of importance to the farmers and identify potential indicators they will utilise, rather than to recommend a prescribed suite of indicators. In some cases, these indicators may be of a larger-scale than just their property.
   Different users of resource-management information will require different indicators. The use of the EMS process provides structure and guidance in determining which of the plethora of indicators might be applicable, while allowing farmers to maximise benefits in the market place or the community. Resource-management agencies and customers may require a different suite of indicators. The use of EMS assists in streamlining all these demands, while keeping the focus on the management approaches required to achieve the greatest benefit for the manager.

AB An experimental site was established in 1997 on the North-West Slopes of New South Wales to further investigate the use of strategic grazing management to improve the persistence of phalaris (Phalaris aquatica cv. Sirosa) and subsequent effects on animal production and soil water content. The pasture was sown in 1992 to Sirosa phalaris, subterranean clover (Trifolium subterraneum var. subterraneum cv. Seaton Park) and lucerne (Medicago sativa cv. Aurora). Four grazing treatments were applied in a randomised 3-replicate design. Treatments consisted of continuous grazing at 12.3 sheep/ha (C12 or control); continuous grazing at 6 sheep/ha (C6), and 2 spring and autumn strategies of either resting from grazing for 6 weeks in each season (SAR0), or reducing stocking rate from 12.3 to 4.0 sheep/ha (SAR4). Despite annual applications of fertiliser and high clover content, Sirosa phalaris herbage mass in plots continuously grazed at 12.3 sheep/ha declined from a mean of 3300 kg DM/ha in spring 1997 to <700 kg DM/ha by May 1998. At the end of the study (February 2001), Sirosa mean herbage mass in these plots was 670 kg DM/ha and lower (P<0.05) than for the other treatments (mean value 5400 kg DM/ha).
   These marked changes in herbage mass, and the degradation of the Sirosa-based pasture to an annual pasture by continuous grazing at 12.3 sheep/ha, were not generally reflected in either short-term animal production or substantial differences in soil water content. Wool production (kg/head) was not significantly different among treatments each year. Compared with continuous grazing at 12.3 sheep/ha, sheep liveweights were higher (P<0.05) in plots continuously grazed at 6.1 sheep/ha from November 1997 to February 1999. However, from February 1999 to 2001, sheep liveweights in the 2 treatments with the highest Sirosa phalaris content were lower (P<0.05) than those continuously grazed at 12.3 sheep/ha. Only the soil water content for the C6 and SAR4 treatments at 0-30 cm was significantly different to the control treatment, but the differences were predicted to be <2.5 mm/year. In the root zone (0-90 cm), mean soil water content ranged from 159 to 309 mm (mean 220 mm), while plant available water (soil water content-soil water content at -1500 kPa) was a mean of 79 mm, ranging from 11 to 168 mm.

AB Field experiments were carried out in the Indo-Gangetic plains of India during 1997-98, 1998-99 and 1999-2000 with the objective to identify alternative crop sequences that are more productive as well as remunerative than the rice-wheat cropping system. The results indicated that the highest mean sunflower seed yield was obtained in the soybean-sunflower rotation followed by the rice-sunflower rotation and the lowest in the maize-mustard-sunflower crop rotation. Similarly, the sesbania-toria-sunflower rotation had the highest biological yield followed by the soybean-sunflower and urd-toria-sunflower rotations. The mean highest harvest index was found in the cowpea-toria-sunflower rotation (35.1%) followed by the urd-toria-sunflower (33.2%) and rice-sunflower (32.7%) rotations. A significantly high oil content in sunflower seeds was observed in both the soybean-sunflower and sesbania-toria-sunflower rotations that was similar to that in the urd-toria-sunflower and cowpea-toria-sunflower rotations. The maize-potato-sunflower, maize-mustard-sunflower, cowpea-toria sunflower and rice-sunflower rotations had significantly higher sunflower seed yield equivalents (201, 17, 15 and 4% higher, respectively) than the rice-wheat rotation. Similarly, the maize-potato-sunflower rotation produced the highest net income followed by cowpea-toria-sunflower, rice-sunflower and maize-mustard-sunflower, that was 351, 37, 14 and 4%, respectively, higher than the net income of the rice-wheat rotation. The benefit: cost ratio was also observed to be significantly highest in the maize-potato-sunflower rotation (1.60). After 3 years of field experimentation, soil organic carbon, available nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium were observed to be highest in the urd-toria-sunflower, soybean-sunflower, cowpea-toria-sunflower and soybean-sunflower rotations, respectively. The mean value of total available nutrients was greater in soybean-sunflower than rice-wheat rotation.
   It can be concluded that the cowpea-toria-sunflower, soybean-sunflower and rice-sunflower crop rotations may be preferred for greater sustainability over the rice-wheat system not only in the Indo-Gangetic plains of India but also in the whole of Asia, and these findings may be a very useful reference for future research on Australian crop diversification.

ID MANAGEMENT
AB The Sustainable Grazing Systems (SGS) Program was established in 1996 to address the issues of declining pasture productivity and sustainability in the high rainfall zone (> 600 mm/year) of southern Australia. The program goal was that 'by June 2001, at least 2000 producers in the high rainfall zone will have adopted changes to their grazing systems that can be shown to be at least 10% more profitable, and more sustainable, than those used prior to participating in SGS. A further 5000 producers will have trialed at least part of the recommended changes'.
   There were 4 interacting activities within SGS, collectively focused on delivering this goal. These were: (i) a National Experiment to develop the principles and quantify the relationships; (ii) a regional producer network to determine and deliver on local producer priorities; (iii) training and skills development courses; and (iv) integration and management to ensure the goal was met in an efficient and effective manner. Producer input and ownership were considered essential and were built in at all levels of program activity and management.
   Independent surveys confirmed that SGS assisted large numbers of producers to make substantial change in farm practices. SGS met its goal by developing and delivering knowledge about more profitable and sustainable grazing systems to a network of almost 10000 livestock producers across southern Australia. Critical elements of SGS included research, skills training and support for producer groups, on-farm trials and demonstrations, and farm-walks for producers to share information and experiences. A 'triple bottom line' approach was adopted to assess and report on the impacts of the program on the financial, social and environmental capital of the grazing industries in the high rainfall zone. In keeping with the triple bottom line approach, this special edition contains papers that report on biophysical, economic, environmental and social aspects of the program.

TI The SGS Regional Producer Network: a successful application of
   interactive participation
SO AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL AGRICULTURE
LA English
DT Article
ID MANAGEMENT; EXTENSION
AB The Regional Producer Network (RPN) functioned across southern Australia as the primary delivery mechanism of the Sustainable Grazing Systems (SGS) Program for 5 years (1996-2001) and the Harvest Year (2001-2002). It consisted of a network of Producer Committees that provided on-ground organisation to coordinate extension activities in the 11 SGS regions. The operation of the RPN was modelled on a participation mode called Interactive Participation. The main objective was to support the adoption of a large-scale practice change in the high rainfall zone towards more productive, profitable and sustainable grazing systems. Strong producer leadership developed and information exchange improved to achieve a high level of impact on management skills among those producers motivated to improve their grazing operations.
   The characteristics of Interactive Participation were incorporated into the processes and operation of the RPN. Defined and structured methodologies were used for collective and context-specific learning within the framework of a producer network that encouraged interaction. The strength of Interactive Participation was that producers saw participation as a right and not just a means to achieve the program goal. Each region took control over local decisions including the allocation of available resources. The process engaged all sectors of the program (producers, researchers, management and funders). The experiential extension procedures used systematic and structured learning activities to support producers who were committed to learning, on-farm change and improvement to grazing management. In developing a coordinated approach to their operation, the Producer Committees engaged grazing industry researchers, public and private extension practitioners and community groups. This collaboration strengthened local organisations and developed community confidence in the grazing industries.

AB The experiences of participants in the Sustainable Grazing Systems (SGS) Program were examined to understand why more productive and sustainable practices were adopted by producers involved in SGS. This paper explores from a range of perspectives (producers, researchers, extension agents and facilitators) the delivery mechanism that led to these practices being adopted and concludes with a model describing the adoption process observed in SGS. The model describes a continuous 3-stage process of motivation, trialing-exploration and farm practice change. Support for decision making during the transition between each stage of the process was recognised as an essential ingredient for success.

ID MANAGEMENT; PASTURE
AB This paper outlines the development and design of the Sustainable Grazing Systems (SGS) National Experiment from the initial call for expressions of interest, through several workshop processes to the final selection and implementation of its 6 component sites, and the general methodology used at each. Sites were located in Western Australia, western Victoria, north-east Victoria, and on the Central Tablelands, North West Slopes, and the eastern Riverina of New South Wales. Sites in Western Australia, north-east Victoria, the North West Slopes, and the eastern Riverina also had subsites. Methods for the sites and subsites (data collection for pastures, livestock, weather, soils and site characterisation) are presented to provide a central reference, and to save duplication in subsequent papers. Descriptions are provided of the location, average annual rainfall, major pasture, soil and stock types, design and number of treatments, and initial soil levels (0-10 cm) of phosphorus, electrical conductivity, and pH for sites and subsites. Also outlined is the major focus of the research undertaken at each site. While sites studied regionally relevant issues, they operated under a common protocol for data collection with a minimum data set being specified for each of 5 unifying themes: pastures, animal production, water, nutrients, and biodiversity. Economic analyses were also undertaken at the macro- and micro-level, and a procedural tool developed for appraising the on- and off-farm impacts of different systems. To give effect to the themes, common database and modelling tools were developed specifically for the national experiment, so that collectively sites comprised a single experiment.

AB A biophysical simulation model (the Sustainable Grazing Systems Pasture Model) was developed as an integral part of the Sustainable Grazing Systems National Experiment. It was developed to meet the needs of the researchers both for analysing data and processes at individual sites, and for simulating the outcome of these processes operating in generic pasture systems on a range of soil types, under specific grazing managements. The model was designed to reside on the desktops of individual researchers and for those researchers to be part of its development process.
   The Sustainable Grazing Systems Pasture Model incorporates the following: a physiological model of pasture species herbage accumulation in response to climatic conditions; the water balance including evapotranspiration, runoff (surface and subsurface), infiltration and drainage; pasture utilisation by grazing animals; a metabolisable energy-based animal growth model; and organic matter and inorganic nutrient dynamics (for nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium and sulfur) including plant uptake, adsorption, leaching, nitrogen fixation by legumes, and atmospheric nitrogen losses. A range of grazing options (set-stocking, rotational grazing and continuous grazing at a variable rate) is available for ewes and lambs, and wethers. Each of the main modules (water, nutrients, pastures and animals) is interconnected. To avoid bias in the influence of any one module, each is described at about the same level of complexity, with the description of any process being restricted to about 5 parameters. The model is hierarchical in structure and most processes are described in terms of a series of fluxes (or, more specifically, flux densities) that have dimensions of amount per area per time.
   The model can be closely linked to a database specifically developed for the Sustainable Grazing Systems National Experiment to allow easy importing and exporting of climate and experimental data for comparison with model output. This paper gives an overview of the model structure and its output, the process that was used for its development within Sustainable Grazing Systems, and its use by the Sustainable Grazing Systems sites and themes. Comments are provided on the implementation of the development process to assist future programs using a similar approach.

SO AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL AGRICULTURE

AB Relational databases are increasingly used to manage large and complex experimental datasets. This technology was chosen to create a common database tool for a large multi-site experiment which measured aspects of the sustainability of various regionally focused grazing experiments, as part of the Sustainable Grazing Systems Program. Since the data needs of experiments expanded over time and the number of sites and subsites increased, it was necessary to adopt an evolutionary approach to creating the database. It was important that the database be customised to accommodate the wide range of experiments and the diverse needs of the many scientists involved and yet have complete conformity of structure to permit across-site queries. This paper describes the steps taken in this process and suggests how similar database projects could be implemented more efficiently in the future. As most of the scientists involved were initially new users of relational databases, there were some delays in achieving full adoption of a uniform approach to data handling. The software chosen was a commonly available desktop application which was modified using code developed to allow graphical queries, quality assurance of data, and interfacing with a purpose-built simulation model. A survey of users at the end of the project indicated that there was generally a high degree of satisfaction with the relational database developed, but it also identified areas requiring improvement. The need for developing mechanisms of sharing data and of protecting data for possible future use are briefly discussed.

TI A practical framework to evaluate and report combined natural resource
   and production outcomes of agricultural research to livestock producers
SO AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL AGRICULTURE
LA English
DT Article
AB The specifications for this study were set by the need for researchers in the Sustainable Grazing Systems (SGS) Program to have a consistent framework to evaluate experimental results across research sites and to share those results in a comprehensive way with livestock producers, allowing them to consider the full range of outcomes and impacts. To achieve this, the framework needed to account for production, economic and natural resource impacts, and other issues associated with making changes on farms. It also had to be easily applied, and readily understood by all segments of the SGS Program. This approach demanded some elements of pragmatism.
   Economic analysis of production data was based around net cash flow analysis. Spreadsheet programs were written for beef, self-replacing Merino and prime lamb enterprises. These incorporated the capacity to graph results automatically, provide sensitivity analysis tables, and project net cash flow results averaged over a 10-year period. Net cash flows were given for 2 levels of management skills - 'district average' and 'high'.
   Placing dollar values or costs on resource impacts was not as simple and could not be achieved within the practical framework required. A qualitative approach to the evaluation of resource impacts was developed in collaboration with researchers, advisors and collaborating producers. A framework was constructed which allows the likely on- and off-farm impacts of any experimental treatments to be identified and subjectively rated for likely importance.
   A practical tool for integrating and reporting the production and resource impact information was constructed. This captures the net cash flow, the key production data, the off-farm and on-farm impacts and provides an overview assessment of the treatment in a simple table. It provides producers with sufficient information to allow an assessment as to whether adoption of any 'treatment' could improve the profitability and sustainability of their grazing system. This tool was tested across all treatments at the SGS National Experiment sites and found to work well. Examples are presented, covering a range of resource impact and net cash flow combinations.

AB The effect of Tasmanian blue gum (Eucalyptus globulus) belts and kikuyu (Pennisetum clandestinum) grass on livestock production and groundwater recharge was studied in the high rainfall zone (> 600 mm/year) of south-western Western Australia from 1998 to 2001. The objective was to identify optimum combinations of tree belts and pasture for sustainable livestock production and the prevention of secondary salinisation. Treatments were annual pasture, in competition with trees at different orientations (east, west and south), kikuyu pasture in competition with trees at one orientation (west), compared with pasture in the absence of tree competition. Plots had 0, 20 or 36% of their area within 10 m of the tree belt where tree-pasture competition would be expected. Plots (0.48 ha) were stocked with Merino wether hoggets at 12 DSE/ha on annual pastures and 14 DSE/ha on kikuyu pastures. Additional sheep were placed on plots in spring and the annual pasture was destocked in autumn.
   Within the growing season, herbage mass was similar across both control treatments as a result of varying stock numbers. However, in summer and autumn the kikuyu control contained between 350 and 4900 kg DM/ha more herbage than the corresponding annual pasture. While both pastures accumulated similar amounts of herbage in 1998 and 2000, kikuyu accumulated more in 1999 (11900 v. 9800 kg DM/ha) as a result of summer rain. Competition from tree belts significantly reduced adjacent annual pasture herbage accumulation (16% average reduction), although there was no difference among the levels of competition. Trees did not significantly affect adjacent kikuyu pasture herbage accumulation.
   Both carrying capacity and clean wool production per hectare were significantly higher on kikuyu pasture in 1999 and 2000. Tree competition also significantly reduced the carrying capacity of neighbouring annual and kikuyu pasture by an average of 10%. Clean wool production per hectare was significantly lower on annual pasture in combination with trees (11% reduction on average), but there was less effect of competition on kikuyu pasture.
   The kikuyu pasture used 115, 57 and 132 mm more water than the annual pasture in 1999, 2000 and 2001, respectively. The soil water deficit beneath the trees exceeded that below both control pastures by between 297 and 442 mm.
   Although the addition of tree belts to annual pasture provided substantial reductions in groundwater recharge, producers would also have to accept losses in livestock production. While kikuyu alone provided significant increases in livestock production and substantial reductions in groundwater recharge, the best compromise was kikuyu in combination with tree belts.

TI Kikuyu and annual pasture: a characterisation of a productive and
   sustainable beef production system on the South Coast of Western
   Australia
SO AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL AGRICULTURE

AB Production parameters and water use of kikuyu (Pennisetum clandestinum) and annual-based pastures were monitored for a beef weaner production system from 1998 to 2000 in a paddock-scale demonstration on the south-east coast of Western Australia.
   A paired paddock (40-105 ha) comparison was carried out between a kikuyu-based pasture (DSKikuyu) and temperate annual pasture (DSAnnual), with comparative measurements covering pasture production, composition and quality, and soil water deficits and drainage. The stocking rates for the paddocks were determined by the pasture productivity and cow P8 fat depth in the 'lactation phase' (April-December), and by sward management and soil stability imperatives in the 'dry cow phase' (January-March). Cow liveweight and P8 fat depth and calf liveweight were compared during the 'lactation phase'.
   Kikuyu and annual pasture had similar carrying capacities through the 'lactation phase'. Kikuyu pasture carried more animals than annual pasture through the 'dry cow phase' (late summer and autumn) in all years. During late autumn, cattle were destocked from the annual pasture to reduce the risk of wind erosion and 'crash grazed' on the kikuyu pasture so as to reduce competition between kikuyu and regenerating annual grass and legume species.
   The comparative quality and productivity of the kikuyu pasture in the lactation phase (winter and spring) was positively correlated with the level of winter legume present. When a similar level of winter legume was measured in the kikuyu pasture relative to the annual pasture (in 1998), the pasture quality, cow liveweight and condition and calf weaning weights were all comparable between the 2 pasture types. When a low legume component was recorded in the kikuyu pasture, the pasture quality and cow liveweight and condition were poorer than the annual pasture.
   The kikuyu pasture growing on deep sandy soil developed a larger (mean 37 mm) soil water deficit than the annual pasture over the measurement period, and in particular from November to March. When integrated over a farm where kikuyu covers 40% of the total area, as was the case in this experiment, the resulting deep drainage was calculated to be just over half that of an equivalent whole farm of annual pasture.
   Over the 3 years of monitoring, the combined system of annual and kikuyu pasture was calculated to have an annual gross margin 19% higher than the annual pasture alone. The major source of difference was no requirement for supplementary feed in the kikuyu-annual pasture system. This difference was limited however, by lighter post-weaning sale weights of cull cows from the kikuyu pasture in 'poor legume' years. There was no difference of calf weaning weights between treatments.
   There is considerable opportunity to improve on this gross margin, through achieving a consistent strong presence of legume in the kikuyu pasture through winter and spring.

AB The effects of combinations of different fertiliser rates and grazing methods applied to phalaris-based pastures on an acid, saline, yellow sodosol on the Dundas Tablelands of western Victoria (mean annual rainfall 623 mm) were measured from 1997 to 2000. The objective was to help identify management systems that improve phalaris growth and persistence, water use, and animal production, and thereby the productivity and sustainability of grazing systems. Pastures were either set stocked with low [mean 6.4 kg phosphorus (P)/ha. year] or high (mean 25 kg P/ha. year) fertiliser rates, or rotationally grazed with high fertiliser (mean 25 kg P/ha. year). Rotational grazing was implemented as either a simple '4-paddock' system (fixed rotation length), or a more intensive system where rotation length varied with pasture growth rate. Unreplicated paddocks of volunteer pasture (dominated by onion grass and annual grass weeds) receiving an average of 8 kg P/ha. year were also monitored. All treatments were stocked with spring-lambing Merino ewes. Stocking rate was an emergent property of each treatment, and was driven by pasture quality and availability.
   Total pasture herbage accumulation ranged from 7150 to 9750 kg DM/ha. year and was significantly lower on the set-stocked, low-fertility treatment than on all other treatments. A significant treatment day effect in the spline analysis of herbage mass was explained by a trend toward higher pasture mass in the rotationally grazed treatments than set-stocked treatments from the break of season until mid-spring. Rotational grazing led to significantly higher phalaris herbage accumulation than set stocking (mean 3680 v. 2120 kg DM/ha. year), but significantly lower subterranean clover herbage accumulation (1440 v. 2490 kg DM/ha. year). Despite the stronger growth of deep-rooted phalaris in the rotationally grazed treatments, maximum soil water deficits at the end of summer differed only slightly between treatments, with the difference between driest and wettest treatments amounting to only 14 mm. Summer growth of phalaris was apparently insufficient to generate significant differences in soil water extraction at depth, even when phalaris content was increased by rotational grazing, and re-wetting of the soil profile occurred at a similar rate for all treatments. Rotationally grazed treatments supported higher stocking rates than set-stocked treatments at high fertiliser rates (mean 14.9 v. 13.7 ewes/ha), but apparent losses in pasture feeding value due to lower legume content under rotational grazing meant that there were few significant differences between treatments in lamb production per hectare.
   The experiment showed that grazing method can have a substantial and rapid effect on pasture botanical composition. There are clear opportunities for producers to use temporal and spatial combinations of set stocking and rotational grazing to manipulate herbage mass and pasture composition within broad target ranges for achieving both animal production (e.g. high per-head animal performance) and sustainability (e.g. persistence of perennial grasses) objectives. Rigid application of either set stocking or rotational grazing imposes limitations on both pasture and animal production, and neither grazing method will optimise system performance under all conditions. The experiment also demonstrated that management and land-use changes that have much greater potential to increase water use than those examined here will be needed to ensure the sustainability of pasture systems in the high rainfall zone of western Victoria.

AB Water and nutrient losses, pasture and animal production were measured for a prime lamb enterprise at Maindample (rainfall 750 mm/year) and a wool enterprise at Ruffy (rainfall 671 mm/year) in north-east Victoria from 1998 to 2000. Each site comprised 3 paddock-scale treatments: control, unsown pasture receiving about 5 kg phosphorus (P)/ha. year; medium input, sown pasture (about 10 kg P/ha. year); and high input, sown pasture (greater than or equal to 22 kg P/ha. year). Sown pastures were based on phalaris (Phalaris aquatica L.) at Maindample and cocksfoot (Dactylis glomerata L.) at Ruffy, and sheep were set stocked.
   Pastures at Maindample created a larger soil water deficit (commonly about 120 mm) compared with Ruffy (about 70 mm) in summer. Maximum soil water deficit at Maindample occurred under the high input pasture and was about 30 mm greater than the medium or control treatments. Phalaris content ranged between about 200 and 1300 kg DM/ha, between 10 and 70% of total composition (commonly about 20%). In contrast, at Ruffy the control, which had 20-40% native grasses (Austrodanthonia and Microlaena) achieved the greatest soil water deficit, about 25 mm greater than for sown pastures. Cocksfoot persisted poorly at the acid soil at Ruffy. Small differences in green leaf area over summer (about 200 kg DM/ha) between treatments could generate the soil water deficit differences over the summer.
   The most striking result was the markedly different pathways of water loss between surface losses and deep drainage at the 2 sites, which was of greater consequence than the effect of pasture type. At Maindample, on average, 166 mm of water was lost annually (22% of rainfall) with 110 mm of this as surface runoff. At Ruffy, annual water loss was 128 mm (19% of rainfall) with 110 mm of this total water loss estimated as loss through deep drainage.
   Phosphorus losses were low in all treatments (less than or equal to1 kg P/ha. year), and nitrate-N (NO3-N) losses (7-12 kg N/ha. year) were comparable with previous work. Concentrations of P in water were highest from the high treatments at both sites, averaging 0.91 and 0.83 mg P/L in surface runoff from Maindample high and Ruffy high treatments, respectively. Average soil water NO3-N concentrations ranged from 3 to 26 mg N/L. Both P and N concentrations were higher than acceptable for aquatic health.
   Environmental risks in terms of water and nutrient losses could be either higher or lower for sown than unsown pastures, depending upon soil type, botanical stability, persistence and the soil water extracting ability of the pasture. Results indicated that better environmental outcomes could be achieved if soil types were targeted for particular land uses. High management skills are needed if grazing enterprises are to be both profitable and have lower off-site impacts.

AB The effects of application of superphosphate and grazing on production and botanical composition of native grasslands were investigated at 3 locations in the high rainfall zone of south-east Australia. These studies were conducted as part of the Sustainable Grazing Systems Key Program, which investigated various aspects of grassland productivity and sustainability between 1996 and 2001. Grasslands in this study either had high contents of Themeda australis or Austrodanthonia spp., or were based on a degraded Austrodanthonia spp. grassland with a high content of annual and weedy species. All sites used increasing levels of superphosphate application (nil, low, medium and high) as treatments, with clover being added in some treatments at 1 site, and herbicide in 1 treatment at another site. Grazing (sheep) was continuous at 1 site (with stocking rates matched to pasture productivity) and intermittent at other sites, with grazing being dictated by available herbage between defined trigger points. Climate was monitored and changes in soil P, herbage mass, botanical composition, ground cover and sheep production recorded. Changes in composition resulting from the treatments varied between sites. At the continuously grazed Austrodanthonia spp. site, there was a decline in native perennial grasses throughout the experiment and an increase in exotic annual grasses in spring where superphosphate was applied. The grassland at the T. australis site remained relatively stable, which may have been due to the limited amount of grazing applied. The degraded Austrodanthonia spp. grassland showed wide seasonal fluctuations in annual species. There were no clear effects of treatments at the latter 2 sites. Sheep production increased with increased superphosphate application at the continuously grazed Austrodanthonia spp. site, but there was little effect at the other 2 sites. Recommendations are made for sustainable management of native grasslands depending on their current botanical state.

AB Pasture degradation is a major issue in the high rainfall zone (>600 mm) of temperate Australia. Characterised by a decline in the perennial grass component, this degradation is responsible for reduced livestock production and implicated in environmental problems, such as dryland salinity, through changed water-use patterns. This paper reports on a multi-disciplinary research program conducted at Carcoar in central New South Wales, one of 6 sites that comprised the Sustainable Grazing Systems National Experiment. The aim of the experiment was to develop more profitable and sustainable pasture systems by evaluating the impact of changes in the perennial grass component on animal production and water-use patterns. Tactical management strategies were evaluated on naturalised and sown perennial grass pastures and on chicory (Cichorium intybus), using a Merino ewe-based first cross lamb enterprise. Data presented showed that grazing deferment over summer, combined with reduced stocking rate, increased perenniality and reduced annual grass weeds compared with continuous grazing. Livestock performance, however, did not always follow trends in available perennial herbage mass. Naturalised and sown pastures were suitable for raising prime lambs, but only chicory had the capacity to finish lambs to market specification without supplementation. With respect to water-use patterns, sown perennial pastures were more successful than naturalised pastures in reducing leakage of water from the root zone, although this seemed to be related mostly to the abundance of the perennial grass in the pasture. From a sustainability perspective, continuously grazed pastures generated higher net cash flows, but had negative environmental impacts, whereas tactically grazed pastures had positive on- and off-farm impacts but lower net cash flows. The implications of these findings for incorporation into future management strategies for sustainable production in high rainfall environments are discussed.

AB A study was conducted on a native pasture ( dominated by redgrass, Bothriochloa macra) in the Barraba district of northern New South Wales to examine the effects of 5 grazing treatments on total herbage mass, litter mass, basal cover, ground cover, sheep liveweight, wool production and soil water content ( SWC, mm) at different depths. Plots were grazed with Merino wethers and data were collected from spring 1997 to spring 2001 and analysed to determine the effects of treatments on both production and sustainability. Five grazing treatments were applied in a randomised 3 replicate design. Grazing treatments were: continuous grazing at 4 and 6 sheep/ha ( C4 and C6), continuous grazing at 8 sheep/ha, with subterranean clover ( Trifolium subterraneum) oversown and fertiliser applied (C8+ sub), and, rotational grazing at an annual stocking rate of 4 sheep/ha with pasture grazed for 4 weeks and rested for 4 weeks ( R4/ 4), or rested for 12 weeks ( R4/ 12).
   Total herbage mass declined in the C4 ( control) treatment throughout the experiment and, compared with this treatment, the C6 treatment had less ( P< 0.007) linear trend over time, while the R4/ 12 treatment had a greater ( P< 0.001) linear trend. Stocking rates could not be maintained in the C4 and C6 treatments and sheep were supplementary fed or removed from these treatments for a total of 133 and 263 days, respectively. For ground cover, the linear trend was greater ( P< 0.05) in the C8+ sub, R4/ 4, and R4/ 12 treatments compared with the continuously grazed C4 and C6 treatments and for litter mass this trend was also greater ( P< 0.05) for the R4/ 12 treatment than the C4 treatment. Basal cover of wiregrass (Aristida ramosa), wallaby grass ( Austrodanthonia spp.) and windmill grass (Chloris truncata) was not affected by grazing treatment but for redgrass the linear trend was greater ( P< 0.05) in the C8+ sub, R4/ 4, and R4/ 12 treatments compared with the C4 and C6 treatments. Sheep liveweight (kg/head) was greater ( P< 0.001) in the C8+ sub treatment compared with the C4 treatment. Annual wool production (kg/head) was also higher ( P< 0.05) in the C8+ sub treatment compared with all other treatments. Compared with the C4 treatment, significant differences in soil water content occurred in the R4/ 12 and C8+ sub treatments, but these were predicted to be only 2.9 mm per year for the R4/12 treatment (0 - 30 cm depth) and 5.7 mm per year for the C8+ sub treatment ( 30 - 170 cm).
   Use of a biophysical model indicated that evapotranspiration was the largest output term in the soil water balance and that both drainage and surface runoff of water were episodic events. A sustainability index derived from economic ( equivalent annual net return ($/ha) for a 10-year period), animal production, pasture, soil health and soil water data indicated that the C4 and C6 treatments had the lowest scores for each of these parameters and the lowest overall indices. These scores were highly correlated with subjective assessments of the impact of the treatments (r = 0.93). Overall, these data indicated substantial benefits of either rotationally grazing or the addition of fertiliser and subterranean clover to the production and sustainability of the native pasture studied.

   PROGRAM
AB As part of the Sustainable Grazing Systems (SGS) National Experiment a study was conducted on a native pasture in the Manilla district of northern New South Wales to examine the effects of 5 grazing treatments on total herbage mass, litter mass, basal cover, ground cover, sheep liveweight, wool production and soil water content (SWC, mm) at different depths. The pasture was a mixture of native perennial grasses, with redgrass (Bothriochloa macra) and wiregrass (Aristida ramosa) dominant on a red Chromosol soil type and bluegrass (Dichanthium sericeum) on a brown Vertosol. Wallaby grasses ( Austrodanthonia richardsonii and A. bipartita) were common on both soils. Plots were grazed with Merino wethers and data collected from spring 1997 to spring 2001 were analysed to determine the effect of treatments on both production and sustainability. Five grazing treatments were applied in a randomised 3 replicate design. Grazing treatments were: continuous grazing at 3.1 and 6.2 sheep/ ha (C3 and C6), continuous grazing at 9.2 sheep/ ha, with subterranean clover ( Trifolium subterraneum) oversown and fertiliser applied (C9+ sub) and rotational grazing at an annual stocking rate of 3.1 sheep/ ha with pasture grazed for 4 weeks and rested for 4 weeks (R4/4), or rested for 12 weeks (R4/12).
   Over time, treatments had no significant effect on either total pasture herbage mass ( compared with the C3 control) or the basal cover of the major perennial grasses. Treatments had inconsistent significant effects on ground cover, litter mass, sheep liveweight and wool production (kg/head) over time. Compared with all other treatments ground cover was less ( P< 0.05) in the C6 treatment in only May and September 2000 and litter mass less ( P< 0.05) in only December 1998 and March 1999. Treatment sheep liveweights were not significantly different from the C3 treatment from September 1997 to 1999. However, from October 1999 to October 2001 sheep liveweight in the C6 treatment was significantly less than in the C3 treatment, while in the C9+ sub and R4/12 treatments it was significantly greater than the control. In 1999, wool production per head was higher ( P< 0.05) in the C9+ sub and R4/12 treatments compared with all other treatments but treatment differences were not significant in all other years. Significant differences in SWC only occurred at the 0 - 30 cm depth between the C3 and the C6 and R4/12 treatments, but were predicted to be < 1.5 mm/year. A sustainability index derived from economic [ equivalent annual net return ($/ha) for a 10-year period], animal production, pasture, soil health and soil water data indicated that the overall indices were lowest for the C3, C6 and C9+ sub treatments and highest for the R4/4 and R4/12 treatments.

AB Eleven experimental sites in the Sustainable Grazing Systems (SGS) national experiment were established in the high rainfall zone (HRZ, > 600 mm/year) of Western Australia, Victoria and New South Wales to measure components of the water balance, and pathways of water movement, for a range of pastures from 1997 to 2001. The effect of widely spaced river red gums ( Eucalyptus camaldulensis) in pasture, and of belts of plantation blue gums ( E. globulus), was studied at 2 of the sites. The soil types tested ranged from Kurosols, Chromosols and Sodosols, with different subsoil permeabilities, to Hydrosols and Tenosols. The pasture types tested were kikuyu (Pennisetum clandestinum), phalaris ( Phalaris aquatica), redgrass ( Bothriochloa macra) and annual ryegrass ( Lolium rigidum), with subterranean clover ( Trifolium subterraneum) included. Management variables were set stocking v. rotational grazing, adjustable stocking rates, and level of fertiliser input. Soil, pasture and animal measurements were used to set parameters for the biophysical SGS pasture model, which simulated the long-term effects of soil, pasture type, grazing method and management on water use and movement, using as inputs daily weather data for 31 years from selected sites representing a range of climates.
   Measurements of mean maximum soil water deficit S-m were used to estimate the probability of surplus water occurring in winter, and the average amount of this surplus, which was highest ( 97 - 201 mm/ year) for pastures in the cooler, winter-rainfall dominant regions of north-east and western Victoria and lowest ( 3 - 11 mm/ year) in the warmer, lower rainfall regions of the eastern Riverina and Esperance, Western Australia. Kikuyu in Western Australia achieved the largest increase in Sm compared with annual pasture ( 55 - 71 mm), while increases due to phalaris were 18 - 45 mm, and those of native perennials were small and variable. Long-term model simulations suggested rooting depth was crucial in decreasing deep drainage, to about 50 mm/ year for kikuyu rooting to 2.5 m, compared with 70 - 200 mm/ year for annuals rooting to only 0.8 m. Plantation blue gums dried the soil profile to 5.25 m by an average of 400 mm more than kikuyu pasture, reducing the probability of winter surplus water to zero, and eliminating drainage below the root zone. Widely spaced river red gums had a much smaller effect on water use, and would need to number at least 14 trees per hectare to achieve extra soil drying of about 50 mm over a catchment. Soil type affected water use primarily through controlling the rooting depth of the vegetation, but it also changed the partitioning of surplus water between runoff and deep drainage. Strongly duplex soils such as Sodosols shed 50% or more surplus water as runoff, which is important for flushing streams, provided the water is of good quality. Grazing method and pasture management had only a marginal effect in increasing water use, but could have a positive effect on farm profitability through increased livestock production per hectare and improved persistence of perennial species.

   RESPONSES
AB To assess the risks and benefits of more intensive pasture management, 2 or 3 treatments with contrasting fertiliser regimes were selected from each site of the Sustainable Grazing Systems national experiment. The assessment used soil coring data, modelling and runoff nutrient concentration data.
   Soil acidification rates were estimated from the simulated nitrate leaching and product removal estimated from the stocking rates at each site. Much higher acidification rates were estimated at sites in Victoria and southern Western Australia than in northern New South Wales. This was because of a lower level of nitrate leaching in summer-dominant rainfall environments coupled with lower stocking rates. Simulations showed highest nitrate leaching on annual pastures, but that a phalaris pasture could reduce this, and a kikuyu pasture could almost fully control leaching.
   The concentration of P in surface runoff was related to soil P status at the 4 southern sites, indicating that greater use of P fertiliser would increase P movement into waterways. There was no relationship between soil P status and P in surface runoff at the northern New South Wales sites, and across all sites there were no relationships between P fertility and runoff N levels. Concentrations of P and N in runoff greatly exceeded stream water quality guidelines, even on treatments where only minimal P had been applied as fertiliser. There was also evidence of high spatial variation in surface runoff generation, with surface runoff from some plots less than 5% of the streamflow in nearby reference streams. There is therefore scope to control P concentrations in streams by retiring from production the parts of the landscape that generate high quantities of surface flow, but to intensify production on areas that produce little runoff.

   EXPERIMENT; ANIMAL PRODUCTION; BOTANICAL COMPOSITION; PERENNIAL PASTURES
AB The Sustainable Grazing Systems (SGS) National Experiment ( NE) Pasture Theme explored factors that influenced annual herbage accumulation and perennial grass and legume content across the NE sites, in the high rainfall zone (HRZ, > 600 mm/ year annual rainfall) of southern Australia using multi-variate analysis and the SGS Pasture Model.
   Annual rainfall was a poor predictor of annual herbage accumulation. The length of growing season accounted for 30% of the variation in annual herbage accumulation. Much of the remaining 70% of variation in annual herbage accumulation was explained by soil Olsen P, the proportion of native species in the pasture and stocking rate, together with interactions among other factors including legume content. Simulated effects of set stocking and rotational grazing on herbage accumulation using the SGS Pasture Model, predicted that rotational grazing was unlikely to result in large increases in herbage accumulation. In contrast, it was predicted that the adoption of deep-rooted C-3 and C-4 perennial grasses could provide useful increases in herbage accumulation.
   Perennial grass content and basal cover were both significantly influenced by growing season length ( P< 0.001), grazing method ( P< 0.001) and an interaction between stocking rate and soil pH ( P = 0.002). These analyses suggested that to maintain or improve the perennial grass component of a pasture at medium - high stocking rates, it was crucial to adopt grazing strategies that included rotation or resting. Perennial grass percent also significantly ( P< 0.001) increased in response to ameliorating the soil pH. Legume content of pastures significantly ( P< 0.001) increased in response to set stocking and increased stocking rate.
   To be botanically stable and productive, sown pastures based on perennial grasses in the HRZ of southern Australia will need to be grazed at high stocking rates ( 15 - 23 DSE/ha) in combination with rotational grazing or resting, and with adequate soil P. Additional gains in production and stability could be obtained by ensuring an adequate legume component, including a C4 perennial grass and ameliorating soil acidity. Pastures based on native perennial grasses may require lower soil P and more conservative stocking rates, depending on species.

AB The relationships between productivity and plant species diversity were assessed using data from the Sustainable Grazing Systems (SGS) 10 national experiment sites. Each site applied up to 7 different management treatments. Sites varied in the amount of data available for analysis. Plant species diversity was assessed in terms of both the total and native species present at each site. More than 200 plant taxa were recorded over the period of the experiment, about one-third of which were native. In the majority of cases, the native species present within a treatment remained there throughout the experiments, even when fertilised and oversown with introduced species. The number of native species increased by 1 or 2 over the 3 - 4 years of each experiment where grasslands were less intensively used ( average herbage mass > 2 t DM/ha), but decreased in more heavily grazed treatments. Native grasses made much greater contributions to herbage mass than other native species. Of the more than 70 native plant species found, the most numerous were broadleaf species, which tended to be more variable under management treatments. As total species richness increased, there was a tendency for pasture productivity to be less, for the mean standing herbage mass to be less and for seasonal growth to be less stable. This depended upon experiments and tended to apply at the sites with higher annual pasture growth rates. All treatments had > 10 plant species within the small ( about 1.5 ha) paddocks used and larger paddocks often had many more. It was apparent from the high plant species richness at each site ( about 25 - 100 species) that many more niches exist in these paddocks than the number of species usually sown in a pasture. Opportunities to redesign pasture mixtures to exploit more of the resources available obviously exist. Understanding of the relationships among management practices, productivity and plant species diversity is limited, but will become important as we seek more sustainable grazing systems. The studies analysed here suggested that where the herbage mass was maintained between 2 and 4 t DM/ha then species were maintained and productivity was optimised.

   PASTURES; MANAGEMENT; PERSISTENCE
AB The effects of various grazing management systems on sown, naturalised, and native pastures were studied at 6 different locations in the temperate high rainfall zone (HRZ, > 600 mm rainfall/ year) of southern Australia, as part of the Sustainable Grazing Systems (SGS) Program. The treatments examined had different pasture species and fertiliser management, with grazing method ranging from set stocking ( continuous grazing) to rotation with rests based on pre- and post- grazing herbage mass or season and plant phenology. Sites were located at: Albany, Western Australia; Manilla, Barraba, Nundle, New South Wales; ( grazed by wethers); and Carcoar, New South Wales; Maindample, Ruffy, north- east Victoria; Vasey, western Victoria; ( grazed by ewes and lambs).
   Grazing method significantly (P< 0.001) influenced stocking rate ( expressed as dry sheep equivalents (DSE)/ ha), but effects were not consistent across sites. At Vasey the stocking rate of the rotation treatments ranged from 5 to 23% higher than the set stocked treatments depending upon year. For all sites, significant factors ( P< 0.001) affecting stocking rate were soil Olsen P, soil pH, grazing management ( resting), legume percent, and an index of growing season effectiveness. Although total annual rainfall had a significant effect ( P< 0.002) in an initial analysis, its influence became non- significant ( P> 0.05), when a growing season index ( P< 0.001) was used. Non- significant ( P> 0.05) factors included solar radiation, annual average temperature, fertiliser applied in the current year, and average annual perennial and broadleaf percent composition.
   The implications of these data for productivity and sustainability ( as assessed by perenniality and water use) were encouraging. Generally, there were positive relationships between increased stocking rate and the probability of achieving a zero mm soil water surplus in winter, and between increased productivity and the proportion of perennial grass species where extremes of treatments were compared at each site. The results indicate that stocking rate can be increased without jeopardising sustainability, that grazing management can bring about more sustainable pastures, that there is scope to increase productivity particularly through increasing soil fertility, and growing season length can be used to predict potential carrying capacity. These are positive outcomes that graziers in the HRZ of southern Australia can use to enhance productivity ( thus profitability) and sustainability.

AB The Sustainable Grazing Systems (SGS) National Experiment used 13 innovative research and development integrating processes to combine 6 diverse research sites across the southern high rainfall zone into a single, integrated experiment. Sites collected a common data set about the productivity and sustainability of grazing systems, so that issues beyond the site level could be explored. Essential to this approach were database and modelling tools that enabled across-site issues to be examined by a mix of conventional data analyses and modelling scenarios. This had not been previously attempted at this scale for the Australian grazing industries.
   Major outcomes from the individual site and theme analyses were tabulated, providing a comprehensive summary of the SGS National Experiment research findings. Many of the research findings were new, and overall the SGS National Experiment improved our understanding of the processes operating in grazing systems and their interactions. The main conclusion from this substantive study was that graziers can use a combination of strategies to enhance the productivity and sustainability of their pastures, such as sowing deep-rooted perennial grasses, enhanced soil fertility, amelioration of low soil pH, and grazing methods that include rotation and rest.
   Since the SGS National Experiment was itself an experiment, participants were surveyed to assess the integrating processes used, their implementation, and leadership and influence within the SGS National Experiment research group. Researchers rated the 13 innovative research and development processes for their potential to improve research and for the extent to which the processes were effectively implemented within SGS. The average potential score was 8.2 ( out of 10). Four integrating processes had a potential score greater than or equal to 9.0: the investment in a communication and product development year ( the 'harvest year'); a common database structure across all sites; the use of themes to integrate across sites; and the use of protocols and minimum datasets to guide the research and data collection. We discuss possible ways to make these processes more effective. While 18 researchers had defined and active leadership roles from the outset of the SGS National Experiment, 2 researchers dominated the scientific influence and leadership.
   Despite some implementation problems with the SGS National Experiment processes, internal and external reviews indicated that the SGS National Experiment met most of its goals and objectives. Because of the processes implemented, the SGS National Experiment framework has provided a new benchmark for conducting large-scale rural research in Australia.

TI Key features of the regional producer network for enabling social
   learning
SO AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL AGRICULTURE
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper outlines a form of research and extension that involves producers, researchers, program administrators, facilitators and others with an interest in on-farm, natural resource management and production improvement. Drawing predominantly from a review of the Sustainable Grazing Systems ( SGS) regional producer network involving 88 interviews with producers, managers and scientists and in-depth studies of 4 SGS regional producer committees, findings advocate the establishment of arrangements where producers are in control of research and development to maximise learning and on-ground change. The justification for this need is based on the principle that major change will not occur unless the theories of those people whose practices are most affected by research and development outcomes are dominant in the research and development approach itself. In this way, research and development responds to the context in which change is to take place. Additionally, the SGS regional producer network provided a broad framework that enabled producers and other people to come together and actively learn from each other in a non-threatening environment. This approach provided a learning environment that was essentially directed by and for producers.

ID MANAGEMENT
AB The Sustainable Grazing Systems (SGS) Program has assisted producers in the high rainfall zone ( HRZ, annual rainfall > 600 mm/ year) of southern Australia, by developing and delivering more productive and sustainable grazing systems. It was evaluated by 2 external surveys - a benchmarking survey in 1994 before the start of SGS, and a follow-up survey of producers in 2001. The 2001 survey showed that SGS had assisted red meat and wool producers in southern Australia make significant and beneficial changes to their grazing systems.
   Substantial changes in grazing practices occurred between 1994 and 2001in the HRZ. These changes included an increase in the number of producers who rotationally graze ( 25%), as well as those undertaking practices aimed at improved pasture management. Participants in SGS were more likely to have made changes to their grazing systems than non-participants. There were no overt differences between regions in producer demographics, or changes made to management practices.
   The survey confirmed SGS had achieved its goal. Sixty percent of producers in the target regions were aware of SGS ( out of a total of 23689 producers); 42% ( 9839) had some involvement with SGS and/or received the SGS magazine 'Prograzier'; while 26% ( 6141) actively participated in SGS through undertaking a PROGRAZE course, and/or by attending regional SGS activities.
   Of the estimated 9839 producers who participated in the program, up to 8000 made beneficial changes to enhance the productivity and sustainability of their grazing operations. Active participants ( 6141) attributed many of these benefits to their involvement in SGS.

TI Identifying social spaces in the Sustainable Grazing Systems Program
SO AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL AGRICULTURE
LA English
DT Article
AB In this paper I will establish that the SGS constituted not one, but many interrelated social spaces within which the science performance was undertaken. These different social spaces comprised their own unique boundaries, their own narratives, and their own contestations and negotiations between SGS actors. The implications of the claims made in this paper are pertinent to analysts of science attempting to understand the social dynamics involved in complex research programs common in today's research environment. The notion of single arenas, agoras, fields or other social spaces of contestation attempting to embrace the full complexity of science performance, as discussed in much of the sociology of science literature, is too simplistic to adequately deal with the multi-dimensional and temporal nature of the social relations involved in modern science. This paper moves away from such notions and shines light on science in practice within multiple social spaces.

AB The Sustainable Grazing Systems (SGS) Program operated across the high rainfall zone (HRZ, annual rainfall > 600 mm/year) of southern Australia from July 1996 to June 2001. An additional year ( the harvest year) was added, to provide time for focussed analysis and product development. A survey of livestock producers across the HRZ confirmed achievement of the goal that at least 2000 producers adopted ( and a further 5000 were trialing) more profitable and sustainable grazing systems as a result of the program.
   SGS was established to address declining pasture productivity and emerging environmental problems in the grazing systems of the HRZ, and though initially focussed on the twin goals of profitability and sustainability, the program evolved to formally include social issues and the full 'triple bottom line' approach. Within SGS, success was defined as the extent to which the program was able to assist the grazing industries build financial, social and environmental capital.
   The suite of papers in this Special Edition provides a comprehensive account of the research and extension 'results' from the SGS Program. Rather than summarising those results, this paper reviews and reflects on the triple bottom line outcomes; the contribution of SGS to the elements of a sustainable grazing system; the impact of grazing method on production and sustainability; and the outcomes from the harvest year. The final section examines the SGS structures and processes that most contributed to the success of the program and advances some suggestions for improvements to future R, D E programs.

AB The microstructure of the mesocarp pithy tissue and short-length fibres of 2 differently processed coconut coir dusts from Mexico and Sri Lanka was studied using scanning electron microscopy and compared with that of a Sphagnum moss peat. Selected physical properties of these materials were also determined for their use in potting media. The 2 coir dusts did not significantly differ in the microstructural parameters studied, whereas they differed remarkably in their particle size and therefore in their physical properties. Pithy tissue was the major constituent of coir dust. Coarse pithy tissue particles (larger than 1 mm) were highly porous, with an internal porosity of 41.0% by volume. These particles exhibited round-shaped external pores which ranged in diameter from 30 to 80 mum, with an average of 44.3 mum, and which accounted for a relative surface porosity of about 40.9%. By contrast, the cells of Sphagnum peat moss leaves showed oval-shaped pores of 20.1 x 11.5 mum, which accounted for a relative surface porosity of only 12.0%. The internal porosity of peat moss leaves was 51.1% by volume. The retting process (soaking in water) applied to the coconut husks in Sri Lanka partially degraded the pithy tissue and coir fibres. Coir dust from Mexico showed lower water-holding capacity and higher aeration than peat, whereas air-water relationships in coir dust from Sri Lanka were similar to those in peat. Although differences observed in microstructure and porosity characteristics could explain the differential physical properties of the three materials studied, the major reason was the different size distribution of their constituent particles.

TI Anthelmintic resistance in sheep nematodes in Australia: the need for
   new approaches

   TRICHOSTRONGYLID INFECTIONS; THIABENDAZOLE-RESISTANCE; WESTERN DISTRICT;
   HELMINTH CONTROL; MERINO SHEEP; SELECTION; PARASITES
AB Sheep worm infections increasingly threaten the profitability of the Australian sheep industry as the prevalence and severity of anthelmintic resistance continues to rise. Field experiments have demonstrated that the use of drenches that are of reduced efficacy due to resistance can reduce wool production by 10% and significantly reduce sheep sale value. The major factor in benzimidazole (BZ) and levamisole (LV) resistance, and in part macrocyclic lactone (ML) resistance in Haemonchus contortus, is considered to be the excessive frequency of treatment. In Ostertagia circumcincta, ML resistance appears to be related chiefly to interactions between the environment and the time of treatment, where resistant worms surviving drenches are not significantly diluted by worms acquired after treatment. Resistance to the BZs and LV affects almost all Australian sheep farms, and on most drench efficacy is now below a useful level. ML resistance is common in O. circumcincta in Western Australia, and increasingly prevalent in H. contortus in summer rainfall regions. Closantel resistance is a major threat to H. contortus control in northern New South Wales and southern Queensland. The organophosphate naphthalophos, especially when used in combination with other compounds, has proved useful although variable in efficacy. It is essential that the sheep industry adopts approaches that minimise reliance on chemical control, such as the breeding of worm resistant sheep, use of specific grazing strategies for worm control and flock treatment tactics to minimise further resistance development. New non-chemical technologies under development are also expected to contribute to more sustainable worm control. Nutritional regimens that minimise the impact of worm infections and enhance the immune response require investigation and integration into sustainable control practices.

AB Sustainable control of gastrointestinal nematode parasitism requires optimisation of protective mucosal immunity. This may involve controlling predisposing factors, of which nutrition is the easiest to manipulate, or immuno-enhancement, including that by dietary components. Minerals are 1 type of dietary component with the potential to alter regulation of mucosal immunity to parasites.
   In addition to more specific functions, both major and trace elements have wide-ranging roles in the activity of enzyme systems, with the potential to affect immunity via a number of pathways. While there is little reported work on the effects of minerals on mucosal immunity of ruminants, some important principles can be drawn from this work. These are discussed with work on immunity in general. Also indicated is the future research needed to explain the role of minerals in immunity to internal parasites and to permit the application of this understanding to on-farm situations.

AB Large quantities of wastewater are generated from municipal and industrial sources in New Zealand. More stringent discharge standards and recent improvements in wastewater treatment technology have contributed to the production of large quantities of solid residuals. Increasing public, cultural, and regulatory pressures to protect water quality have resulted in significant interest in applying residuals to plantation forests.
   In a well-managed land application site, the forest ecosystem can efficiently handle organic contaminants and recycle nutrients provided through the residuals, resulting in significant increase in plant growth. Due to large variations in characteristics of different residuals, land application system design must be tailored to match a particular residual with the assimilation capacities of a particular soil-plant system. In New Zealand, many wastewater irrigation systems are employed in forested land as an alternative treatment of liquid residuals. In recent years,large-scale forested land application of municipal and pulp and paper industrial solid residuals have also increased as a preferred alternative to landfilling. It has been suggested that natural abundance of N-15 can be used to trace the fate of residual-derived N in the ecosystems. This technique can resolve one of the main environmental concerns associated with application of residuals in forested land, namely nitrate leaching. Intensive research indicates that significant economic and social benefits can be achieved with minimal adverse impact on the receiving environment.
   This paper provides an overview of the research issues associated with application of residuals on forested soils in New Zealand, such as sustainability, beneficial effects, and potential adverse impacts on soil and environmental quality. Performances of 4 case studies, representing application of 2 liquid residuals and 2 solid residuals to forested soils in New Zealand, are discussed.

AB Plants pump large amounts of water, solutes, and organic matter as part of their normal physiological processes. This pumping action can be exploited to improve degraded environments by stabilising, removing, or breaking-down contaminants in the substrates. In addition, soil amendments such as fertilisers and microbes may also be added to enhance the efficacy of the operation. Basic plant physiology sets limits on the capacity of phytoremediation. However, combining this technology with the production of saleable products may render the extra time needed for clean-up relatively unimportant. Phytoremediation is still poorly developed, particularly the phytoextraction of heavy metals. Continual innovation will greatly expand the scope and efficacy of phytoremediation. The greatest potential use for this technology may be in developing countries that have the highest levels of environmental degradation, and scant funds for remediation. Phytoremediation could provide a low-cost and sustainable way to improve local economies. Here a case study is reported on the phytoremediation of a 3.6 ha sawdust pile that was leaching unacceptable amounts of boron (B) into local waterways. High water-use poplars were used to control leaching and potentially remove B from the site via phytoextraction. Selected trees that are coppiced before leaf-fall could be mulched and used to provide 'organic' B on nearby orchards that are deficient in this element.

AB A 15-year experiment in a clayey Red-Yellow Podzolic in the tropical highlands of Vicosa, Brazil, was studied in 2000, aiming to evaluate the impact of different management systems ( no tillage, disk plowing, heavy scratcher + disk plowing, and heavy scratched) on the total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (TN), and several organic carbon pools. A natural forest, adjacent to the experimental area, was used as reference. The greatest TOC and TN as well as microbial biomass C (C-MB), light fraction C (C-FL), and labile organic carbon ( CL) stocks were observed in the Atlantic Forest, compared with all other systems. The long-term cultivation (+/-70 years) of this area, prior to the installation of the experiment, has led to soil degradation, slowing the C recovery. No tillage had the higher C and N stocks and greater C-L pool at the surface (0 - 10 cm), indicating improvement in soil nutrient status, although none of the systems presented potential to sequester C-CO2. Sustainable tropical agricultural systems should involve high residue input and conservative soil management in order to act as a C-CO2 sink. The C stocks in the C-MB, C-FL, and C-L compartments were more reduced in relation to the natural vegetation with higher intensity management than the TOC stocks. This result indicates that these C compartments are more sensitive to changes in the soil management.

AB Growing awareness of the pressure on land resources emphasises the need to understand the full range of processes operating in human-impacted agroecosystems. In such systems one of the greatest threats to long-term sustainability is the erosion and depauperation of soil, which, until recently, was attributed almost entirely to water erosion. This study builds on recent awareness of the significance of tillage erosion and presents the results of an experimental investigation of tillage erosion due to mouldboard ploughing. Aluminium cubes were used to trace soil translocation as a result of a single pass of the plough perpendicular to the contour in downslope and upslope directions. In common with others studies, translocation was found to be directly proportional to slope tangent for downslope tillage and unrelated to slope for upslope tillage. The influence of non-topographic variables on the relationship between translocation distance and slope was partially filtered out by using the ratio of translocation distances in the tillage direction and perpendicular to tillage. Shallow plough depths of 0.17 m produced tillage detachment of only 230 kg/m(2); however, a high tillage translocation coefficient of 1.16 m/pass resulted in a soil flux coefficient of 265 kg/m. pass. The high tillage translocation coefficient is probably partly due to the loose nature of the regularly cultivated loessic soil, however, on the basis of comparison with other published studies, it is suggested that the high tillage speed of 7 km/h is the principal control on the magnitude of the coefficient. Analysis of the available data suggests that a 30% reduction in tillage erosion intensity could be obtained by reduction of the tillage speed to 4 km/h; nevertheless, more experimental work is needed to test this suggestion. On the transect studied, a pair of opposing passes of the mouldboard plough would produce erosion rates as high as 5.1 kg/m(2). year (51 t/ha. year) from shoulder slope elements and as high as 1.9 kg/m(2). year (19 t/ha. year) over half of the slope length. This pattern matched closely the distribution of Cs-137-derived erosion rates documented previously for a nearby field, suggesting that for this environment, as for many mechanised agricultural systems, tillage erosion is the dominant soil redistribution process and the greatest threat to long-term sustained on-site productivity. Reduction of tillage erosion should, therefore, be seen as a priority in the development of sustainable land management strategies.

AB Soil acidity has been of major concern in Australia since European settlement. Acidification processes have been accelerated due to agricultural activities such as N fertiliser application and leguminous N- fixation in farm rotations. In this paper, we measured the acid buffering capacity ( pHBC) of Vertosols, soils used predominantly for growing cotton in northern New South Wales. The pHBC values were used to calculate decrease in soil pH assuming net acid input due to agricultural practices. We combined the acidification results with geostatistics to spatially simulate the decline in soil pH of surface soils over time. The results indicate that it would take 10 - 417 years for soil pH to decrease by 1 unit on an assumed acid input of 5 kmol H+/ ha. year. Soil pH will drop by 1 unit within 100 years for 90% of the soils and within 15 years for 10% of the soils. This reflects the variability of the pHBC for the studied soils. In 50 years from present, most of the eastern and north- western parts of the study region may become highly acidic with soil pH declining to 5.5. There may be a potential threat to sustainable agriculture from acidification in the region, although more work needs to be done to corroborate the counter- effects of water fluxes and carbonate dissolution. Sensitivity analysis indicates that even at low levels of acid input, some areas in the study region may experience significant decline in soil pH in the surface layer.

AB Soil carbon is an important component of the global carbon cycle with an estimated pool of soil organic carbon of about 1500 Gt. There are few estimates of the pool of inorganic carbon, but it is thought to be approximately 50% of the organic carbon pool. There is no detailed study on the estimation of the soil carbon pool for Australian soils.
   In order to quantify the carbon pools and to determine the extent of spatial variability in the organic and inorganic carbon pools, 120 soil cores were taken down to a depth of 0.90 m from a typical cotton field in northern NSW. Three cores were also taken from nearby virgin bushland and these samples were used as paired samples. Each soil core was separated into 4 samples, i. e. 0 - 0.15, 0.15 - 0.30, 0.30 - 0.60, and 0.60 - 0.90 m. Soil organic carbon was determined by wet oxidation and inorganic carbon content was determined using the difference between total carbon and organic carbon, and confirmed by the acid dissolution method. Total carbon was measured using a LECO CHN analyser.
   Soil organic carbon of the field constituted 62% ( 0 - 0.15 m), 58% ( 0.15 - 0.30 m), 60% ( 0.30 - 0.60 m), and 67% ( 0.60 - 0.90 m) of the total soil carbon. The proportion of inorganic carbon in total carbon is higher than the global average of 32%. Organic carbon content was relatively higher in the deeper layers (> 0.30 m) of the studied soils ( Vertosols) compared with other soil types of Australia. The carbon content varied across the field; however, there was little correlation between the soil types ( grey, red, or intergrade colour) and carbon content. The total soil carbon pool of the studied field was estimated to be about 78 t/ ha for 0 - 0.90 m layer, which was approximately 58% of the total soil carbon in the soil under nearby remnant bushland ( 136 t/ ha).
   The total pool of carbon in the cotton soils of NSW was estimated to be 44.8 Mt C, where organic carbon and inorganic carbon constitute 34.9 Mt C and 9.9 Mt C, respectively. Based on the results of a limited number of paired sites under remnant vegetation, it was estimated that about 18.9 Mt of C has been lost from Vertosols by cotton cropping in NSW. With more sustainable management practices such as conservation tillage and green manuring, some of the lost carbon can be resequestered, which will help to mitigate the greenhouse effect and improve soil quality and may increase crop yield.

AB Revegetation of high-pH substrates such as bauxite residue sand (BRS) can be problematic, since poor availability of nutrients like manganese (Mn) requires extensive and frequent fertiliser additions to maintain plant productivity. Recent glasshouse studies have shown improved growth and Mn nutrition of deep-rooted, perennial lucerne ( Medicago sativa L.) growing in BRS when Mn was banded deep below the surface. Deep banding of Mn fertiliser shows promise in having long residual effectiveness in BRS. A field study involving deep-banded Mn in a BRS disposal area was undertaken. Manganese fertiliser, banded at a rate of 15 kg/ha approx. 0.18 m deep, provided effective supply of Mn to lucerne for at least 2.5 years, while 5 separate surface-broadcast applications ( 15 kg Mn/ha each) were required over the same period to maintain similar lucerne productivity. Shoot and root yields and Mn concentrations in shoots were consistently greater in the banded than broadcast treatments. Root extension deeper than 30 - 40 cm was largely inhibited by a physical compaction layer and an increase in pH with depth. Lucerne root length density was increased significantly by deep banding of Mn. In conclusion, deep banding of Mn fertiliser can improve sustainability of revegetated BRS areas and, potentially, productivity of other high pH substrates, by reducing the frequency and amounts of Mn fertiliser additions required for healthy plant growth.

AB This paper reviews two aspects of agricultural biodiversity. 1. The ways in which agricultural biodiversity may be increased to favour pest management are examined. At the simplest level, the structure within a monoculture may be altered by changing management practices to benefit natural enemies. At the other extreme, annual and perennial non-crop vegetation may be integrated with cropping, and biodiversity increased at the landscape level. 2. The existence of a hierarchy for the types of benefits of increased biodiversity is discussed. Vegetational diversity can lead to suppression of pests via 'top-down' enhancement of natural enemy populations and by resource concentration and other 'bottom-up' effects acting directly on pests. Whilst such low-input pest management mechanisms are attractive in their own right, other (non-pest management related) benefits may simultaneously apply. These range from short-term benefits in crop yield or quality, longer term benefits for sustainability of the farming system and, ultimately, broad societal benefits including aesthetics, recreation and the conservation of flora and fauna. Examples are given of such multi-function agricultural biodiversity.

AB We compared the effects of different low-input farming systems on carabids and spiders. The study was performed in a 3-year field survey using a paired-farm approach in six different landscapes units in northwestern Switzerland considering also the nearby semi-natural habitats. Carabids and spiders were sampled in 24 winter cereal crops and 18 semi-natural habitats using five funnel pitfall traps per site.
   Considering all cereal sites, in low-input ICM fields (= no insecticides, fungicides and growth regulators; ICM: Integrated crop management) 36% less carabids and 8% less spider specimens were found. In several cases, carabid populations of organic fields were significantly richer in species and abundance than in the low-input integrated crop management farmed plots. Endangered, stenoceous carabids (e.g. xero-thermophilous) and top-predators were more abundant in the organic fields. Spider communities differed less in mean number of species and abundance between the two low-input agricultural systems. Multivariate analysis showed that farming method and weed abundance were significant factors altering the carabid fauna and weed diversity influence spider fauna. Wolfspiders such as Pardosa agrestis, P. palustris and Trochosa ruricola seem to be enhanced by organic management. Linyphiids (Erigone atra, Oedothorax apicatus) were more abundant in low-input ICM fields. Several carabid species and wolfspiders which have their main distribution in semi-natural habitats occurred more abundant in organic fields. This indicates that seminatural habitats in combination with organic farming may be an important factor for the conservation and enhancement of the species rich assemblages on agricultural land.

AB Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) are biodegradable polyesters produced by many bacterial species. They are a natural part of the renewable carbon life cycle and are a sustainable source of plastics into the future. PHA production, however, cost about ten times as much as petroleum-derived thermoplastics. The value of the polymers can be increased by controlling the polymer's microstructure. By changing what substrates are available to the bacteria during polymer synthesis, different compositions of PHA can be synthesized. This technique can be used to synthesize core and shell latexes, giving specific properties to film and coatings. Additionally, alternating substrates at a faster rate can be used to synthesize different polymers within an individual polymer chain, thereby producing block copolymers. Block copolymers have uses as blend compatibilizers and thermoplastic elastomers. Producing PHAs with controlled microstructures gives control of the physical properties and allows for the production of high value polymers.

AB As part of a study in sustainable greenhouse waste management, a growing medium component made from composted greenhouse waste was investigated and compared with the conventional sawdust growing medium used in most vegetable greenhouses in British Columbia, Canada. The compost provided higher moisture retention and density, and lower porosity; for optimal growing conditions, irrigation should be adjusted to take this into account. In a commercial tomato greenhouse trial setting, a mixture of 2:1 sawdust to compost by volume was found to be suitable as a growing medium, providing similar yield, crop health and fruit quality, and additional pH buffering compared with the conventional system. Since the waste processing is carried out on site, quality and consistency of the compost can be ensured. Successful application of compost in the growing medium can help provide a more sustainable waste management strategy through on-site recycling and conservation of organic resources, and may offer the grower disease suppression benefits.

AB In Eastern Tyrol (Austria), homegardens are an integral part of the farming system. The aim of this paper is to present evidence for the development of gardening in the study area and to identify differences/similarities between gardens at organic and non-organic farms. In 1997 and 1998, in homegardens on 91 organic and 105 non-organic farms from 12 communities, occurrence and abundance of cultivated plant species were surveyed and interviews were carried out about garden history, management and plant use. For the factor organic/non-organic, differences between gardens were statistically tested. Garden management is similar in organic/non-organic gardens, except mixed cropping and the use of alternative remedies to combat diseases, both with significantly higher occurrence on organic farms. Popular innovations from organic farming did not have a strong and clearly visible impact on management of homegardens. The population of cultivated plant species, until the 1960s approx. 51; nowadays approx. 587 species in all gardens, and main use of garden produce has been in a process of change with an increase in importance of species used as food and for decoration, but with no significant differences concerning organic/non-organic. Women farmers gardening in Eastern Tyrol are highly sympathetic to the principles of organic farming, even on non-organic farms. Sustainability can be increased when methods from organic gardening are promoted and tested locally more effectively. Science and policy should recognize the work of women farmers who maintain homegardens with high agrobiodiversity as part of their culture.

AB From radical positions it is argued that it will take paradigmatic transformations to develop a sustainable agriculture and that values and attitudes have to be changed. To find out if teachers and students in higher agricultural education are motivated for radical changes, a survey based on the Alternative-Conventional Agriculture Paradigm Scale (ACAP-scale) was conducted. The ACAP-scale shows how people relate to the alternative and conventional agricultural paradigm and it shows their overall understanding of how agriculture works and relates to the physical and social environment. This study showed that the ACAP-scale is a suitable method for quantitative assessment of attitudes to agriculture in a broader context. Among students and faculty members at the Royal Veterinary and Agricultural University, Denmark there exists significant differences in paradigmatic positions. Students' course choices are, to some extent, influenced by their paradigmatic position, some courses enrol followers of either the alternative or the conventional agricultural paradigm, and females and older students hold more alternative views than males and younger students. It is concluded that the wide range of values and attitudes among students and teachers calls for new teaching methods, where values and attitudes are integrated. It cannot be taken for granted that teachers and students share the radical visions of sustainability as sometimes presupposed of bodies working for sustainable development.

AB The environmental performance of willow biomass crop production systems in New York (NY) is analyzed using life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology. The base-case, which represents current practices in NY, produces 55 units of biomass energy per unit of fossil energy consumed over the biomass crop's 23-year lifetime. Inorganic nitrogen fertilizer inputs have a strong influence on overall system performance, accounting for 37% of the non-renewable fossil energy input into the system. Net energy ratio varies from 58 to below 40 as a function of fertilizer application rate, but application rate also has implications on the system nutrient balance. Substituting inorganic N fertilizer with sewage sludge biosolids increases the net energy ratio of the willow biomass crop production system by more than 40%. While CO2 emitted in combusting dedicated biomass is balanced by CO2 adsorbed in the growing biomass, production processes contribute to the system's net global warming potential. Taking into account direct and indirect fuel use, N2O emissions from applied fertilizer and leaf litter, and carbon sequestration in below ground biomass and soil carbon, the net greenhouse gas emissions total 0.68 g CO2 eq. MJ(biomass produced)(-1). Site specific parameters such as soil carbon sequestration could easily offset these emissions resulting in a net reduction of greenhouse gases. Assuming reasonable biomass transportation distance and energy conversion efficiencies, this study implies that generating electricity from willow biomass crops could produce 11 units of electricity per unit of fossil energy consumed. Results from the LCA support the assertion that willow biomass crops are sustainable from an energy balance perspective and contribute additional environmental benefits.

AB Lime-stabilized sewage sludge and composted poultry manure, at a rate of 250 m(3) ha(-1) each, and slow-release N fertilizer (Scott's Osmocote) at 100, 200 and 300 kg N ha(-1), were applied to plots of willow biomass crops during the first season of a three-year growth cycle. Stem biomass production was measured annually and soil chemical characteristics were assessed at the end of the growth cycle. Average annual stem biomass production was 8-11 Mg ha(-1) in slow-release N fertilized plots corresponding to a yield increase of 7-33% relative to control plots. In organically amended plots, annual stem biomass production increased by 30-38% relative to control plots. The study suggests that organically amended willows grew at a slightly faster rate than slow-release N fertilized willows. Statistically, the relationship between slow-release N application rate and stem biomass production was not highly significant; applications of slow-release N in excess of 100 kg N ha(-1) provided no additional yield benefits. Differences in soil characteristics were most strongly expressed in surface soil. The pH at 0-10 cm depth was 1 and 2 units higher on lime-stabilized sludge and composted poultry manure plots, respectively. Concentrations of soil K, P and Mg were dramatically higher in the composted poultry manure soils. The highest soil organic matter and N levels were observed in the surface horizons of organically amended soils. Utilization of organic residuals increases biomass production, provides beneficial use for wastes, reducing production costs and contributing to the sustainability of biomass production systems.

AB This paper presents a synthesis of assessment of sustainable biomass production potential in six Asian countries-China, India, Malaysia, Philippines, Sri Lanka and Thailand, and is based on the detailed studies carried out in these countries under the Asian Regional Research Programme in Energy, Environment and Climate (ARRPEEC). National level studies were undertaken to estimate land availability for biomass production, identify and evaluate the biomass production options in terms of yield per hectare and financial viability, estimate sustainable biomass production for energy, and estimate the energy potential of biomass production in the six Asian countries. Sustainable biomass production from plantation is estimated to be in the range of 182.5-210.5, 62-310, 0.4-1.7, 3.7-20.4, 2.0-9.9 and 11.6-106.6 Mt yr(-1) for China, India, Malaysia, Philippines, Sri Lanka and Thailand, respectively. The maximum annual electricity generation potential, using advanced technologies, from the sustainable biomass production is estimated to be about 27, 114, 4.5, 79, 254 and 195 percentage of the total electricity generation in year 2000 in China, India, Malaysia, Philippines, Sri Lanka and Thailand, respectively. Investment cost for bioenergy production varies from US$381 to 1842 ha(-1) in the countries considered in this study; investment cost for production of biomass varies from US$5.1 to 23 t(-1).

AB This study aims to estimate the land availability for biomass production, identify and evaluate the biomass production options by yield ha(-1) and financial viability, estimate the sustainable biomass production for energy, and estimate the energy potential of biomass production. Two scenarios are considered to estimate the land availability for biomass production by 2010, namely Scenario 1 (S1) and Scenario 2 (S2). S1 assumes that the land use pattern will remain constant until 2010 while S2 considers the surplus land available and also the projected area under plantation in 2010. Two biomass demand scenarios are also considered, namely incremental biomass demand (IBD) scenario and full biomass demand (FBD) scenario. 1131) assumes that only the incremental biomass demand (industrial wood, sawn wood and fuelwood) from 1997 to 2010 will be generated through harvests from new plantation using the available land. FBD assumes that all the biomass demand (fuelwood + sawn wood + industrial wood) projected for the year 2010 will be met from new plantation. Under the IBD scenario, the annual biomass production potential for energy would be 210.47 and 182.53 Mt for S1 and S2, respectively. The surplus area for energy would be 39.64 and 32.51 M ha for SI and S2, respectively. Under the FBD scenario, the land required for biomass demand would be 99.71 M ha which is larger than the feasible surplus land of 90.73 and 83.60 M ha under S I and S2, respectively. Therefore, the surplus area for energy is negative, that means the biomass supply by plantation will not be met by full biomass demand in 20 10 even if all feasible lands would be developed. Electricity generation potential from plantation under SI and S2 will supply about 8.8% and 7.6% of total electricity demand, respectively. The plantation cost of major species and the biomass production for energy by plantation in 2010 under these scenarios are also calculated. Investment required for biomass production for energy is projected. Barriers and strategies for biomass production for energy are also discussed in this study. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The availability of land for biomass production, the various biomass production options, biomass productivity rates, financial viability, investment required to produce biomass for energy and the barriers to biomass production are analysed. The scenarios considered for estimating the biomass potential are incremental biomass demand, sustainable biomass demand and the full biomass demand. Under these scenarios, two Situations namely no increase in cropland by 2010 and increase in cropland by 10% over 1995 area have been considered. The land available for biomass production ranges from 9.6 to 36.5 Mha under the different scenarios. Annually 62-310 Mt of wood could be generated from the surplus land, after meeting all the requirements of biomass, such as domestic fuelwood, industrial wood and sawnwood, with an investment of Rs168-780 billion. An electricity generation potential of 62-310 TWh annually is estimated. The key barriers to produce biomass sustainably for energy are lack of commercial demand for wood for energy, lack of financial incentives, low productivity of plantations, land tenurial barriers and lack of institutions to integrate biomass production for energy and bioenergy utilities.

AB This paper addresses issues on sustainable biomass production for energy in Malaysia. Three biomass demand scenarios, viz. incremental biomass demand, sustainable biomass demand and full biomass demand are introduced. In order to meet these demands, two surplus land availability scenarios (Scenarios I and II) are also introduced. In Scenario I, it is assumed that the area under plantation will remain constant and 100% of surplus land is available for plantation, while Scenario II considers a 25% increase of food production and a reduction of the potential surplus land available by the same proportion. The land area to meet the demands for fuelwood, sawn wood, and industrial wood are estimated and by deducting this area from total surplus land, the land area available for energy plantations are estimated. By subjecting these lands to different forestry and productivity options, sustainable biomass productions for energy are estimated. Each plantation option is also evaluated using the financial viability of the system. By identifying appropriate technologies for electricity generation, the energy potential of biomass produced is estimated. The annual electricity generation potential from incremental biomass demand under land Scenarios I and II are 1.66 and 0.38 TWh yr(-1), respectively. There is insufficient surplus land for dedicated energy plantations for both the sustainable biomass demand and full biomass demand scenarios under the two biomass production (land) scenarios. This paper finally discusses the barriers and policy options for energy plantations and recommends some strategies to promote them. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study aims to estimate land availability for biomass production, identify and evaluate the biomass production options in terms of yield per hectare and financial viability, estimate sustainable biomass production for energy, and estimate the energy potential of biomass production in the Philippines. In estimating the area for biomass production, two land availability scenarios are considered, namely, Scenario 1 (S1) which assumes that there will be no increase in the area under permanent crops, arable lands, forest plantations and agroforestry (AF) lands by 2010 (with 1997 as the base year), and Scenario 2 (S2) which assumes that the total land area under permanent crops, arable lands, forest plantations and AF increases by about 10% by 2010. Three possible scenarios are used to account for the projected biomass demands by the year 2010, namely incremental biomass demand (IBD), sustainable biomass demand (SBD), and full biomass demand (FBD). Under IBD the surplus land for bioenergy plantation would be 1.94 and 1.16 Mha under S1 and S2, respectively. While under SBD, the remaining land for bioenergy plantation is 1.44 and 0.66 Mha under S1and S2, respectively. Because of the high value of biomass requirements, FBD cannot be applied in the country. Therefore under FBD, there will be no land available for bioenergy plantations. Three major forestry options are also considered for bioenergy production: short rotation forest plantation, long rotation forest plantation and AF. The total annual biomass production potential for energy in the country is in the range of 3.7-20.37 Mt under the different scenarios and options.
   Assuming the energy content of wood is 15 GJ t(-1), energy potential of the produced biomass is 55.5 million to 305.6 million GJ. If 1 Mt of woody biomass can generate 1 TWh of electrical power, then the annual electricity generation potential also ranges from 3.7 to 20.37 TWh. The potential amount of electricity generated through bioenergy plantation would be from 3% to 22% of the country's projected electricity demand by the year 2008.

AB The present study concentrates mainly on the estimation of land availability for biomass production and the estimation of sustainable biomass production potential for energy. The feasible surplus land area available for bioenergy plantation is estimated assuming two land availability scenarios (Scenarios I and 2) and three biomass demand scenarios (IBD Scenario, SBD Scenario and FBD Scenario). Scenario 1 assumes that 100% of the Surplus area available in base year 1997 will be suitable for plantation without considering population growth and food production and that 75% of this surplus land is feasible for plantation. Scenario 2 assumes that future food requirement will grow by 20% and the potential surplus area will be reduced by that amount. The incremental biomass demand scenario (IBD Scenario) assumes that only the incremental demand for biomass in the year 2010 with respect to the base year 1997 has to be produced from new plantation. The sustainable biomass demand scenario (SBD Scenario) assumes that the total sustainable supply of biomass in 1997 is deducted from the future biomass demand in 2010 and only the balance is to be met by new plantation. The full biomass demand scenario (FBD Scenario) assumes that the entire projected biomass demand of the year 2010 needs to be produced from new plantation. The total feasible land area for the scenarios IBD-1, IBD-2, SBD-1, SBD-2, FBD-1 and FBD-2 are approximately 0.96, 0.66, 0.80, 0.94, 0.60 and 0.30 Mha, respectively. Biomass production potential is estimated by selecting appropriate plant species, plantation spacing and productivity level. The results show that the total annual biomass production in the country could vary from 2 to 9.9 Mt. With the production option (i.e. 1.5 m x 1.5 m spacing plantation with fertilizer application) giving the highest yield, the total biomass production for energy under IBD Scenario would be 9.9 Mt yr(-1) for Scenario 1 and 6.7 Mt yr(-1) for Scenario 2. Under SBD Scenario, the corresponding values are 8.2 Mt yr(-1) for Scenario 1 and 5.0 Mt yr(-1) for scenario 2. Finally, FBD Scenario leads to a total biomass production of 6.2 Mt yr(-1) for Scenario 1 and 3.0 Mt yr(-1) for Scenario 2. The total investment for bioenergy plantation is estimated, and the barriers and policy options for biomass production for energy are also presented in this study. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

AB This study aims to estimate the land availability for biomass production, identify and evaluate the biomass production options by yield per ha and financial viability, estimate the sustainable biomass production for energy, and estimate the energy potential of biomass production. Two scenarios are proposed to determine the feasible land for biomass production by 20 10, namely Scenario 1 (S1) and Scenario 2 (S2). S1 assumes that there will be no increase in the area under food production by 2010 while S2 considers an increase of 10% in the area under food production by 2010. Two biomass demand scenarios are also considered, namely incremental biomass demand (IBD) scenario and full biomass demand (FBD) scenario. The potential land available for biomass production is identified by the use of the Thai Forest Sector Master Plan target area. Under the two scenarios, the land for production of biomass to meet the biomass demands for industrial wood, sawn wood and fuelwood, and the area that can be dedicated for biomass production for bioenergy are estimated. The total potential available for biomass production is 22.5 million ha. The land for production of biomass to meet the demands is 0.512 million ha under the IBD scenario and 6.524 million ha under the FBD scenario. The land dedicated for bioenergy production is 8.329 and 2.911 million ha, respectively for the two scenarios. For the FBD scenario, the land dedicated for bioenergy will be allocated from community forest (CMF) and non-protected area system (NPAS) where both categories are suitable for short rotation plantation or Eucalyptus. For FBD scenario, the land dedicated for bioenergy will be allocated from NPAS only. For IBD scenario, the annual bioenergy production ranges from 106.6 to 33.3 million ton. For FBD scenario, the annual bioenergy production ranges from 37.3 to 11.6 million ton. The potential electricity generation using biomass by 2010 varies from 106.6 to 11.6 TWh. The investment required for biomass production for energy is projected. Barriers and strategies for biomass production for energy are also discussed in this study. (C) 2003 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The use of bio-energy crops for electricity production is considered an effective means to mitigate the greenhouse effect, mainly due to its ability to substitute fossil fuels. A Whole range of crops qualify for bio-energy production and a rational choice is not readily made. This paper evaluates the energy and greenhouse gas balance of a mixed indigenous hardwood coppice as an extensive, low-input bio-energy crop. The impact on fossil energy use and greenhouse gas emission is calculated and discussed by comparing its life cycle (cultivation, processing and conversion into energy) with two conventional bio-energy crops (short rotation systems of willow and, Miscanthus). For each life cycle process, the flows of fossil energy and greenhouse gas that are created for the production of one functional unit are calculated. The results show-that low-input bio-energy crops use comparatively less fossil fuel and avoid more greenhouse gas emission per unit of produced energy than conventional bio-energy crops during the first 100 yr. Where the mixed coppice system avoids up till 0.13 t CO2 eq./GJ, Miseanthus does not exceed 0.07 t CO2 eq./GJ. After 100 yr their performances become comparable, amounting,to 0.05 t CO2 eq./ha/GJ. However, if the land surface itself is chosen as a functional unit, conventional crops perform better with respect to mitigating the greenhouse effect. Miscanthus avoids a maximum of 12.9 t CO2 eq./ha/yr, while mixed coppice attains 9.5 t CO2 eq./ha/yr at the most. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, we show how nature oriented forestry measures in a typical temperate forest type in combination with bioenergy systems could lead to continuous and permanent removal of CO2 from the atmosphere. We employ a forest growth model suited for modeling uneven-aged mixed temperate stands and analyze the interaction with biomass energy systems that allow for CO2 removal and long-term sequestration in geological formations. On global scales this technological option to convert the global energy system from a CO2 emitter to a CO2 remover has been overlooked by both the science and policy communities. Removal of the major Greenhouse Gas (GHG) CO2 from the atmosphere is possible using biomass energy to produce both carbon neutral energy carriers (e.g., electricity and hydrogen) and, at the same time, offer a permanent CO2 sink by capturing carbon at the conversion facility and permanently storing it in geological formations. This technological option resolves the issues of permanence and saturation of biological sinks while at the same time this option respects the multiple benefits of sustaining diverse, healthy, and resilient forests. Our results indicate that a typical temperate forest in combination with capturing and long-term storage can permanently remove and on a continuous basis about 2.5 t C yr(-1) ha(-1) on a sustainable basis respecting the ecological integrity of the ecosystem.

AB Bioenergy has an important role in the implementation of the Kyoto agreement in Finland. The main sources of wood residues for energy production are logging areas and sawmills. The use of forest chips can be of great significance in reducing carbon dioxide emissions by replacing fossil fuels. Increasing the use of forest chips has environmental benefits, but it also includes possible environmental disadvantages. Therefore, system research is needed to assess the forest chip utilisation prospects for their environmental quality to secure sustainable forest management. Life-cycle methodology was developed and applied to assess environmental burdens and impacts of the logging and sawmill residues throughout the whole fuel chain from the forest to energy production. According to the study, the energy efficiencies of the forest chip systems are quite high. Net CO2 emissions of the systems are low owing to the low input of external primary energy required to operate the systems. Although wood energy is renewable, it has many similarities with fossil fuels, e.g. as the emissions of the conversion phase are significant. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The Swedish forest industry sector produces timber, energy and other commodities, but has to consider the vested interests of other parties. This paper adopts a perspective whereby the modem forest industry sector is regarded as a system for the production of energy products, and where traditional forest industry products are seen as commodities that are released as energy at the end of their lives. Assisted by a review of the literature, the market forces affecting forest fuels are assessed from the perspectives of forest owners, machine contractors and purchasers of forest fuels.
   Present-day forest operations are highly efficient in terms of invested and inherent energy in harvested timber. There are also markets, methods and technology for the production of biofuels. However this harvest entails economic and environmental costs. The markets for biofuels seem to be growing, and bioenergy from forests competes with energy produced by other actors. Designing systems that provide a profitable flow of bioenergy from forestry without risking the sustainable use of forests as regards the long-term supply of nutrients and maintaining biological diversity constitutes a challenge for scientists and practitioners working in the sector. The author suggests existing systems for environmental and forest certification as a means of safeguarding and confirming that the harvest and trade of forest fuels comply with standards for ensuring sustainable forestry (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB Sweden's goals of contemporaneously reducing CO2 emissions and phasing out nuclear power will require a maximum utilization of biomass fuels. This would imply a significant shift from electricity and fuel oil to biomass generated heat, but must also be accomplished without a deterioration of the local air quality. The most suitable energy carrier seems to be pelletized biomass fuels with their associated low emissions and considerable residential conversion potential. Using an underlying statistical design, a parametric dispersion modeling study was performed to estimate and illustrate the combined effects of source-specific, meteorological and modeling variables on the ambient air quality in a typical residential area for different conversion scenarios. The work nicely illustrated the benefits of combining statistical designs with model calculations. It further showed that the concentration of combustion related ambient THC was strongly related to conditions affecting the source stength, but only weakly to the dispersion conditions and model variables. Time of year (summer or winter); specific emission performance; extent of conversion from electricity; conversion from wood log combustion; and specific efficiency of the pellet appliances showed significant effects in descending order. The effects of local settings and model variables were relatively small, making the results more generally applicable. To accomplish the desired conversion to renewable energy in an ecologically and sustainable way, the emissions would have to be reduced to a maximum advisable limit of 25 +/- 7 mg THC/MJ(fuel) (given as CH4). Further, the results showed the potential positive influence by conversion from wood log to low emission pellet combustion. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Simulation and validation of the evaporation of water from liquid manure
   using ventilation exhaust air: linking of two simulation models
SO BIOSYSTEMS ENGINEERING

DT Article
AB The pig production needs to be modified into a sustainable system. Handling of the manure and reducing emissions have to be taken into account in the design of pig facilities, so the called integrated pig facilities are being developed in which the energy in the exhaust air can be used to evaporate water from liquid manure. The objective of this research was to link an existing dynamic simulation model for indoor climate calculation to a newly developed simulation model for manure evaporation, allowing annualised calculation of evaporation. The physical processes that occur in the liquid manure evaporator were described in a dynamic simulation model. This model was. validated with experiments carried out in a laboratory facility. This model underestimated the evaporation with an average of 15(.)4%. Some explanations were given.
   Model calculation of the evaporation at annual basis shows that per fattening pig place 0(.)38 to 0.41 m(3) liquid manure per year can be evaporated. To increase the evaporation level, thermal energy can be added. The linking of two simulation models was successful. The liquid manure drying simulation model can be used to gain insight in the possibilities of using a manure drying technique under a variety of circumstances, and to design practical installations and to optimise the drying process.

AB 1. The immune system of the chicken is an invaluable model for studying basic immunology and has made seminal contributions to fundamental immunological principles. Graft versus host responses and the key role of lymphocytes in adaptive immunity were first described in work with chicken embryos and chickens.
   2. Most notably, the bursa of Fabricius provided the first substantive evidence that there are two major lineages of lymphocytes. Bursal-derived lymphocytes, or B cells, make antibodies while thymus-derived, or T cells, are involved in cell-mediated immune responses.
   3. Gene conversion, the mechanism used by the chicken to produce its antibody repertoire, was first described in the chicken and requires the unique environment of the bursa. Subsequently it has been shown that some mammals also use gene conversion.
   4. The chicken's Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC), the first non-mammalian MHC to be sequenced, is minimal, compact and some 20-fold smaller than that of mammals. Uniquely, the chicken MHC is strongly associated with resistance to infectious diseases.
   5. The first attenuated vaccine was developed by Louis Pasteur against a chicken pathogen, fowl cholera, and the first vaccine against a natural occurring cancer agent, Marek's disease virus, was developed for the chicken.
   6. Vaccination of chick embryos on the 18th d of incubation, another breakthrough using chickens, provides protection early after hatching. In ovo vaccination now is widely practised by the poultry industry.
   7. Evidence that widespread and intensive vaccination can lead to increased virulence with some pathogens, such as Marek's disease virus and infectious bursal disease virus, was first described with chicken populations. It warns of the need to develop more sustainable vaccination strategies in future and provides useful lessons for other species, including in the human population.
   8. Recombinant DNA technologies now provide the opportunity for the rational design of new vaccines. Such vaccines could contain the protective immunogenic elements from several pathogens and immunomodulatory molecules to direct and enhance immune responses so providing improved protection. The important thing will be to design vaccines that are sustainable and do not drive pathogens to ever-increasing virulence.

   social housing; sustainable built environment; the Netherlands
AB Although progressive government guidelines and awareness of sustainable issues exists, progress in sustainable management in the social housing sector has been slow. A market research survey and analysis of the sustainable housing management by Dutch housing associations indicates the areas and organizations where policies, instruments and practices are focussed or lacking. Longitudinal trends are established using further surveys from 1993, 1998 and 2000 as well as comparing national strategies from five European Union countries (the Netherlands, Germany, the UK, France and Finland). Results indicate that efforts in sustainable management are misplaced with emphasis on procuring new buildings, not on operation and maintenance. Several barriers at the policy and strategy level are identified, especially the perceived costs of implementing environmental management, the lack of market demand and the poor capture of benefits. Special recommendations for government, housing associations and occupants are based on the findings-widening the focus of issues on sustainability, emphasizing the existing building stock, increasing the use of voluntary agreements, recognizing different capabilities in scale of housing associations and creating market demand.

AB Objective To investigate the problems, benefits, feasibility, and sustainability of implementation of WHO guidelines on management of severe malnutrition. ,
   Methods A postal survey invited staff from 12 African hospitals to participate in the study. Five hospitals were evaluated and two were, selected to take part in the study: a district hospital in South Africa and a mission hospital in Ghana. At an initial visit, an experienced paediatrician reviewed the situation in the hospitals and introduced the principles of the guidelines through a participatory.:approach. During a second visit about six months later, the paediatrician reviewed the feasibility and sustainability of the introduced changes and. helped find solutions to problems. At a final visit after, one year, the paediatrician reassessed the overall situation.
   Findings Malnutrition management practices improved at both hospitals: Measures against hypoglycaemia, hypothermia, and infection were strengthened. Early; frequent feeding was established as a routine practice. Some micronutrients for inclusion in the diet were not locally available: and.: needed to be imported. Problems Were encountered with monitoring of weight gain and introducing a rehydration solution for malnutrition.
   Conclusion Implementation of the main principles of the WHO guidelines on severe malnutrition was feasible; affordable, and, sustainable at two African hospitals.. The guidelines could be improved by. including suggestions on how to adapt specific recommendations to local situations. The guidelines are well supported by experience and published reports, but more information-is. needed about some components and their impact on mortality.

AB The Canadian federal process for environmental impact assessment (EIA) integrates health, social, and environmental aspects into either a screening, comprehensive study, or a review by a public panel, depending on the expected severity of potential adverse environmental effects. In this example, a Public Review Panel considered a proposed diamond mining project in Canada's northern territories, where 50% of the population are Aboriginals. The Panel specifically instructed the project proposer to determine how to incorporate traditional knowledge into the gathering of baseline information, preparing impact prediction, and planning mitigation and monitoring. Traditional knowledge is defined as the knowledge, innovations and practices of indigenous and/or local i communities developed from experience gained over the centuries and adapted to local culture and environment. The mining company was asked to consider in its EIA: health, demographics, social and cultural patterns; services and infrastructure; local, regional and territorial economy; land and resource use; employment, education and training; government; and other matters. Cooperative efforts between government, industry and the community led to a project that coordinated the concerns of all interested stakeholders and the needs of present and future generations, thereby meeting the goals of sustainable development. The mitigation measures that were implemented take into account: income and social status, social support networks, education, employment and working conditions, physical environments, personal health practices and coping skills, and health services.

ID EPIDEMIOLOGIC TRANSITION THEORY
AB This paper reviews the health dimension and sociocultural, economic, and ecological determinants of health in existing global scenario studies. Not even half of the 31 scenarios reviewed gave a good description of future health developments and the different scenario studies did not handle health in a consistent way. Most of the global driving forces of health are ad dressed adequately in the selected scenarios, however, and it therefore would have been possible to describe the future developments in health as an outcome of these multiple driving forces. To provide examples on how future health can be incorporated in existing scenarios, we linked the sociocultural, economic, and environmental developments described in three sets of scenarios (special report on emission scenarios (SRES), global environmental outlook-3 (GEO3), and world water scenarios (WWS)) to three potential, but imaginary, health futures ("age of emerging infectious diseases", "age of medical technology", and "age of sustained health"). This paper provides useful insights into how to deal with future. health in scenarios and shows that a comprehensive picture of future health evolves when all important driving forces and pressures are taken into account.

AB The Kullu District in Himachal Pradesh, India, a Himalayan mountain area, has experienced rapid development in tourism, agriculture and hydro-electricity with substantial impact on the local society, economy, and environment. This paper describes a project undertaken in the area since 1994 by the Universities of Manitoba and Delhi involving collaborative research and action to promote environmental sustainability. Collaboration, in addition to that between the universities, involved government agencies, non-govern mental organizations, unions, educational institutions, and local residents. The results of this field activity led to an evaluation of collaborative planning and development. Objectives relating to capacity building within the universities and action-research were achieved, whereas objectives relating to policy development in environmental sustainability were frustrated by the institutional context and a lack of time and resources.

AB The cooperation between Brazil and Canada in support of projects with the National Service for industrial Apprenticeship (SENAI) has been seen in both countries as a history of successes. The paper describes the Canadian supported projects developed and implemented at SENAI, and considers the many lessons learned from over twenty years of cooperation. Both the process of learning and the strategic application of the lessons learned have contributed to the success of the projects. It is hoped that they can also contribute to the development of new projects at SENAI, in Brazil, and to Canadian supported projects elsewhere.

TI Challenges related to soil biodiversity research in agroecosystems -

AB Soil biodiversity, the study of the variety of life in the soil, has received increasing attention as an outcome of recent national and international initiatives, such as the Convention on Biological Diversity, and various programs related to sustainable development of agroecosystems. The broad objectives of this paper are to set the stage for a "state of the art" review of soil biodiversity research in Canadian agricultural systems, to highlight the relevance of soil biodiversity studies at various scales of observation, to acknowledge the importance of soil biodiversity to the soil system with respect to soil functions, and processes and to suggest research challenges and opportunities.
   Study scale is of critical importance as it determines both the kind of soil biodiversity information and the feasible level of detail (spatially and temporally). At all scales from global to national to regional to landscape to ecosystems ranging to even fine scales of habitat niches at soil particle level, soil biota respond to the physical, chemical and biological constraints of their environment as mediated by environmental and anthropogenic influences. For example, at the landscape level, there exists a mosaic of ecosystems that can be characterized as a continuum ranging from unmanaged (natural), uncontrolled systems regulated primarily by environmental influences to managed, controlled systems regulated primarily by anthropogenic influences. In agroecosystems, soil biota contribute to the decomposition of crop residues and nutrient cycling, soil aggregation and water infiltration, suppression of soil-borne diseases and pests, and detoxification of chemicals. The intensity and duration of environmental and anthropogenic influences on these soil biota will affect their spatial and temporal distribution within this continuum of ecosystems occurring in the landscape and thereby also affect the extent of their capability for contributing towards soil functions and processes. Within this spatial and temporal context, research challenges are discussed.

TI Herpetofaunal indicator species as measures of environmental stability
   in Honduras
SO CARIBBEAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
AB Population declines of several members of the Honduran herpetofauna have occurred despite a reasonably robust system of biotic reserves. A procedure was developed to identify "indicator species" whose biological features can be used to establish a gauge of environmental stability for most ecophysiographic areas in Honduras. A total of 103 species with the highest environmental vulnerability scores (EVS) were designated indicator species. These 103 species are distributed in numbers from 1 to 18 among 26 ecophysiographic areas. The current population status of the indicator species was determined and it indicates that 37 species have declining populations or are extirpated or extinct. Each ecophysiographic area was given a grade for its environmental stability based on the percentage of species with stable populations. Conclusions indicate that the Honduran environment is becoming increasingly inhospitable to amphibian and reptilian populations, and that only the achievement of a sustainable human society could stabilize this trend.

AB In this work we propose an integrated model to simulate the oxygen balance of a eutrophic lagoon exploited for mollusks farming. The balance is determined by macroalgal primary production and respiration rates plus the oxygen demand by clams and sediment. The aim is to evaluate the impact of intensive clam rearing on the vulnerability of the lagoon ecosystem to anoxic crises. The model is based on field data collected in the Sacca di Goro lagoon (po River Delta) and has a stochastic formulation accounting for environmental unpredictability. The results show that clams have a considerable impact on the ecosystem, i.e. densities of 500 clams m(-2) can cause hypoxic events (DO < 2 mgO(2) L-1) n June and September, whilst densities over 1000 clams m(-2) (one half the maximum observed seeding densities) can determine a state of chronic hypoxia during the whole summer period, with minimum DO values lower than 1 mgO(2)L(-1). The model provides a valuable tool for assessing the sustainability of different rearing policies.

AB Living in a century in which the turnover of new insights in biomedical sciences is accelerating rapidly, educational institutions have to face the problem of the sustainability of its teaching strategies. There is no doubt that the task of every university is to keep the quality of its education on a high standard. This goal can only be achieved if the increasing information of high complexity can be adequately integrated into teaching scenarios and constantly be available with reasonable accessibility. Conventional types of teaching media are no longer qualified for this purpose. New teaching technologies, carefully integrated into the curriculum are believed to be an essential media to guarantee the constant high standard of education. In addition, nearly all modern research in life sciences nowadays has switched to teamwork to be able to create real breakthroughs in basic and medicinal sciences, e.g. the Human Genome Project. This fact demands appropriate team teaching and working concepts as well as a well-equipped environment to support collaboration. In this article a completely new scientific environment for teamwork in education and research in life sciences is presented: Vireal Lab, a physical learning environment, equipped with interactive tables and white boards with built-in electronic devices and touch-sensitive, surfaces. It supports all modes of face-to face or virtual collaborative learning and working. Since collaborative learning is believed to be one of the most successful learning methods it is, for the first time, supported by appropriate new technologies. Vireal Lab is an innovative approach to meet the high demands of today's teaching and research in life sciences.

AB The survival of plants is of fundamental importance to guarantee the biodiversity in natural areas and a sustainable agriculture. The National Centre of Competence in Research 'Plant Survival in Natural and Agricultural Ecosystems' devotes its research efforts to the understanding of mechanisms of plant survival. The mechanisms that plants employ to adapt to their biotic and abiotic environment and to cope with important stress factors are investigated. This is achieved by interdisciplinary interaction of disciplines within the NCCR. The particular role played by natural products and analytical chemistry in seven different projects is summarized.

AB On July 26, 2000, the Canada Foundation for Innovation announced an award of $1.3 M dollars for The Centre for Environmental Research in Minerals, Metals and Materials, CERM3, at The University of British Columbia. Additional funding was also provided by the British Columbia Knowledge Development Fund ($1.3 M) and the UBC Stewart Blusson Fund ($0.7 M). Annual industrial grants and contracts are providing support funding for the on-going research projects. Corporate membership in CERM3 entitles each participant to a seat on the technical advisory committee (TAC) as well as access to the five laboratory facilities currently under construction. Both the federal and provincial governments will also participate in the TAC through NRCan-CANMET and the BC Ministry of Energy and Mines, respectively. CERM3's mission is:
   to develop innovative methods to deal with environmental problems created by mining activity;
   to promote sustainable development as a hallmark of management decision-making;
   to produce mining and processing engineers with the required environmental skills; and
   to enhance the image of mining in society as a vibrant and necessary component of a modem economy and society which disturbs the environment for the benefit of mankind.
   CERM3 brings together a multi-disciplinary team of researchers from over 12 departments at The University of British Columbia (UBC) to work on mining-related environmental problems, These include: chemistry; soil sciences; chemical and biological engineering; earth and ocean sciences; microbiology; civil engineering; electrical engineering; metals and materials engineering; mechanical engineering; mining and mineral processing, the Westwater Research Centre; the Institute for Resources and the Environment; and the School of Occupational and Environmental Hygiene. The centre intends to interact with scientists from industry, governments and other universities across Canada and around the world. CERM3 aims to become Canada's leading environmental research facility for the mining industry. This paper describes the evolution of CERM3 and its coordinated multi-disciplinary approach to mining and the environment. Some of CERM3's research projects include:
   developing new protocols for environmental analyses to provide consistent and reliable assays;
   isolating a natural virus for Thiobacillus terrooxidans and other bacteria responsible for acid rock drainage (ARD);
   designing bio-remediation and adsorption techniques for mine effluents;
   promoting and enhancing the use of hydrometallurgy to reduce environmental pollution;
   examining new approaches to comminution to decrease energy consumption;
   developing a magnetically levitated hoisting system to reduce the footprint of a mine operation; building a state-of-the-art supercomputer network laboratory for mine/mill simulations; and
   designing intelligent bulkheads to seal tunnels following mine closure to survive for 1000 years.
   This latter project involves the establishment of a research station at the Britannia mine site, 45 km north of Vancouver, which will provide a full-scale facility to design the "Millennium Plug" and contribute directly to the solution to one of North America's worst ARD-contaminated sites.

AB One of the main challenges for production enterprises is succeeding in the dynamic competitive environment with its rapidly changing requirements. A strategy for the individual factory to cope with these turbulent market and technological developments is to focus itself on a specific set of competencies and capacities and to offer these within the framework of temporary production networks which can be rapidly configured to meet changing requirements. Therefore, the individual factory must be able to integrate itself into temporary partnerships for changing production tasks but at the same time retain a stable basis for the efficient utilisation and sustainable development of its own capacity and competence. The developed object oriented explanation model is based on object oriented software engineering principles and describes an approach for the initial configuration and reconfiguration of factories within the framework of collaborative production networks.

AB Ambitious claims have been made about the development benefits of market-based policy instruments for climate mitigation. We examine the implications of forest carbon projects for different aspects of equity and sustainable development. We apply a stakeholder multi-criteria assessment to explore the range of stakeholders, their roles, interests and perspectives, to a case study in Mexico. Two elements of equity, access to markets and forests, and legitimacy in decision-making and institutions, are discussed. Robust cross-scale institutional frameworks are necessary to ensure that objectives for equity and sustainable development are met and that already marginalised sectors of society are not excluded. These institutions are still developing and their establishment brings together many different stakeholders from government, private sector and civil society. However, the ability of the "new carbon economy" to provide real benefits for sustainable development may ultimately be constrained by the nature of the market itself. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

AB An emerging topic in current climate negotiations is the political momentum for recognising adaptation to climate change as a crucial part of a comprehensive climate policy. However, there are a number of arguments and doubts raised by politicians, negotiators and environmentalists alike with regard to the necessity of implementing adaptation in parallel with mitigation. The first aim of this article is to analyse possible contradictions and synergies between these two strategies and analyse the implications for developing countries and sustainable development targets. We then use Vietnam as a case study to demonstrate how to integrate mitigation and adaptation strategies that can provide additional benefits to the social welfare. This empirical analysis provides a basic understanding of how to address thorny questions in a nascent process of designing public climate policy in Vietnam. Lessons drawn from this research should be replicable in other developing countries having similar circumstances. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI The development and climate nexus: the case of sub-Saharan Africa
SO CLIMATE POLICY
LA English
DT Article
DE development; climate change; Africa; post-Kyoto climate policies;
   energy; food security
AB This paper explores an alternative approach to future climate policies in developing countries. Although climate change seems marginal compared to the pressing issues of poverty alleviation and economic development, it is becoming clear that the realisation of development goals may be hampered by climate change. However, development can be shaped in such a way as to achieve its goals and at the same time reduce vulnerability to climate change, thereby facilitating sustainable development that realises economic, social, local and global environmental goals. This approach has been coined the 'development first approach', in which a future climate regime should focus on development strategies with ancillary climate benefits and increase the capability of developing countries to implement these. This is anticipated to offer a possible positive way out of the current deadlock between North and South in the climate negotiations. First, elements are presented for an integrated approach to development and climate; second, the approach is elaborated for food and energy security in sub-Saharan Africa; and third, possibilities are outlined for international mechanisms to support such integrated development and climate strategies.

TI Viable responses to the equity-responsibility dilemma: a
   consequentialist view
SO CLIMATE POLICY
LA English
DT Article
DE equity; efficiency; development; GHG quota allocation
AB This paper aims at clarifying some conceptual flaws blurring the equity-efficiency debates involved in the setting of objectives of GHGs emissions control beyond 2012. To this end, it carries out numerical experiments that test the viability of agreements grounded on two contrasting target allocation rules: a "Soft Landing" rule prolonging a Kyoto-type agreement; and a "Convergence" rule progressively re-directing Kyoto towards a per capita emissions endowment. The numerical results demonstrate the sensitivity of the impact to the metric used to assess it and to assumptions regarding the interaction between the cap and trade system and accompanying measures such as domestic policies (characterised as simple fiscal reforms) and international public funding. In a further step, the paper derives some lessons about how to reconcile two political imperatives: (a) an ex-post or "consequentialist" approach to equity, which however cannot fully avoid relying on ex-ante rules, and (b) the necessity of an agreement on such stable ex-ante rules to set up emissions targets and efficient emissions trading. Such reconciliation suggests a coming back to the environment/development "Gordian Knot", which underpins all global environmental affairs since the Stockholm Conference in 1972: the equity-efficiency dilemma has to be set in a broader sustainable development perspective whereby climate policies are integrated with development priorities of the poorest countries so as to create a leverage effect on development.

AB The international discourses on climate change and sustainable development represent different cultures. The sustainable development process has sought to build agreement among competing discourse coalitions. The climate change process focuses on designing cost-effective measures based on expert analysis. Sustainable consumption presents a challenge to both communities. The challenge has been taken up within the sustainable development process but little progress has been made. High consuming lifestyles seem "locked-in" by the economic, technological and cultural context.
   Nevertheless, there are several reasons for optimism that sustainable consumption patterns might develop. One is the diversity of current consumption patterns and the growing minority concerned with ethical consumption. Another is the growing understanding of innovation processes, developed to address technological change, but applicable to social innovation. A third reason is the growing reflexivity of communities and institutions.
   Government policies that seek to manage or control consumption, or persuade consumers to change their behaviour, are important but unlikely to be sufficient to bring about sustainable consumption. A complementary strategy would establish partnerships with the public and stakeholders, developing shared visions and approaches, supporting innovation and experimentation, and learning from outcomes. Changes are also needed in policies throughout government, from employment law to trade. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper reviews how sustainable development was treated in prior assessment reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and presents proposals on how it might be integrated into the forthcoming Fourth Assessment Report (AR4). There has been a steady, but slow, increase in the exposure and treatment of sustainable development in each subsequent IPCC assessment. However, much more remains to be done if the mandate provided in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) is to be met. The paper argues that the AR4 can take three practical steps in making the integration more complete. First, at the conceptual level, equity concerns should be made a more pervasive, even central, focus of the AR4. Second, at the analytical level, the examination of alternative development pathways begun during the TAR process needs to be continued and expanded. Third, at the operational level, the AR4 should deal with sustainable development in all its chapters rather than relegating it to a peripheral few, should broaden the base of expertise reflected in its panels of authors and reviewers, and should commission a companion special report on climate change and sustainable development.

   SRES; adaptation mitigation links (and vice versa); mitigation-links to
   development paths
AB Climate change and sustainable development have been addressed in largely separate circles in both research and policy. Nevertheless, there are strong linkages between the two in both realms. This paper focuses on the scientific linkages and discusses the opportunities they provide for integrated policy development, and the necessity to consider the risk of trade-offs. It is suggested that integration may not only provide new opportunities, but may even be a prerequisite for successfully addressing both issues. Since the feasibility of stabilising greenhouse gas concentrations is dependent on general socio-economic development paths, climate policy responses should be fully placed in the larger context of technological and socio-economic policy development rather than be viewed as an add-on to those broader policies. The arguments are supported by a range of examples for various economic sectors in the areas of both mitigation and adaptation, largely drawn from IPCC's Third Assessment Report.

AB This paper reports on investigations of two propositions. First, it is easy to overestimate the importance of climate change in the larger picture of sustainable development while at the same time underestimating the potential for climate change concerns to be a catalyst for progress toward sustainable development. Second, these imbalances in perceptions are more likely to be addressed effectively at a local scale than at a global or national scale. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The aim of using wastes in agriculture is to achieve a sustainable cycle in which these wastes will turn into organic sources in agricultural production. The specific objective was to study the composition of compost made with different sewage sludge/bulking agent ratios and to establish the most suitable stability or maturity analytical index for the compost. Three compost piles. with different volume proportions (biosolids: sawdust) were performed. Measurements of pH, cationic-exchange capacity (CEC), total carbon (Ct), total nitrogen (Nt), ignition losses (IL), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), humic (HA), and fulvic acids (FA) were conducted. Microbial respiration was measured in the first and last thermophilic stage. Heavy metals [chromium (Cr), nickel (Ni), lead (Pb), zinc (Zn), copper (Cu), mercury (Hg), silver (Ag), arsenic (As), barium (Ba), selenium (Se), and cadmium (Cd)] were determined at the end of composting. The ratios used did not influence the compost properties since no differences were found either in the composition of final product or in the time required to achieve a mature compost. The pH, CEC/Ct, Ct/Nt, and IL% did not indicate degree of stability or maturity of compost. The HA and FA trials did not allow to establish the degree of the humification process. The Ct, Nt, and DOC clearly indicated the end stage in the compost piles maturity. These assessments were achieved after two months of processing, reaching stability with the following values: 3.5 and 5 g kg(-1) for the Ct, 0.25 and 0.38 g kg(-1) for Nt and 0.03 g kg(-1) for DOC. The respiration activity decreased by 70%to 80% at the end of the thermophilic stage. The level of heavy metals, measured when the study was over, did not reach the highest values permitted by current regulations.

AB The chemical control of plant pathogens concerns mainly fungal diseases of crops. Most of the available fungicides act directly on essential fungal functions such as respiration, sterol biosynthesis or cell division. Consequently, these compounds can exhibit undesirable toxicological and environmental effects and sometimes select fungal resistant strains. Plant activators are expected to provide sustainable disease management in several crops because the development of resistance is not expected. Considering the future, the discovery of novel antifungal molecules will reap advantage from throughput screening methodologies and functional genomics.

AB This paper deals with the effects of agronomic practices on parasite life cycles, and the design of integrated crop protection strategies. Cropping systems have a large effect on the size of the primary inoculum and its localisation, on the development and spread of epidemics, and on the coordination of the life cycle of cultivated plants and that of their parasites. They can disrupt ecological equilibria, either favouring or disfavouring the pathogens. By combining information concerning the effects of agricultural techniques on diseases and the physiological effects of diseases on growth and crop production, it is now possible to develop new crop management systems, in which the use of non-chemical methods for preventing diseases is a priority. However, the cur-rent knowledge need to be completed by studies on other scales, particularly of the effect of cropping systems on the genetics of disease populations integrating more completely the 'long-term' dimension of sustainable agriculture.

AB No other district in Pakistan has seen a higher proportion of its population engage in transnational migration than Mirpur and from nowhere else have a higher proportion of such migrants successfully established themselves in Britain. Yet despite the intensity of the trans-local linkages which have thereby been created, and the huge flow of remittance capital into a district which otherwise occupies a thoroughly marginalised position on the global periphery, in no way has this served to stimulate any kind of sustainable pattern of economic development. This article sets out to place these developments in their appropriate historical, political, environmental, local and global contexts in an effort to establish how and why it is that the Mirpuris' otherwise sophisticated and successful entrepreneurial capabilities have not led to more successful and sustainable outcomes in their home base. There are good reasons why the lessons that can be learned in Mirpur could well be applicable elsewhere.

AB Soil mineral deficiencies or toxicities adversely affect common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) production worldwide. Cultivars tolerant to low soil fertility (LF) should support sustainable farming systems and reduce production costs and farmers' dependence on fertilizers. Our objective was to identify LF tolerant landraces and improved common bean genotypes. We systematically screened 5000 to 5500 landraces and improved genotypes for LF tolerance at Popayan and Quilichao, Colombia, between 1978 and 1998. Mean LF intensity index across locations for seed yield ranged from 0.35 to 0.68. Average seed yield reduction over five cropping seasons was 53%. Seed yield, biomass, and HI were positively associated in LF and high soil fertility (HF). LF tolerance was identified in eight landraces and 14 improved genotypes. All landraces were from Middle America (MA), belonging to common bean races Durango, Jalisco, and Mesoamerica. All improved genotypes except one (A 36) also possessed characteristics of and involved one or more LF tolerant MA landraces in their pedigree. There was considerable variation for seed, plant, and maturity characteristics among LF tolerant genotypes. In LF, mean seed yield for landraces ranged from 856 kg ha(-1) for 'Apetito' to 332 kg ha(-1) for G 19833. Among improved genotypes, A 774 had the highest (948 kg ha(-1)) and CAP 4 the lowest (651 kg ha(-1)) seed yield. Reduction in seed yield due to LF ranged from 31% for A 36 to 63% for CAP 4. All landraces and seven improved genotypes had either a below average or average LF susceptibility index. Use of these LF tolerant landraces and improved genotypes should be maximized in breeding and genetic studies to enhance sustainable farming systems.
