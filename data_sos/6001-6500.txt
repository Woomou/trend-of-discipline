AB Many people in sub-Saharan Africa have to rely on meager water resources within mudstones for their only water supply. Although mudstones have been extensively researched for their low permeability behavior, little research has been undertaken to examine their ability to provide sustainable water supplies. To investigate the factors controlling the occurrence of usable ground water in mudstone environments, an area of Cretaceous mudstones in southeastern Nigeria was studied over a 3 yr period. Transmissivity (T) variations in a range of mudstone environments were studied. The investigations demonstrate that within the top 40 m of mudstones, transmissivity can be sufficient to develop village water supplies (T > 1 m(2)/d). Transmissivity is controlled by two factors: low-grade metamorphism and the presence of other, subordinate, lithologies within the mudstones. Largely unaltered mudstones (early diagenetic zone), comprising mainly smectite clays, are mostly unfractured and have a low T of < 0.1 m(2)/d. Mudstones that have undergone limited metamorphism (late diagenetic zone) comprise mixed layered illite/smectite clays, and ground water is found in widely spaced fracture zones (T > 1 m(2)/d in large fracture zones; T < 0.1 m(2)/d away from fracture zones). Mudstones that have been further altered and approach the anchizone comprise illite clays, are pervasively fractured, and have the highest transmissivity values (T > 4 m(2)/d). Dolerite intrusions in unaltered, smectitic mudstones are highly fractured with transmissivity in the range of 1 < T < 60 m(2)/d. Thin limestone and sandstone layers can also enhance transmissivity sufficiently to provide community water supplies.

TI Local agenda 21, capacity building and the cities of Peru
SO HABITAT INTERNATIONAL

DT Article
DE Agenda 21; education; capacity building; planning; urban Peru
AB The Peruvian Forum of Cities for Life has promoted and worked for the implementation of Local Agenda 21 since 1997. The technical assistance and capacity building support for Local Agenda 21 in Peru's cities has produced many project initiatives and investments plans, has contributed to modifications in local planning norms and boosted the work of environmental NGOs. Over the coming years when the environmental infrastructure projects get implemented all this is expected to show visible impacts for the quality of life and will be seen as the foundation for a continuous participatory and sustainable process of city development and environmental improvements. The weakness of the Peruvian Agenda 21 process has been and continues to be, however, the constrained funding situation for municipal investments.
   The relevance of the Peruvian Agenda 21 experience can be seen in the fact that it has filled a void in urban planning, has assumed the role of a stimulator of participatory processes and concerted action. Agenda 21 has contributed to a significant rise in environmental and urban consciousness of the local institutions and the general public. The successful application of a combined approach of awareness raising, education, capacity building and technical assistance is the real message of this experience of the Forum of Cities for Life and its Peru Urban Management Education Program (PEGUP).

TI Trading health services across borders: GATS, markets, and caeats
SO HEALTH AFFAIRS
LA English
DT Article
AB The General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) is the result of an ongoing process of opening national markets to foreign health services within an international framework of trade agreements that prohibit discriminatory treatment of foreign suppliers. Developing markets are growing, as is demand for health care services, and most of this demand is being met by the private market. The globalization of health services requires the resources of the academic and corporate sectors of the developed world for equitable and sustainable growth. Health services trade should be seen as a tool for achieving these goals, rather than as an end in itself.

SO HEALTH RISK & SOCIETY
LA English
DT Article
DE food choice; environment; risk; safety; health
ID RISK; HEALTH; DEBATE
AB Health campaigns have focused on lifestyle decisions such as physical inactivity, diet and smoking to minimise health risks. The links between health, environmental sustainability and consumer food choices have less prominence. Reported here are Australian consumer perceptions of environmental health issues related to the food system. Interviews with 26 participants explored the environmental implications of food choices. Concerns included conflicting information, related health risks, and the blaming of individuals for 'poor' choices. Participants recognised that focussing on the individual overlooked the structural context of food production. They requested information about food production processes to assist decision-making and identified the need for an influential body to advocate for their interests in food production decisions. The results indicate a need for government, industry and consumer collaboration to develop and implement practical communication strategies about food production for communities.

TI From nature tourism to ecotourism? The case of the Nerorongoro
   Conservation Area, Tanzania
SO HUMAN ORGANIZATION
LA English
DT Article
DE ecotourism; sustainable development; Maasai; Ngorongoro
AB This paper examines what is needed to transform nature tourism to protected areas into ecotourism, having genuine social benefits and serving as a tool for sustainable community development. It draws on the case of the Ngorongoro Conservation Area, Tanzania's most visited protected area, and a multiple land use zone inhabited by the pastoral Maasai peoples. I argue that for ecotourism to promote sustainable development in communities that are its supposed beneficiaries, three fundamental conditions must be met. First, opportunities to capture the economic benefits of tourism must be structured in a way that is culturally appropriate, and therefore accessible to the target population. Second, for communities to benefit from ecotourism, they need secure land tenure over the area in which it takes place, as well as the ability to make land use decisions for that area. Third. tourism benefits to local communities must be more than economic; they must promote deeper social and political justice goals that, if left unaddressed, restrict peoples' ability to enjoy the economic benefits of tourism. Without these elements, the conservation outcomes of ecotourism are likely to be less favorable.

AB In this article we examine community level civil society in Chiloe, Chile. We look at the interface between community and the wider systemic environment in the community development process. Issues such as the paradox of community solidarity, culture of dependence, obstacles to grass-roots participation, and leadership are examined in the community context. These issues are set in relief against a systemic environment comprised of traditional municipal politics and modernist 'intervening' agencies of the state. We refer to the case of one organization, ProRural, to examine the successes and failures of an interventionist strategy in Chiloe. Our central argument is that structural powerlessness, and dependent relations on the state, are reproduced through traditional cultural patterns in small community settings. These obstacles can be overcome through the development of leadership capacity and small project successes which in time stimulate new cultural patterns. The role of intervening organizations in this process is vital. But such organizations have to adopt a long-term, capacity-building strategy based on flexible and responsive relationships with their constituencies.

AB The future of the development and application of groundwater remediation technologies will unfold in an atmosphere of heightened public concern and attention. Cleanup policy will undergo incremental change towards more comprehensive efforts which account for the impact of remediation on nearby resources. Newly discovered contaminants will cause the re-examination of "mature" technologies since they may be persistent, mobile and difficult to treat in-situ. Evaluations of the effectiveness of remedial technologies will eventually include byproduct formation, geochemical consequences and sustainability. Long-term field trials of remedial technologies alone can provide the data necessary to support claims of effectiveness.

AB There is currently a need for a review of the definition and methodology of determining sustainable yield. The reasons are: (1) current definitions and concepts are ambiguous and non-physically based so cannot be used for quantitative application, (2) there is a need to eliminate varying interpretations and misinterpretations and provide a sound basis for application, (3) the notion that all groundwater systems either are or can be made to be sustainable is invalid, (4) often there are an excessive number of factors bound up in the definition that are not easily quantifiable, (5) there is often confusion between production facility optimal yield and basin sustainable yield, (6) in many semi-arid and and environments groundwater systems cannot be sensibly developed using a sustained yield policy particularly where ecological constraints are applied. Derivation of sustainable yield using conservation of mass principles leads to expressions for basin sustainable, partial (non-sustainable) mining and total (non-sustainable) mining yields that can be readily determined using numerical modelling methods and selected on the basis of applied constraints. For sonic cases there has to be recognition that the groundwater resource is not renewable and its use cannot therefore be sustainable. In these cases, its destiny should be the best equitable use.

AB The possibility to use three-phase permanent magnet linear generators to convert sea wave energy into electric energy is investigated by multiphysics simulations. The results show a possibility, which needs to be further verified by experimental tests, for a future step toward a sustainable electric power production from ocean waves by using direct conversion. The results suggest that wave energy can have an impact on tomorrow's new sustainable electricity production, not only for large units, but also for units ranging down to 10 kW. This gives wave power a larger economical potential than previously estimated. The study demonstrates the feasibility of computer simulations to give a broad, and in several aspects a detailed, understanding of the energy conversion. The simulation results also give a useful starting point for future experimental work.

AB This article presents three studies dealing with information and communication needs in rural primary health care from Peru and Nicaragua. Results show that primary health-care systems in rural areas of developing countries are very inefficient. Among the main reasons we found factors related to communication infrastructure, information sharing, and continuous training of health professionals. We conclude that telemedicine systems can improve this situation, but the lack of infrastructures, low income levels, and other conditions, impose strong limits to the introduction of new technologies. The main conclusion is that differences in needs and conditions between developing countries and industrialized ones force to use different solutions and approaches. This article presents some proposals on technology requirements and how to deal with the use of telemedicine in rural areas of developing countries. These proposals can be useful to all kind of actors (national public administrations, multilateral institutions, industry, academy, civil society, etc.) in order to promote really relevant and sustainable proposals in telemedicine for rural regions of developing countries.

AB A field experiment was conducted at Regional Agricultural Research Station, Jagtial, during rainy (kharif) and winter (rabi) seasons of 1996-97 to 1998-99 on red sandy-loam soils, to find out profitable and energy-efficient rice (Oryza sativa L.)-based cropping sequences among different cropping sequences, viz., rice-maize (Zea mays L.), rice-sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.), rice-groundnut (Arachis hypogaea L.), rice-blackgram (Phaseolus mungo L.), rice-greengram (Phaseolus radiatus L.), rice-soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.], rice-Indian mustard [Brassica juncea (L.) Czernj. & Cosson] and rice-rice. Of the 8 cropping sequences, rice-rice, rice-maize and rice-sunflower cropping sequences gave significantly higher rice-equivalent yield (11,616, 11,553 and 10,868 kg/ha respectively) and gross returns (Rs 51,745, 51,464 and 48,291/ha respectively). Though field water supply was higher to rice-rice cropping sequence (2,800 mm), the water-use efficiency was lowest (4.15 kg/mm). Similarly, rice-rice cropping sequence also required higher energy input (75,036 MJ/ha) but the energy efficiency and energy productivity were lowest (4.2 and 155 g/MJ). However, net returns and benefit : cost ratio were higher with rice-maize (Rs 21,884/ha; 1.74) and rice-sunflower (Rs 21,321/ha; 1.79) cropping sequences. Similarly, these cropping sequences also recorded higher energy-use efficiency (6.4 and 5.1 respectively), energy productivity (227 and 238 g/MJ respectively) and water-use efficiency (7.22 and 7.50 kg/mm respectively) and were more sustainable than rice-rice and other rice-based cropping sequences.

AB Epoxy based paints are widely formulated from diglycedyl ether of bisphenol-A (DGEBA). They are foremost atnicorrosive industrial paints but show poor outdoor weatherability, low resistance to acids and are susceptible to chalking, In view of the fast depleting stocks of petroleum, DGEBA, one of the petroleum-derived chemicals in paints can be partially or fully replaced by a vegetable oil epoxy, which is a sustainable based resource material. Attempts to obtain usable paints from Pure vegetable oil epoxy like epoxidised linseed oil (LOE), by authors have been unsuccessful as it does not form rigid film. To overcome this problem, the oil epoxy was blended with hard polymers like polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) and polystyrene (PS). with a low weight percentage to obtain LOE based compatible blend Paints. Such a low quantity of PMMA and PS were found to yield fast setting paint films of good physico-mechanical and anticorrosive characteristics. It was observed that LOE-PMMA-MF paint showed improved performance than DGEBA-Polyamide (PA) paint except against alkali.

SO INTERNATIONAL FORESTRY REVIEW

DT Article
DE Reduced Impact Harvesting (RIH); Brazilian Amazon; Criteria and
   Indicators (C&I)
AB The paper presents the results and main conclusions of an assessment of compliance with technical guidelines for Reduced Impact Harvesting (RIH) in terra firme forests of the Brazilian Amazon. The assessment was carried out in two certified timber enterprises in the State of Para, Brazil applying the RIH-guidelines for a period of over three years. From a tool developed for Amazonian forest enterprises to monitor the sustainability of their harvesting operations, which uses a set of criteria and indicators (C&I), a total of 190 verifiers were selected for assessing the 61 RIH-guidelines. The assessment revealed valuable information with regard to the state of implementation and quality of the forest operations in the two enterprises and important insights for improvement of the RIH-guidelines. Two thirds of the RIH-guidelines were fully implemented. Their acceptance, however, differed according to the situation and interest of the enterprises. Among the reasons for incomplete implementation of the RIH-guidelines, the lack of systematic monitoring insufficient training and qualification. and inadequate equipment appeared to be most important. The study also showed the need for the continuous assessment of the quality and relevance of RIH-guidelines.

TI Demand and supply of wood for drum making in central Uganda
SO INTERNATIONAL FORESTRY REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
DE drum making; Uganda; Polyscias fulva; Mpigi district; supply and demand
AB Drum making is an important economic activity in Mpigi district, central Uganda. Scarcity of the desired tree species for drum making has raised concern about the future of the business. A study was carried out to assess the demand and Supply of wood for making drums and ascertain whether the supply of logs from the wild is sustainable. Drum makers in 28 stalls were interviewed to collect information on the Volume of wood required for making drums. Thirty sample plots were established in Degeya, Lufuka and Mpanga forests to determine the potential supply of logs. A combined Huber and Newton's formulae and Von Mantel's method were used to compute the volume of wood that could be obtained from the forests. The wood used in drum making is in critical supply and the annual demand exceeds supply by 610 m(3). Harvesting of the tree species desired for drum making from the forests is not sustainable. On-farm cultivation of the trees by the local communities is recommended in order to supply logs for drum making and reduce pressure on the forests.

TI Medicinal plants in urban districts of Tanzania: plants, gender roles

SO INTERNATIONAL FORESTRY REVIEW

DT Article
DE medicinal plants; sustainable use; gender roles; urban; Tanzania
ID POPULATIONS; HIGHLANDS; RESERVE; MEXICO; TREES
AB An ethnobotanical survey was carried out to collect information on medicinal plants and gender roles in sustainable use by urban communities of Morogoro and Iringa districts, Tanzania. A total of 99 and 75 medicinal plant species distributed in various genera and vascular plant families, curing about 72 and 57 human diseases, were reported in the two districts respectively. Results showed significant gender roles difference in sustainable use of medicinal plants. Most men herbalists used roots while women preferred barks. Uprooting during plant harvesting was agreed to exist by most men herbalists in Morogoro. The majority of men and women herbalists supported the idea of conserving medicinal plants in order to ensure their sustainability in future. Since medicinal plants play an important role in the livelihoods of urban dwellers, their loss due to unsustainable exploitation will obstruct the existing health care system unless conservation measures are taken. There is a need to sensitize and train herbalists and other users on sustainable ways of harvesting medicinal plants, encourage traditional conservation methods and domestication possibilities in home gardens. Emphasis on domestication should be a priority to women considering their marginal economic status and special interest in plant resources. Government legislation regarding plants protection should be strengthened to control harvesting of medicinal plants in the wild. Studies to validate safety and efficacy, assess harvesting sustainability and wild status of medicinal plants is recommended to improve the health care system and strengthen conservation abilities in Tanzania.

AB Disease-resistant livestock could provide a potentially sustainable and environmentally sound method of controlling tick and tick-borne diseases of livestock in the developing world. Advances in the knowledge and science of genomics open up opportunities to identify selectable genes controlling disease resistance but first, breeds and individuals with distinguishable phenotypes need to be identified. The Bos indicus breed, Sahiwal, has been exploited in dairy breeding programmes, because it is resistant to ticks and has relatively good performance characteristics compared to other indigenous cattle breeds of tropical regions. The analyses reported here show that Sahiwal calves were also more resistant than European Bos taurus (Holstein) dairy breed calves to tick-borne tropical theileriosis (Theileria annulata infection). Following experimental infection with T. annulata sporozoites, a group of Sahiwal calves all survived without treatment, with significantly lower maximum temperatures (P < 0.01) and lower rates of parasite multiplication (P < 0.05) than a group of Holstein calves, which all had severe responses. Although the Sahiwals became as anaemic as the Holsteins, other measures of pathology, including enlargement of the draining lymph node and the acute phase proteins, alpha(1) acid glycoprotein and haptoglobin, were significantly less in the Sahiwals than in the Holsteins (P < 0.05). Additionally, the Sahiwals had significantly lower resting levels of alpha(1) acid glycoprotein than the Holsteins (P < 0.05). Production of a third acute phase proteins, serum amyloid A, had very similar kinetics in both breeds. Acute phase proteins are produced in response to systemic release of the kinds of pro-inflammatory cytokines that are thought to be responsible for the pyrexic, cachectic and anorexic responses characteristic of tropical theileriosis. The prolonged production of a, acid glycoprotein in the Holsteins is indicative of chronic production of circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines. In contrast, Sahiwals appear able to overcome infection with T. annulata as well as limit pathology by preventing the over-stimulation of pathways involving these cytokines.

   influence of textural properties and surface chemistry

ID HYDROGEN-PRODUCTION; DECARBONIZATION
AB Use of carbon-based catalyst for thermocatalyfic CO2-free production of hydrogen from methane offers several advantages. In this paper, activated carbons with different textural properties and surface chemistry have been used to study the influence of these properties on the efficiency of methane decomposition. It has been shown that the initial reaction rate of decomposition is related to the surface chemistry of the catalyst, in particular to the concentration of oxygenated groups, and not to the surface area. On the other hand, the capacity to accumulate carbon before deactivation, which defines the long-term behaviour, is related to the surface area and the pore size distribution, in particular to the area in mesopores. In this way, microporrous carbons with high content of oxigenated surface groups exhibit high initial conversion rates but they become rapidly deactivated. In contrast, mesoporous carbons with high surface area provide more stable and sustainable hydrogen production. (C) 2004 International Association for Hydrogen Energy. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

DT Article
DE concepts of transdisciplinarity; sustain ability research; innovation;
   interdisciplinary cooperation; mode 1 and mode 2
AB Under the assumption that there is a close interrelatedness between sustainability research and transdisciplinarity, the authors have explored the experiences of researchers in the sustainability area with this mode of knowledge generation. The paper refers to two standardised surveys carried out in extra-university research institutes in the German state of Baden-Wurttemberg. Explored were the actual research practice and the structural, cultural and personal factors which play a role regarding the feasibility of transdisciplinarity. In the everyday practice of researchers, it was found that it is extraordinarily complicated to overcome disciplinary limitations and to abandon the epistemo-logical security of one's own discipline. This is a duplicate form of insecurity: insecurity concerning the research object and insecurity concerning one's own identity and professional future as a scientist. Thus, cultural (scientific) and structural factors prove to be inhibitory to transdisciplinarity. In the future, this Situation may change, especially in extra-university research institutes, if it is possible to let both forms of knowledge generation flow in a project-dependent parallel way.

AB Techniques for water harvesting from streams for irrigation and waterpower utilities, particularly in the semi-arid middle mountain region of Nepal, were developed many centuries ago. Water harvesting techniques have traditionally evolved to fit the local environment and living conditions of the people. In terms of community participation, the sustainability of community-based local water resources management in Nepal should promote traditional streamwater harvesting technologies that will potentially benefit local communities and also should be recognized by environmentalists and water experts. This paper investigates some traditional forms of water delivery technologies adopted by local farmers in three catchment areas from the middle mountain region of Nepal. Each form of indigenous practice is considered from the objective of scientific validation.

AB How do Cambodian villagers perceive sustainability and what do they do'on the ground'? Looking at sustainability issues through the lens of two local resource management committees, and using a triangulation of social science research methods, this paper examines the roles and responsibilities of these groups and how they grapple with resource degradation and related activities. The committees have experimented with a range of resource management strategies, from creating fishing sanctuaries to resolving fishing gear theft. The results indicate that one reason villagers are willing to engage in coil) In Unity-based management is when they believe that they can improve livelihoods within their community. Community-based management is being carried out in the absence of formal legislation; it is recognized through government policy and administrative approvals. In this regard, local-level support and leadership has been key, and the current arrangement has created the political space for experimentation and learning.

AB The theory, of the commons encompasses two interpretations: one based on 'manifest custonis', whilst the other relates to'latent customs'. The Former asserts that individuals behave as rational economic units, pursuing their own profit based mechanisms, whilst social restrictions relating to the use of resources within communities act to prevent the total destruction of the natural environment. In contrast, the latter holds that people behave according to the normality or ethics emboddied within the society, and that this contributes to sustainable resource management.
   A field survey conducted in West java as part of the present study revealed that a system of communal ownership of lands and resources is widely practiced on land that is strictly private property, including paddy fields, cultivated swiddens, gardens and so forth, facilitated by the distribution of land, lending and borrowing of land and collaborative labour systems. This customary management system is considered it prime example of the commons resource management. Furthermore, communal lands, were also seen to play a significant role in the distribution of land and resources amongst community members to supplement daily needs. In addition, these customary land-use systems-as the commons, are considered to contribute towards mitigating the gap between rich and poor.

AB In summary, at Genencor we believe that industrial biotechnology can contribute significantly to progress towards industrial sustainability. We also take seriously the challenge this poses to individual companies. From its first days, Genencor has been devoted to applying the lessons of biotechnology to solving all kinds of problems, not just human health. Twenty years from now, we will look back and see that biotechnology has contributed much more to human progress than just curing terrible diseases. And, 20 years from now, we think we will be living in a flourishing biobased economy.

AB Using stable N isotopes, the fate of effluent-derived N has been determined within a land based municipal effluent irrigation scheme. Over 900 metric tonnes (t) of effluent-derived N have been applied to 192 ha of production conifer forest near Rotorua (NZ) over the past 11 years. The effluent N has a natural isotopic signal, generated by the treatment process, allowing it to be traced into various components of the system. Using this isotopic signal, a realistic approximation of storage capacity of various components of the system has been generated, including a calculation of the contribution of effluent N exiting the catchment via stream flow.
   Forest storage accounts for 50% of the applied N with a considerable proportion of that immobilized in wood and soil. The wetland, although not intensively sampled, retains 115 t, (13%) of the applied N. Denitrification, including that occurring within the wetland, accounts for 23 t (3%). Nitrogen isotope data confirm that the rise in NO3 concentrations is directly attributable to effluent N. Currently 88% of NO3-N in the stream is effluent-derived. Using current N isotope values for the stream and extrapolating over the discharge period, export of effluent N via the stream is estimated as 263 t (29%) of the applied N. Overall the forest and wetland ecosystem has intercepted or denitrified 65% of applied N, with 29% lost to the stream, and 50 t (5%) unaccounted for.
   The forest ecosystem is currently over-supplied with N and a number of management implications flows from these findings. In the long term the continued application of effluent N to the current irrigation area is not sustainable.

ID SEPARABILITY; TESTS
AB This paper deals with the optimal organisation of the water supplying industry by having a close look on the basic characteristics of water as an economic good as well as the specific structure of production. The stages of water generation, treatment, transport and distribution are analysed by applying economic concepts as economies of scale and scope, subadditivity, irreversible investments and transaction costs, vertical integration as well as functional separability. On the basis of these analyses the determination of the optimal firm and industry structure is approached. Empirically based organisation models have not been considered in the course of the ongoing discussion on water sector liberalisation so far, I fence, with respect to tight public budgets as well as increasingly scarce water resources central economic concepts are modelled for an empirical application to the water industry in order to contribute to the identification of a sustainable firm and industry structure. The ,pool-model' seems to lie a promising alternative with respect to the restructuring of the water supplying industry.

AB We conducted a laboratory investigation on the consequences of feeding predatory salmonids either experimental diets low in thiamine or diets containing alewife Alosa pseudoharengus. In experiment 1, adult lake trout Salvelinus namaycush were fed experimental diets containing bacterial thiaminase. In experiment 2, adult lake trout were fed natural prey species, alewives, and bloaters Coregonus hoyi. The diets consisted of four combinations of alewives and bloaters from Lake Michigan (100% alewives, 65% alewives-35% bloaters, 35% alewives-65% bloaters, and 100% bloaters), alewives from Cayuga Lake, a casein bacterial thiaminase, and a commercial trout diet. We assessed the effects of each diet on egg thiamine concentration and incidence of an embryonic early mortality syndrome (EMS). In experiment 1, incidence of EMS ranged from 0% to 100%. Significant relationships were found between the incidence of EMS and thiamine. In experiment 2, adult lake trout fed 100% alewives from either Lake Michigan or Cayuga Lake or fish fed the casein bacterial thiaminase diet produced eggs with low thiamine and swim-up fry with EMS. At either 35% or 65% alewives in the diet, egg thiamine was significantly lowered. The number of females that produced offspring that died from EMS were low but demonstrated the negative potential if feral lake trout foraged on either 35% or 65% alewives. Depleted egg thiamine and the onset of EMS required diets containing thiaminase for a minimum of 2 years in lake trout initially fully thiamine replete. We conclude that EMS can be caused by extensive feeding on 100% alewives and dietary levels of 35% or greater may prove detrimental to sustainable reproduction of salmonids in the Great Lakes. The data are consistent with that observed in feral lake trout, and it is concluded that EMS is the result of a thiamine deficiency.

AB As the second part of a research agenda addressing the idea and meaning of Sustainable Development, this paper responds to the challenges set in the first paper. Using a Foucaudian perspective, we uncover and highlight the importance of discourse in the development of societal context which could lead to the radical change in our epistemological thought necessary for Sustainable Development to reach its potential. By developing an argument for an epistemological change, we suggest that business organizations have an ethical responsibility towards revaluating Sustainable Development, leading to a discourse based on an integrated inclusive process of celebrating diversity in all its forms. The paper goes on to explore the argument for such a change. This exploration is based on three issues: the notion of over simplification in the promotion of development; the idea of an imbalance in the interaction of business and government operating in the larger context of society; and the notion of increasing responsibility with increasing influence in terms of the business organization within society. Having established the argument for an ethical choice by business organizations, we then reflect on how such a change could be incorporated into an organization.

AB This paper analyzes the question: What does it take for science parks and technology districts to evolve and grow? We propose an analytical framework to examine the gestation, evolution, and sustainability of science parks and related but broader regional phenomena such as technology districts. The framework comprises three aspects of a science park's development: growth mechanisms, level of technological capabilities, and nature of its integration with national or global markets. The main growth mechanisms we identify are government-led infrastructure provision, agglomeration effects, and continual self-renewal through the creation of new businesses. We apply this framework to analyze Singapore's science park strategy and the recent One-North initiative. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The Barataria-Terrebonne Estuarine System (BTESP in southeast Louisiana is one of the most vulnerable areas to coastal land loss in the United States. Comprising more than four million acres of wetlands, bayous, bay.,;, and barrier shorelines, about 682 species of birds, fish, mammals, reptiles, and amphibians plus numerous species of invertebrates, including shrimp, oysters, and crabs, live or visit the BTES. It has the highest land loss rate and some of the most rapidly eroding barrier islands in the United States. Annual wetland loss rates ranged from 18 to 22 mi(2)/y in the last 50 years in the BTES, representing at least one-half of the land loss in the entire state. The wetlands and shallow estuarine waters of the BTES are extremely productive, supporting diverse recreational opportunities and one of the largest commercial fishing industries in the country. These industries, with a large share coming from the BTES, generate more than $2 billion annually in fish and wildlife-associated activities, making the BTES a critical component of Louisiana's and the nation's economy. Unfortunately. Louisiana's wetlands are deteriorating rapidly, severely threatening the sustainability of the entire system and the assets of it.; renewable resources. As the barrier islands and wetlands of the BTES degrade and are lost, important habitat for renewable resources that support these industries will be gone. To preserve and protect these resources, restoration of wetlands and barrier shorelines is essential, Although the BTES is only one piece of coastal Louisiana that is at stake, this paper focuses on the area to illustrate the richness of Louisiana's renewable resources and coastal environments. and the challenges that all coastal communities will face in the future.

AB The claim that the EU played a leadership role at the 2002 World Summit on Sustainable Development is examined using the concept of normative power Europe. We examine how the EU operationalized the concept of sustainable development before questioning whether the EU represents a normative power in the field of sustainable development. In doing so, we address two key concerns. First, we question the depth of the current EU's commitment to sustainable development. Second, we raise a number of important theoretical questions regarding Ian Manners' broader application of the concept of normative power Europe.

DE community development approach; aid and post-conflict societies;

   psychosocial effects of violence; traumatized; communities; Guatemala;
   community healing; empowerment and development; reconciliation;
   sustainability
AB The main challenge for community development efforts in post-conflict societies with large numbers of traumatized people is to create hope and reconciliation through community healing and participatory democratic community development. The community development efforts should aim at creating a set of values and practices conducive to peaceful co-existence through non-violent conflict resolution, thereby reducing the alarming levels of violence in post-conflict societies.
   This article describes a community development approach in Guatemala to supporting people affected by organized violence and torture. Through a description of the theoretical and practical work carried out in post-conflict Guatemala through the ODHAG-RCT programme, the article focuses on the relation between the three main pillars of the community development approach; healing, empowerment, and development. The community development approach uses health as the entry strategy to its aim of social and political transformation. Traditionally, health is not perceived as being linked with social and political transformation, but rather as the means to increase the health condition of community members. However, this article will show how community social psychology can be integrated in an understanding of political and economic community development. Hence it is argued that the outcome of the community development approach is measured through observations of the group as well as the political and economic developments of the community, and not only through a decrease in health related symptoms.

AB A discrete model of a market economy is coupled to an accumulating pollutant, and the intertemporal equilibrium dynamics of the resulting three-dimensional economic-environmental system is investigated through analysis and numerical methods. Conditions for the existence and stability of sustainable equilibria are studied under the usual assumption of linear uptake of the pollutant by the biosphere and under an alternative assumption of a threshold mechanism for uptake that leads to potential fold bifurcations and problems of existence for real equilibria over parts of the parameter space.

AB We present an integrated methodology for the optimal management of nitrate contamination of ground water combining environmental assessment and economic cost evaluation through multi-criteria decision analysis. The proposed methodology incorporates an integrated physical modeling framework accounting for on-ground nitrogen loading and losses, soil nitrogen dynamics, and fate and transport of nitrate in ground water to compute the sustainable on-ground nitrogen loading such that the maximum contaminant level is not violated. A number of protection alternatives to stipulate the predicted sustainable on-ground nitrogen loading are evaluated using the decision analysis that employs the importance order of criteria approach for ranking and selection of the protection alternatives. The methodology was successfully demonstrated for the Sumas-Blaine aquifer in Washington State. The results showed the importance of using this integrated approach which predicts the sustainable on-ground nitrogen loadings and provides an insight into the economic consequences generated in satisfying the environmental constraints. The results also show that the proposed decision analysis framework, within certain limitations, is effective when selecting alternatives with competing demands. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

ID LOWLAND AGRICULTURAL CATCHMENTS; SOIL-EROSION; SUSPENDED SEDIMENT;
   RATES; BUDGETS; PB-210
AB Recognition of the threat to the sustainable use of the earth's resources posed by soil erosion and associated off-site sedimentation has generated an increasing need for reliable information on global rates of soil loss. Existing methods of assessing rates of soil loss across large areas possess many limitations and there is a need to explore alternative approaches to characterizing land surface erosion at the regional and global scale. The downcore profiles of Cs-137 activity available for numerous lakes and reservoirs located in different areas of the world can be used to provide information on land surface erosion within the upstream catchments. The rate of decline of Cs-137 activity toward the surface of the sediment deposited in a lake or reservoir can be used to estimate the rate of surface lowering associated with eroding areas within the upstream catchment, and the concentration of Cs-137 in recently deposited sediment provides a basis for estimating the relative importance of surface and channel, gully, and/or subsurface erosion as a source of the deposited sediment. The approach has been tested using Cs-137 data from several lakes and reservoirs in southern England and China, spanning a wide range of specific suspended sediment yield. The results obtained are consistent with other independent evidence of erosion rates and sediment sources within the lake and reservoir catchments and confirm the validity of the overall approach. The approach appears to offer valuable potential for characterizing land surface erosion, particularly in terms of its ability to provide information on the rate of surface lowering associated with the eroding areas, rather than an average rate of lowering for the entire catchment surface.

AB The World Summit for Sustainable Development (WSSD) in Johannesburg made it clear that political leadership the world over is incapable of rising to the challenges of sustainability. Yet, most of the hundred or so world leaders who attended have a higher education degree from some of the world's most prestigious universities. This paper tries to address some of the key challenges this poses for universities. It looks at the changing professional landscape within the EU, parameters of a higher education (HE) that would produce Earth-literate leaders, at the concept of a sustainable university and ecological footprinting as a tool to measure this, and at the implications all this has for the HE and geography curriculum.

AB The declaration of the 'United Nations Decade of Education for Sustainable Development' (ESD), Resolution 571254, February 2003, provides the best yet occasion for higher education institutions (HEIs) to 'green' their curricula. The idea for the Decade emerges from a progression of high-level international conferences, beginning with Stockholm, 1972, that have seen ESD thinking move from general statements of intent to increasingly detailed specifications for action. There has also been a growth in awareness that the changes to the curriculum for sustainable development must suffuse all areas of education provision. They cannot be restricted to the environmental disciplines or 'ecoliteracy' modules or even to the classroom, but must be demonstrated by the whole of an HEI's approach to the world. Obstacles to implementation include: funding and perverse subsidies, departmental and disciplinary barriers, ivory-tower traditions in teaching that externalize and objectify the subjects studied and persistence of the obsolete mind-sets of the 'industrial age'. These barriers may mean that change in HEIs will have to be driven by external processes, such as the transformation of primary and secondary education where the fragmentation of knowledge is less entrenched. However, there now seems to be growing agreement that HEIs should equip all their students with 'environmental literacy' and that sustainability should be central to concerns both in HEI curricula and in operational practice.

AB The conceptual underpinning and the organizational structure of the existing system of higher environmental education in Russia are analysed. The system, embracing 129 universities, has been created in the last 10 years. At present there is a shift from general environmental education to education for sustainable development. The new system is based on the incorporation of natural, economic and social components into the curriculum. The paper also discusses the contribution of Russian scientists to the sustainable development concept (D.L. Armand's works of the 1960s) and Russia's participation in the development of the European Strategy for Education for Sustainable Development (ESD).

AB The Alps have always been of global interest and significance due to their natural and cultural diversity and are presently the number one tourist destination worldwide. Therefore, raising awareness of issues of global change and sustainability is most relevant in this region. Due to its integrative nature, geography can contribute substantially to disseminating knowledge about the Alps. This paper reports on the development of an environmental education concept,for the community of Galtur. The concept is based on a thorough analysis of the Alpine environment, the recording of educational interest in the Alps, and the development of implementation strategies for environmental education programmes. The main goal of the concept is to contribute to a sustainable future for the Alps. The paper highlights the role of geographical research and education in promoting public awareness and understanding of sustainability issues.

AB This article explores the impact of the new sustainability agenda on the occupational and professional needs of those who have taken educational and training programmes in the environmental field at either undergraduate or postgraduate level or through relevant professional institutions' continuing professional development programmes. It also describes a one-day workshop for the professions on sustainable development, based on systems thinking and practice. The workshop provides a model for developing greater understanding and effective action in professional practice, by using dialogue and inter-professional learning to explore approaches to sustainability in a variety of business and professional contexts. It introduces the principles underpinning the concept of sustainability and provides tools to support the integration of sustainable development into professional practice and organizational change.

AB This article explores issues of scalability and sustainability in distance learning. The authors kept detailed records of time they spent teaching a course in geographic information science via the World Wide Web over a six-month period, during which class sizes averaged 49 students. The authors also surveyed students' satisfaction with the distance learning course through ratings and open-ended questions. Findings are compared with similar data collected a year earlier, when class sizes associated with the same distance learning course averaged 18 students. In response to the increase in average class size by a factor of 2.7, the authors' course-related workloads increased by a factor of about 2.5 (from 47.5 hours to 116.7 hours total). Analyses of student feedback suggest that student satisfaction with the course was high overall and suffered no significant decline as a result of increased instructional efficiency.

AB Groundwater models provide an efficient means to evaluate the sustainability of new groundwater production wells. An important component of any groundwater modeling analysis is the quantification of the prediction uncertainty. This analysis incorporates uncertainty analysis techniques within the groundwater modeling environment to predict regions within a groundwater basin that have a low probability of excessive drawdown and groundwater contamination. The analysis focuses on the quantification of a basin-wide water-balance, generation of a spatial distribution of lithology, locating a nearby total dissolved solids (TDS) plume, and construction of an accurate groundwater flow model. Thousands of Monte Carlo realizations are simulated to determine the most probable parameter sets based on an objective function that minimizes the error between simulated and observed hydraulic head. Only those simulations with small error are used in a subsequent analysis to investigate 77 potential well locations near the city of Fernley, in northern Nevada. The final result is a map depicting the probability that a production well has either excessive drawdown and/or encroachment of the TDSs plume. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

SO JOURNAL OF INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article
DE Asphalt pavements; Concrete pavements; Life cycles; Energy consumption;
   Sustainable development
AB In addition to traditional economic and technical objectives, environmental impact, and sustainability are increasingly being considered in the design of roadways and other infrastructure projects. This paper presents an abbreviated life cycle inventory assessment of a continuously reinforced concrete pavement (CRCP) and an asphalt pavement with respect to the energy consumed by each pavement type for the construction of a roadway. For CRCP, energy is primarily consumed during the manufacture of cement and reinforcing steel, which together account for approximately 94% of the total amount of energy consumed from extraction of raw materials through placement of the CRCP. For asphalt pavement, the major consumption of energy from extraction through placement occurs during asphalt mixing and drying of aggregates (48%) and the production of bitumen (40%). The assessment results highlight where sustainable design efforts to reduce energy consumption can best be directed in the initial phases of a pavement's life cycle.

TI Addressing Sustainability in Transportation Systems: Definitions,

SO JOURNAL OF INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article
DE Sustainable development; Transportation systems; Performance evaluation;
   Metric systems
AB Addressing the sustainability of transportation systems is an important activity as evidenced by a growing number of initiatives around the world to define and measure sustainability in transportation planning and infrastructure provision. This paper reviews major initiatives in North America, Europe, and Oceania. The purpose is to characterize the emergent thinking on what constitutes transportation sustainability and how to measure it. While there is no standard definition for transportation system sustainability, it is largely being defined through impacts of the system on the economy, environment, and general social well-being; and measured by system effectiveness and efficiency, and the impacts of the system on the natural environment. Frameworks based on important causal relationships between infrastructure and the broader environment, infrastructure impacts on the economy, environment, and social well-being; and the relative influence of agencies over causal factors, are largely being used to develop and determine indicator systems for measuring sustainability in transportation systems. Process-based approaches involve community representatives and other stakeholders in planning and present opportunities to educate the public and influence collective behaviors. These frameworks can be used collectively to help agencies refine their visions as well as develop policies, planning procedures, and measurement and monitoring systems for achieving sustainable transportation systems.

ID DEFAULT; REPUDIATION; REPUTATION; HISTORY; MODELS
AB We construct a dynamic equilibrium model with contingent service and adverse selection to quantitatively study sovereign debt. In the model, benefits of defaulting are tempered by higher future interest rates. For a wide set of parameters, the only equilibrium is one in which the sovereign defaults in all states; additional output losses, however, sustain equilibria that resemble the data. We show that due to the adverse selection problem, some countries choose to delay default to reduce loss of reputation. Moreover, although equilibria with no default imply greater welfare levels, they are not sustainable in highly indebted and volatile countries. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID MODEL
AB Rudimentary knots are invoked to generate a representation of the elementary particles, a model that endows the particles with visualizable structure. The model correlates with the basic tenets, taxonomy, and interactions of the Standard Model, but goes beyond it in a number of important ways, the most significant being that all particles (hadrons and leptons, fermions and bosons) and interactions share a common topology. Among other consequences of the modeling are the topological basis for isospin invariance and its connection to electric charge, the necessary identity of electron and proton charge magnitudes, and the existence of precisely three generations on the particle family tree. The salient feature of the model is that the elementary particles are viewed not as discrete, point-like objects in a vacuum but rather as sustainable, membrane-like distortions embodying curvature and torsion in and of an otherwise featureless continuum and that their manifest physical attributes correlate with the distortion. There are additional connections to the theories of fiber bundles, superstrings and instantons and, historically, to the work of Kelvin in the mid-nineteenth century and Cartan in the 1920s among others.

TI Winning the war, but losing the peace? The dilemma of SPLM/A civil
   administration and the tasks ahead
SO JOURNAL OF MODERN AFRICAN STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
AB The debate over peace in Sudan has centred on the ongoing talks in Naivasha, Kenya. This paper argues, however, that sustainable peace is not simply a function of the implementation of an agreement between the SPLA and Khartoum, but that other fracture lines will run through post-conflict Sudan. Here we draw attention to the rupture between the Dinka, dominant within the SPLA, and the Equatorian peoples of the far south, hundreds of thousands of whom were driven from their homes or faced with economic and political oppression under SPLA occupation. As these refugees return, it will be through local government structures that Equatorians will or will not be integrated into the SPLA political project for Southern Sudan. Thus, local government figures prominently in the possibility for sustainable peace. We describe the origins and structure of local government in Southern Sudan, situating it in the history of political tension between Dinka and Equatorians. We then describe the challenge of equitably distributing land and foreign aid to returnees in the context of ethnic politics and a massive NGO presence.

TI Abuse and westernization: Reflections on strategies of power
SO JOURNAL OF PEACE RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID SPACE
AB Using Foucault's concepts of power relations, discourse and internalization, this article uncovers some basic dissemination and internalization strategies of power relations on several levels. First, it looks at power at the individual level, with an analysis of family abuse and torture. It then applies this analysis to Westernization in Africa, arguing that the basic strategies by which power is disseminated and internalized into the bodies, psyches and cultures of Africans are the same as in abuse. The internalization of the Western discourse at the individual and small-community levels was studied through field research, undertaken in Ghana, that included participant observation and interviews. The research shows that even in the case of small, local, sustainable development projects, one sees a Westernization of power relations between men and women, chiefs and population, and elders and youth, with changes in related values. The field research reveals that actors are not merely passive victims of changes in discourses: they resist it, cooperate, disseminate and adapt it to their needs, but within the rules of the Western regime of discourse. The general conditions, processes and actors' strategies in this process of discursive change go further than a mere analogy to abuse and torture. The article shows that the process by which an initially violent, dominant discourse is transformed into a 'normal' way of living, into beliefs and wishes, is the same in these different cases, suggesting that there exist some general strategies by which power is disseminated at the international and individual levels and by which it is propagated and internalized by individuals.

AB Based on some theoretical considerations, this paper defines minimum conditions for sustainable development. It presents and compares two models suitable for simulating sustainability strategies. One (PANTA RHEI) is a highly sophisticated econometric model for the German economy. The other one (SuE) is a less disaggregated system dynamics model for the EU 15 economy. Both include the measuring of energy and material consumption and are thus well suited to indicate the linkage of economic development and environmental impact. Similarly, both calculate the employment effects of a given policy, thus, permitting the inclusion of a key social concern in the evaluation of sustainability policies as well.

ID PATENT STATISTICS; INNOVATION
AB Since the early 1990s, fuel cell (FC) technology has received a great deal of attention from the automotive industry. Its high efficiency and low emissions have made the technology become one of the dominant technological opportunities to achieve more sustainable mobility. Under pressure of ever-increasing regulatory standards, the automotive industry has spent billions of dollars on researching and developing fuel cell vehicles (FCVs), with the objective of starting commercialization in 5-10 years time. Industry experts evaluate the industry's apparent commitment to FC technology optimistically as well as critically. Optimists see carmakers' efforts as a sign of change in the industry, necessitated by regulation and societal needs of a cleaner environment. Skeptics see carmakers' efforts in FC technology as 'window dressing', investing minimal amounts of resources (with maximum public exposure) while being limitedly committed to commercialize FCVs. This paper makes an attempt to nuance both views by assessing levels of RSD commitments carmakers. Based on an analysis of patenting behavior, this paper concludes that automotive activities go beyond window dressing, but fall short of portraying full commitment to this radical technology.

AB Reforming the public health infrastructure requires substantial system changes at the state level, including the reorganization of state agencies' plans, roles, and relationships with other sectors and communities, Beyond the limited time period of pilot programs and grants, how are these public health system changes to be sustained? Turning Point is an initiative of The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation to transform and strengthen the public health system. The 21 states participating in this initiative developed multisector partnerships to produce public health improvement plans and from these, chose one or more priorities for implementation. Reform efforts to strengthen the public health system occur within complex fiscal and political environments, however, and must cope with both uncertainty and turbulence in the process of implementing change. Turning Point state partners have developed a variety of approaches to the challenge of incorporating effective community collaborations as a permanent strategy for transforming public health systems. A qualitative, descriptive study design was used to analyze the strategies used by Turning Point state partnerships to meet the challenges of sustaining their system improvements. These strategies included: institutionalization within government, establishing "third sector" institutions, cultivating relationships with significant allies, and enhancing communication and visibility among multiple communities.

AB Prior to 2001, the local public health system in Nebraska was weak, fragmented, and severely under funded. Local 93 counties. The Turning Point project provided the impetus for change by allowing a diverse group of public health stakeholders to develop a strategic plan for strengthening and transforming the public health system. The plan acted as a catalyst to use some of the Nebraska Tobacco Settlement Funds to provide dedicated state funding to build the local public health system, By June 2002, 16 new local public health departments had been organized, ultimately covering all of the 93 counties in the state. Some of the keys to long-term sustainability are creating a network of community health partners that support collaborative decision making, continually seeking input from the community, developing and implementing an education and training plan for public health professionals and local board of health members, and demonstrating accountability by documenting results and communicating them to policy makers and the general public.

AB This article describes the efforts of public health leaders to develop local public health capacity across Maine. More than 200 individuals representing both government and nongovernmental organizations became engaged in The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation-sponsored Turning Point project in 1999. In recent years, the state has had only two local (city) health departments, only one of substantial capacity covering an extremely small proportion of the total state population. This article describes Maine Turning Point organizational efforts, challenges, successes, and failures, from the perspective of 3 individuals involved in the process. Five years later, a new network of state-financed, community-based partnerships focused on chronic disease risk factors has been established, apparently strong enough politically to survive in an era of severe state budget cuts. Tobacco use has been reduced. Many other serious public health issues, however, from obesity to mental illness and substance abuse, remain to be successfully addressed. The development of a sustainable statewide network of local agencies providing the essential public health services remains an elusive goal.

ID UTTARA KANNADA DISTRICT
AB Rural energy planning depends solely on the existing levels of energy consumption in domestic sector. In India, energy requirements for cooking and water heating depend predominantly on biomass fuels, which are often burnt in traditional stoves (efficiency < 10%), while kerosene and electricity are used for lighting. A sound environmental development of a region needs promotion of conservation activities among local communities and application of traditional environmentally sound technologies. Environmental research activities in recent years have generated large data on energy processes, mainly on commercial sources of energy such as, coal, oil, natural gas, and electricity are generally available, a lot of effort is still required to quantify traditional sources of energy. In this regard, Decision Support System (DSS) with relevant data help the decision makers to take appropriate timelier decisions and assist in the evaluation of reliability and the generation of alternatives. DSS incorporates simulation and optimization models with interactive graphics capabilities to encourage the acceptance of analyzing techniques in practice. This paper presents a conceptual framework for analyzing energy consumption at domestic sector via DSS. The framework is based on material flux, comparative analyses of village level domestic energy consumption patterns across various zones considering regional and seasonal variations. It also differentiates between household activities like cooking, water heating, and space heating which are the major end use activities. The system with a synergistic integration of software tools will assist decision makers in understanding the process status better and also aid in providing timelier decisions and efficient outputs. DSS is validated with the data pertaining to energy situation of Kolar district. Stratified random survey covering 2500 households distributed uniformly over the district shows that most households still use traditional stoves for cooking (97.9%) and water heating (98.3%). Energy analysis shows that the consumption ranges as follows: fuel wood for cooking, 0.69 +/- 0.34-1.42 +/- 0.27 kg/capita/d; electricity for lighting, 5.17 +/- 2.16-6.57 +/- 4.07 kWh/capita/month; kerosene for cooking, 0.44 +/- 0.16-1 +/- 0.76 l/capita/month; LPG for cooking, 0.18 +/- 0.05-1.03 +/- 1.35 kg/capita/month; and, biogas for lighting, 0.6 +/- 0.29-0.76 +/- 0.28 m(3)/capita/d.

AB Agricultural sustainability in China, especially in the North China Plain, is highly dependent on water resource availability. Land management has changed dramatically in this region since the 1970's when a more intensive practice of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and summer corn (Zea mays L.) in one-year rotation started causing excessive exploitation of groundwater to meet crop water needs for high yield productivity. Over fifty percent of the area in the northwestern region of the North China Plain is irrigated using groundwater. Over ninety percent of Luancheng Man county is in a groundwater-irrigated winter wheat-corn rotation. In addition the irrigation management practices, agricultural management practices, soil textural classes (mostly loam soils) and climate are similar throughout the Northwestern North China Plain and the Luancheng Man county. Our objectives were to identify whether land use is a factor contributing to groundwater table decline in Luancheng Man county of the North China Plain and to use long term small plot studies from 1998 to 2002 to evaluate the potential of limited irrigation based on wheat stage of growth as a viable water-saving practice to reduce consumptive use and stabilize the groundwater table.
   Assessment of groundwater resources for the Luancheng Man county found that groundwater levels have been dropping at a rate of 0.8 m yr(.1) (31.52 in yr(-1)) (P < 0.001). This occurred during a time of significantly lower precipitation that explained about 91 percent of the groundwater depletion rate (P < 0.001). The drop in groundwater levels was also correlated (r(2) = 0.71) with the increased area planted to wheat (P < 0.001). At this current rate of groundwater use, the resource will be depleted within three decades. A more efficient management system that increases water use efficiency or amount of grain produced per unit of water use is needed for sustainabitity of the cropped areas. We found that irrigation scheduling based on wheat stage of growth can significantly increase water use efficiency when we target application of two key 60 mm (2.36 in) irrigation events at the jointing and heading. stages of growth when compared to traditional irrigation management practices that use four irrigation events (240 mm or 9.46 in) (P < 0.05). Although simulated Penman-Monteith evapotranspiration from 1998 to 2002 was significantly correlated with measured values (P < 0.001), Penman-Monteith evapotranspiration values were higher than evapotranspiration measured with weighing lysimeters (P < 0.05). Our 1998 to 2002 studies suggest that there is potential to use stage of growth and water budget models for irrigation scheduling in the Northwestern North China Plain and cut water use by nearly fifty percent without significantly reducing grain yields. It is imperative that these practices tested in small plots now be demonstrated in commercial applications to conserve groundwater resources and maintain agricultural sustainability needed to feed China's increasing population.

AB The purpose of this paper is to discuss the resources, including operations and information technology that have contributed to the competitive position of the Port of Singapore. We present a detailed discussion of the Port and its resources, and analyze the case using the resource-based view of strategy. A firm with a competitive advantage excels in time, quality, or cost, or a combination of such over its competitors. We argue that a combination of resources including supportive government policies, ample investment, and well thought out operations and information technology along with location and a natural deep harbor to help create a sustainable advantage for the Port. We find that Singapore compensated for some of its natural disadvantages like small land area by successfully applying information technology in critical areas to increase the island's capacity to handle shipping.

AB Database-assisted design (DAD) for wind results in structures with reduced material consumption and failure risks, i.e., in improved safety and sustainability. The paper presents a DAD-compatible probabilistic procedure for estimating: (1) Wind effects corresponding to any mean recurrence interval of the wind speeds, and (2) wind-load factors. Unlike the ASCE 7 Standard and earlier structural reliability estimates, the procedure accounts for the inherent randomness in the estimation of peaks and for relevant wind-related knowledge uncertainties. On the basis of a selection of uncertainty parameters believed to be reasonable, it is concluded that: (1) The extreme wind speed distribution type significantly affects the estimates of the load factors. Our estimates, based on the Extreme Value Type III Reverse Weibull distribution, yield load factors consistent with values specified in the ASCE 7 Standard-in contrast to estimates published in the 1980's. (2) The variability of the ratio between wind speeds averaged over different time intervals can significantly affect the estimated wind-load factor. (3) An increase in size of the extreme wind data set from, say, 30 to 50 years, has a marginal effect on load factor estimates. (4) For low-rise buildings in open terrain, wind-load factors are typically affected weakly by even large uncertainties with respect to terrain roughness length. Additional research on the effect of terrain roughness uncertainties for buildings in built-up terrain may require an expansion of the aerodynamic databases currently available. It is noted that consideration of uncertainties in isolation, as commonly performed by some analysts and wind tunnel operators, especially for peak effects estimation, can be misleading; for structural applications, uncertainties need to be considered collectively.

TI Communities' readiness for health information exchange: The national
   landscape in 2004
SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL INFORMATICS ASSOCIATION
LA English
DT Article; Proceedings Paper
CT Annual Meeting on eHealth Initiative
CY DEC   16, 2003
CL Washington, DC
AB Background: The Secretary of Health and Human Services recently released a report calling for the nation to create a national health information network (NHIN) that would interconnect Regional Health Information Organizations (RHIOs). These RHIOs, which others have called Local or Regional Health Information Infrastructures (LHII), would in turn interconnect local as well as national health information resources. Little data exist about the activities taking place in communities to create LHIIs.
   Approach: The authors analyzed data that communities submitted in response to a request for capabilities issued by the Foundation for eHealth as part of their Connecting Communities for Better Health program using descriptive statistics and subjective evaluation.
   Impression: The authors analyzed data from 134 responses from communities in 42 states and the District of Columbia. Communities are enthusiastic about moving forward with health information exchange to create LHIls to improve the efficiency, quality, and safety of care. They have identified significant local sources of investment and plan to use some clinical data standards but not as broadly as was expected. The communities have not yet developed the specific technical approaches or the sustainable business models that will be required. Many communities are interested in creating an LHII and are developing the leadership commitment needed to translate that interest into an operational reality. Clinical information standards can be incorporated into a community's plans as often as they need to be. Communities have to overcome funding issues, develop deeper understanding of the technical and organizational issues, and aggressively share their learning to succeed within their community and to help other communities succeed.

AB Guiera senegalensis tolerates repeated cutting and pruning to which it is increasingly subjected at the onset of each cropping period, and one to three times during the annual cropping period (June-September). It responds by profusely branching at the shrub base. The topographic and geomorphic influences, and the effect of clearing on the relationships between shrub density, mean individual above-ground biomass and leaf water status were analysed for seven fallow sites. They were sampled 75 km east of Niamey in Niger. Surprisingly, shrub density and mean individual above-ground biomass were highest in the sites that had been recently in fallow and intensively cultivated prior to crop abandonment. Stand above-ground biomass was also positively related to mean predawn and daily minimum leaf water potentials. Consequently, in the studied G. senegalensis stands, above-ground biomass appeared to be controlled by water availability - rainfall, runoff, infiltration - rather than by cropping intensity. Anisohydric stomatal regulation, resulting in large safety margins from critical transpiration, was inferred from the diurnal amplitude of leaf water potential during the dry season. The plant physiological resistance to water stress combined with its population adjustment in density and growth contributes to the sustainable dominance of G. senegalensis.

TI Sustainable operation and maintenance of urban infrastructure: Myth or
   reality?
SO JOURNAL OF URBAN PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT-ASCE
LA English
DT Article
AB It has become increasingly apparent that a paradoxical situation is emerging with respect to urban services in less developed countries. On the one hand a huge demand for urban infrastructure has resulted from rapid urbanization; on the other, existing infrastructure is failing into disrepair before completing its design life. Operation and maintenance (O&M) has been identified by commentators as the key to enhancing the sustainability of existing infrastructure and assets. However, there is a general lack of understanding by stakeholders about the role of operation, maintenance and sustainability in the context of good governance. The aim of this paper is to explore the constraints to operation, maintenance, and sustainability of urban services. The findings are based on case studies from India, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka. In each of the case locations, projects were completed more than 3 years ago. Data collection tools included document review, interviews, and participant observations. Forums and workshops were also held. In order to distinguish between the different constraints acting upon urban services, the term "sustainability" has been separated according to its technical, financial, and institutional aspects. This paper demonstrates how findings from community involvement in service delivery in developing countries can be of benefit to engineers or NGOs working with communities to improve the operation and maintenance of urban services in developed countries. Traditional centralized systems for O&M, which are the responsibility of municipalities and utilities, are not delivering. Recently there has been a search for alternatives such as community-based approaches. Internationally it seems service users are being encouraged to ensure the infrastructure in their neighborhood is kept in good condition. It is hoped that getting service users involved will lead to increased efficiency, benchmarking, raise awareness/debate, contributed to national growth, reduced waste, improved resource allocation, and improved competitiveness. However, evidence of the success of such schemes is rather patchy. It has been recognized that neither community nor government alone can ensure the sustainability of infrastructure; a partnership approach is needed. The keys to improving operation and maintenance-and hence sustainability-are the availability of information and the attribution of clear roles and responsibilities. Operation and maintenance can be seen to be the most important determinant of citizens' satisfaction with urban services; this in turn leads to better governance.

AB This paper describes the extent to which the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) in combination with image regression used on satellite data can indicate vegetation cover decreases caused by increased exploitation of Swedish mountains. The methods outlined in this study give a basis for detection of less sustainable mountain ecosystems by using as an indicator bare patches of humus or soil where none existed previously. Landsat 5 TM (R) data from 1984 and 1994 and Landsat 7 ETM+(R) data from the year 2000 were used in the study. The results show that the NDVI significantly separates areas with vegetation cover decrease from areas with no vegetation cover decrease in sensitive, high-latitude mountain ecosystems, such as mountainous dry heath communities.

ID PRODUCTION SYSTEMS; WELFARE; AGRICULTURE; MANAGEMENT; LIVESTOCK; GOALS
AB The paper examines the notion of sustainable farm animal breeding. A brief explanation of why sustainability matters is offered first. After this, the historical development of the concept of sustainability is charted. The authors then turn to review published literature with a bearing on sustainable farm animal breeding. Little has been written directly on the subject: the requirements of sustainable farm animal breeding await serious clarification. The paper looks at SEFABAR (Sustainable European Farm Animal Breeding and Reproduction), a project designed to identify sustainable practices in farm animal breeding which ran for nearly 3 years from 2000. In this project commercial breeders and breeding scientists were required, with the professional assistance of bioethicists, economists, social scientists and NGO representatives, to develop a definition of sustainable farm animal breeding. The authors describe initial attempts to carry out this task. They then describe a general method of building a definition of sustainability-the so-called concem-criteria-indicators method-that was used in SEFABAR to good effect. They note the progress that was made once this method was introduced. Finally, the importance of communication is explained. The authors suggest that the concept of sustainability can be effectively used to organise and facilitate dialogue between stakeholders, including the breeding industry and society as a whole.

AB The aim of the present study was to evaluate the sustainability and welfare of extensively farmed Podolian cattle. A trained interviewer visited 50 farms and filled in a checklist which included four cards corresponding to the following animal categories: calves, replacements, feeders and adults. The analysis of the farming system showed that animals were able to express their main behavioural patterns. In addition, recorded animal-related variables indicated that Podolian cattle could benefit from high standards of welfare. Sustainability of the Podolian fanning system in terms of human edible returns was evaluated for two production systems producing 10-month-old calves (10 month) and 18-month-old young bulls (18 month), respectively. Edible returns for humans were low when all animal intakes were considered for both production systems. However, if returns were computed using not only the amount of food used by the animals but also consumable by humans, yields were much higher for 18-month systems [103% crude protein (CP) and 37.1% gross energy (GE)] and so high that they could not be computed for 10-month systems. These results indicate either a low degree of competition (18-month system) or no competition (10-month system) between humans and Podolian cattle. Perceptions of sustainability and welfare of Podolian cattle may promote a favourable positioning of products in premium-price markets and help preserving this breed and the related traditional fanning system.

AB This paper develops a framework for analyzing business-to-business (B2B) transactions and supply chain management based on integrating contract procurement markets with spot markets using capacity options and forwards. The framework is motivated by the emergence of B2B exchanges in several industrial sectors to facilitate such integrated contract and spot procurement. In the framework developed, a buyer and multiple sellers may either contract for delivery in advance (the "contracting" option) or they may buy and sell some or all of their input/output in a spot market. Contract pricing involves both a reservation fee per unit of capacity and an execution fee per unit of output if capacity is called. The key question addressed is the structure of the optimal portfolios of contracting and spot market transactions for the buyer and these sellers, and the pricing thereof in market equilibrium. Existence and structure of market equilibria are characterized for the associated competitive game between sellers with heterogeneous technologies, under the assumption that they know the buyer's demand function. This allows an explicit characterization of the price of capacity options and the value of managerial flexibility, as well as providing conditions under which B2B exchanges are efficient and sustainable.

DE ecosystems; biomonitoring; sustainability of life forms; microcosms;

AB How ironic that, in humankind's quest for sustain ability, so little attention is given to the biospheric life support system upon which the human species depends. Since natural systems cannot speak to human society, a continuously operating feedback loop is essential for providing information about a natural system's condition in time to take corrective action when necessary. Investigators must replicate the important cause/effects pathways of natural systems. Biomonitoring is surveillance undertaken to ensure that previously established quality control conditions are being met. Surveillance is the systematic and orderly gathering of data to determine what is happening, but without a prior commitment to initiate remedial action if quality control conditions do not remain within an acceptable range. In order to take remedial action before severe damage has occurred,;sampling must be sufficiently frequent and the results quickly available to provide an early warning of deleterious conditions. Micro- and mesocosms are not miniature ecosystems, but rather :systems of lesser complexity that provide useful information on :elected ecosystem attributes. Their design, study, and extrapolation to larger, multivariate ecosystems require considerable professional judgment. Properly used, micro- and mesocosms provide evidence for decision making that can prevent or diminish damage to larger natural systems for which They act as surrogates.

AB The research outlined in this paper is part of a wider research program named SYSCOLAG (Coastal and LAGoonal SYStems in Languedoc-Roussillon area, France) dedicated to sustainable coastal management. The main objective of this program is to build up a communication infrastructure to improve the exchange of information and knowledge between the various scientific disciplines involved in the research. In order to ensure the sharing of resources without affecting the autonomy and independance of the partners, we propose a three-level infrastructure (resources, federation and knowledge access) based on a metadata service (using ISO 19115 standard for geographic information metadata) completed by a common vocabulary (ontology).

DE global IPM; technology development; IPM adoption; networking
AB Integrated Pest Management (LPM) is a key component in the development of sustainable agro ecosystems. The Integrated Pest Management Collaborative Research Support Program (IPM CRSP) is a USAID funded project that is a consortium of U.S. universities working with host country national programs and other stakeholders to promote IPM globally. The IPM CRSP model is based on a Participatory Integrated Pest Management (PIPM) process that has as its goals to help reduce: agricultural losses due to pests, damage to natural eco-systems including loss of biodiversity, and pollution and contamination of food and water supplies. The IPM CRSP participatory model is based on networking, institution building, private sector interaction, research-technology development and technology transfer. The new IPM CRSP beginning in 2005 will build on the experience of the previous IPM CRSP (1992-2004). The technical approach of the New IPM CRSP is to implement an ecologically-based, participatory IPM (EP-IPM) program with a carefully-conceived strategy for local, national, regional, and global diffusion of IPM capacity and knowledge. Broad participation and communication are critical components of the strategy, along with a competitive process and a management plan designed to ensure high quality research and accountability. The approach is based on a competitive process open to U.S. universities who are expected to partner with host country national programs and other stakeholders in the development of Regional IPM Centers and on five Global IPM Themes including invasive species, insect transmitted viruses, regional diagnostic laboratories, information technologies and databases, and impact assessment.

   minimization
SO NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID PLUTONIUM; TRANSMUTATION; THORIUM
AB A new COmbinedNonFertile and Uranium (CONFU) fuel assembly is proposed to limit the actinides that need long-term high-level waste storage from the pressurized water reactor (PWR)fuel cycle. In the CONFU assembly concept, similar to 20% of the UO2 fuel pins are replaced with fertile free fuel hosting the transuranic elements (TRUs) generated in the previous cycle. This leads to a fuel cycle sustainable with respect to net TRU generation, and the amount and radiotoxicity of the nuclear waste can be significantly reduced in comparison with the conventional once-through UO2 fuel cycle. It is shown that under the constraints of acceptable power peaking limits, the CONFU assembly exhibits negative reactivity feedback coefficients comparable in values to those of the reference UO2 fuel. Feasibility of the PWR core operation and control with complete TRU recycle has been shown based on full-core three-dimensional neutronic simulation. However, gradual buildup of small amounts of Cm and Cf challenges fuel reprocessing and fabrication due to the high spontaneous fission rates of these nuclides and heat generation by some Pu, Am, and Cm isotopes. Feasibility of the processing steps becomes more attainable if the time between discharge and reprocessing is 20 yr or longer.

AB Studies on the trypanotolerance of Orma Boran X Maasai Zebu (Orma Zebu) crossbred cattle (F-1 progeny) and pure-bred Maasai Zebu contemporaries were carried out in Nguruman, south western Kenya. The two groups were monitored from birth for a period of 2 years. The incidence of trypanosomosis, parasitaemia, packed cell volume (PCV), body mass and average daily mass gain were monitored. During the study period, overall trypanosomosis incidence was low (3 %). The crossbred cattle had a higher incidence of infection (61 % vs 39 %). The mean PCV and mean mass gain for the crossbred cattle was higher than that of the Maasai Zebu. The mean calf body mass at weaning (8 months) for the Orma Zebu and Maasai Zebu was 72 kg and 64 kg, respectively, while at 18 months of age their mean body mass was 164 kg and 123 kg, respectively. During the rainy season significant differences in average daily mass gains were noted (P< 0.05). The superior mass gain of the Orma Zebu observed during the rainy season, despite higher infection rates, indicate an enhanced trypanotolerance. Moreover, the better performance of the Orma Zebu is an attribute that could be exploited in the adoption of the trypanotolerance genotype, as a sustainable trypanosomosis control strategy.

TI Riparian habitats (mallines) of Patagonia - A key grazing resource for
   sustainable sheep-farming operations
SO OUTLOOK ON AGRICULTURE
LA English
DT Article
DE riparian habitats; grazing; mallines; Patagonia
AB Riparian-like habitats of and Patagonia (Argentina), known locally as mallines, play a key role in providing forage for domestic herbivores and adequate habitat for native wildlife. Because these systems are driven by localized abundant water availability, their forage production can be of an order of magnitude higher than that of the surrounding dryland and, when properly managed, can considerably improve livestock and sheep production. Unfortunately, improper grazing management has caused extensive degradation of soils and vegetation of these habitats in the past. Until recently, very few local studies had addressed questions related to the complexities of ungulate-plant interactions in relation to sustainable management of this critical grazing resource. Fortunately, this trend is changing rapidly and since the early 90s there have been a number of grazing studies with sheep and cattle, investigating animal responses to controlled-grazing management systems. Many of the results of this research have been published locally and are not readily accessible. In this article, the authors review much of this research and provide a synthesis of the current state of knowledge regarding the functioning and grazing management of riparian-like habitats of Patagonia.

AB There is an urgent need for the international community to address not only the issues of preserving the global environment and reducing poverty in developing countries, but to also face up to new challenges, such as providing assistance to the reconstruction in Afghanistan. Furthermore, it is necessary to address these issues and challenges by means of mutual collaboration. This latter point has been the subject of lively discussion. In this paper, we describe a new direction in international cooperation taken by the Rural Development Bureau of the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, Japan in response to the trend of international discussions. This shoulb be achieved by utilizing Japan's experience and expertise gained in the development of its own paddy rice agriculture.
   Specifically, based on the philosophy that sustainable agricultural and rural development can conserve a regional environment, the Bureau intends to undertake: (1) extension of the results from a cooperation project to other regions, by modifying it and converting it to multi-purpose use; (2) collaboration with aid-related entities in Japan and abroad, and dissemination of related information to them; and (3) promotion of cooperation focused on a specific topic.
   Furthermore, the Bureau will promote the following matters as the basis for international cooperation in each major task. (1) Contribution towards sustainable water use. (2) Extension of the participatory integrated rural development, and its modification for reconstruction assistance. (3) Extension of desertification control, and its modification and conversion for multi-purpose use. (4) Conversion of the technology for soil erosion control into multi-purpose use.

   National Park
SO PERIODICUM BIOLOGORUM

   soil; digitalisation of crowns; fir; beech
AB Background and Purpose: The paper describes the state and values of some structural elements which have an effect on natural regeneration and sustainability of non-economic forests, using as an example the "Risnjak" National Tar. By the application of digitalisation a three-dimensional digital dynamics model and vertical profile of a stand was produced with actual measured trees in the field. The distribution of the number of trees indicates the entire absence of fir of the smallest diameter degrees, and also the lace of medium diameter trees. With the increase of diameter breast height this difference disappears in the medium diameter trees (55 cm) and above this diameter an excessive number of large diameter trees is present. The beech has taken advantage of this situation and with its smallest diameter degrees occupied (filled in) the space created by the absence of fir trees. This confirms the fact that for several decades the accession (influx) of the fir from natural regeneration has failed to occur, which, as a consequence, can be observed in the change of tree species. The results of measurements of numbers and quality of young growth during the years of monitoring do not guarantee the further course of the anticipated normal process of nature regeneration, which is the fundamental objective of regeneration and maintenance of forest sustainability.
   Materials and Methods: In 1998, a permanent experimental plot, 100 x 100 in in size, was established, on which all trees larger than 8 cm in diameter were numbered and basic measurement data recorded (d b h, tree heights and stem lengths). The experiment was repeated in 2003. Horizontal crown projections were recorded, on the basis of which the sum of crown projections per ha in absolute and relative values, and the area not covered by crowns, mean projection and mean crown diameter; were calculated. The crown projections were digitalised and on the basis of the measured values (tree height and stem length, and the length and width of crowns), a three-dimensional digital dynamics model of a stand was produced. For the purpose of investigating the possibility of natural regeneration, records were made of the structure and number of young growth, as well as the shrub layer, on a sample area of 360 m(2) and classification made in height-age classes.
   Results: Measurement of the structure, number and quality of young growth in 1998 and 2003, indicated that natural regeneration of the fir was questionable. Namely, not one fir higher than 30 cm was recorded. The somewhat more present beech young growth of 2.5 in in height and more, was suppressed and of low quality, although it should serve as the basis for the future stand. Distribution of the number of trees showed the entire absence of fir of the smallest diameter degrees, which confirms the fact that for several decades the accession (influx) of fir from natural regeneration failed to occur: The space wasfilled by aggressive beech, which indicates a change of species. The digital model of crown projection and produced three-dimensional digital dynamics model of the stand show excessive soil cover by tree crowns amounting to 88.46%, which is an essential condition for natural reforestation. Due to the disruption of natural structure, a step-like form of canopy was missing, which is generally characteristic for structures of mixed beech and fir stands.
   Conclusions: The investigation results of the stand structure and measurements of the number and quality of young growth during the years of monitoring show that the expected normal process of natural regeneration is questionable. The continued stability of natural reforestation is the basic condition for permanent and stable structure in the process of preserving biological diversity and the basic objective with regard to maintaining permanent natural self-regeneration.

AB The introduction of genetically modified (GM) crops has caused a fierce public debate in Europe. Much of the controversy centres on possible risks to the environment. A specific problem here is that risk perception of the scientific experts differs from that of the public. In this paper, risks associated with herbicide-resistant crops are presented from the point of view of experts and lay people. In the public perception, herbicide-resistant (HR) crops are troublesome because of their association with two technologies: genetic engineering of crops and the use of herbicides. These technologies are perceived as risky because they seem to share certain features: in particular, their long-term effects are unknown and they are dreaded. Other value questions also come into play. The public seems to be concerned that risks are not outweighed by usefulness, that using HR crops is the wrong path to sustainable agriculture, that the individual's right to choose GM-free products may be violated, and that these crops are unnatural. In contrast, on the issue of the uncertainty inherent in risk assessment, experts and the public seem to share a good deal of ground. (C) 2004 Society of Chemical Industry.

AB Study Objectives. To objectively compare the results of a collaborative approach using pharmacists with the results of usual care for achieving a low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL) goal of 100 mg/dl or less in outpatients with documented coronary heart disease (CHD) who are not at goal, and to document the effect on LDL after removal of such a collaborative model from the study population.
   Design. Prospective, multiclinic, controlled study.
   Setting. Four clinics of a 19-clinic staff model health maintenance organization in Minneapolis and St. Paul, Minnesota. Two clinics treated the intervention patients, two the controls; one clinic for each group was suburban, and one for each was urban.
   Patients. Four hundred eighty-one patients aged 18 years or older with CHD and whose LDL levels were not at goal.
   Intervention. Clinical pharmacists implemented the physician-approved care plan for each intervention patient; activities included managing lipid-lowering drug therapy and educating patients on cardiovascular risk reduction.
   Measurements and Main Results. Primary outcomes were changes in LDL level and the proportion of patients achieving goal LDL in the intervention versus the usual care (control) group. Secondary outcomes were the sustainability of the impact observed up to 18 months after discontinuation of the intervention. Mean +/- SD baseline LDL levels were 131 28 and 131 +/- 26 mg/dl (p=NS) for the intervention and control groups, respectively. After a mean of 6.5 months follow-up, 107 (72%) patients in the p intervention group and 61 (18%) patients in the control,group had attained their LDL goal (p<0.001). Mean LDL levels were reduced by 35.6 mg/dl (27.5%) and 6.7 mg/dl (4.6%) in the intervention and control groups, respectively (p<0.001). When the active program was discontinued, results of the 18-month follow-up indicated that 85 (65%) intervention patients remained at goal compared with 96 (42%) controls (p<0.001).
   Conclusion. This trial provides quantitative evidence to support the effectiveness of the collaborative approach as an intervention to optimize management of patients with CHD whose LDL levels are not at goal; this approach is specifically called for in the executive summary of the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III. Furthermore, this study documents both the magnitude and sustainability of the impact collaborative care models can have in managed care environments.

TI Sustainability of vegetable farming in Southern Mindanao, Philippines:

DE hilly land; Mindanao; soil fertility; vegetables
AB A case study and survey were conducted in 2001-2002 in Kapatagan, a mid-elevation vegetable production area in Digos City, Southern Mindanao, Philippines to determine the impact of vegetable farming on soil properties. The case study of 27 farms-with different lengths of cultivation (less than 10 yr, 11-20 yr and more than 20 yr) and operated by farmers with different levels of success, showed that all had highly acidic soils and magnesium (Mg) levels that were medium to low. More than 60% of the farms had inadequate levels of organic matter (OM), phosphorus (P) and zinc (Zn), and low cation exchange capacity (CEC). More than 80% of the farms exceeded the threshold level for bacterial wilt, likely because of the use of infected seed in potato cultivation. OM, pH, CEC and soil bacterial count were significantly and negatively correlated with years under cultivation. A separate study done in 2004 showed that 100% of 33 farms sampled were deficient in boron (B). Among the various soil parameters, OM was the only one that was found to be positively and significantly correlated with success in farming. The survey involving 209 respondents revealed that farmers coped with soil deterioration by applying excessive chemical NPK fertilizers, a practice which probably caused and generally aggravated the problem. The studies suggest that farmers generally need to apply dolomitic lime, OM and micronutrients (particularly B), coupled with judicious applications of chemical NPK and a sound bacterial wilt management program.

DE economic analysis; Mindanao; profitability; vegetables
AB Vegetable crops were grown throughout the year in Kapatagan, Digos City, Davao del Sur Province in Southern Mindanao, Philippines based on data gathered from farmer interviews. There was a wide range of yield and profitability in six major crops, reflecting the range of farming practices and cost of production, and the instability of prices of vegetables. Majority of the farmers obtained below average yield, and the average yields were generally less than 50% of the yields obtained in a comparable environment. Of critical importance in determining cost of production was interest payment on loan by 40% of the farmers, which ranged from 30-53% of cash expense. Interest payments accounted for the largest percentage of cost of production, followed by labor, fertilizers and pesticides (in that order). Highest average net incomes were obtained from potato, cabbage and Chinese cabbage (PhP80799, PhP79203, PhP50287 per hectare, respectively). However, return on cash expense was highest for carrot at 3.68 per peso spent, followed by potato and cabbage with PhP3.58 and PhP2.55, respectively. In spite of these high returns, estimate of annual income from growing vegetable crops showed that 83% of the farmers earned less than PhP100,000 per year; 68% of them earned less than PhP50,000 per year. These earnings were barely sufficient to support their basic needs. Suggestions for improving vegetable farming and the overall economic condition of farmers in Kapatagan were offered.

AB Sustainable management of wetland ecosystem is necessary as it serves the important functions such as food storage, water quality maintenance and providing habitat for different species of wildlife. Hence, an inventory of wetlands in any given area is a pre-requisite for their conservation and management. A study has been carried out to delineate the wetlands of east Champaran district of Bihar, India, using IRS 1D LISS III data. The data for the pre and post monsoon seasons have been analysed and the wetlands have been qualitatively characterized based on the turbidity and aquatic vegetation status. The extent of water logging problem in the study area was inferred from the seasonal variation of waterspread during both the seasons. The three categories of wetlands (ponds/lakes, water logged areas and oxbow lakes) have been identified. From the analysis, it has been observed that the inland wetlands constitute 2.7% of the study area, of which 1.8% is subjected to water logging. Thus, this study highlights the usefulness of remotely sensed data for wetland mapping, seasonal monitoring and characterization.

AB Electron transfer from confined structures like quantum film, quantum wire or quantum dot has been studied in conjunction with photoexcitation. The present paper highlights photocurrent generation in the external circuit due to electron transport within the organized ZnS quantum dots by means of tunnelling through the thin dielectric matrix. The average size distribution of the particles was determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) in consistency with high-resolution electron microscopy (TEM). We demonstrate measurable and sustainable photocurrent in the external circuit as a result of quantum charge transport within arrayed quantum dots excited by high-power photons. The nonlinearity nature of I-V response is marked by Coulomb blockade signature, which serves as a prerequisite for single electron device applications. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Reduced tillage systems are gaining popularity but weed control is often a limiting factor in the adoption of such systems. Cover crops have become a viable option for sustainable agriculture because of its contribution to soil fertility and improved crop performance. However, the contribution of cover crops to weed management is not clearly defined. We compared minimum tillage (MT) and no-tillage (NT) with conventional tillage (CT) for their effects on wheat growth in an original paddy land clay soil in the presence of Chinese milk vetch as a cover crop. Cover crop biomass, weed emergence, main crop growth and yield and soil penetration resistance were examined. Chinese milk vetch was successfully established under MT and CT but not tinder NT, which retarded its growth resulting in a significantly large biomass of all weed species. Weed suppression was more effective when the cover crop was broadcasted than row seeded. The presence of milk vetch as a cover crop significantly suppressed weed growth under NIT especially at the late stage of growth and resulted in a comparable grain yield to that under CT. Although soil penetration resistance under NIT remained high throughout the period of wheat growth, milk vetch could be effectively utilized as a cover crop under MT and wheat grain yield under NIT was comparable to that under CT without mulch treatment.

AB The study of population health encompasses analysis of the fundamental influences on human health, the consequences of such influences for societies and individuals, and the ways in which people and institutions respond to these consequences. A theme lacking from the present discourse is that of the sustainability of population health. To be sustainable, societies must respect the boundaries of natural systems and scorn disparities in standards of living. Preliminary analysis of data from 152 countries reveals an inverse relation between measures of population health and sustainability, although there are examples of societies where this inverse relation does not hold. Future research in population health should begin to question the sustainability of improving the health of some populations at the expense of others, and investigate how some societies appear to be able to achieve population health without compromising the health of the biosphere.

AB This study was aimed at developing a better understanding of environmental pressure of urban household consumption in China. First, we introduced the concept model of household metabolism. Using this model, we analyzed the changes of Chinese household metabolism during the last 20 years. Rather than taking into account all aspects of household consumption, we just focused on water and energy metabolisms. After exploring the clearly increasing trends of urban household metabolism in China, we identified the underlying driving forces as biological/physical factors, economic/marketing factors and demographic factors. In conclusion, we Suggest that additional work must be carried out in a wider range of household activities and at more advanced research levels in China.

AB The Earth's surface has changed considerably over the past centuries. Since the start of the industrial Revolution in the early 1700s, humans from the "Old World" started to colonize the "New World". The colonization processes lead to major changes in global land use and land cover. Large parts of the original land cover have been altered (e.g., deforestation), leading to extra emissions of GHG's to the atmosphere and enhancing global climate change. The spatial and temporal aspects are still not very well known. More and more global integrated environmental assessments concerning global sustainability require long time series of global change indicators, of which population is an important one. This study presents an update of the geo-referenced historical population maps for the period 1700-2000, part of the History Database of the Global Environment (HYDE), which can be used in integrated models of global change and/or global sustainability.

AB Drawing on a four-year research programme conducted in Sri Lanka (part of a larger programme also conducted in India and Kenya) this paper addresses the issue of building and planning regulations and how such regulations affect people's livelihoods. This paper begins by reviewing the urban housing programmes undertaken in Sri Lanka over the past 30 years with special reference to urban upgrading projects and their respective planning and building regulations. The authors have analysed four cases from Colombo Municipality and two cases from a secondary town, Moratuwa Municipality in Colombo Municipal Authority, in order to assess the impacts of such urban upgrading programmes on the livelihoods of the poor; some conclusions and recommendations have been drawn. Guidance notes (based on a literature review, historical analysis and case studies) are presented towards the end of the paper for the use of local government staff as well as others acting as partners in the improvement of livelihoods in urban areas. Land reforms and land management are key components of any sustainable urban upgrading programme. The authors conclude that regulatory frameworks which take into account existing patterns (with the exception of unsafe practices) of livelihoods and socio-economic aspirations will enhance the potential for sustainable livelihoods.

AB In Vietnam, needs to update medical and public health research capacity, but advanced training in research methodology in universities is still very Limited. The first university-certified research training course aimed at physicians was conducted in Ho Chi Minh City in 2000. This paper describes the processes, outcomes and lessons learned from the project, to enable the training course to be repeated to increase research capacity among health professionals in Vietnam and other developing countries. Based on needs assessment, the 9-month, part-time course offered advanced training in practical research skills, including epidemiology, biostatistics and qualitative research methods. Thirty-seven trainees (teaching staff, interns and clinicians) completed the course, which included four group research projects. With active support from university management, the course was rigorous and participation was excellent. Trainees's knowledge of research methodologies increased, and their self-evaluation of achievement of the training objectives was high. The total score of the epidemiology and biostatistics test improved from 56% (median) in the pre-course test to 83% in the post-course test. The group research project results were disseminated through a conference and publication in peer-reviewed journals. The course has since been repeated twice as a 1-month intensive course to accommodate trainees from distant regions. This type of rigorous in-service research training at universities and teaching hospitals in developing countries appears to be an effective, sustainable approach. It also holds promise for producing research data that are responsive to a country's own needs and which are likely to be applied in health policy and practice. Further evaluation of the impact and cost of such models is indicated. (C) 2004 The Royal Institute of Public Health. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This study proposes a three-dimensional framework for describing and measuring a firm's IC that includes human capital, intellectual property, and reputational capital. Drawing upon the resource-based view of the firm, it is argued that in high-technology new ventures (HTNVs) IC assets offer a unique source of advantage that facilitates entrepreneurship by reducing the risk and increasing the returns from investments in innovation and venturing. This paper reports the results of an empirical study of 237 HTNVs in the US that issued an initial public offering between 1994 and 1998. It is found that these firms' top management team human capital diversity and organizational reputation are of greatest significance for their entrepreneurial performance. Interestingly, these factors far outweigh the insignificant effect observed for intellectual property on subsequent innovation and venturing activities. The implications for theory and practice are discussed.

AB This article contributes to the analysis of tacit collusion in quantity-setting supergames involving cost-asymmetric firms. Asymmetry is dealt with by assuming that firms have a different share of a specific asset that affects marginal costs. The model extends optimal punishment schemes in the style of Abreu (1986, 1988) and provides conditions for industrywide collusion to be enforced. From the analysis of the impact of asset transfers on the sustainability of tacit collusion, merger policy implications can be drawn. In particular, I show that if the merger induces an increase in the inequality of asset holdings, this will hinder collusion.

AB Livestock grazing practices on public and private rangelands throughout the western United States are subject to increasing scrutiny. Much criticism arises from the tendency for livestock to concentrate in riparian areas and to disproportionately use the vegetation to the degree that riparian function and vegetation are compromised. The purpose of this synthesis article is to evaluate grazing-management strategies that encourage beef cattle to use forage resources away from riparian areas and areas where topographical features limit grazing use. Specifically, this paper evaluates individual management strategies and attempts to quantify the changes in distribution patterns and vegetation use. An effective strategy uses water development to encourage uniform distribution. Likewise, timing and duration of grazing have dramatic influences on cattle distribution in riparian and upland range areas. In general, early in the grazing season, when upland forage is green and growing, cattle tend to distribute more uniformly than later in the season, when upland vegetation is dormant and cattle disproportionately use riparian areas. In addition, early in the season, cattle grazing forested rangelands seem to prefer south-facing aspects with more open canopies when compared with late-season distribution patterns when concentration switches to northerly aspects, denser canopies, and more diverse diets. Other factors that appear to influence distribution include cow breed, age, and stage of production. In addition, recent research suggests that as cows age, distribution patterns change: Older cows have been reported to travel further from water than their younger contemporaries as long as adequate forage is available in the uplands. Additional research is needed on beef cattle selection, technological applications, efficient herding practices, supplementation strategies, and whole-range management systems that encourage the sustainable use of rangeland resources.

AB Perennial cropping systems may achieve significant improvement over annual systems in the synchrony between crop nutrient demands and nutrient supplies. Improvements in nutrient synchrony would result in the reduction of nutrient losses and their associated environmental impacts. A perennial system with high levels of synchrony would also require fewer nutrient inputs, such that it may be possible to develop an agriculture that functions mostly, if not entirely, on nutrient inputs from endogenous sources (i.e., weathering of primary and secondary minerals and biological nitrogen fixation). In this paper I describe three realms of research that will inform the development of relatively high-yielding grain production systems grown on endogenous nutrient supplies: (1) improvement of nutrient synchrony through the development of perennial crops; (2) identification of soils that are in a high nutrient release phase of pedogenesis, which could balance the export of rock-derived nutrients in crop harvests; and (3) optimization of legume density, harvest index and percent nitrogen derived from the atmosphere (%Ndfa) to achieve adequate nitrogen inputs through biological fixation.

AB Organic and low-input farmers often plant seed varieties that have been selected under conventional practices, traditionally including high inputs of artificial fertilizers, crop protection chemicals and/or water. In addition, these crops are often selected in environments that may or may not represent the local environment of the farmer. An evolutionary participatory breeding (EPB) method emphasizes the utilization of natural selection in combination with site-specific farmer selection in early segregating generations of a heterogeneous crop population. EPB is a combination of two specific breeding methods, evolutionary breeding and participatory plant breeding. Evolutionary breeding has been shown to increase yield, disease resistance, genetic diversity and adaptability of a crop population over time. It is based on a mass selection technique used by farmers for over 10,000 years of crop improvement. Participatory plant breeding programs originated in developing countries to meet the needs of low-input, small-scale farmers in marginal environments who were often overlooked by conventional crop breeders. The EPB method is an efficient breeding system uniquely suited to improving crop varieties for the low-input and organic farmer. The EPB method utilizes the skills and knowledge of both breeders and farmers to develop heterogeneous landrace populations, and is an effective breeding method for both traditional and modern farmers throughout the world.

AB Dissemination and sustainability of evidence-based physical education programs (PE) has been studied rarely. The sustainability of a health-related PE program (SPARK) was independently evaluated in 111 elementary schools in 7 states. Surveys were mailed to schools that had received SPARK curriculum books, training, and follow-up (response rate = 4 7 %). Up to 80 % of schools that adopted STARK PE reported sustained use up to 4 years later Schools using SPARK had more frequent PE classes. Sustained use was related to support from the principal, not previously having a standard PE program, having adequate equipment, and teachers being physically active. Program sustainability was similar in advantaged and disadvantaged schools. Evidence-based PE programs can be sustained up to 4 years.

ID NORTHAMPTONSHIRE
AB Waste minimisation clubs have been established for some 12 years in the UK. During that time, they have been significant driving forces in disseminating sustainable waste management practices in industry and commerce. Clubs have also demonstrated that they can achieve significant reductions in levels of waste. However, data on the economic benefits of these clubs remain scanty and disparate. In addition. no standard methodology has developed to assess whether the investment costs of clubs can be justified on grounds of either economic welfare or sustainable development, despite the theoretical advantages from doing so. Against this background, the paper considers the need for economic appraisal and evaluation of waste minimisation clubs and discusses how these methods could be applied to the creation of clubs that will be sustainable over time.

DT Article
DE solid waste management; sustainable recycling; greenhouse gas credits;
   wastepickers
AB Contributing elements toward the development of a sustainable solid waste management system in Tucuman, Argentina, are described. Changes in the working environment for the wastepickers have been instrumental in providing a livable wage and diminished health and environmental risks to the wastepickers and to neighboring residents. Income levels to the wastepickers are now approximately 1.75 times minimum wages in Tucuman and are being driven almost entirely by the recycling of plastics. Educational improvements in Tucuman, which are assisting sustainability of the solid waste system, are being significantly improved by the operation of a pilot scale project, by demonstrating opportunities to government officials and school children. Improved financial sustainability to the solid waste management system is also potentially available from carbon credit trading opportunities, presenting the opportunity for 1.2 times the income available from recycling efforts.

AB This paper focuses on the environmental component of sustainability of technology, taking into account the role of industrial ecology. Assessment of environmental sustainability of technology traditionally focuses on immediate impact of technology on the environment through quantifying resource extraction and generated emissions. However, technology does not only exchange materials with the environment but also with the industrial society as a whole, the so-called industrial metabolism. A higher compatibility of a specific technology with the industrial system, as studied in industrial ecology, can result in lower resource extraction and reduced waste emission, indirectly contributing to a better environmental sustainability.
   Starting from the considerations above and based on the second law of thermodynamics, the paper presents a set of five environmental sustainability indicators for the assessment of products and production pathways, integrating industrial ecology principles. The indicators, all scaled between 0 and 1, take into account: (1) renewability of resources; (2) toxicity of emissions; (3) input of used materials; (4) recoverability of products at the end of their use; (5) process efficiency.
   The applicability of the elaborated set of indicators is illustrated for different production pathways of alcohols (petrochemical and oleochemical based), polyethylene end-of-life options and electricity production from non-renewable (natural gas and fossil oil) and renewable resources (hydropower, photovoltaic conversion of solar irradiation).

ID INDUSTRY
AB It is generally considered that the non-renewable nature of mineral resources will make them gradually depleted over time. However, in the perspective of development availability of mineral resources in a long-term depends not only on their currently available amounts but also on future potential mineral resources (e.g. those undiscovered and low-grade ores) and substitutive renewable resources. In addition, it is influenced by factors like technology and capital. These factors interact with each other. As a result, it is possible to make the sustainable development of mineral resources by appropriate coordination between these factors. A new concept of Degree of Sustainable Development of Mineral Resources (DSDMR) and its conceptual model are proposed in this paper in the viewpoints of system science and sustainable development to evaluate the ability of sustainable development of mineral resources for a raining city. DSDMR refers to the ability of meeting needs of present and future generations for mineral resources by their logical distribution and substitution. An indicator system and a fuzzy integrated judgment model, which involve factors of resources, economy, society, environments and intelligence, are presented. They are used to evaluate DSDMR of Huangshi city, which is the most ancient and yet one of the most important mining cities producing iron and copper in China. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Ecosystem restoration in highly complex, human-dominated estuaries rests on a strong conceptual foundation of sustainability, ecosystems, and adaptive management of human-induced environmental impacts. Successful application involves evaluating uncertainty, incorporating place-based information, and engaging diverse constituencies in the planning process. That means integration of technical knowledge with an understanding of the "cultural milieu" inherent in all estuaries, that is, the intensity of human activity and impacts plus socioeconomic factors relevant to restoration goals. Operational definitions of what constitutes acceptable ecosystem conditions and current baselines are critical yet rest in large measure on cultural values and socioeconomic considerations. Resources for long-term monitoring and research to assess performance and ecosystem condition are paramount. Unprecedented population growth promises additional stressors on estuarine environments worldwide, making maintenance of present conditions difficult. The art of good, practical ecosystem restoration as a management tool at multiple geographic scales promises to play a crucial role in sustainability goals.

AB Pitting the dynamicism and uncertainty inherent in undisturbed coastal ecosystems against the stability and predictability required of human-dominated landscapes creates the paradox of the dual mandate. We describe a gradient of estuarine types ranging from systems that experience little human intrusion-conservation estuaries-to those that are dominated by people or extractive uses-production and urban-industrial estuaries. Future approaches to managing these estuarine resources will require a division of the concept of marine protected areas into at least two subcategories: "conservation" managed areas (CConservationMAs) and "commerce" managed areas (CCommerceMAs). The latter includes conditions where humans are not only a core feature of the landscape but also where extractive uses drive a large part of the local, regional, and even national economy. System reliability and predictability of ecosystem services are integral components of any management scheme in CCommerceMAs. By recognizing this division managers can construct appropriate baselines that encompass the biodiversity and ecological integrity inherent in relatively undisturbed estuaries (or portions thereof), or the ecosystem health and system reliability that characterize urban-industrial systems. The terms ecosystem restoration and ecosystem rehabilitation are also distinguished; the former term is used to describe practices that return ecosystems to optimum biological integrity, whereas the latter term is applied to the health of human-dominated estuaries where the goal is to manage natural processes and functions. Our proposed approach does not mean that ecosystem quality is sacrificed in urban-industrial or production systems; to the contrary, contaminant source control, suitable sediment and water quality, and the human endeavors to address them are just as important to sustaining commercial activity as they are to the well-being of extant biota. So too, are the conservation and preservation of existing critical habitat (proximate reservoirs of biodiversity) in urban-industrial systems, and rehabilitation of habitats that support species coadapted to the presence of humans.

AB The concept of sustainability has several, sometimes contrasting, meanings that may generate confusion, misunderstanding, and conflict concerning conservation and restoration practices. It is therefore desirable to clarify the concept of sustainability, thereby potentially contributing to mutual understanding, especially when social conflicts arise. This article discusses a recently published typology of three conceptions of sustainability that range from economic to ecocentric valuations of nature. We argue that the typology is incomplete because it does not include the arcadian approaches. For this reason, we introduce a "tripolar model" for conceptions of sustainability, applying it to the debate on shellfish harvesting in the Dutch Wadden Sea. We conclude that the particular visions or conceptions of sustainability held by relevant actors may have an impact on strategies for conservation.

AB The global human population is growing exponentially, close to a majority lives and works near the coast, and coastal commerce and development are critical to the economies of many nations. Hence, coastal areas will continue to be a major focus of development and economic activity. People desire the economic advantages provided by coastal development along with the fisheries and social commodities supported by estuarine and coastal ecosystems. Because of these facts, we view the challenge of balancing coastal development with enhancing nearshore marine and estuarine ecosystems (i.e., net ecosystem improvement) as the top priority for coastal researchers in this century. Our restoration research in Pacific Northwest estuaries and participation in nearshore project design and impact mitigation has largely dealt with these competing goals. To this end, we have applied conceptual models, comprehensive assessment methods, and principles of restoration ecology, conservation biology, and adaptive management to incorporate science into decisions about uses of estuarine systems. Case studies of Bainbridge Island and the Columbia River demonstrate the use of objective, defensible methods to prioritize tidally influenced shorelines and habitats (i.e., riparian forests, marshes, unvegetated flats, rocky shores, seagrass meadows, kelp forests) for preservation, conservation, and restoration. Case studies of Clinton, Washington, and Port Townsend, Washington, demonstrate the incorporation of an ecological perspective and technological solutions into design of overwater structures to minimize impacts on nearshore ecosystems. Adaptive management has allowed coastal development and restoration uncertainties to be better evaluated, with the information used to improve management decisions. Although unproven on a large scale, we think these kinds of methods can contribute to the net improvement of already degraded ecosystems. The ingredients include applied science to understand the issues, education, incentives, empirical data, cumulative impact analysis, and an effective adaptive management program. Because the option of net ecosystem improvement is often more costly than alternatives such as no net loss, commitment by the local or regional community to this approach is essential.

AB The Long-Term Vision for the Schelde estuary was determined as "the development of a healthy and multifunctional estuarine water system that can be utilized in a sustainable way for human needs." This Dutch-Flemish managerial plan sets quality targets for the condition of the estuary by the year 2030 and the management measures to achieve them. Targets were developed and integrated from three central perspectives: accessibility of the ports, safety against floods in the densely populated catchment, and ecosystem health. This study focuses on the ecological rehabilitation of the estuary and the creation of sustainable nature, seeking possible alliances with security measures against floods, navigation requisites for port activities, and enhancement of the estuary's educational and recreational values. The estuary and its valley were subdivided into ecologically relevant zones. Key parameters were identified, and a conceptual rehabilitation model was developed, based on a problem analysis. Goals were set in a semiquantified way for most attributes of the estuarine functioning and prioritized for each zone. Rehabilitation measures with maximal contribution to the priority goals were identified for each zone. Spatial analysis of the study area indicated optimal areas for the implementation of these measures. To exemplify the array of possibilities on an ecosystem level, two different rehabilitation plans were proposed, each from a different approach. The potential contribution to the rehabilitation of the estuary was compared for both alternatives.

AB To bridge the gaps between restoration as a science and as a practice, restoration ecology has to broaden its scope toward transdisciplinarity in close cooperation with landscape ecologists and other holistic environmentally oriented scientists, professionals, practitioners, and stakeholders. For restoration, the ongoing transdisciplinary scientific revolution has opened new insights to cope with the complex bio-hydro- and human-ecological network relations. The Total Human Ecosystem (THE), integrating humans with all other organisms and their total environment at the highest level of the global hierarchy, should become the unifying holistic paradigm for all synthetic "eco-disciplines." These should link ecological knowledge, wisdom, and ethics with their scientific and professional expertise from the natural and social sciences and the humanities. As the tangible matrix for all organisms, including humans, our industrial Total Human Landscape is the concrete spatial and functional system of the THE. It forms a closely interlaced network of solar energy-powered natural and seminatural biosphere landscapes and fossil energy-powered urban and agro-industrial technosphere landscapes. The self-organizing and self-creative restoration capacities of biosphere landscapes are driven by mutually amplifying auto- and cross-catalytic feedback loops, but the rapidly expanding technosphere landscapes are driven by destabilizing "run-away" feedback loops. To prevent a global breakdown and to ensure the sustainable future for both humankind and nature, these positive feedbacks have to be counteracted by restraining, cultural feedbacks of environmental planning and management, conservation, and restoration. As the theme of this special issue alludes to, this template should become an integral part of an urgently needed sustainability revolution, to which the transdisciplinary landscape restoration could contribute its important share.

AB Life form, endemism, conservation status, and horticultural interest are detailed for orchid species associated to shade coffee-plantations in Mexico. About 11% of the orchid taxa (2 14 species) found in these agroccosystems are in the Mexican list of species requiring some form of protection. Almost 40% of the species are of horticultural interest. The importance of promoting shaded coffee plantations as an alternative to the conservation of primary plant communities in Mexican and other tropical regions is clear. Long term management plans are recommended.

TI Environmental action and local democracy in post-socialist Hungary
SO REVUE D ETUDES COMPARATIVES EST-OUEST
LA French
DT Article
AB The history of environmental policy in Hungary still seems to bear the marks of the Communist past. Till 1989, the environment came under consideration in planning only as a sectorial policy and was seen only in terms of nature conservation. The central government and bureaucracy, in charge of policy-making, were rather unwilling to regulate pollution and environmental hazards. By the late 1980s, environmentalist movements were objecting to this situation and challenging the declining regime. Despite its obvious willingness to break with the Communist past, Hungary has still not fully erased all traces of previous political and institutional practices. Environmental policy is still technocratic and centralized. Official institutions are struggling to apply European environmental standards based on sustainable development and local initiatives precisely because the latter are lacking. The Communist era's main legacy seems to be the lack of democratic participation at the local level in environmental (or other) matters.

TI Green chemistry as social movement?
SO SCIENCE TECHNOLOGY & HUMAN VALUES
LA English
DT Article
DE green chemistry; social movements; expertise; environmentalism
AB Are there circumstances under which scientists and engineers doing their ordinary jobs can be thought of as participants in a social movement? The technoscientists analyzed in this article are at the forefront of a new way of doing chemistry; they are attempting to redesign chemical products and synthesis pathways to significantly reduce health effects and environmental damage from industrial chemicals. Green chemistry practitioners and entrepreneurs now constitute a small minority of chemists and chemical engineers in the university, government, and corporate sectors, but the innovators gradually are institutionalizing their efforts and winning converts. Drawing on concepts from social movement theory, the authors argue that examining green chemistry as a social movement sheds light on the intentional social organization of emerging scientific and engineering disciplines, advances thinking about the role of expertise in social change, and uncovers a possible pathway toward reconstructing chemical technologies on a more environmentally sustainable basis. The article closes with questions about potential coalitions among green chemists and engineers, regulators, and activist sectors of civil society.

AB The global effort toward sustainable development has initiated a transition in water management. Water utility companies use water-pricing policies as an instrument for controlling residential water demand. To support policy makers in their decisions, the authors have developed DAWN, a hybrid model for evaluating water-pricing policies. DAWN integrates an agent-based social model for the consumer with conventional econometric models and simulates the residential water demand-supply chain, enabling the evaluation of different scenarios for policy making. An agent community is assigned to behave as water consumers, while econometric and social models are incorporated into them for estimating water consumption. DAWN's main advantage is that it supports social interaction between consumers, through an influence diffusion mechanism, implemented via inter-agent communication. Parameters affecting water consumption and associated with consumers' social behavior can be simulated with DAWN. Real-world results of DAWN's application for the evaluation of five water-pricing policies in Thessaloniki, Greece, are presented.

TI Quality of life perceptions and directions for urban regeneration in
   Hong Kong
SO SOCIAL INDICATORS RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
AB Urban regeneration can be an effective tool to promote sustainability and enhance macro-level quality of life if the principles of encouraging participation, building community character, advancing equity, improving environment and enlivening the economy are observed. Through the assessment of various quality of life indicators related to these five basic principles for sustainable urban regeneration by the public, private and community sectors, this paper finds that Hong Kong falls far short of realizing these fundamental principles. There are also considerable discrepancies between the public and non-public (private and NGOs) sectors in terms of evaluating existing quality of life issues and perceiving their relative priorities. The private and community sectors tend to have lower rating of existing situation and consequently a longer priority list. On the contrary, the public sector seems to be more complacent with the existing quality of life situations and has a much shorter priority list. The public sector's more relaxed attitude coupled with a top-down executive-led polity mean that Hong Kong will probably have a long way to go toward sustainable urban regeneration.

AB The term 'critical body residue' (CBR) was defined as the lowest observed total body concentration of a contaminant in an organism, which is associated with the occurrence of adverse toxic effects in either individuals or populations of a defined age or stage of development. In this study, internal toxicity thresholds were determined for copper in the clitellated adult stage of earthworms (Lumbricus rubellus and Aporrectodea caliginosa). The objective was to assess the applicability of CBRs as a practical tool in soil quality assessment of contaminated sites and as a means of a sustainable protection of earthworm fauna. Laboratory studies showed that body concentrations of Cu were generally in agreement with the chemically available CaCl2-extractable fraction in soil, but that there was also some evidence of internal pH-related homeostatic regulation. Toxicological correlates of body Cu concentrations with adverse effects on cocoon production (fecundity) suggested an approximate sublethal internal threshold of about 40 mg kg(-1), with mortality occurring at about 60 mg kg(-1). Adult L. rubellus sampled from areas with a wide range of metal pollution showed body Cu concentrations with a minimum of 8 mg kg(-1) and a maximum of 60 mg kg(-1). Beyond this apparent physiological tolerance range, environmental management directed at optimal earthworm population survival may not be sustainable in contaminated fields. Studies of L. rubellus colonizing a metal-contaminated experimental sludge-treated field showed that a reduced rate of colonization can already be associated with an average body Cu concentration of 25 mg kg(-1). However, in this particular field situation mixture effects of other metals that were also present in the soil and the occurrence of avoidance behaviour during colonization may have contributed to this low internal toxicity threshold. It is concluded that the CBR approach seems to be a feasible option for use as a tool in a bioavailability-based soil quality assessment, even for essential trace metals like copper, but that further insight may be needed to establish the uncertainty and reliability of the application in environmental quality assessment and decision making.

AB Rain-fed agriculture in alternation with natural fallow is widespread in semiarid northeastern Mexico, but little information on changes in soil properties, soil degradation, and natural rehabilitation is available. The effects of rain-fed agriculture and fallow on soil quality indicators on vertisols in a semiarid area near Linares, Nuevo Leon, were studied. One cultivated time sequence representing 3 to 30 yr of use and one fallow time sequence of 2 to 22 yr were selected. Fifty percent of soil organic carbon (SOC) and 56% of total nitrogen (TN) were lost during the first 4 yr of cultivation, but loss reached approximate equilibrium after 6 yr. The SOC showed 34% recovery and TN showed 62% recovery on sites abandoned for 22 yr. Despite this recovery after 22 yr of fallow, SOC and TN levels reached only 50% of those observed under native vegetation. Water-stable macroaggregation declined by 14% under cultivation, but increased swiftly during fallow, showing no significant correlation with SOC. The levels of SOC and TN depletion under conventional rain-fed agriculture observed are very difficult to mitigate by natural fallows in economically-viable time periods. However, the precise impact of these changes on aggregation properties of these vertisols and the long-term sustainability of present cultivation-fallow practices is not clear. Further research to determine the precise influence of individual soil organic constituents on physical properties of these vertisols is in progress.

AB Soil organic matter (SOM) controls the physical, chemical and biological properties of soil and is a key factor in soil productivity. Data on SOM quantity and quality are therefore important for agricultural sustainability. In 1990, an experiment was set up at Saria, Burkina Faso on a sandy loam Lixisol to evaluate long-term effects of tillage (hand hoeing or oxen ploughing) with or without 10 t ha(-1) yr(-1) of manure and fallowing on SOM and N concentrations and their distribution in particle size fractions. The field was sown annually to sorghum (Sorghum bicolor [L.] Moench). Ten years later, total organic C and total N, SOM fractions and their N concentrations, and sorghum yield were determined. Continuous sorghum cultivation without organic inputs caused significant losses of C and N in the hoed and ploughed plots. However, addition of manure to hoed plots was effective in maintaining similar levels of C and N to fallow plots. Without manure, SOM was mainly stored in the size-fraction < 0.053 mm (fine organic matter, FOM). SOM was mainly stored in the size-fraction between 0.053 and 2 mm (particulate organic matter, POM). In plots with manure and in fallow plots, the addition of manure more than doubled POM concentrations, with levels in tilled plots exceeding those of the fallow plots, and the highest levels in manually hoed plots. Nitrogen associated with POM (POM-N) followed a similar trend to POM. Hoeing and ploughing led to a decline in sorghum grain yield. Manure application increased yields by 56% in the hoed plots and 70% in the ploughed plots. Grain yield was not correlated with total SOM but was positively correlated with total POM. This study indicated that POM was greatly affected by long-term soil management options.

   sustainable management; Ferrasols
AB The impact of different tropical farming systems on soil quality was examined using a systematic sampling strategy. Total organic C, pH, extractable P, exchangeable K, bulk density, water stable aggregates, microbial biomass C, cation exchange capacity, soil depth, and clay content were determined. An assessment framework, including a minimum data set, linear scoring functions and weighted additive indices, was used to evaluate the soil quality of a tropical farm growing various crops in Hainan, China. Soil quality was evaluated according to four functions: water availability, nutrient availability, rooting suitability, and erosion resistance. Our results showed that soils were intrinsically lacking in nutrients and vulnerable to degradation, and that these problems were exacerbated by inappropriate management. There was strong evidence that long-term rubber farming caused soil acidification, soil compaction, and depletion of organic matter and nutrients. By contrast, conservation practices in coffee plantations protected or improved organic matter concentration and soil structure, resulting in higher soil quality indices.

AB Sustainable management of nutrients in agricultural systems is critical for sufficient production of nutritious foods and to minimize environmental pollution. In this overview, we discuss some of the most important factors influencing nutrient cycling, and how practices for sustainable nutrient management can be optimized. In most cases, problems are associated with excessive use of nutrients (manures, other organic amendments, and inorganic fertilizers). Options for dealing with such problems at the farm level include: reducing nutrient inputs to balance exports, increasing the land area on which manures are applied, and export of excess nutrients from the farm in the form of value-added products. These strategies can be used singly, or in combination. Nutrients in the human food chain are often not recycled back to primary crop production. To manage such issues, and avoid regional nutrient accumulations, we need to develop a better understanding of large-scale nutrient flows, and develop policies to manage them. We stress the importance of scale when considering nutrient management in the future.

AB The practice of large phosphorus (P) additions to agricultural land has resulted in an increased depletion of limited mineable rock phosphate resources, P accumulation in soils with an increased risk for P losses, and intensified eutrophication and deterioration of water quality in recipient water bodies. A number of measures have been used to reach balance between P inputs and outputs in agricultural systems, with the goal of achieving improved P use efficiency, sustained high crop yields and reduced P losses. This paper discusses how this goal may be achieved. Results from a Swedish long-term fertility experiment combined with results of a P leaching study using a selection of soils from the fertility experiment are used to evaluate the effects of a balanced P system on yields, soil P levels and P leaching. Three P fertilizer application strategies are compared (zero P, replacement P, and a treatment where surplus P fertilization was used to achieve a rapid increase in the soil P status). The replacement P strategy appeared to be the most sustainable system but P fixation in this system must be accounted for. When surplus P rates were applied, increased crop yields were counterbalanced by poorer use efficiency and P accumulation in soil. Topsoil P content was a poor predictor of P leaching. Instead, balancing P inputs and outputs represents a first step in the management of P losses, but additional, site-specific measures are required to counteract site-specific factors responsible for P losses.

AB Fertilizer and manure application rate and timing are often based on the optimal nitrogen rate and not on potassium (K) requirements. This can lead to excess or shortage of K depending on the crop and rotation. In grass-dominated agricultural production, including many organic farming systems, K has become a critical element, especially in areas dominated by coarse-textured or organic soils. In this paper we review K management in relation to long-term sustainability of both the soil resource and the production of crops of high yield and quality. One question for the future is whether we can adopt management options that favour efficient use of K and secure a sustainable future for global K reserves. For example, is it possible to enhance the release rate of K from soil mineral sources so that we require less fertilizer K from K-bearing salt deposits? A reduction in external K inputs requires improved on-farm recycling of K in order to reduce losses. We also need a better understanding of soil processes and soil-plant interactions and decision-support tools to predict the potential K release from mineral weathering. Certain areas dominated by young, clay-rich soils can potentially supply enough K, whereas other areas with coarse sandy or organic soils have a very low weathering potential and would thus need external inputs of K.

AB Sustainable nutrient management includes economizing on finite natural resources such as fossil energy and limited phosphorus (P) resources. Arable farms with exclusively crop production are characterized by large nutrient export in farm products. In the long term, nutrient export from soils and losses must be balanced by adequate inputs of fertilizers, biological N-2 fixation or recycled products from the human food system. Critical issues associated in particular with arable systems discussed in this paper include organic matter depletion and lack of synchronization between nitrogen (N) release from organic N pools (such as plant residues and green manures) and crop demand, leading to N losses and/or N deficiency. Further critical issues identified include efficient use of indigenous soil P and applied P fertilizers and, especially in organic systems, risk of depletion of P and K, which if realized reduce soil fertility and limit production. The risk of enrichment of trace elements to levels toxic to soil microbes, plants, animals or man is also discussed. Suggested measures for managing these critical issues include choice of crop rotation, residue and green manure management.

AB Low input grazing-based meat production is often practised on land where alternative land use is restricted and where high biodiversity warrants specific environmental payments. Although these systems are characterized by low external nutrient inputs, significant nutrient losses may occur per unit of produce, even though losses per unit area are low. If the aim is to have animal production without further eutrophication of watercourses, these losses should be minimized,. However, if nutrient-poor grasslands characterized by high biodiversity are the aim, some losses must be accepted to balance nutrient inputs by atmospheric deposition. The impact of grazing animals on nutrient dynamics in grasslands is reviewed in this paper, and options to further improve nutrient management are discussed. It is concluded that nutrient management should largely be addressed indirectly through management of animal behaviour in relation to grazing and supplemental feeding, as well as through optimization of the seasonal distribution of livestock size. A case study indicated that N losses from a cattle farm could be reduced considerably by these means, while animal production could actually be improved. Sustainability issues and trends in legislative and social pressures on low input grazing-based systems of animal production are discussed in relation to nutrient management and practical recommendations.

AB The intensity of animal production around the world has increased substantially during the last half-century, which has led to large problems with the disposal of manures and waste waters. The focus of this paper is on the development of national policies to improve the nutrient management of concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs), where nutrients are invariably in surplus. To create proper nutrient management strategies for CAFOs, and to avoid environmental problems when surplus nutrients enter air, soil and water, we need to know the number of animals/birds in the unit, the quantity of manure/slurry produced, how this material is stored and handled and how much land is available for manure spreading. In this paper, we discuss the development of nutrient management strategies for CAFOs in Europe and North America, and the voluntary measures and environmental regulations related to this. For the planning of nutrient management to be comprehensive and efficient, we need expertise from several disciplines. This planning includes development of: animal diets that reduce the amounts of excreted nutrients; efficient storage and land application technologies; land application programmes to optimize yields and reduce nutrient losses; and strategies for use of excess manure outside the farm. Also, large-scale efforts involving many stakeholders (farmers, governments and private industry) are needed to solve problems with nutrient imbalances over the long term. Efforts along these lines include manure relocation, alternative uses of manures, nutrient trading, and a general extensification of animal agriculture. The overall guiding principle for policies and planning should be a balance of nutrients, on farms as well as at larger scales.

AB To establish strategies for sustainable nutrient management, the priority of each identified element for different user groups and the issue of data transferability from one scale to the next need to be addressed. This is important to avoid developing policies and strategies using inaccurate data. This paper provides a thorough background on such issues and provides data from specific case studies to reflect the impact of scale on the usability and transferability of data. These data show that using information obtained in a laboratory setting for larger scales can generate major errors. Data are also provided regarding the spatial variability in total N and total P measured at different sub-watersheds within a large watershed. Results from this case study indicate that there is a definite spatial variability in N and P loadings, which makes it difficult to transfer and extrapolate from data measured at one sub-watershed to the entire watershed. Therefore, it can be concluded that using either measured or simulated data obtained at a small scale to respond to questions for larger scales may be erroneous. Such difficulty may be due to the inherent spatial variability in soils, nutrients, biology and other features of the landscape.

AB Do sport, exercise, and physical education (SEPE) professionals empower the people they serve and contribute to community development? Do SEPE policies, programs, and practices contribute to sustainable economic and social development, making them worthwhile governmental investments? These questions frame the ensuing analysis. Empowerment-oriented and community-based SEPE programs, and practices may contribute to sustainable development in five related areas. They may enhance human health and well-being across the lifespan; mollify the harms caused by poverty, social exclusion, social isolation, and inter-group conflict; contribute to human capital development, especially in vulnerable youth; develop collective identities, thereby facilitating collective action; and foster social networks and voluntary associations, which animate civil society in strong democracies. To achieve these potential contributions, SEPE professionals will need to develop new capacities and build new institutions. These pervasive changes characterize the social work of SEPE programs, practices, and policies.

AB One of the most significant and enduring ideas associated with the systems initiatives at Hawkesbury has been the interconnections that were made there between systemic acts of development in the 'concrete world' and the abstract 'epistemic developments' of the actors who participate in them. Each is seen to be constitutive of the other in a profoundly systemic manner, with 'concrete events' being both influenced by and an influence on 'abstract ideas'. The embrace of critical experiential strategies, which themselves are regarded as essentially systemic and reflexive in nature, has been a central feature of the pedagogies, research processes, and engagement strategies that have been designed to better facilitate this interconnection. As calls for more sustainable and equitable forms of development gather momentum across the globe, and the citizenry become increasingly engaged with issues that are seen to pose significant systemic global risks, the need for collective, communicative experiential strategies in the form of systemic discourse becomes evident.

AB Innovation is said to be one of the most important factors in economic competition. Regions and firms are striving for the establishment of innovative structures. However, the question of how to organize permanent or sustainable innovativeness is not easily answered. Suggesting six rules of innovation, the first rule is, that there is no general rule of how to organize sustainable innovativeness. Anyway, we do know much about innovation killers and about how organizations deal with innovations and we do know that innovations do not happen merely by chance. There are regional paths of innovations, innovation paradigms and long waves of innovation models. For Europe, especially for Germany, the adaptation of 'innovation models' has been very important for the evolution of new institutional and organizational forms, but we can identify striking cultural differences. In Asia, the adaption of the same innovation models did lead to different forms of innovation management with considerably different outcomes. The article concludes that transferring implicates transforming in a culturally path-dependent way.

AB Telecommunications access in the rural and remote areas of Australia has come under considerable scrutiny in recent years. In the past decade, various Federal Government reports and inquiries have citied inadequate infrastructure, lack of service provision, the high cost of access and "thin" markets as key impediments. Whilst these difficulties are not restricted to rural and remote Australia, they tend to impact disproportionately on regional communities, notably in education and health service provision. Particularly at risk are the indigenous communities in rural and remote regions of Australia.
   In this paper telecommunications infrastructure is perceived as the lynch-pin for achieving sustainable economic and social development. It is suggested that without appropriate development of information infrastructure, the disparities already experienced by rural and remote communities will be further exacerbated as the reliance of goods and services over computer-mediated networks increases.
   The paper offers a new paradigm that will assist in maintaining a competitive telecommunications environment and facilitate the sustainable social and economic development of rural and remote communities. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Purchasing management and total quality management (TQM) can help provide organizations with a sustainable competitive advantage by improving product quality and service while reducing cost. Although the literature has emphasized that purchasing and quality management are essential competencies to supply chain success, there is a lack of empirical evidence that tests the impact of quality management practices in purchasing (QMPP) on business performance. Therefore, the objective of this research was to empirically examine a mediational model in which QMPP have a direct impact on purchasing performance and an indirect impact on business performance mediated through purchasing performance. The proposed model was tested by means of structural equation modelling. The study showed that the implementation of quality management practices in purchasing has a significant positive impact on purchasing and business performance.

AB Following the description of the subsided land treatment methods and the characteristics of the related land reclamation, the necessity and emergency of the land reclamation work is stressed. To cope with the related problems, dynamic prediction of the ground subsidence in different time periods and areas is made based on the laws governing the rock and ground movements and line with a mine's future mining plan. It is proposed to carry out dynamic management of subsided land reclamation work in mining area, in order to tackle the previous and current issues confronted in the processes of land requisition, compensation and land reclamation. It is intended to provide. through the above-mentioned efforts, the technical and decision-making basis for the mining authorities concerned to better solve the problems relating to land requisition and reclamation in the future, and relocation of villages for facilitating the mining of the underground coal depositing and realizing the sustainable development of mining enterprises.

AB With the flourish of Digital Earth and Digital Urban, Digital Mine is also imperative. The most fundamental condition for Digital Mine is mastering multiple spatial and property data. Various drawing materials and property data for mine industry provided by mine surveying workers in our country over the past half century will be the foundation of Digital Mine. The authors believe that the first step of Digital Mine is to develop basic mine geographic information system (for short MGIS), based on which Web Mine Geographic Information System can be set up. Besides when selecting software desk, including system softwares, supporting softwares, tool softwares and other auxiliary softwares, following standard, compatiblity, transplantation and co-operation, the function and efficiency of the selected software environment, as well as the supporting and expansion of adopting new technology should all be considered.

AB Severe soil erosion in the Yellow River basin is a significant obstruction to the sustainable management of soil and water resources. Any changes in soil erosion will have great effects on long-term planning of soil and water conservation in such a severely eroded basin. Rainfall erosivity describes the soil loss potential caused by rain, which can be expected to change in correspondence to changes in climate. This study was conducted to assess the potential effects of climate change on rainfall erosivity in the Yellow River basin. Two different rainfall scenarios were generated with the HadCM3 general circulation model for the years 2006 to 2035, 2036 to 2065, and 2066 to 2095. The statistics test showed that rainfall erosivity increased significantly in the Yellow River basin under both scenarios for all periods in the coming decades. The erosivity increase varied from scenario to scenario, and from period to period. Generally, increases in erosivity were less from southeast to northwest. The calculated precipitation elasticity of rainfall erosivity indicated that percent changes in rainfall erosivity were greater than percent changes in total precipitation by a factor of 1.2 to 1.4. The expected increases in precipitation require that more attention will be given to soil and water conservation practices such as vegetation rehabilitation and check-dam construction.

AB The development and implementation of both economically and environmentally sustainable precision crop management systems can be greatly enhanced through the use of remote sensing. In this study, the potential of narrow-waveband hyperspectral observations in the discrimination of nitrogen and water stresses in corn (Zea mays L) was investigated. Afield experiment was conducted in the summer of 2002 at the Macdonald Research Farm, McGill University, Ste-Anne-de-Bellevue, Quebec, Canada. Corn was grown in forty 9.0 x 10.0 m test plots laid out in a split-plot design with irrigation (non-irrigated, irrigated) as the main treatment and nitrogen fertilizer application rate (50, 100, 150, 200, and 250 kg ha(-1)) as the sub-treatment. Hyperspectral measurements in 2151 wavebands (350 to 2500 nm) were made with afield spectroradiometer during the entire growing season. Using a stepwise procedure, the most effective wavebands capable of discriminating treatment effects were selected. By applying a discrimination procedure with a well-chosen subset of the selected wavebands, treatments were correctly classified with more than 95% accuracy. Specific narrow wavebands, from different portions of the spectrum, allowed the discrimination of plots differing in their irrigation and nitrogen treatments. This study supports past work suggesting that greater spectral resolution should lead to more consistent relationships between the spectral data and different crop status indicators.

DE urban change; mobility and transport in Sao Paulo
AB The paper analyses current transportation and traffic conditions in the Sao Paulo Metropolitan area and the factors that shaped them over the 1967-1997 period. Quantitative data from four subsequent Origin-Destination surveys (OD) were used. Transport progressively changed towards a motorized system, first with the intense use of buses and finally with the large increase in the use of automobiles. Public transport services experienced severe supply and quality problems and increasing fares led to the exclusion of a large number of users. Negative externalities related to the increasing use of the automobile-such as traffic accidents, congestion and pollution-skyrocketed, threatening the sustainability of the metropolis. Policies towards unsustainability continue to be supported and it also appears that even harsher negative consequences will have to be faced until a new vision of the problem is developed.

AB Traditionally, the transport literature reflects the view that traffic volumes, road traffic volumes in particular, are coupled with Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Recently published literature also argues that the carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from transport, passenger cars in particular, have not shown any decoupling from transport volumes for some years. This article presents a theoretical framework for decoupling, defining the difference between decoupling, coupling and negative decoupling. These are further broken down to weak, strong and expansive/recessive degrees of decoupling, laying emphasis on the absolute increase or decrease of the variables. The result section presents data of the development of the relationships between GDP, traffic volumes and CO2 emissions from transport in the EU15 countries between 1970 and 2001, including the special case of Finnish road traffic. The aggregate EU15 data show a change from expansive negative decoupling to expansive coupling regarding passenger transport, and from weak decoupling to expansive negative decoupling regarding freight transport. Weak decoupling of transport CO2 emissions from GDP could also be observed. Weak decoupling of all the three aspects (freight, passenger and CO2) could be seen in the UK, Sweden and Finland in the 1990s. In Finland, the statistics show weak decoupling of GDP from road traffic volume and strong decoupling of road traffic volume and CO2 emissions from road traffic between 1990 and 2001. Four hypothetical explanations of the Finnish phenomenon are put forward in this article: policy towards sustainable mobility, green urban lifestyle, increasing income differences, and statistical misinterpretation. Each explanation is backed up with some quantitative evidence in observable trends in Finland during the 1990s. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper three 'Images' of air travel on a sustainable path in 2050 are outlined. The method used is backcasting. A stabilization of the carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere at 450 parts per million is assumed to constitute a sustainable level. It is concluded that a refinement of the conventional turbofan aircraft is probably not sufficient to reach even the less demanding target level, even though a 40% reduction of fuel intensity may be achieved. The introduction of more radical aircraft configurations, e.g. the flying wing, probably has the greatest potential for reducing fuel consumption, but the development of such aircraft is uncertain. A less risky strategy is to opt for a high-speed propeller aircraft with a cruise speed which is 20-25% lower than for a conventional turbofan aircraft. This configuration entails a 56% cut of carbon dioxide emissions per passenger-kilometre compared to 2000. If this technology trajectory is combined with a development characterized by a weakened emphasis on economic growth together with less hectic lifestyles, it may be possible to reach even the most demanding of the target levels. Air travel per capita in 2050 would then be slightly higher than in 2000. If only the less demanding target level is to be reached global air travel per capita may be about 110% higher than in 2000.

AB Low-elevation ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Doug]. ex. Laws.) forests of the northern Rocky Mountains historically experienced frequent low-intensity fires that maintained open uneven-aged stands. A century of fire exclusion has contributed to denser ponderosa pine forests with greater competition for resources, higher tree stress and greater risk of insect attack and stand- destroying fire. Active management intended to restore a semblance of the more sustainable historic stand structure and composition includes selective thinning and prescribed fire. However, little is known about the relative effects of these management practices on the physiological performance of ponderosa pine. We measured soil water and nitrogen availability, physiological performance and wood radial increment of second growth ponderosa pine trees at the Lick Creek Experimental Site in the Bitterroot National Forest, Montana, 8 and 9 years after the application of four treatments: thinning only; thinning followed by prescribed fire in the spring: thinning followed by prescribed fire in the fall; and untreated controls. Volumetric soil water content and resin capsule ammonium did not differ among treatments. Resin capsule nitrate in the control treatment was similar to that in all other treatments, although burned treatments had lower nitrate relative to the thinned-only treatment. Trees of similar size and canopy condition in the three thinned treatments (with and without fire) displayed higher leaf-area-based photosynthetic rate, stomatal conductance and mid-morning leaf water potential in June and July, and higher wood radial increment relative to trees in control units. Specific leaf area, mass-based leaf nitrogen content and carbon isotope discrimination did not vary among treatments. Our results suggest that, despite minimal differences in soil resource availability, trees in managed units where basal area was reduced had improved gas exchange and growth compared with trees in unmanaged units. Prescribed fire (either in the spring or in the fall) in addition to thinning, had no measurable effect on the mid-term physiological performance and wood growth of second growth ponderosapine.

AB In the mixed grain-livestock producing subtropical regions of northern Australia, declines in the fertility of cropping soils combined with an increasing demand for high quality forage have prompted many producers to consider greater use of ley or phase pastures in their farming systems. The recently released tropical legumes, Lablab purpureus cv. Endurance and Macroptilium bracteatum cv. Juanita, and a previously commercially available legume cultivar, Clitoria ternatea cv. Milgarra, were compared at 3 on-farm sites across southern inland Queensland. L. purpureus produced its highest biomass in the first (range 1595-7037 kg/ha DM) and second years (range 4717-6150 kg/ha DM) but high plant mortality and an absence of seedling regeneration resulted in poor dry matter production in the third year. While C. ternatea produced low biomass in the first season (< 1277 kg/ha DM), yields increased progressively, reaching 4047 kg/ha DM by the third year. Virtually all of the original plants of this species survived and 15-28 seedlings/m(2) established from high soil seed reserves, ensuring a persistent pasture. Biomass production of M. bracteatum in Years 2 and 3 was relatively stable on the sites with the deeper soil profiles (Downfall Creek and Brigalow) and ranged from 3382 to 4940 kg/ha DM. At one site, cropping activities over the previous 20 years had depleted soil nitrate-N content measured to 1.2 in prior to the legume phase, to 27-34 kg/ha N. Following the 3 seasons of legume production and a 12-month fallow, soil nitrate-N increased to 168-223 kg/ha N. At another site, soil nitrate-N contents of 177-180 kg/ha N were measured in the soil profiles to 1.5 m following the legume leys compared with only 74 kg/ha N in a continuous-wheat treatment. Management strategies to capitalise on this additional soil N are discussed.

AB Previously we formulated a quantitative model to characterize site-specific schistosomiasis transmission. In this paper, we present a procedure to calibrate the model to data collected in endemic villages of south-western Sichuan, China, with the objective of reducing parametric uncertainty to allow the model to describe local transmission with relative confidence. A Bayesian approach using local epidemiological data and expert opinion is employed to calibrate the model. Results indicate that, after calibration, the output uncertainty is reduced substantially. The calibrated model is then used for prediction of the effects of different intervention options. Simulations reflect a bimodal transmission in both human (early summer and early fall) and snail (late summer and late fall) infections in this area, for which there is some field evidence. Also shown in the simulations are relatively high reinfection rates following chemotherapy in these endemic villages. These results suggest that a sustainable control strategy is essential in reducing transmission, and that transmission can be reduced by chemotherapy, focal snail (e. g. snail clusters) control, and egg control. Our work demonstrates the feasibility of characterizing site-specific schistosomiasis transmission using a mathematical model and a calibration approach that integrates diverse field data, and the use of the calibrated model to design control strategies.

AB A computer model was developed to evaluate the impact of various technologies for water conservation in domestic households, in terms of the impact on the operation of downstream infrastructure. These technologies, which include (a) low-flush toilets, (b) greywater re-use, and (c) re-use of rainwater from roof runoff for toilet flushing, were compared using indicators of sustainability to measure water consumption, sewerage-system operational performance and process treatment efficiency. The results demonstrated that rainwater re-use is potentially the most sustainable strategy in terms of the benefits associated with water conservation and reduction in sewage discharges from combined-sewer overflows (CSOs). The benefits were observed without the problems associated with increased sedimentation in sewers during dry weather, associated with other water-conservation strategies such as reduced-flush toilets, greywater re-use and the resultant increase in pollutants from CSOs during wet weather.

TI Catchment flood management - A UK perspective and experience

DE flood management; planning; hydroinformatics; water quality; diffuse
   pollution
AB In recent years, there has been a growing concern worldwide about climate change and the corresponding apparent increase in the risk and frequency of flooding and about the implications for a wide range of river basin management issues. This paper describes the United Kingdom government approach to implementing Catchment Flood Management Plans (CFMPs), which will provide a large-scale strategic planning framework for the integrated management of flood risk to people and the development of the natural environment in a sustainable manner This unified approach is to be adopted across England and Wales, with a view to establishing a unifted framework to study flood management in each major catchment. Following on from this introduction to the U.K. approach to high-level flood management, details are given of a study where better water quality management during flood flow conditions has been shown to require a catchment-wide approach to reducing diffuse source pollution from agricultural regions. This study also shows that without this holistic approach to water management, a major cause of non-compliance with an EU Directive would not have been established for this river basin.

ID RESTORATION
AB Intensive land use and far-reaching regulation of the fluvial hydrosystem in the past century have reduced the hydromorphological resilience of the Rhine and Meuse river basins. Because the hydromorphodynamic processes could be controlled to a greater extent, residents of the riverine areas lost their sense of the natural dynamics of river systems, and further urbanization of areas prone to flooding took place without the potential dangers being recognized. It was particularly in the low-lying polders of the Netherlands that the potential damage from flooding increased tremendously over time. The high water discharges of the rivers Rhine and Meuse in 1993, 1995, and 1998 caused a considerable change in governmental policy, public awareness, and international cooperation in terms of flood protection and inland water management. The Dutch government is currently trying to achieve sustainable water and river management by developing and implementing a new approach to flood defense. In addition to the implementation of technological measures, the government aims to create more space for the rivers, combined with objectives from other policy areas, including the restructuring of rural areas, development of the ecological infrastructure, surface mineral extraction, land use and other area specific projects such as housing schemes. This approach is not confined to the Netherlands: similar concepts have recently been introduced at various other locations in the Rhine and Meuse river basins. The new approach requires land-use changes and introduces new scientific research issues relating to land and water use, hydromorphology, river management, and socio-economics. This paper discusses this new approach and related scientific developments.

ID RUNOFF
AB There have been growing concerns over the negative effects of pesticide usage on human health and environmental sustainability. Pesticide residues, if they enter water bodies, will impair water quality and pose risks to human health. During flood season, floodwater could wash off large amount of pesticide residues to rivers and lakes. A pesticide-loss simulation and health-risk assessment (PSHA) system was developed to predict pesticide losses and evaluate associated health risks during flood season. A case study was conducted in the Auglaize-Blanchard Watershed in Ohio to calibrate and verify the proposed system. The results showed a reasonable prediction accuracy and model performance. The PSHA system was then applied to estimate pesticide losses and assess health risks during May 199 7 to April 1998, especially during the flood season from May to August. The results show that water discharge during the flood season contributed 90 percent of the total pesticide losses. The chronic and acute health risks were then quantified and the results showed that the health risks caused by atrazine losses were markedly high during flood season. Therefore, pesticides applied during flood season would cause more serious pollution problems and higher health risks than that in other times. Flood season was shown to be a critical period for not only controlling flooding hazards but also mitigating pesticide pollution.

AB Village poultry play a vital role in many poor rural households. They provide scarce animal protein (in the form of meat and eggs) and can be sold/bartered to meet essential family needs such as medicine, clothes and school fees. They also provide manure and pest control as well as being used in traditional ceremonies. Village poultry are generally owned and managed by women and children and improving their production can provide the first step out of poverty for the rural poor. The Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research (ACIAR) has supported village poultry research in many countries since 1984. This research has had some significant outcomes including: the control of Newcastle disease (ND) using Australian derived live thermotolerant vaccines in a variety of poultry production systems in several countries; description and quantification of the scavenging feed resource base of low input/low output systems; development of gender-sensitive extension materials and methodologies suitable for use in remote rural areas in Asia and Africa; and the development and registration of a new duck plague vaccine in Vietnam.
   The thermotolerant ND 1-2 vaccine remains viable for periods away from the cold chain, can be administered by various routes and induces an acceptable level of protection under village conditions. The vaccine master seed, together with the ND Laboratory Manual, is made available without cost by ACIAR. In developing countries where ND is endemic, outbreaks regularly result in high mortalities and in countries where it is not endemic, sporadic outbreaks make vaccination advisable. The implementation of an effective ND control programme in countries in Africa and Asia has resulted in increased chicken numbers, increased household purchasing power, increased home consumption of chicken products and increased decision-making power for women. However, sustainable programmes for the control of ND in village chickens have been difficult to achieve, often due to limited appreciation by official agencies of the benefits of village poultry. Experience has shown that a sustainable ND control programme is composed of five essential components: a) an appropriate vaccine and vaccine technology; b) effective extension materials and methodologies that target veterinary and extension staff, community vaccinators and farmers; c) simple evaluation and monitoring systems; d) economic sustainability based on the commercialisation of the vaccine and vaccination services and the marketing of surplus chickens and eggs; and e) support and coordination by relevant government agencies for the promotion of vaccination programmes. Details of ND control in village poultry are provided on the ACIAR website, www.aciar.gov.au and by the Australian Agency for International Development www.ausaid.gov.au.

DE family poultry; gender; management; nutrition; poverty alleviation
AB Despite efforts to develop intensive poultry production, family poultry (FP) are still very important in developing countries. In most developing countries, the keeping of poultry by local communities has been practised for many generations. FP keeping is a widely practised activity. More than 90% of rural families in most developing countries keep one or more poultry species (i.e. chickens, ducks, guinea fowls, geese, pigeons, etc.), and all ethnic groups tend to be involved in FP production. Although generally requiring low levels of inputs, FP is an appropriate system for supplying the fast-growing human population with high-quality protein, while providing additional income to the generally resource-poor small farmers, especially women. FP is also a source of employment for underprivileged groups and less-favoured areas in developing countries. However, constraints facing FP production systems are related to high mortality (mainly due to Newcastle disease), housing, feeding, breeding, marketing, credit, education/training, extension and information dissemination. Organizers of FP development programmes must be sufficiently sensitive to socio-cultural and economic circumstances of potential beneficiaries. Developing schemes that aim to promote and improve the FP sub-sector in a way that is sustainable must not underestimate the specific roles and contributions of relevant members of local communities, as well as their different gender groups i.e. women, men, boys, girls, young and old persons. Therefore, getting new information and other various interventions to the front line of production requires well-designed gender research. This work, which must be done by multi- and trans-disciplinary teams to ensure that the production environment in which FP-keeping farmers work is fully understood, helps to identify the target groups of FP producers for development programmes such as in training, extension, information dissemination, provision of inputs and credit, marketing of poultry and their products. Ways to improve the productivity of FP management systems by taking into account sociocultural, especially gender, aspects in the design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation stages of FP development programmes at community level are also explored.

ID NEWCASTLE-DISEASE VIRUS
AB Rural poultry flocks in developing countries make little use of conventional vaccines or therapies. Appropriate vaccines must be robust, cheap and suited for local production in relatively unsophisticated laboratories. Only diseases producing high mortalities warrant attention. Appropriate therapies depend on local ethnoveterinary knowledge.
   Newcastle disease is the most important constraint to the productivity of village chicken flocks. The Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research (ACIAR) initiated projects on vaccines to control this disease in rural flocks in 1984. Thermostable variants of the avirulent strains V4 and 1-2 were developed and shown to be safe and effective in laboratory and village trials. Master seed of 1-2 vaccine is made available without cost to developing countries. Vaccine is produced by a seed-lot system and involves allantoic sac inoculation of non-SPF eggs. Harvested allantoic fluid is the basis of the vaccine. Sustainable vaccination campaigns require components other than an appropriate vaccine. Appropriate extension messages must be developed to target the neglected village flocks, and the women who usually control them. Systems of cost recovery must be developed. Appropriate training must be available at all levels - to administrators, laboratory staff and village vaccinators. With the control of Newcastle disease, villagers can be convinced of the full potential of their flocks to produce food and income. Other interventions including housing, nutrition and control of other diseases can be introduced. The thermostable vaccines have been tested in at least 30 developing countries and produced on a large scale in at least 9. International agencies other than ACIAR and various NGOs have supported the projects. The next village vaccine could be fowlpox, with virus adapted to production in the allantoic cavity. The major killing disease of duck flocks in Asia is duck plague. An ACIAR project has seen the development of an improved vaccine in Vietnam The vaccine, adapted to grow in cultured chick embryo fibroblasts, is registered foe use throughout Vietnam. Various remedies, mainly herbal, are used on village flocks to improve performance. These probably do not assist in treating established disease.
   The commercial industry could ask, are our vaccines too sophisticated and expensive, is there a place for food vaccines, should we investigate herbal remedies and how can we help the rural poor?.

ID DIVERSITY
AB The global poultry sector is divided into a large-scale commercial sub-sector dominated by international, vertically integrated companies, and a small-scale subsector that provides up to 90 percent of total poultry production in some of the least developed countries. The fast reproduction cycle, low unit costs, economies of scale in research and appropriation, and control of the produce are driving factors in the commercial sector. Private research concentrates on technologies that are likely to result in market applications and returns to investment. Private incentives for animal research are strongest where markets for improved technology are large, technical advances can be made quickly, and intellectual property can be protected. To date, technological protection strategies and contractual practices, rather than formal intellectual property rights strategies, have dominated in the commercial poultry sector. Poultry breeding companies have developed a highly successful way of protecting their intellectual property investment in superior breeds by exploiting heterosis, and the deleterious segregation of hybrid stocks in the next generation. Thus, by restricting access to the pure parent line stock (a form of trade secret) and by selling F1 generation birds, a breeding company remains the sole supplier of useful material. Patents do not yet play a role in poultry breeding, but breeding for disease resistance might change this in the future.
   This paper explores the flow of poultry genetic material between developed and developing countries, investments in the poultry sector in developing countries, and economic and legal issues involved. In terms of genetic resources, the main questions concern how the division in the poultry sector affects the full portfolio of poultry genetic resources and if this division has an impact on the traditional small-scale subsector. The analysis is based on country reports to the First Report on the State of the World ' s Animal Genetic Resources process, studies on flow of genetic material and commercial transactions, and genetic distancing.

AB An investigation into the potential carrying capacity of suspended bivalve culture was undertaken using a linear food web model. The investigation involved configuring the model for the present state using all available information, and then perturbing the food web by introducing the bivalve culture until pre-determined carrying capacity limits were achieved. These carrying capacity trigger levels were defined by the production carrying capacity and the ecological carrying capacity. The production carrying capacity represents the theoretical maximum bivalve culture that could be supported in the embayment. This is defined as when the ecosystem collapses down to a nutrient-phytoplankton-culture-detritus dominated system. This level of culture was found to be a yield of bivalve culture of 310 t km(-2) year(-1) averaged across the bays in question. By contrast, the ecological carrying capacity was defined as the level of culture that could be introduced without significantly changing the major energy fluxes or structure of the food web. This limit was found to correspond to a bivalve culture yield of 65 t km(-2) year(-1) averaged across the bays. Introducing the large-scale bivalve culture resulted in a decrease in the mean trophic level of the ecosystem, an increase in the total yield, throughput and efficiency, and the bivalves replaced zooplankton as the major grazers in the modelled system.

AB Risk assessment of future land use changes with respect to their ecological impact is still an unsolved problem. The implementation of sustainable land use concepts for mesoscale catchments requires a methodology that is able to quantify the effects on the water balance of this ecosystem. Paired catchment experiments on this scale are either not feasible or too time-consuming and expensive, and the results are usually not transferable to other regions. Thus the application of hydrological models can clarify the processes involved and support well-balanced management decisions.
   The GIS-linked software package 10SWAT consisting of the pre-processing tools TOPAZ, SUSAT and SWAT-GRASS, the ecohydrologic model SWAT-G and the post-processing program OUTGRASS were tested in the German Aar watershed (60 km(2)), which is located in a low mountain range area in the federal state of Hessen. The aim of this modelling exercise is the development of a method for land use change analysis in order to derive sustainable land use options. The impact of different average field sizes on the spatial distribution of agricultural production systems was analysed by the economic model ProLand. Spatially distributed land use scenarios for an average field size of 0.5, 0.75, 1, 2, 5, 10 and 20 ha have been provided in the form of raster maps with a resolution of 25 m x 25 m and were analysed with the IOSWAT modelling system with regard to their hydrological effect. In general, the model predicts reasonable annual trends for the water balance components of the scenarios under investigation. However, the absolute changes due to deforestation, augmentation of grassland and field crops remain much smaller than expected. The peak flow rate is especially affected by the changes in land use. The strongest impact can be observed in the spatial pattern of water balance components within the catchment. Copyright (C) 2005 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

AB To date, habitat expansion in the United Kingdom has been on a case-by-case basis, without consideration of the current state, in terms of biodiversity, or the future sustainability of the habitat reserve. It was hypothesised that spatially targeted habitat expansion is beneficial for habitat and species' persistence. Five spatially explicit scenarios for new habitat creation were devised, each with a different conservation aim: increase habitat patch size, reduce patch perimeter-area ratio, decrease habitat patch isolation, increase biodiversity and ensure sustainability. For beech woodlands in part of the Chilterns Natural Area, UK, we investigated changes to six landscape metrics (total area (TA), patch density (PD), largest patch index (LPI), mean patch size (MPS), mean nearest-neighbour distance (MNN) and mean shape index (MSI)) as a result of the addition of new habitat, in accordance with the level of increase indicated in the United Kingdom's Habitat Action Plan for beech woodland. Significant differences were found between the landscape metrics produced by spatially targeting new habitat and those produced by randomly adding new habitat. Random habitat addition performed poorly when compared with spatially explicit habitat addition even with relatively modest habitat expansion targets. We conclude that spatial targeting of habitat creation can counter the adverse effects of habitat fragmentation. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB At the 2002 Johannesburg World Summit on Sustainable Development, 190 countries endorsed a commitment to achieve, by 20 10, a significant reduction of the current rate of biodiversity loss at the global, regional and national levels. A wide range of approaches is available to the monitoring of progress towards this objective. The strengths and weaknesses of many of these approaches are considered, with special attention being given to the proposed and existing indicators described in the other papers in this issue. Recommendations are made about the development of indicators. Most existing and proposed indicators use data collected for other purposes, which may be unrepresentative. In the short term, much remains to be done in expanding the databases and improving the statistical techniques that underpin these indicators to minimize potential biases. In the longer term, indicators based on unrepresentative data should be replaced with equivalents based on carefully designed sampling programmes. Many proposed and existing indicators do not connect clearly with human welfare and they are unlikely to engage the interest of governments, businesses and the public until they do so. The extent to which the indicators already proposed by parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity are sufficient is explored by reference to the advice an imaginary scientific consultant from another planet might give. This exercise reveals that the range of taxa and biomes covered by existing indicators is incomplete compared with the knowledge we need to protect our interests. More fundamentally, our understanding of the mechanisms linking together the status of biodiversity, Earth system processes, human decisions and actions, and ecosystem services impacting human welfare is still too crude to allow us to infer reliably that actions taken to conserve biodiversity and protect ecosystem services are well chosen and effectively implemented. The involvement of social and Earth system scientists, as well as biologists, in collaborative research programmes to build and parameterize models of the Earth system to elucidate these mechanisms is a high priority.

AB By agreeing to strive for 'a significant reduction in the current rate of loss of biological diversity' by the year 2010, political leaders at the 2002 World Summit on Sustainable Development (held in Johannesburg, South Africa) presented conservation scientists with a great opportunity but also one of their most significant challenges. This is an extremely exciting and laudable development, but this reporting process could be made yet more powerful if it incorporates, from the outset, independent scientific assessment of the measures, how they are analysed, and practical ways of plugging key gaps. This input is crucial if the measures are to be widely owned, credible and robust to the vigorous external scrutiny to which they will doubtless be exposed. Assessing how rates of biodiversity loss have changed from current levels by 2010 will require that a given attribute has been measured at least three times; however, most habitats, species, populations and ecosystem services have not been assessed even once. Furthermore, the best data on which to base estimates of biodiversity loss are biased towards the charismatic vertebrate species; unfortunately, these supply minimal services to the human economy. We have to find ways to redress this taxonomic imbalance and expand our analyses to consider the vast diversity of invertebrate, fungal and microbial species that play a role in determining human health and economic welfare.
   In the first part of this paper I will use examples from local and regional monitoring of biological diversity to examine the desired properties of 'ideal indicators'. I will then change focus and examine an initial framework that asks how we might monitor changes in the economic goods and services provided by natural ecosystems. I will use this exercise to examine how the set of possible indicators given by the Convention on Biological Diversity might be modified in ways that provide a more critical assay of the economic value of biological diversity. Here I will emphasize that we need not only to monitor these benefits, but also to significantly increase public awareness of human dependence upon the role that non-voting species play in driving the world's financial economy.

AB Conservative estimates suggest that 50-90% of the existing insect species on Earth have still to be discovered, yet the named insects alone comprise more than half of all known species of organism. With such poor baseline knowledge, monitoring change in insect diversity poses a formidable challenge to scientists and most attempts to generalize involve large extrapolations from a few well-studied taxa. Butterflies are often the only group for which accurate measures of change can be obtained. Four schemes, used successfully to assess change in British butterflies, that are increasingly being applied across the world are described: Red Data Books (RDB) list the best judgements of experts of the conservation status of species in their field of expertise; mapping schemes plot the changing distributions of species at scales of 1-100 km(2); transect monitoring schemes generate time series of changes in abundance in sample populations of species on fixed sites across the UK; and occasional surveys measure the number, boundaries and size of all populations of a (usually RDB) species at intervals of 10-30 years. All schemes describe consistent patterns of change, but if they are to be more generally useful, it is important to understand how well butterflies are representative of other taxa. Comparisons with similarly measured changes in native bird and plant species suggest that butterflies have declined more rapidly that these other groups in Britain; it should soon be possible to test whether this pattern exists elsewhere. It is also demonstrated that extinction rates in British butterflies are similar to those in a range of other insect groups over 100 years once recording bias is accounted for, although probably lower than in aquatic or parasitic taxa. It is concluded that butterflies represent adequate indicators of change for many terrestrial insect groups, but recommended that similar schemes be extended to other popular groups, especially dragonflies, bumblebees, hoverflies and ants. Given institutional backing, similar projects could be employed internationally and standardized. Finally, a range of schemes designed to monitor change in communities of aquatic macro-invertebrates is described. Although designed to use invertebrates as a bio-indicator of water quality for human use, these programmes could be extended to monitor the 20 10 biodiversity targets of the World Summit on Sustainable Development.

AB Human activities have severely affected the condition of freshwater ecosystems worldwide. Physical alteration, habitat loss, water withdrawal, pollution, overexploitation and the introduction of non-native species all contribute to the decline in freshwater species. Today, freshwater species are, in general, at higher risk of extinction than those in forests, grasslands and coastal ecosystems. For North America alone, the projected extinction rate for freshwater fauna is five times greater than that for terrestrial fauna-a rate comparable to the species loss in tropical rainforest. Because many of these extinctions go unseen, the level of assessment and knowledge of the status and trends of freshwater species are still very poor, with species going extinct before they are even taxonomically classified.
   Increasing human population growth and achieving the sustainable development targets set forth in 2002 will place even higher demands on the already stressed freshwater ecosystems, unless an integrated approach to managing water for people and ecosystems is implemented by a broad constituency. To inform and implement policies that support an integrated approach to water management, as well as to measure progress in halting the rapid decline in freshwater species, basin-level indicators describing the condition and threats to freshwater ecosystems and species are required. This paper discusses the extent and quality of data available on the number and size of populations of freshwater species, as well as the change in the extent and condition of natural freshwater habitats. The paper presents indicators that can be applied at multiple scales, highlighting the usefulness of using remote sensing and geographical information systems technologies to fill some of the existing information gaps. Finally, the paper includes an analysis of major data gaps and information needs with respect to freshwater species to measure progress towards the 2010 biodiversity targets.

AB Most of the world's biodiversity will continue to exist outside protected areas and there are also managed lands within many protected areas. In the assessment of millennium targets, there is therefore a need for indicators to measure biodiversity and suitability of habitats for biodiversity both across the whole landscape/seascape and in specific managed habitats. The two predominant land uses in many inhabited areas are forestry and agriculture and these are examined. Many national-level criteria and indicator systems already exist that attempt to assess biodiversity in forests and the impacts of forest management, but there is generally less experience in measuring these values in agricultural landscapes. Existing systems are reviewed, both for their usefulness in providing indicators and to assess the extent to which they have been applied. This preliminary gap analysis is used in the development of a set of indicators suitable for measuring progress towards the conservation of biodiversity in managed forests and agriculture. The paper concludes with a draft set of indicators for discussion, with suggestions including proportion of land under sustainable management, amount of produce from such land, area of natural or high quality semi-natural land within landscapes under sustainable management and key indicator species.

AB This paper discusses key issues in the science-policy interface. It stresses the importance of linking the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity to the Millennium Development Goals and to issues of immediate concern to policy-makers such as the economy, security and human health. It briefly discusses the process of decision-making and how the scientific and policy communities have successfully worked together on global environmental issues such as stratospheric ozone depletion and climate change, and the critical role of international assessments in providing the scientific basis for informed policy at the national and international level. The paper also discusses the drivers of global environmental change, the importance of constructing plausible futures, indicators of change, the biodiversity 2010 target and how environmental issues such as loss of biodiversity, stratospheric ozone depletion, land degradation, water pollution and climate change cannot be addressed in isolation because they are strongly interconnected and there are synergies and trade-offs among the policies, practices and technologies that are used to address these issues individually.

TI Organic farming: Its relevance to the Indian context

AB Increasing consciousness about conservation of environment as well as health hazards associated with agrochemicals and consumers' preference to safe and hazard-free food are the major factors that lead to the growing interest in alternate forms of agriculture in the world. Organic agriculture is one among the broad spectrum of production methods that are supportive of the environment. The demand for organic food is steadily increasing both in the developed and developing countries with an annual average growth rate of 20-25%. Organic agriculture, without doubt, is one of the fastest-growing sectors of agricultural production. However, there are certain issues that should be clarified before wego for a large-scale conversion to organic agriculture. The most important issues are Can organic farming produce enough food for everybody? Is it possibleto meet the nutrient requirements of crops entirely from organic sources? Arethere any significant environmental benefits that accrue front organic farming? Is the food produced by organic farming superior in quality? Is it economically feasible? In this article, we review these aspects of organic farming. InIndia, vast stretches of arable land, which are mainly rain-fed and found in the Northeastern region where negligible amount of fertilizers and pesticides are being used and have low productivity, could be exploited as potential areas for organic agriculture. Considering the potential environmental benefits oforganic production and its compatibility with integrated agricultural approaches to rural development, organic agriculture may be considered as a development vehicle for developing countries like India, in particular.

   MSY; blue crab; Chesapeake Bay
ID POPULATIONS
AB Relations between optimal yield and abundance in a fluctuating environment and conditions for a conservative level of harvest were obtained for the Fox surplus production model and compared with those for the logistic surplus production model. Environmental variation was included in the optimization of harvest with the Fox surplus production model to obtain a relation in which the maximum sustainable yield (MSY) and biomass at the MSY varied as the environment varied. The relation can be applied for management of fisheries at the optimum levels in a fluctuating environment. For both models there is only one maximum sustainable yield under equilibrium conditions, but in a variable environment the maximum sustainable yield and optimum biomass and effort vary as the environment varies. The results were applied to the blue crab (Callinectes sapidus) fishery of the Chesapeake Bay. Although several numerical results for the logistic and Fox models were similar, the parameter estimates were different and the Fox model predicted a much larger decrease in population abundance at the MSY Harvesting at a conservative level with either the Fox model or the logistic model could increase blue crab abundance substantially with little decrease in harvest. At a conservative level of harvest, there is a 20% increase in biomass with a 6% decrease in yield for the logistic model and a 37% increase in biomass with a 9% decrease in yield for the Fox model. Both the Fox and the logistic surplus production models indicate that the blue crab fishery has been consistently over harvested. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Integrating quantitative and qualitative methodologies for the

SO BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
AB Background: Due to the complexity of health system reform in the post-conflict, post-disaster, and development settings, attempts to restructure health services are fraught with pitfalls that are often unanticipated because of inadequate preliminary assessments. Our proposed Integrated Multimodal Assessment - combining quantitative and qualitative methodologies - may provide a more robust mechanism for identifying programmatic priorities and critical barriers for appropriate and sustainable health system interventions. The purpose of this study is to describe this novel multimodal assessment using emergency medicine in post-conflict Serbia as a model.
   Methods: Integrated quantitative and qualitative methodologies - system characterization and observation, focus group discussions, free-response questionnaires, and by-person factor analysis - were used to identify needs, problems, and potential barriers to the development of emergency medicine in Serbia. Participants included emergency and pre-hospital personnel from all emergency medical institutions in Belgrade.
   Results: Demographic data indicate a loosely ordered network of part-time emergency departments supported by 24-hour pre-hospital services and an academic emergency center. Focus groups and questionnaires reveal significant impediments to delivery of care and suggest development priorities. By-person factor analysis subsequently divides respondents into distinctive attitudinal types, compares participant opinions, and identifies programmatic priorities.
   Conclusions: By combining quantitative and qualitative methodologies, our Integrated Multimodal Assessment identified critical needs and barriers to emergency medicine development in Serbia and may serve as a model for future health system assessments in post-conflict, post-disaster, and development settings.

TI The economic value of stream restoration
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH

DT Article
AB The economic value of restoring Deckers Creek in Monongalia and Preston counties of West Virginia was determined from mail, Internet, and personal contact surveys. Multiattribute, choice experiments were conducted and nested logit models were estimated to derive the economic values of full restoration for three attributes of this creek: aquatic life, swimming, and scenic quality. Their relative economic values were that aquatic life > scenic quality approximate to swimming. These economic values imply that respondents had the highest value for aquatic life when fully restoring Deckers Creek to a sustainable fishery rather than a "put and take" fishery that cannot sustain fish populations. The welfare improvement estimates for full restoration of all three attributes ranged between $12 and $16 per month per household. Potential stream users (anglers) had the largest welfare gain from restoration, while nonangler respondents had the lowest. When these estimates were aggregated up to the entire watershed population, the benefit from restoration of Deckers Creek was estimated to be about $1.9 million annually. This benefit does not account for any economic values from partial stream restoration. On the basis of log likelihood tests of the nested logit models, two subsamples of the survey population (the general population and stream users) were found to be from the same population. Thus restoration choices by stream users may be representative of the watershed population, although the sample size of stream users was small in this research.

AB The annual increase in farmed freshwater prawn production in the world during the decade ending 2001 has been estimated as 29% and that during 1999-2001 as 48%, the production in 2001 being about 300 000 mt (all Macrobrachium species). Between 1999 and 2003 the annual increase in farmed Macrobrachium rosenbergii production in India was about 80%, production reaching 30 450 mt in 2002-2003. This log phase of production followed the rise and fall of shrimp farming in the country. Several shrimp farming ventures collapsed in the 1990s, owing to degraded environment and diseases, abetted by lack of awareness and inadequacy of information on the culture systems and their interactions with other human endeavours. This shrimp farming experience has made the aquafarmer and other stakeholders aware that while aquaculture has a high potential in ensuring food and nutritional security and livelihood, besides profit to the farmer and socio-economic benefits to local communities, it is likely to slip from sustainable development pathways if adequate understanding, improved management practices, governmental policies and plans for implementation and regulation to ensure sustainability are not in place. The lessons learned from shrimp farming can help in steering the development of sustainable freshwater prawn aquaculture in India and elsewhere.

AB A renewed interest in natural gap dynamics has developed from a recent focus on sustainable forestry in Europe. To improve. our understanding of the role of a canopy opening on the physical environment in a natural forest. a case study was undertaken in and around a gap in a semi-natural, beech-dominated (Fagus sylvatica L.) forest. spatial and temporal variations in photosynthetically active irradiance (I-P), soil and air temperature (T-S and T-A) and soil water content (SWC) were studied until the third growing season after natural formation of the gap.
   I-P was highest in the northern part of the gap and in the adjacent forest, particularly around mid-summer and on sunny days. when I-P was predominantly direct. Total Ip in the southern part of the gap and along Rap edges declined by about 19.6% from the first to the second year after gap formation, possibly due to growth of canopy and sub-canopy trees. Maximum and mean T-S were generally highest in the southern central part of the gap, and in late spring and summer also under the closed canopy east of the gap. The insulating effect of dense regeneration could to some extent explain the spatial variation of T-S. though this was not tested directly. SWC in the gap was near field capacity and generally higher than that under the closed canopy during summer. A decrease in SWC from the first to the second year after gap formation may have been attributed to released edge trees. although water use by the dense regeneration could not be ruled out.
   In general, the effect of this small irregular gap on light, soil and air temperature, and soil moisture was influenced by the considerable microsite variation. Furthermore, growth of regeneration and edge trees. resulting in increased interception, shading and water extraction by roots, may have modified the gap effect seen as early as the second year after gap formation.

AB Although mahogany, the most commercially important timber tree in Neotropical forests, is widely acknowledged to be threatened by unsustainable logging which does not provide for its regeneration. its fruiting dynamics are poorly understood. During each of six successive years, we measured tree diameters and counted woody fruit capsule segments that fell below the. crowns of 82 mahogany trees in natural forest in central Quintana Roo, Mexico. Sample trees ranged from <20 cm to more than 100 cm DBH. Fruit production increased with diameter, and trees greater than or equal to75 cm produced significantly more fruits each year than did trees of smaller diameters. Large trees could produce more than 700 fruits/year. Trees greater than or equal to75 cm DB H were also more consistent producers: while up to 27% of trees <75 cm DBH produced < 1 fruit/year in any year, at least 93% of larger trees produced fruit every year. Over the 6 years, individual trees greater than or equal to75 cm produced a total of 367 +/- 34 fruits. as compared to 91 +/- 8 fruits among trees <75 cm (an average of 61 +/- 7 and 15 +/- 2 fruits/year, respectively). However, the number of fruit produced per unit crown volume was not significantly different between the two size categories. Fruit production varied among years, with the highest production in 1998 and the lowest in 1999 and 2000. The population of sampled mahogany trees produced approximately three times more fruit, and individual trees produced up to five times more fruit, in the year of highest production, as compared to the lowest. Mahogany does not exhibit the fruit production patterns found in mast fruiting species. Inter-annual variability in size of fruit crops at both the population and individual-tree levels are lower than in masting species. and the synchronocity among trees was low. Basal area growth averaged 76.5 +/- 18.6 cm(2)/year for trees greater than or equal to75 cm and 29.9 +/- 1.7 cm2/year for trees <75 cm DBH, and varied significantly among years. Years of high fruit production were also years of good growth, implying "'resource matching" rather than the "resource switching" associated with masting. To ensure seed production for the regeneration of mahogany it is important to retain mahogany trees greater than or equal to75 cm DBH as seed sources. This presents a challenge, since currently mahogany trees in this region are harvested down to a minimum diameter as low as 55 cm. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The harvest of non-timber forest products (NTFPs) represents a significant source of income for hundreds of millions of people, and is promoted as a conservation and development strategy across the globe. Most research on NFTP management focuses on the dynamics of individuals within harvested populations, but the ways in which management may affect the dynamics of populations across a landscape and over time remain largely unexplored. Here, I use a metapopulation framework to assess the effects of management on populations of the fiber-harvested bromeliad, Aechinea magdalenae. in the Sierra Santa Marta, Mexico. Specifically, I quantify rates of colonization. extinction and growth as well as size structure of A. magdalenae populations from 1997 to 2003; and compare these variables between wild versus outplanted populations and between old-growth versus secondary forest populations. Over the 5-year study period, 42% of the 31 wild A. magdalenae populations went extinct due to anthropogenic fires and to ramet harvest for the creation of enrichment plantings. Significantly more secondary forest populations went extinct than old-growth forest populations. Sixty-two outplanted populations were created and in contrast to wild populations and despite harvest, these outplantings increased in size and none went extinct. The structure of wild populations shifted towards fewer populations with less rosettes but overall numbers and sizes of populations increased. These results illustrate the dynamic nature of A. magdalenae populations over both time and space and the ways in which the fates of populations depend on decisions made by harvesters at both the population and the landscape level. In this case, sustainable harvest of A. magdalenae does not necessarily ensure population persistence. Outplanting of A. magdelanae appears to be functioning as a very successful forest conservation strategy. Nonetheless, the conservation of at least some mid populations may be required to ensure long-term survival of this species in this region. Metapopulation approaches may provide an important compliment to demographic studies of A. magdalenae and other NTFP. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Widespread concern about the sustainability of clearcut regeneration systems has led to the increased use of partial retention systems in British Columbia. In particular, uncertainty surrounds the relative performance of tree species of different shade tolerance, prompting increasing interest in seedling response to a range of light environments. Even more uncertainty surrounds, our understanding of the development of trees in partially cut stands infected with the root diseases. Armillaria ostoyae (Romagnesi) and Inontus tomentosus (Fr.Fr) S. Teng. We compared light retention (25% of the original basal area). heavy, retention (50% of the original basal area) and clearcut treatments at two sites. A root removal technique (pushover falling) was used for root disease mitigation. Light levels were measured using hemispherical photography. Growth rate increased as the level of canopy openness increased, but did not vary among species differing in shade tolerance. The root removal treatment. by contrast, had no effect on seedling survival after 5 years. Development and expression of the root diseases over the longer term may alter these results. Our findings demonstrate that a variety of partial retention systems can be used to regenerate mixed species forests in the Interior Cedar Hemlock zone. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Fragmented developed areas usually support source-sink patches for invasive organisms in urban landscapes. Invasive plants that have a different origin than the spreading source have an important role in artificial landscape restoration in degraded areas. However, many alien plant species have invaded the original habitat or ecosystem of native plants; sequentially their fast growing populations colonize neighboring ecosystems easily. Biological contamination sometimes occurs, unbalancing biodiversity in the natural landscape system. Therefore, long-term monitoring for dynamic communities after restoration in urban areas is indispensable for establishing a strategy for sustainable urban management. Under this principle we have examined the spreading of representative naturalized plant species according to recent land use changes. In this study, we have selected two representative invasive plants, Robinia pseudoacacia and Eupatorium rugosum. Their distribution pattern and patch characteristics of population were identified by the data of Seoul Biotope Map and a field survey. As a result of GIS-aided analysis of landscape patches, these two species often occurred in the same place. Concentration patterns of population distribution were found in forest edges disturbed by development of roads and human settlement. Especially, Eupatorium rugosum had extended to inner forest patches although the individuals were scattered. Distribution patterns of those species were partly related to landscape indices such as patch size and shape of the forest edge. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We developed a habitat model for Great Tits, Parus major minor, in an urban area of Osaka, Japan. Although Great Tits play an important role in the urban food web, there are few in most of Osaka and downtown Tokyo, areas that have low vegetation cover. We derived a habitat model for Great Tits using a logistic regression model with GIs. A bird survey was conducted twice in 85 urban parks using the line census method in the breeding season, May-July 2000. A GIs base map was created from aerial photographs. The following variables were measured for each park from public records and GIs for predicting the habitat: park properties (age, distance to the nearest mountains, distance to the nearest forest of more than 10 ha), the number of other habitats occupied by the tits within 500 m and 1 km and area of tree cover (within it and surrounding parks). Number of nearby habitats and distance from the nearest mountains and forest of more than 10 ha are variables related to the regional populations of the tits. Area of tree cover was measured for five radii (50, 100, 150, 200, 250 m) from park centers, and a logistic regression model was calculated for each of these radii. Variables were selected by a stepwise method. The best fitting model of the five models was selected using Akaike's Information Criteria. In the bird survey, the tit was recorded in 12 parks. The areas of parks occupied by the tit were 0.56-136.0 ha (mean: 26.0 ha +/- 42.06 S.D., n = 12). Variables selected in the best fitting model were area of tree cover in a radius of 250 m from park center and the number of other habitats within 1 km as positive factors. This model shows that area of tree cover within a certain range and number of nearby populations are the keys to the distribution of Great Tits. From this model obtained, 6.0 ha (31%), 4.0 ha (20%), 2.6 ha (13%) and 1.8 ha (9%) of tree area are needed to achieve probability of 0.5 in a radius of 250 m when numbers of other habitats within 1 km was 0-3, respectively. A realistic target figure is 10% of tree cover throughout urban areas to create an ecologically sustainable city. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This industrial residue is the woody endocarp of the almond fruits. This material is normally incinerated or dumped without control. Almond shell used (100% pure) as growing media can be more ecologically-friendly and less expensive than traditional rockwool since it can be locally produced. Three commercially produced random samples of two different textures and two volumes (19 and 25 L) were evaluated as growing media for soilless production. Three experiments were conducted to evaluate the effects of volume and texture and to compare this substrate with rockwool in terms of yield and quality characteristics of fruits in melon and tomato culture. The physical, physico-chemical and chemical properties studied did not differ significantly between both textures. Tomato plants grown in almond shell residue used 21 % less water compared to rockwool over the course of production. We found non-limiting in comparison to rockwool for melon and tomato crops in relation to fertigation parameters, water uptake and yield. Significant differences of yield were found when we used the big size, specially in melon crop where commercial yield and soluble solids of plants growing on 25 L bags was higher than that on small one. The results suggested that almond shells seem to be an acceptable growing media as rockwool substitute for soilless vegetable production. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Chifin and chitosan are biopolymers from renewable resources, obtainable from shells of shellfish, the wastes of the seafood industry. Their distinctive advantages include availability, biocompatibility, biodegradability, nontoxicity, antimicrobial properties, heavy metal ions chelation, gel forming properties, ease of chemical modification, and high affinity to proteins. Owing to these characteristics, the polymers, thus far underutilized, are predicted to be widely exploited in the near future in environmentally benign applications, notably in systems working in biological environments. This paper looks at how chitin/chitosan materials can contribute to the development of membrane-based processes, particularly to those classified as supportive of the sustainability of our life, i.e. controlled release, biosensors, tissue engineering, and the ones contributing to cleaner industries, a cleaner environment, and cleaner water and food.

AB The container-breeding mosquito, Aedes aegypti, is the major global vector of dengue viruses, causing around 50 million infections annually. We have developed-a mosquito control strategy, incorporating four elements: (1) a combined vertical and horizontal approach that depends on community understanding; (2) prioritised control according to the larval productivity of major habitat types; (3) use of predacious copepods of the genus Mesocyclops as a biological control agent; delivered by (4) community activities of health volunteers, schools, and the public.. We have previously reported that, from 1998 to 2003, community-based vector control had resulted in A aegypti elimination in six of nine communes, with only small numbers of larvae detected in the others. Here, we report eradication in two further communes and, as a result of local expansion after the project in three northern provinces, elimination from 32 of 37 communes (309 730 people). As a result, no dengue cases have been detected in any commune since 2002. These findings suggest that this strategy is sustainable in Vietnam and applicable where the major sources of A aegypti are large water storage containers.

AB Understanding the biophysical foundation of agroecosystems is critical to achieve sustainable results. This paper focuses on the efficient flow of materials within an agroecosystem from cropping to livestock-raising and endeavours to establish a functional model of the relationship between motive power and resistance with efficiency measured in terms of material flow within the system. An efficiency constant (K) was created by modeling five integrated factors in the cultivation-husbandry system: single-harvest yield, multiple crop index, waste of forage, feed conversion ratio and circulation volume. Results of a test modeling of K at three sites in north China indicate that small scale agroecosystems are sensitive to material flows and the resulting pressure such flows place on system efficiency.

AB The validity of the modifications in the source code of EPIC for simulation of crop development in semiarid conditions, described in de Barros et al. [de Barros, I., Williams, J.R., Gaiser, T. Modeling soil nutrient limitations to crop production in semiarid NE of Brazil with a modified EPIC version. I - Changes in the source code of the model. Ecol. Modell., submitted for publication] was tested against the results of 3 years, field experiment with nutrient omission using intercropping between maize and cowpea. The plant biomass production, grain yield, N, P, and K uptake by both crops were measured during the period of 1998-2000 and compared with simulated values. Reasonably good agreement and accuracy was obtained between the measured and simulated values for all evaluated parameters.
   Slight overestimation of grain yield by the simulations was attributed to high rates of floral abortion caused by dry spells during the flowering periods of 1998 and 1999, since this factor is not considered in the model yet. Improvements of the accuracy of the model may also be obtained by more comprehensive understanding of soil resource use by component plants in mixed cropping systems. Therefore, it is necessary to generate more knowledge about the partitioning of the resources by the crops before being incorporated into modeling approaches.
   The model was sensitive to climate variations and changes in soil chemical properties due to the application of fertilizers and/or lime under the tropical semiarid conditions of the NE of Brazil. Once calibrated and validated for different crops and soil types of this region, the model will be appropriate as tool for regional planning. (C) 2004, Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The current population, necessitates the assessment of farming practices. This is particularly critical in the North China Plain, which is the food bowl of the country. This study assesses the economic, environmental and socio-institutional aspects of the major cropping systems in the NCP, based on selected site-specific indicators and their established threshold limits. Necessary information for this study was obtained through a survey of 270 farm households from four villages in Ningjin County, soil sample analysis, chemical tests of nitrate concentration in groundwater and crop plants, field observation and discussions with key informants, as well as official reports and publications. The findings of the analysis revealed all cropping systems in the study area are economically viable. However, such achievements have been made at a cost to the environment, degradation of natural resources and risk to human health. The real costs of environmental degradation are mounting, taking the forms of groundwater depletion, soil salinization and compaction, and land subsidence over the decades, as well as nitrate contamination in groundwater and agro-products, farmers' sickness, and loss of insect and pest predators. Sensitivity analysis shows that crop production reacts sensitively to,changes of output price and in input costs, which implies an unstable production situation in a long period. Only about 6% of the surveyed farm households applied the recommendations of the corresponding agents for balanced input use. The study stresses that farming practices, which are economically viable, should not be promoted at the cost of the environment, otherwise, it would cause acute damage to the environmental and economic loss for the future. Several recommendations have been outlined for the promotion of sustainable cropping systems in the NCP (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A study on resource acquisition and availability was carried out in an Indonesian village in relation to small-scale dairy production system. Despite the important role of local biological resources in providing low cost inputs like forages and firewood, lack of privately owned source of inputs among the majority of dairy farmers has resulted in great dependency on imported resources. The study indicates that forest and plantations are major source of diverse plant species of various nutritive values to fulfil the need of forages. Energetic analysis suggests that the contribution of imported energy is higher than that provided from local resources. A total of 96.4 x 10(6) kcal is estimated to enter a typical dairy farm annually; only about 22% of the energy originated from local resources. Dairy farm operation produced a by-product mainly in the form of fresh manure equivalent to about 21.5 x 10(9) kcal per year, but its use is still limited. This waste is in fact an important local resource that could support the establishment of sustainable agricultural practice within the context of crop-animal-based production systems and rural energy development.

TI What's community got to do with it? Implementation models of syringe
   exchange programs
SO AIDS EDUCATION AND PREVENTION
LA English
DT Article
AB Syringe exchange programs (SEPs) have been shown to be highly effective in reducing HIV transmission among injection drug users (IDUs). Despite this evidence, SEPs have not been implemented in many communities experiencing HIV epidemics among IDUs. We interviewed 17 key informants in nine U.S. cities to identify factors and conditions that facilitated or deterred the adoption of SEPs. Cities were selected to represent diversity in size, geographic location, AIDS incidence rates, and SEP implementation. Key informants included HIV prevention providers, political leaders, community activists, substance use and AIDS researchers, and health department directors. SEPs were established by one or more of three types of implementation models: (a) broad community coalition support, (b) community activist initiative, and (c) top-down decision making by government authorities. In each model, coalition budding and community consultation were critical steps for the acceptance and sustainability of SEPs. When others were not prepared to act, community activists spearheaded SEP development, taking risks in the face of opposition, but often lacked the resources to sustain their efforts. Leadership from politicians and public health officials provided needed authority, clout, and access to resources. Researchers and scientific findings lent force and legitimacy to the effort. Rather than adopting adversarial positions, successful SEP implementers worked with or avoided the opposition. Fear of repercussions and lack of leadership were the greatest barriers to implementing SEPs. Communities that successfully implemented SEPs were those with activists willing to push, the agenda, public officials willing to exercise leadership, researchers able to present authoritative findings, and proponents who effectively mobilized resources and worked to build community coalitions, using persistent but nonadversarial advocacy.

DE formal legal objectives of forest funding; pan European criteria of
   Sustainable Forest Management; cross country analysis; forest funding in
   Europe
AB The study bases on the question about the "right" way of funding of forestry, e.g. the question about the "right" objectives forest policy should serve. Beside these considerations, the question about the "right" amount of funding and the question about effectiveness and efficiency of funding stand in the center of attention. These questions are of special relevance if put in the context of comparative analysis in the field of assessment of funding of forestry in Europe.
   When looking at forest funding programmes in Europe it becomes obvious that formal objectives of almost all funding programmes are generally formulated rather vague and do not relate to precise qualitative or quantitative goals. The purposes of this study was to apply a method that allows a cross country analysis of the objectives of forest funding programmes.
   The method applied in this approach consists of three steps: first, an identification and clarification of the objectives of forest funding programmes, second, an allocation of the programmes and the respective funding volumes to the Pan-European Criteria of Sustainable Forest Management (tab. 1) and, third, a comparative interpretation of the relative importance of economic, ecological and social objectives of forest funding.
   The results of the cross country analysis (fig. 1-8, tab. 2-9) show, that in some countries the funding programmes and the respective funding volumes may be allocated rather evenly to the Pan-European criteria. The interpretation is that these countries aim at promoting a multifunctional forestry. In other countries there seems to be a tendency towards strengthening economic efficiency of timber production whereas in a third type of countries forest funding primarily serves ecological or social objectives.
   These results are discussed in the light of the economic, ecological, and social importance of forests that may differ significantly in the countries considered. The analysis helps to improve the understanding of different forest funding policies in Europe, by making the differences and deficits transparent and by pointing out options.

AB The extensive data on the relationship between parasite genotype and susceptibility to antifolate drugs can now be coupled with pharmacokinetic information to allow construction of models of the selection and spread of antifolate-resistant Plasmodium? falciparum. In this report, we have modeled the effect on resistance selection processes of combinations of antifolate antimalarial drugs with artesunate and with amodiaquine under a variety of conditions that can be defined by the user. The model is intended to assist policymakers in forecasting the useful therapeutic life (UTL) for a rang, e of potential combination treatments. The model is especially designed for use by African malaria programs so that the interactions of key variables can be explored and appropriate combinations of drugs can be chosen for field testing. The model provides some important general conclusions: 1) for optimal extension of UTL, combination therapy must be deployed before either constituent drug is used as monotherapy; 2) even short periods of monotherapy can severely limit the usefulness of subsequent combination therapy; and 3) that adding a second drug to rescue an antifolate antimalarial that is overtly failing is an inappropriate and ultimately wasteful exercise.

AB Large carnivores have declined worldwide, largely through conflict with people. Here, we quantify the impact of lethal control, associated with livestock depredation, on a population of African lions (Panthera leo) living outside protected areas. Farmers shot lions only in response to livestock attacks. Nevertheless, adult mortality was high and a simple model predicted that the population was marginally stable or slowly declining. Mortality was four times higher among lions radio-collared in association with attacks on livestock, than among lions with no known history of stock killing, suggesting that some animals were habitual stock killers. Known stock killers also experienced lower reproductive success; hence there was strong artificial selection against stock-killing behaviour. In addition, mortality was higher among lions whose home ranges overlapped a property where non-traditional livestock husbandry was associated with chronic depredation by lions. This 180 km(2) ranch acted as a sink that directly affected lions over more than 2000 km(2) and may have undermined the viability of the study population. Our results suggest that sustainable coexistence of lions and people demands livestock husbandry that effectively deters predators from acquiring stock-killing behaviour, but that lethal control may play an important role in avoiding the spread of such behaviours through the population.

AB Insight regarding the genetic origin and composition of the studied population of the red-legged partridge (Alectoris rufa) is likely to provide general and critical information for the appropriate management and possible conservation of the species. The reintroduced population of red-legged partridges living in Pianosa Island (National Park Tuscany Archipelago) has proven to be sustainable: captive-bred individuals, morphologically assigned to the taxon A. rufa, were released to the island approximately 20 years ago, establishing an apparently well-adapted population. We have investigated this population by means of 10 microsatellite loci in order to shed light on its genetic structure. Considering that A. rufa is known to crossbreed with A. chukar, the Pianosa Island population was compared at the molecular level with a red-legged partridge breeding stock (Aulla, MS) as well as with a population of pure A. chukar. Our results indicate that the red-legged partridge population from Pianosa, morphologically identified as A. rufa, is actually partly introgressed with A. chukar, questioning its genetic purity and the possible use of this population as a starting stock for future reintroductions elsewhere.

AB Comprehensive information of mangrove genetic resources is requisite for developing strategies for their effective conservation and sustainable use. Genetic diversity within and among populations of a widespread viviparous mangrove Ceriops decandra was determined using inter-simple sequence repeat (ISSR). Ten natural populations were collected from Malay Peninsula and North Australia. At the species level, high genetic variation was detected (P = 72%, HE = 0.253, and I = 0.379). The estimate of G(ST) was 0.882, indicating a high level of genetic differentiation among populations. When populations were grouped according to geographic regions, i.e., East Malaya, West Malaya, Southmost Malaya, and North Australia, AMOVA suggested that most of the total variation (87%) was accounted for by differentiation between regions, with only 4% accounting for variation among populations within regions, and a further 9% partitioned among individuals within a population. A UPGMA dendrogram based on genetic distance revealed a deep split between populations from the eastern Indian Ocean and all others from the western Pacific Ocean, which may result from the historical lowering of sea level at these regions during the recent Pleistocene glaciations. An understanding of the genetic structure of C. decandra provides insight for the conservation and management of this species. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Bacterial hydrogenases have been harnessed to the removal of heavy metals from solution by reduction to less soluble metal species. For Pd(II), its bioreduction results in the deposition of cell-bound Pd(0)-nanoparticles that are ferromagnetic and have a high catalytic activity. Hydrogenases can also be used synthetically in the production of hydrogen from sugary wastes through breakdown of formate produced by fermentation. The Bio-H-2 produced can be used to power an electrical device using a fuel cell to provide clean electricity. Production of hydrogen from confectionery wastes by one organism (Escherichia coli) can be used as the electron donor for the production of Bio-Pd-0 from soluble Pd(II) by a second organism. The resulting Bio-Pd-0 can then be used as a bioinorganic catalyst in the remediation of Cr(VI)-contaminated solutions or polychlorinated biphenyls at the expense of Bio-H-2, as a hydrogenation catalyst for industry of as a component of a fuel cell electrode.

AB American ginseng, Panax quinquefolius L., is one of the most heavily traded medicinal plants in North America. The effect of harvest on genetic diversity in ginseng was measured with a single generation culling simulation program. Culling scenarios included random harvest at varying levels, legal limit random harvest and legal limit mature plant harvest. The legal limit was determined by the proportion of legally harvestable plants per population (% mature plants per population). Random harvest at varying levels resulted in significant loss of genetic diversity, especially allelic richness. Relative to initial levels, average within-population genetic diversity (H-e) was significantly lower when plants were culled randomly at the legal limit ( Mann - Whitney U = 430, p< 0.001) or when only mature plants were culled ( Mann - Whitney U = 394, p< 0.01). Within-population genetic diversity was significantly higher with legal limit mature plant harvest (H-e = 0.068) than when plants were culled randomly at the legal limit (H-e = 0.064; U = 202, p< 0.01). Based on these simulations of harvest over one generation, we recommend that harvesting fewer than the proportion of mature plants could reduce the negative genetic effects of harvest on ginseng populations.

AB Several predator species at risk of extinction in Southwestern Europe are dependent on the population density of European wild rabbits Oryctolagus cuniculus. Rabbit populations in the region, however, have recently undergone dramatic decreases in population density, which may be exacerbated by hunting. Current hunting policies set the autumn-winter season, just before the start of rabbit reproduction, as the main hunting season, and previous theoretical models have estimated that the current hunting season may have the greatest negative impact on rabbit abundance and should be changed. We utilised a model for rabbit population dynamics to determine the effects of the timing of hunting during two seasons, summer and autumn, on the tendency of rabbit populations to be over-harvested and on the number of rabbits hunted. This model included field estimates of age- and sex-selection biases of hunting by shotgun. Scenarios with different hunting rates and sex- and age-selection probabilities of hunting were simulated for populations with different turnover levels and with and without compensatory mortality mechanisms. Field estimations showed that hunting in summer was juvenile-biased whereas autumn hunting was juvenile- and male-biased. In contrast to previous findings, our modelling results suggested that hunting in autumn may be the most conservative option for harvesting of rabbit populations, since these populations were more prone to be over-harvested during the summer. The differences between the two seasons in number of rabbits hunted were dependent on population dynamics and hunting sex- and age-selection probabilities. Our findings suggest that altering of current hunting policies would not optimise the exploitation or conservation of wild rabbit populations, but that the latter may be improved by some changes in the timing of hunting.

TI Fertility and hatchability in RIR and WL breeds as functionally modified
   by crossing them in alternate sex combinations (Gallus domesticus)
SO BRITISH POULTRY SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
ID WEIGHT-LOSS
AB 1. Four breeding groups of Rhode Island Red and White Leghorn domestic fowl (RIR (female) x RIR (male), RIR (female) x WL (male), WL (female) x RIR (male) and WL (female) x WL (male)) were compared for fertility, hatchability, and their post-insemination sustainability, egg weight loss during incubation and uncovered yolk in abdominal cavity of dead in shell in order to understand the problems associated with the RIR breed in these respects.
   2. Crossing RIR (female) with WL (male) or in reverse sex combinations did not improve fertility in comparison to pure RIR chickens and all these groups were less fertile than the pure WL.
   3. Unlike fertility, hatchability in RIR improved with the change to either sex partner of the WL breed but the WL (female) x RIR (male) combination was similar to the pure WL (97.72 and 97.12%, respectively). In contrast, crossing RIR (female) with WL (male) resulted in an improvement (86.67%) as compared to pure RIR (76.67%) but still lower than the pure WL and WL (female) x RIR (male) cross.
   4. Egg weight loss during incubation was more (20.16%) in pure RIR as compared to RIR (female) x WL (male) (17.13%), followed by WL (female) x RIR (male) (10.28%) and pure WL (9.57%).
   5. There were more dead-in-shell embryos with yolks outside their abdominal cavity in pure RIR and their crosses as compared to pure WL breeds.
   6. Fertility was sustained for longer in WL than other combinations with post-artificial insemination using constant number of spermatozoa. Fertility after a week of insemination tended to decrease more rapidly than hatchability on a fertile egg basis.
   7. It is concluded that both sexes are responsible for the poor fertility in RIR but the female is responsible for poor hatchability and this poor performance is mainly due to greater egg weight loss during incubation.

TI Evacuation with smoke control for atria in green and sustainable
   buildings
SO BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
DE green and sustainable building; atrium; fire safety; evacuation; smoke
   exhaust
AB The concepts of green buildings and sustainable buildings are promoted actively in the developed countries. Targets are on protecting the environment, using less energy through natural ventilation provisions and daylight utilization, developing better waste management and taking water conservation into account. Architectural and building design, electrical and mechanical systems, and building management have to be upgraded.
   However, there are problems in dealing with fire safety, especially in complying with the existing prescriptive fire codes. An obvious example leading to hot arguments is the green or sustainable buildings with an atrium. Smoke spreading would give problems and evacuation design under smoke was identified to be a key issue. Providing more emergency exits might give a faster evacuation time, but would give security problems.
   An alternative solution is to install a smoke management system to keep the smoke layer high. Better designs can be achieved by integrating the evacuation time with the smoke filling time under different scenarios. Evacuation design can be improved by installing a smoke exhaust system. System performance by fire safety management would provide adequate safety. This point will be demonstrated in this paper.

AB Canada exhibits high per capita energy consumption. This paper examines energy use in Canada by region and sector, focusing on four sectors most relevant to civil engineering activities: residential, commercial-institutional, construction, and transportation. Environmental impacts associated with major energy sources including coal, petroleum products, natural gas and electricity are reviewed. The relationships between energy consumption and infrastructure design are analysed. Opportunities for reductions are identified in building design, water and waste-water systems, urban form, and transportation. Large improvements in commercial and residential energy efficiency can be achieved through the implementation of existing technologies in building upgrades, retrofits, and rebuilds. Increasing surface albedos and more extensive use of vegetative shading and consideration of the geometric properties of urban canyons and their microclimatic effects also allow for considerable energy savings. The incorporation of mixed-modal transit, walking and cycling paths, and community-scale design as elements of long-term transportation planning and the development of alternative transportation technologies have the potential to considerably reduce per capita energy use. The development and implementation of alternative energy supply technologies include energy recovery from waste-water treatment.

AB The environmental and human health impacts of engineering activities have reshaped the way engineers make decisions. Increasingly, engineering decision-making is taking into consideration the full life cycle implications of engineering activities. This paper details the development and application of a national economic input-output-based life cycle assessment model, a tool for guiding engineering decision-making, for the Canadian economy. The model consists of 61 industries and 103 commodities and incorporates economic and environmental-resource data, including marginal resource consumption, energy use, releases of National Pollutant Release Inventory compounds, and emissions of greenhouse gases. The model is useful for evaluating various development strategies and analyzing the potential direct and indirect impacts of alternative public policies on the Canadian economy and environment. The model is applied to various sectors of the Canadian economy, and the life-cycle implications of demands for different commodities are determined, including demand for electricity and construction materials for highway design.

ID DECISION-MAKING
AB Much of the focus on sustainable infrastructure has concentrated on buildings and construction processes. To advance this thinking for other civil infrastructure systems (CIS), this paper outlines a framework that uses a set of proposed indicators to measure the sustainability of chosen infrastructure options and help select the preferred alternative in a multiobjective decision approach. Physically implementing "sustainable infrastructure" involves three life stages for any project: preproject planning, project implementation, and ongoing operations. It is critical to evaluate the sustainability of chosen options in each of these life stages. This research develops two categories of indicators, mandatory screening indicators (MSI) and judgment indicators (JI), and a multilayer approach for incorporating these indicators. A normalization procedure has been adapted to work within the framework to help compare alternatives across a range of indicators and different orders of data magnitude. A hypothetical example using a transmission line corridor is presented to illustrate how the framework can be applied.

AB This paper details the role of infrastructure in promoting sustainability at the neighbourhood scale. A sustainable neighbourhood design process is outlined and the importance of adopting a systems perspective and considering infrastructure interconnections is emphasized. The performance of local infrastructure systems (e.g., buildings and local transportation network) is influenced by interactions with the greater urban region and with other local infrastructure. Through a broad review of the literature on transportation, water, building, and urban forestry systems, this paper identifies many of these extra- and inter-neighbourhood interactions. The paper concludes that it is difficult to achieve neighbourhood sustainability objectives without infrastructure systems at the urban scale that support these micro-scale goals. Furthermore, interactions between local infrastructure systems can have a positive or negative impact on infrastructure performance and environmental impacts. Careful consideration of these relationships during neighbourhood design could yield significant improvements in infrastructure resource efficiency as well as reductions in pollutant emissions and overall costs.

AB This paper presents a semantic framework for supporting the cost-benefit analysis in urban transit rehabilitation decisions. The use of semantic representations of decision parameters allows for more effective knowledge management practice and easier accumulation and access of corporate knowledge regarding balancing traditional construction investments with the costs to the environment, local business, and impacts on traffic. A sample illustrative case was considered by this study. It includes a comparison of a hypothetical scenario of building a monorail to replace an existing streetcar in one of Toronto's most congested streets: King Street. A microscopic simulation model for the King Street route has been developed and used in comparing the status quo to the proposed scenario in terms of impacts on traffic performance. A cost-benefit analysis has been conducted to assess the feasibility of both options. The study investigated direct costs such as monorail construction cost, streetcar system removal cost, and operating and maintenance costs of both systems. The sustainability-related costs included user costs and accident costs.

AB Research in the area of sustainable urban infrastructure reflects the need to design and manage engineering systems in light of both environmental and socioeconomic considerations. A principal challenge for the engineer is the development of practical tools for measuring and enhancing the sustainability of urban infrastructure over its life cycle. The present study develops such a framework for the sustainability assessment of urban infrastructure systems. The framework focuses on key interactions and feedback mechanisms between infrastructure and surrounding environmental, economic, and social systems. One way of understanding and quantifying these interacting effects is through the use of sustainability criteria and indicators. A generic set of sustainability criteria and subcriteria and system-specific indicators is put forward. Selected indicators are quantified in a case study of the urban water system of the City of Toronto, Ontario, Canada.

AB In suburban areas, traffic issues are generally related to elevated speeds and volumes and a perceived reduction in personal safety. In response, traffic engineers have designed and implemented a variety of traffic calming measures for local and collector streets, with significant speed reductions and other benefits. Less common are measures to address traffic issues on arterials which (if implemented) might reduce speeds, thereby encouraging more sustainable transportation modes and lessening automobile dependence. A geographic information system (GIS) based tool has been developed to provide decision support for the development of neighbourhood traffic calming plans for all street types. This tool is potentially useful because of the increased use of traffic calming measures and the growing public desire for safer streets. Decision support (provided by the tool) is dependent upon measured or perceived problems, roadway type, and user objectives, as well as the potential impacts and current installation costs of traffic calming measures. An application to suburban Hamilton demonstrates the functionality of this tool.

ID CEMENT
AB Portland cement production in Canada increased from 1.7 million tonnes in 1946 to more than 13 million tonnes in 2002. Although the industry is a major player in meeting infrastructural needs of Canadians, it is also a major user of natural resources such as water, natural minerals, and aggregates. Moreover, for each tonne of cement clinker produced, 1 t of CO2 is released into the atmosphere. At the same time, Canada produces nearly 5 million tonnes of fly ash each year, and yet the use of fly ash as cement replacement remains dismally low at around 17%. It is believed that through product and process innovations, more fly ash can be used in concrete, thus preserving natural resources, reducing CO2 emissions, and helping Canada meet the requirements of the Kyoto Protocol. Forecasting the future impact of using fly ash in concrete has been based on qualitative and linear estimates, however, without accounting for the complexity of the problem and its dynamic feedbacks. In this paper, a novel application of system dynamics modeling, a feedback-based object-oriented modeling paradigm, is proposed to create a rational model that departs from current approaches used in modeling CO2 emissions of cement production. The model accounts for the various enablers and barriers for using fly ash in concrete, including market dynamics and technology development. It allows the user to test a wide variety of scenarios and policies, its flexible architecture permits coupling it with general economic or service life models, and its modular nature allows expanding its boundaries to include other facets of the holistic CO2 emissions problem in Canada.

ID ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT; INSURANCE; PRODUCTS
AB At present, the performance of sustainable technologies in buildings is generally not assessed holistically, but rather from a primarily single issue perspective, e.g., only financially or environmentally. Such an approach is limited in that it ignores the interaction of the technologies within the physical facility itself as expressed through life cycle costs, the impact on the surrounding environment, design objectives of the project and its stakeholders whose value systems may conflict. This work identifies the primary cause-and-effect relationships of selected sustainable building technologies and illustrates elements of a framework for the systematic assessment of their performance from an environmental, social, economic, and technical perspective. Rooftop garden technology is used to demonstrate application of the framework. The primary goal of this work is to improve the understanding and decision-making capabilities of the building industry and government when faced with decisions regarding investment and policy regarding sustainable building technologies. A secondary goal is to identify knowledge gaps in our understanding of sustainable technologies.

ID MODEL
AB The mining of oil sands in northern Alberta leaves behind large open pits, tailings, and overburden piles in which the surface and subsurface hydrology has been completely disrupted. Extensive reclamation work is required to reconstruct the entire landscape and reestablish the various elements of the hydrologic cycle. Syncrude Canada Ltd. has established a series of small instrumented watersheds in a reclaimed overburden pile at the Mildred Lake mine in northern Alberta, Canada, to test the sustainability of different reclamation strategies. The purpose of these field sites is to assess the performance of different reclamation strategies and track the evolution of the reclaimed landscape with time. The saline-sodic shale overburden has been covered with different (in type and depth) soil layers to provide sufficient moisture storage for vegetation while minimizing runoff and salt transport into the cover from the underlying overburden shale. In this paper, a system dynamics watershed model (SDWM) is developed to simulate one of the reconstructed watersheds and assess its ability to provide common watershed functions. The model is at an early stage, but preliminary results point to the potential of the system dynamics approach in simulating watersheds and testing different scenarios. The tested reclamation strategy seems to be satisfactory within a certain range of hydrologic conditions. Further validation of the SDWM is required, however, before relying on its results for decision support with regard to reclamation strategies.

AB Beijing is located in a semiarid region, and water shortage is a common problem in the city. Along with the rapid increase in water demand, due to fast socioeconomic development and an increase in population, a shortage of water resources and a deterioration of the water environment have become obstacles to sustainable socioeconomic development in Beijing. In the long run, sustainable water resources management, water conservation, and completion of the south to north water diversion project will solve the problem. This paper introduces the water resources situation in Beijing; analyzes future water demand; and discusses the actions of water saving, nontraditional water resources exploitation, wetland construction, and water environment protection. The paper also explains the importance of the south to north water diversion project and the general layout of the water supply strategy, water distribution system, and methods to efficiently use the diverted water in Beijing.

AB Petroleum sludge is a complex mixture of hydrocarbons, water, metals, and suspended fine solids. The objective of this research was to develop a technique that will lead to the separation of phases ready for further reuse. A study was carried out to investigate a combination of various systems of electrokinetic cells, to which oily sludge, conditioning liquids, and different electrical potentials were applied. The developed electrokinetic phase separation is a new cost-effective technology, which in turn will permit the revitalization of petroleum sludge. This method can significantly reduce the amount of wasted sludge and can recover new fuels free of metals and water. Life cycle analysis of the recovered fuel shows that a new petroleum waste management protocol might reduce emissions of major greenhouse gases such as CO2, CH4, and N2O by 40 026 000, 1057, and 566 kg, respectively, per refinery per year.

DE sustainable development; civil; engineering; infrastructure; innovation;
   creative destruction; environment; collaboration
AB The engineering community at large, and the civil engineering community in particular, has the opportunity and arguably the obligation to promote a development agenda that considers not only the economics of development, but also the health of the environment and society at large. In this paper, we contemplate the challenge of sustainable development and its effect on project scale and scope. We discuss the inherent opportunity to drive the "creative destruction" of the development industry, using innovation to exploit inefficiencies in the planning and management of engineering systems to create a range of "future" products and services that challenge existing practice. We review the impact of procurement policy, contract pricing, prescriptive codes, and public policy on innovation. Several examples of innovative design and sustainable development introduced into the planning and management of Canadian civil engineering projects are provided. We assert that the most effective means of promoting the sustainability of built environment and civil infrastructure systems will be through inter- and intra-industry collaboration with the support of public policy-makers.

AB In the ongoing discussion about sustainable forestry, gap regeneration is suggested to reduce nitrate (NO3-) losses from forest ecosystems. The effect of gap formation and gap size on soil moisture and NO3- leaching was studied in two managed beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) stands in Denmark for about 2 years after formation of four gaps (approx. 20 and 30 m in diameter). Soil moisture content, soil solution NO3-N concentrations, and nitrogen (N) concentrations in throughfall and precipitation were measured along transects from the gaps into the surrounding forests. Losses of NO3-N were estimated using the water balance model WATBAL. Soil moisture content in gaps remained close to field capacity throughout the year, while it decreased to 50%-70% of field capacity under the closed canopy during the growing season. Drainage water fluxes, soil solution NO3-N concentrations, and NO3-N losses were increased in the gaps as compared to under the canopy. For the whole study period, losses of NO3-N were 3- to 13-fold higher in the gaps than in the surrounding forests. However, a significant effect of gap size was not found within the range of the investigated gap diameters and canopy heights. Presumably, not only the aboveground canopy gaps, but also the belowground root gaps affected soil moisture and thus drainage water fluxes and NO3- losses.

TI Should sustained yield be part of sustainable forest management?
SO CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID ECONOMIC-ANALYSIS; POLICY; EFFICIENCY
AB This paper considers the question of whether sustainable forest management (SFM) should continue to incorporate sustained yield (SY) requirements, as it currently does in many jurisdictions. We evaluate the extent to which SY and SFM are consistent with notions of weak and (or) strong sustainability. Strong sustainability implies placing constraints on the reduction of stocks of natural capital to prevent irreversibility and (or) protect flows of services that have public good characteristics. In contrast, weak sustainability may allow market forces to draw down stocks of natural capital so long as levels of total capital (including human-made and natural capital) are maintained. We argue that with SY policies, we have probably chosen to attach strong sustainability policies to the only forest resource that does not need such protection (i.e., timber), while we have excluded other resources that could well need such protection (e.g., biodiversity) for pursuing SFM. Thus, the concept of allowable annual cuts could be dropped from SFM to be replaced by safe minimum standards on components of forest capital that are subject to irreversibility and (or) that have public good features. In other words, if we truly wish to pursue SFM, it may be necessary to leave SY behind.

   RESPONSES; HYBRIDS; SUSTAINABILITY
AB The relatively high cost of willow (Salix spp.) biomass feedstock compared with fossil fuels makes it imperative to reduce production costs by increasing yields and reducing input costs. This can be addressed by harnessing the genetic potential of willow based on an understanding of the variation in key traits and how they interact to influence biomass production. Variation in 11 morphological traits among 30 willow clones at the end of a 3-year rotation was analyzed to determine its relationship to biomass production. We found significant differences (p <= 0.001) among the 30 clones in all traits. Across all clones, several significant trait correlations were detected. Cluster analysis revealed that high-yielding clones could be separated into two distinct "functional types" characterized by alternate growth strategies. One set of clones was characterized by a large number of small diameter stems, relatively low leaf area index and specific leaf area, but high foliar nitrogen and wood specific gravity. The other was characterized by a small number of large diameter stems, high leaf area index and specific leaf area, but low foliar nitrogen and wood specific gravity. The differences in strategies were apparent at the species level as well. These results suggest that multiple ideotypes need to be incorporated into willow breeding and selection efforts and in the management of willow biomass crops.

AB Soil aggregation is influenced by physical and chemical proper-ties of organic materials applied to the soil. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of fresh paper mill sludges and their composts, and their application frequency on soil aggregation, mean weight diameter of aggregates (MWD) and on the C content and C mineralization from water-stable aggregates. The experiment was established on a Le Bras silt loam (Humic Gleysol) under silage corn (Zea mays L.) production, and was designed as a split-plot experiment with six treatments in the main plots that were applied at two frequencies (annual and biennial) in the sub-plots. Paper mill sludges and their composts were applied at 40 t ha(-1) on a wet basis, alone or completed with 120 kg N ha(-1). Those treatments were compared to mineral N fertilization (160 kg ha(-1)) recommended for silage corn, and the control. Soil aggregation was assessed by wet soil sieving on a nest of 5-mm, 2-mm, 1-mm and 0.25-mm sieves. Soil C contents and mineralization were determined on whole soil and on > 5 mm, 2-5 mm and 0.25-2 mm aggregate classes. Fresh and composted paper mill sludges significantly (P < 0.05) increased the proportion of water-stable aggregates > 5 mm, the MWD of aggregates and the C content of aggregate fractions, compared to the control and the mineral N fertilizer treatment. However. the abundance of > 5 mm aggregates and the MWD of aggregates were significantly decreased when fresh paper mill sludges were combined with mineral N fertilizer, suggesting a fast mineralization of binding agents. In contrast, N fertilizer application has not reduced soil macro-aggregates > 5 min and the MWD of aggregates in paper mill compost treatments, probably due to resilience to degradation of humic substances brought by the composts. On average, carbon mineralization was highest in all aggregates in soils with paper mill sludges, than for their composts, which suggests that paper mill sludge C was more labile than compost C. Therefore, more frequent fresh paper mill sludge applications would be necessary for a sustainable effect on soil aggregation.

AB Objective: Last decade, the shear stress caused by increased blood flow in collateral circulation after occlusion of main artery was recognized as a trigger of vascular remodeling and collateral growth. The goal of this study was to differentiate whether the on-going increased blood flow is necessary for the vascular remodeling or the remodeling, once in progress, develops independently of flow.
   Methods: Femoral artery occlusion was performed in C57B1/6 mice. After 1-3 days, the ligature was removed and normal limb perfusion was re-established, monitored by laser Doppler Imaging (LDI). Two weeks after the first occlusion, both femoral arteries were re-occluded to compare collateral growth on the "naive" and "preconditioned" sides. After perfusion fixation, ultrastructural studies and morphometry of the collateral vessels were performed.
   Results: Blood flow fell after occlusion to about 15% of control levels and recovered to about 40% by day 3. The reperfusion normalized sustainable blood flow. After the second occlusion, blood flow on both sides fell again to about 15% but recovered to 70% in the "preconditioned" compared to 40% in the "naive" side during the following 3 days. 5-Bromo-2'-desoxy-uridine (BrdU) administered during reperfusion was detected mainly in the neointima that, in many cases, had markedly narrowed the lumen. Two to three days after reocclusion, a statistically significant lumen enlargement on the "preconditioned" side was observed, while neointima disappeared.
   Conclusion: Cellular proliferation and remodeling of collateral arteries were induced by short period of increased blood flow (occlusion of the femoral artery) but realized mostly during the low blood flow (reperfusion of the femoral artery). The neointima developing as a result of this remodeling can be recruited as a functional part of the arterial wall if the collateral perfusion increases as a result of repetitive occlusion of the femoral artery. The "medialization" of the neointima might cause the observed quicker gain of collateral lumen diameter and conductance, saving distal muscle tissue from the ischemia.

AB The photooxidation of aniline to azobenzene on alumina in ethanol with natural sunlight and artificial UV light (365 nm) was studied as a function of [aniline], catalyst loading, airflow rate, solvent composition, etc. The metal oxide exhibits sustainable catalytic activity. The product formation is larger with illumination at 254 nm than at 365 nm. Electron donors like triphenylphosphine, diphenylamine and hydroquinone enhance the photocatalysis. Singlet oxygen quencher, azide ion does not suppress the catalysis. The photooxidation occurs in protic and aprotic solvents. The product formation is analyzed using a kinetic model.

AB Sustainable development of the building sector can be achieved by a significant incorporation of cementitious and pozzolanic by-products, such as fly ash and slag, as well as some natural pozzolanic materials (supplementary cementing materials-SCM). Millions of tons of SCM, especially in Greece, are dumped due to overproduction or non-conformity with the existing standards. In this work, various types of SCM produced in Greece are investigated for a potential use in concrete. Their behavior as regards strength and durability is approached by a practical efficiency factor (A-value). The work is further focused on fly ashes. as they constitute the vast and more active majority of Greek SCM. The effectiveness of the Greek fly ashes in concrete improvement is widely proved through strength and durability measurements at laboratory and pilot-plant scale. However. they contain high amounts of free lime and sulphates, which may cause durability problems. In addition, they exhibit inadequate fineness and composition variations. Thus, an appropriate treatment is required and proposed by the present study in order to eliminate or reduce any harmful factors. Finally, a mix design strategy ensuring optimum strength, durability and ecological profile is proposed. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The subject of concrete recycling is regarded as very important in the general attempt for sustainable development in our times. In a parallel manner, it is directly connected with (a) increase of demolition structures past out of performance time, (b) demand for new structures and (c) results-especially in Greece-of destruction by natural phenomena (earthquakes. etc.). The present paper refers to the concrete recycling subject and, more specifically, to a proposal for Greek specifications of recycled concrete aggregates (RCA) with reference to international experience and practice. The existence of Greek specifications of RCA-the European ones will come much later-will help Olympic Games 2004 to be as "green" as possible. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper highlights some of the outcomes from a EU Accompanying Measure focussing on food powders. The main goals of the work were to outline the major industrial problems, knowledge barriers, and research challenges and opportunities in relation to food powders, and to promote the creation of a sustainable network of excellence in the area of food powders. Food powders are powders first and foremost, thus many of the research challenges and opportunities are similar to handling and processing of other powders. As a result, much can be learned from other industries that deal with powders. What makes food powders different from many other powders is their composition, which is mainly of biological origin, and that they are eventually consumed by people and animals. Consequently, stability of food ingredient functionality and prevention of contamination are major issues right through from powder production to final application of the powder, which is usually in the form of a wet formulation.

AB Changing production patterns towards waste reduction in a globalizing world can be considered a starting point towards sustainable development. The aim of the chemical plant designer is to reduce pollutant emissions, not by cleaning the effluents but by diminishing the production of the undesirable compounds. The case study examined is focused on reducing the CHF3 emission of an existing difluorochloromethane (HCFC-22) plant by allocating the source of the problem and trying to decrease byproduct emissions by reducing their production. The effect of the operating conditions on the formation rate of both the product and the byproduct of the plant is studied and it is proved that the optimum result is accomplished simply by reducing the residence time in the fluorination reactor, that is, without the need for extra investment and/or energy consumption, a solution highly desirable from an economic point of view. The results of the study were applied to an existing plant leading to 50% reduction of the CHF3 emissions.

AB This paper describes a stateful service-oriented middleware infrastructure for the management of scientific tasks running on multi-domain heterogeneous distributed architectures. Allocating scientific workload across multiple administrative boundaries is a key issue in Grid computing and as a result a number of supporting services including match-making, scheduling and staging have been developed. Each of these services allows the scientist to utilize the available resources, although a sustainable level of service in such shared environments cannot always be guaranteed. A performance-based middleware infrastructure is described in which prediction data for each scientific task are calculated, stored and published through a Globus-based performance information service. Distributing these data allows additional performance-based middleware services to be built, two of which are described in this paper: an intra-domain predictive co-scheduler and a multi-domain workload steering system. These additional facilities significantly improve the ability of the system to meet task deadlines, as well as enhancing inter-domain load-balancing and system-wide resource utilization.

ID CONSERVATION; BIODIVERSITY
AB Broadly conceived and considered in its many usages, sustainability has grave defects as a planning goal, particularly when used by conservationists: it confuses means and ends; it is vague about what is being sustained and who or what is doing the sustaining; it is uninspiring; it is little more than Pinchotera conservation (and thus ignores the many lessons learned since then); it need not be linked to land, to the land's functioning, or to any ecological science; it need not include a moral component; it is consistent with the view of humans as all-powerful manipulators of the planet; and, in general, it is such a malleable term that its popularity provides only a facade of consensus. When sustainability is defined broadly to include the full range of economic and social aspirations, it poses the particular risk that ecological and biodiversity concerns will be cast aside in favor of more pressing human wants. Given these many defects, the conservation movement should discard the term in favor of a more alluring goal, attentive to nature and its ecological functioning. A sound goal would incorporate and distill the considerable ecological and moral wisdom accumulated since Pinchot's day while giving conservationists the rhetorical tools needed to defend the land against competing pressures. In our view, conservation would be well served by an updated variant of "land health," Aldo Leopold's ecologically grounded goal from the 1940s. Land health as an independent understanding should set the essential terms of how we live and enjoy the earth, providing the framework within which we pursue our many social and economic aims.

ID DEFORESTATION; ECOLOGY
AB The Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) and the World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD) endorsed the Hague Ministerial Declaration that calls for a significant reduction of the current rate of biodiversity loss at the global, regional, and national levels by 2010. We argue that there is a shortage of standardized, regularly repeated measurements of the state of biomes and their biota that could be used to monitor progress toward this goal. In particular, there are few data that directly or indirectly measure the delivery of ecosystem services that depend on biodiversity. Given the link made in the declaration between biodiversity and poverty alleviation, this deficiency is of special concern. We suggest that greater attention should be given to defining the questions about changes in biodiversity that are relevant to CBD and WSSD goals and propose a framework through which the links between these questions and programs of monitoring and research could be made stronger and more explicit. The framework consists of three stages. First is a scoping stage in which reviews of existing knowledge and interactions with stakeholders help to define the subject of the evaluation and lead to a preliminary model of the system of interest. Second is a design stage in which the types of measurement and sampling strategies are selected by evaluating their fitness for purpose and the resources available to conduct the work. The final stage is implementation and reporting, which considers data collection and storage and the evaluation and dissemination of results. This framework can be applied across a broad range of biodiversity attributes and scales and, if combined with a systematic review of the most important and relevant questions about changes in biodiversity, would improve the coverage, fitness for purpose, and value for money of biodiversity monitoring. Slowing the rate of loss of biodiversity requires conservation action, but to know where this is most needed and whether it is working requires better and more comprehensive monitoring.

AB Many soils in southeastern Utah are protected from surface disturbance by biological soil crusts that stabilize soils and reduce erosion by wind and water. When these crusts are disturbed by land use, soils become susceptible to erosion. In this study, we compare a never-grazed grassland in Canyonlands National Park with two historically grazed sites with similar geologic, geomorphic, and geochemical characteristics that were grazed from the late 1800s until 1974. We show that, despite almost 30 years without livestock grazing, surface soils in the historically grazed sites have 38-43% less silt, as well as 14-51% less total elemental soil Mg, Na, P, and Mn content relative to soils never exposed to livestock disturbances. Using magnetic measurement of soil magnetite content (a proxy for the stabilization of far-traveled eolian dust) we suggest that the differences in Mg, Na, P, and Mn are related to wind erosion of soil fine particles after the historical disturbance by livestock grazing. Historical grazing may also lead to changes in soil organic matter content including declines of 60-70% in surface soil C and N relative to the never-grazed sites. Collectively, the differences in soil C and N content and the evidence for substantial rock-derived nutrient loss to wind erosion implies that livestock grazing could have long-lasting effects on the soil fertility of native grasslands in this part of southeastern Utah. This study suggests that nutrient loss due to wind erosion of soils should be a consideration for management decisions related to the long-term sustainability of grazing operations in and environments.

AB Quantitative conservation methodologies such as Population Viability Analysis (PVA) require reliable estimates of life history parameters such as breeding success. The utility of such metrics for egg-laying species is complicated by the fact that the mortality of eggs and juveniles can occur both randomly and independently over time,. or catastrophically, as in the sudden loss of a clutch or brood. Not knowing the nature of mortality caused by either or both of abiotic (e.g., weather) and biotic (e.g., predation) events limits our. ability to confidently assess a population's demography and. sustainability, or rank competing hypotheses. To address this deficiency, we describe a statistical model that estimates egg and juvenile survival rates continuously from laying to fledging based on periodic observations of individual clutches and broods. Adjunct data on environmental or predation threats can be included in the model as covariate series potentially affecting juvenile survival. Our model can statistically characterize mortality between the extremes of random and catastrophic mortality and can determine if unwitnessed mortalities occurred independently or were correlated (i.e., overdispersed, where catastrophe is extreme overdispersion). Overdispersion is estimated as a parameter of the beta-binomial probability distribution of survival. outcomes, which differs from its treatment in Program MARK where overdispersion is an a posteriori diagnostic referred to as e. We used data for the sea duck Barrow's Goldeneye to illustrate our model. Specifically, we contribute to the argument that a larger brood confers a fitness advantage to a tending hen by concluding that brood size on hatch day is positively correlated with a juvenile's probability of surviving to fledge.

SO EDUCATIONAL ADMINISTRATION QUARTERLY

AB This article addresses the sustainability of comprehensive school reform (CSR) models in the face of turbulent district and state contexts. It draws on qualitative data gathered in a longitudinal case study of six CSR models implemented in 13 schools in one urban district. Why do reforms sustain in some schools and not in others? How do changing state and district contexts influence reform sustainability in schools? After 3 years, reform efforts ceased in 6 of the 13 schools studied; two other schools were still implementing reforms but at very low levels. Only 5 of the 13 schools continued to implement their CSR models with moderate to high levels of intensity. Findings show that changing district and state contexts affected the sustainability of CSR models in schools differently depending on each school's strategy for dealing with the changes, as well as their local conditions, experiences with reform, and capacity.

AB Emergency medicine (EM) development is rapidly occurring throughout the world. However, this growth has largely occurred outside of the low- and lower middle-income countries. These countries face complex multisectoral development challenges that often preclude spending for EM projects. Identifying funding sources to develop sustainable EM initiatives in these countries requires an understanding of the primary lending agencies and their health agendas.

AB The world population has passed six billion people and the pressure on basic daily needs is partictularly dominant in the developing Countries, such as the ASEAN. As most of the natural resources, particularly that of fossil fuel is depleting rapidly, more efficient ways to produce daily necessity are becoming important issues. In addition, both the UNFCCC and the Kyoto Protocol require. that efforts should be directed to improve efficiency of energy conversion devices. effective use of the clean and friendly renewable source of energy, beside providing Sink for the green house gas (GHG) emissions. INFORSE report to the UN Secretary General indicated that the total energy sources in the industrialized countries will diminish drastically, but by providing enough funding for R/D in renewable energy conversion, about 50% of the world energy could be supplied by the developing countries by the year 2050.
   Despite the above limiting conditions, current data indicated growing energy demand in most of the developing countries, particularly in the ASEAN region. Consequently, these countries, should find out the best strategy in utilizing the available energy sources to maintain sustainable development. One of the reasonable option is to make use of the potential renewable energy resources within the countries and develop industries that complies with the unique characteristics of the energy, which is usually disperse, low density and mostly is still not yet competitive with power generation system using subsidized fuel price. Although some basic R/D on renewable energy technology is also being conducted in ASEAN. more effort, however, is directed to its immediate applications in providing basic energy need for rural house-hold, creating productive uses to process agricultural commodities, and to Support 2Cneral rural electrification programs. Such activity has been supported by relevant and operational government policies, international assistances, and gradual involvement of the private sectors. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The world is faced with an intrinsic environmental responsibility, i.e. the minimisation of greenhouse gas emission to acceptable levels. This study seeks to explain the methods of carbon dioxide capture and sequestration and to discuss a line of research that may, in the future, help to reduce the greenhouse effect in a sustainable manner.
   The capture of carbon dioxide produced by combustion of fossil fuels used in electric generation can be achieved by amine scrubbing of the flue gases. This process is costly and may, in the future, be replaced by options such as membrane separation, molecular sieves or desiccant adsorption. Short term options of sequestration by direct injection into geologic or oceanic sinks are recognised as methods to reduce the carbon dioxide levels but do not address issues of sustainability. For this purpose, the topic of photosynthetic reaction, which has long been known as a natural process that can produce useful by-products of biomass, oxygen and hydrogen and can fix carbon dioxide, has been examined. In a controlled environment, such as a bio-reactor, micro-organisms capable of photosynthetic reactions may hold the key to reducing emissions in both an economically and environmentally sustainable manner. The design of such a laboratory scale reactor, described in this paper, may help researchers study the feasibility of implementing a larger scale economically sustainable system capable of sequestering significant quantities of carbon dioxide.

AB Solar energy systems (photovoltaics, solar thermal, solar power) provide significant environmental benefits in comparison to the conventional energy sources, thus contributing, to the sustainable development of human activities. Sometimes however, their wide scale deployment has to face potential negative environmental implications. These potential problems seem to be a strong barrier for a further dissemination of these systems in some consumers.
   To cope with these problems this paper presents an overview of an Environmental Impact Assessment. We assess the potential environmental intrusions in order to ameliorate them with new technological innovations and good practices in the future power systems. The analysis provides the potential burdens to the environment, which include-during the construction, the installation and the demolition phases, as well as especially in the case of the central solar technologies-noise and visual intrusion, greenhouse gas emissions, water and soil pollution, energy consumption, tabour accidents, impact on archaeological sites or on sensitive ecosystems, negative and positive socio-economic effects.

DE woodfuel; environment; rural development
AB Chad, like many other sub-Saharan African countries, depends for most of its energy demand on woodfuels; 90% or more of the country's energy balance comes from biomass energy. Obvious environmental problems appear around cities because of their highly concentrated demand, and this threatens the sustainability of supply. But, this does not need to be a problem, and woodfuel can also be an engine of economic growth, particularly in rural areas. A few policy conditions will need to be satisfied and in Chad this appears to be the case. As a result, the woodfuel supply of the capital N'Djamena could become sustainable, thereby continuing to provide low-cost energy to the urban population for the foreseeable future while giving income generation opportunities in rural areas.

AB This paper examines the implications of tenancy legislation and privatization of community lands in Goa on the supply of local public goods for soil conservation. In the post-tenancy period our survey reveals an increasing number of farmers being affected by salinity ingress. These findings support the hypothesis that when community institutions break down, individual agents who become new resource owners do not have sufficient incentive to undertake supply of local public goods, which leads to a decline in productivity and affects long-term sustainability.

ID CITIES
AB Urban form is changing in Britain, with new patterns of development reflecting economic, technological, and transportation conditions in an increasingly competitive framework. Changes in urban form have implications for the environmental sustainability, integration and cohesion, and longer term quality of life in and around cities. Britain has a comprehensive planning system with a strong rhetoric of policies towards these goals. In this paper the authors draw on evidence from recent research, primarily in central Scotland, to assess how far planning actually does make a difference to urban form rather than simply passively responding to demand. They consider some of the systematic tendencies in decentralised planning decisionmaking, some selected evidence of development outcomes, and some insights from major development case studies. The conclusions highlight the differential influence of planning between different development sectors and the obstacles to achieving a more sustainable pattern.

AB In the northwestern United States, insect pests of potatoes (Solanum tuberosum L.) have typically been controlled using broad-spectrum insecticides. However, the loss or impending loss of many broad-spectrum chemicals is increasing the use of selective insecticides, and organic potato production is growing in the region. In the 2001 and 2002 growing seasons, we intensively sampled the arthropods in 31 (14 in 2001 and 17 in 2002) production potato fields tinder three pest management regimens: conventional fields treated with broad-spectrum insecticides (Hard), conventional fields treated with selective insecticides (Soft), and organic fields treated with insecticides certified for organic production (Organic). All fields were within the Columbia Basin of Washington, grown under center-pivot irrigation. We sampled arthropods using three techniques: D-vac suction sampling, pitfall trapping, and visual searching. Geocoris spp. and Nabis spp. bugs (Hemiptera) and spiders (Araneae) were the most abundant predators in plant foliage, together making up >90% of the foliar predator community in both years. Total predator densities and densities of Geocoris, Nabis, and spiders not in the family Linyphiidae were highest in Organic and Soft, and lowest in Hard fields. Linyphiid spider densities were marginally elevated in Soft compared with Hard fields. On the ground, carabid (Coleoptera: Carabidae) and staphylinid (Coleoptera: Staphylinidae) beetles and a diverse group of spiders dominated the community, together making up >90% of the ground-active predator community in both years. Total predator densities and densities of carabid beetles, staphylinid beetles, and linyphiid spiders were highest in Organic and Soft and lowest in Hard fields, whereas densities of these arthropods did not differ between Organic and Soft. Densities of nonlinyphiid spiders were highest in Organic, intermediate in Soft, and lowest in Hard fields. While predator densities were generally high in organic fields, these fields also had the highest densities of the two most injurious insect pests, the green peach aphid (Myzus persicae Sulzer) and the Colorado potato beetle (Leptinotarsa decemlineata Say). Selective insecticides allowed conventional growers to achieve predator densities similar to those seen in organic fields while retaining low pest densities typical of fields treated with broad-spectrum insecticides.

AB Environmental Impact Assessments (EIA) and Strategic Environmental Assessments (SEA) frequently rely on spatial analysis underpinned by spatial data. However, the potential of spatial analysis is often not fully exploited. A questionnaire survey prepared by the European Commission (EC) revealed the existence of problems with the use of spatial data for the preparation of EIA and SEA reports, that have important implications for the preparation of environmental impact studies. This survey has been conducted in the context of the preparation of an extended impact assessment of a proposal for a Directive on INSPIRE-an Infrastructure for Spatial Information in Europe. The INSPIRE 'initiative intends to deal with a range of barriers that now prevent the widespread use of spatial data in support of good governance that contributes to sustainable development. If INSPIRE could help overcoming the problems related with the availability, access and interoperability of spatial datasets, it would decrease the time and cost needed for the preparation of EIA and SEA reports, improve their quality and reliability and facilitate public participation. Therefore it would contribute to better and more transparent environmental decision-making, thus promoting sustainable development. (C) 2004 European Communities. Published by Elsevier Inc.

DE soils; environmental assessment and protection; risk assessment
ID KNOWLEDGE; EUROPE
AB It has been widely recognised at national, European and international levels that soil protection is important within the concept of sustainable development. Soils can be considered to perform a broad range of functions, many of which are vital to society and its environment. There are many pressures and threats upon soils including erosion, decreasing levels of organic matter, point and diffuse contamination, sealing, compaction and declining bio-diversity. In the United Kingdom, the Environment Agency has a role in protecting soils. In support of this role, a flexible risk based method for the prioritisation of environmental issues related to soils has been developed. This paper describes the method and framework developed and in so doing it highlights many of the issues and difficulties surrounding the environmental assessment and knowledge of soils.

   composting; economic incentives
ID DETERMINANTS; VALUATION
AB Municipalities everywhere are coping with increasing amounts of solid waste and need urgently to formulate efficient and sustainable solutions to the problem. This study examines the use of economic incentives in municipal waste management. Specifically, we address the issue of recycling, if and when this waste management option is-on social welfare grounds-a preferred solution. A number of studies have recently assessed the monetary value of the externalities of alternative solid waste management options. In the present context, these subsidies could be interpreted as the implicit value of the benefits from reducing environmental externalities associated with landfilling as perceived by local government authorities. We surmise that the difference between mean households' willingness to pay (WTP) for recycling services. via the purchase of a subsidized waste disposal facility, and the above (proxy) value of externalities reflects the difference between private and public perception regarding the negative externality associated with landfilling. We believe that this information is useful in determining the level of subsidization needed (if at all) to sustain any recycling program. The study is unique in the sense that its conclusions are based on revealed household behavior when faced with increased disposal costs, as well as information on WTP responses in hypothetical but related (and, therefore, familiar) scenarios. The article also explores the influence of the subsidization schemes on recycling rates. It was found that with low levels of effort needed to participate in a curbside recycling program, households' participation rates are mainly influenced by economic variables and age, and households are willing to pay a higher price for the recycling scheme. When the required effort level is relatively high, however, households would pay a lower price, and the rate is influenced mainly by their environmental commitment and by economic considerations. We found that in both cases a subsidy would be required in order to achieve an efficient level of recycling.

AB A temporal assessment of land-cover changes of the province Beykoz in Istanbul has been documented in this article. The. study focuses on the acquisition and analysis of LANDSAT 5 TM images that reflect the drastic land-cover changes between the years 1984 and 2001 utilizing aerial photographs, orthophoto maps, standard topographic maps, and ground truth measurements. The status of the province, including its surrounding villages, were examined together with more specialized maps showing only the city center and part of the province that lies within the watershed of the Elmali Drinking Water Reservoir, The land distribution profiles were also calculated for each of the images to help authorities and decision-makers to better understand the main causes of such remarkable changes and to inform them of the changing quality conditions of the reservoir. Rapid, uncontrolled, and illegal urbanization accompanied by insufficient infrastructure has caused degradation of forests and barren lands in the province, especially within the past two decades. The proximity of the province to the reservoir's watershed, downtown Istanbul, and the transportation network has accelerated the land-cover changes whose adverse impacts on the reservoir water quality are sensed. It is intended that the data gathered and processed in this study will provide a basis for future sustainable urban planning and management activities.

AB The European Union Water Framework Directive offers an unparalleled opportunity for improving river basin management. 'End-of-pipe' solutions will not deliver sufficient improvements in order to achieve the ambitious goals set by the Directive. Ecological design, which can help to deliver 'upstream solutions', is essential to achieve these goals. This research examines the emerging role of 'planning for sustainability' in the context of river catchment management. The SUNstainable Design Ways process is being tested in the context of waterside regeneration in the NorthWest region of the UK. Sustainable management of water requires integration, recognizing the interconnections between systems operating at different levels of scale. This is an endeavour in which systems thinking could provide useful tools. Systems orientated models can enhance dialogue, facilitate work across scales and sectors and increase focus on the 'whole picture'. The development of DesignWays was a conscious attempt to embed 'new paradigm' living systems metaphors into a tool for design and decision-making. This paper discusses key challenges posed by the Water Framework Directive, followed by an exploration of the ways in which Design Ways can help to meet these challenges. This research points to the importance of a focus on ways using toolkits for participation as a societal process, aiming to make the process engaging and meaningful for participants.

   valuation
AB In order to implement water management in a sustainable way, the related decision-making processes have to take the ecological and socio-economic consequences into account. In The Netherlands, policy makers struggle with the question of how they can deal with flood risks. This paper presents some results of a research project sponsored by the Dutch Ministry of Water management in order to develop a risk assessment approach that assists decision-makers in dealing with flood risks. It shows that dealing with risk in decision-making related to water management manifests itself in different ways. One aspect is the incorporation of risk in the process of valuation of socio-economic effects. Another aspect is the incorporation of the valued socio-economic effects into the decision-making process. The paper shows that different attitudes towards risk determine to a large extent how the valued effects are assessed. This element has been widely discussed in the literature. The results are innovative in that they also show that risk attitudes and the understanding of the risk concept interfere with the outcome of the decision-making process in the field of water management. The paper provides an approach to how the concept of risk can be operationalized in different ways by decision-makers in dealing with flood risks. The approach is applied in two case studies. The results show that different institutional contexts impose different ways of dealing with risks which may significantly change over time (discount rates, risk attitudes, relevance of ecological effects, etc.).

AB The Decision Support System for Irrigation (DSIRR) is a DSS for the economic-environmental assessment of agricultural activity focusing on irrigation, designed to answer both public and private needs. The program simulates the economically driven decision processes of farmers, permitting an accurate description of production and irrigation in terms of technology and agronomics. Distinct farm models can be constructed to describe the relevant production system in the catchment. Short and long term analyses can be conducted, the latter with endogenous investment choices. Solutions are found by applying multicriterial mathematical programming techniques. Farm models run under a graphical interface, which allows the user to quantify, by farm type, the utilization of water, labour and machinery, considering different types of soils, irrigation systems, water-yield functions and seasonality. Data are aggregated at catchment scale. Richness of information produced, flexibility and simplicity of use make DSIRR a useful tool for more sustainable agriculture and the definition of a sound water policy. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The paper reports the first results of the Project WADI (Sustainability of European Irrigated Agriculture under Water Directive and Agenda 2000), funded under the 5th Framework Programme of the European Union (EU). The objective of the project is to evaluate the economic, social and environmental sustainability of European irrigated farming under different scenarios concerning water policy and the Common Agricultural Policy. The methodology relies on scenario analysis combined with farm level mathematical programming models. Two pilot case studies are presented for Italy: cereal farming and fruit farming. According to the first results, the impact of the directive, up to reasonable prices, may be summed up in a minor reduction of water use associated with a sharp decrease of farm income and a significant reduction of employment. Nevertheless, different farming systems may react in very different ways. More detailed local analyses are needed in order to support the design of effective and efficient policies at basin level.

AB Sustainable water resources management is a priority issue today, since it can contribute to achieving both environmental preservation and economic prosperity. Wetlands constitute a significant environmental system, since they incorporate unique habitats with endemic and migrant species and therefore contribute to the conservation of high global biodiversity. However, they suffer from degradation because of the intensification of agriculture, the increase in pollution rates and poor water management practices. This study attempts to develop a methodology by combining GIS applications, remote-sensing techniques and physically based hydrologic modelling for the formation of water management plans in lake catchments. This methodology has been tested in Trichonis Lake catchment, in Western Greece, where the endangered calcareous fens habitat undergoes great ecological stresses due to the irrational use of local water resources. The first results indicated that the particular methodology operated efficiently. The suggested scenario has been adopted by the local water authorities and the significant water level fluctuations observed in the past have been eliminated to approximately 25% in the initial implementation period.

AB Developing decision support systems for environmental applications is an intricate, challenging task. The increasing complexity of environmental decision problems, the growing number of subjects involved and keen competition between conflicting interests make decisions and decision support difficult. Decision support systems have been developed since the 1970s to help tackle semi-structured and unstructured decision problems. Despite their popularity, the success of DSS development is uncertain and many computerised decision-support tools have failed when dealing with complex and unstructured problems. This article describes the development methodology and progress of mDSS, a decision support system for water resource management that has been developed under the European research project MULINO. The mDSS tool is designed to integrate environmental (especially hydrological) models with multiple-criteria evaluation procedures. A number of prototypes have been developed and the final version is expected at the end of the 3-year project. The system's development is driven by the experience acquired in several case studies selected in five European countries. Although the main aim of the MULINO project and the DSS is to help with increasingly complex decisions of general water management, the concepts of sustainable river basin management introduced by the water framework directive are addressed as well.

AB Integrated management is the key to the sustainable development of Europe's water resources. This means that decisions need to be taken in the light of not only environmental considerations, but also their economic, social, and political impacts; it also requires the active participation of stakeholders in the decision making process. The problem is to find a practical way to achieve these aims. One approach is to use Bayesian networks (Bns): networks allow a range of different factors to be linked together, based on probabilistic dependencies, and at the same time provide a framework within which the contributions of stakeholders can be taken into account. A further strength is that Bus explicitly include the element of uncertainty related to any strategy or decision. The links are based on whatever data are available. This may be an extensive data set, output from a model or, in the absence of data, can be based on expert opinion. Networks are being developed for four catchments in Europe as part of the MERIT project; these are in the UK, Denmark, Italy and Spain. In each case stakeholder groups are contributing to the design of the networks that are used as a focus for the consultation process. As an example, the application to water management of a UK basin is discussed. Crown Copyright (C) 2004 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB While sustainable cities have been promoted as a desirable goal within a variety of policy contexts, critical questions concerning the extent to which cities and local governments can address the challenges of sustainability remain unanswered. We use a multilevel governance perspective to examine the discursive and material struggles which take place in creating sustainable cities. In exploring the politics of implementing climate protection through development planning in Newcastle upon Tyne and transport planning in Cambridgeshire, we find that the interpretation and implementation of sustainability are shaped by forms of governance which stretch across geographical scales and beyond the boundary of the urban. We argue that the 'urban' governance of climate protection involves relations between levels of the state and new network spheres of authority which challenge traditional distinctions between local, national and global environmental politics.

ID CLIMATE-CHANGE
AB Usage of the word "sustainability" is widespread and incorporates a plethora of meanings. After reviewing four extant sustainability frameworks, we propose a Sustainability Hierarchy to structure a broad array of issues that have been associated with sustainability. These issues vary widely in their urgency, severity and uncertainty of consequences, and temporal and spatial dimensions. It categorizes actions some view as unsustainable based on their direct or indirect potential to (i) endanger the survival of humans; (ii) impair human health, (iii) cause species extinction or violate human rights; or (iv) reduce quality of life or have consequences that are inconsistent with other values, beliefs, or aesthetic preferences. Effects considered include impediments to the ecosystem functions that support human life, human health, and species viability. This paper argues that for sustainability to become a more meaningful concept, the many worthy issues in the fourth category (values, beliefs, and aesthetic preferences) should not be considered sustainability concerns. Implications for companies, policy makers, and scientists are discussed.

AB The North American environmental movement has historically sought to redress the depletion and degradation of natural resources that has been the legacy of the industrial revolution. Predominant in this approach has been the preservation of wilderness, conservation of species biodiversity and the restoration of natural ecosystems. While the results of such activity have often been commendable, several scholars have pointed out that the environmental movement has inherited an unfortunate bias against urban environments, and consequently, a blind spot to ways in which densely populated built spaces can serve to enhance rather than degrade efforts to achieve sustainability. After exploring this concern we argue that environmental architecture can serve as a counter-balance to this bias, focused, as it is, on the ways in which the construction and organisation of built spaces for humans can help or hinder the pursuit of environmental priorities. But if environmental architecture is to take this role then it must be understood in a broader context, one which does not exclude other moral, political and aesthetic values in the production of human environments. We will highlight several examples of how environmental architecture has combined success and failure at taking a broader view of environmental questions, with a specific focus on one green skyscraper that may be good for the natural environment but not necessarily for the human environment of the city.

AB This article is building the theory for the scientific field of industrial ecology. For this, the industrial ecosystem (IE) concept is used. IE uses the model of sustainable ecosystems in unsustainable industrial systems for making progress towards the vision of the industrial ecosystem. Six controversies are revealed and identified as research challenges. I invite all those who are interested in industrial ecology to respond to this contribution.

AB Since early 1999, we have been working on an environmental information system as a preliminary phase to develop the National Strategy of the Catalan Coast. Using the tourism industry as the main pressuring driver and the municipality as the territorial unit, we have compiled a vast amount of information that has been converted into an information platform for the general public, politicians, and public administrators. Working in close co-operation with the planning authorities of the Generalitat of Catalonia, we developed decision support tools as a methodological approach for coastal management. The decision support system is composed by: (a) the development of an environmental indicator-based report; (b) the use of a geographical information system (GIS); and (c) the incorporation of different types of graphical packages. These tools have been applied to the 70 municipalities of the Catalan Coast and a specific development of the system was carried out in the region of La Selva, municipalities of Blanes, Lloret de Mar. and Tossa de Mar (southern Costa Brava, Girona). The system has been designed to help coastal managers in Catalonia, and it is thought to be used in the process of developing the National Strategy for Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM) of the Catalan Coast following the EC Recommendation (COM/00/545).

AB Mixtures of wet vegetable wastes (Brassica, carrot or onion) and dry onion waste were composted at 50 degreesC for 7 days. The incorporation of the raw or composted vegetable waste mixtures into sandy loam, silt and peat soils reduced the viability of sclerotia of S. cepivorum in glasshouse pot bioassays. The reduction in viability was dependent on waste type, rate of incorporation, duration of exposure and soil type. Onion waste was the most effective waste type in reducing sclerotia viability in all three soils. The Brassica and carrot wastes were as effective as the onion waste in silt soil but less effective in sandy loam and peat soil. A 50% w/w incorporation rate of the wastes gave the largest reduction in viability, with an increase in reduction over time. Composted onion waste reduced sclerotia viability under glasshouse and field conditions although the effect was smaller in the field. Composted onion waste incorporated into soil at 50% w/w reduced the incidence of Allium white rot on onion seedlings in glasshouse pot tests. Incidence and control of the disease differed with soil type. The most consistent control was achieved in peat soil whereas no control was observed in silt soil. Incorporation of the waste 2 months prior to sowing or transplanting reduced seedling emergence in sandy loam soil and growth in all three soil types. The potential for field application of composted vegetable wastes as a sustainable method for control of Allium white rot and waste disposal is discussed.

AB Background: In 1998 a joint initiative of the Hungarian School of Public Health and the National Public Health Service created a network of sentinel stations based in primary care facilities in four Hungarian counties. The aim was to establish a system that will provide valid data on morbidity of selected diseases in Hungary. Methods: Based on standardized protocols, the participating centres have continuously reported data on the prevalence of cardiovascular diseases, diabetes mellitus, liver cirrhosis, and some malignant diseases, as well as supplying denominator data. The four counties represent both eastern and western parts of Hungary, reflecting the known geographical disparities in health. Each county office enrolled general practitioners maintaining representation in terms of both geography and distribution of settlement size. Results: A total of 73 general practitioners agreed to participate, providing care for 15.6% (138,088 people) of the population in the counties. The population registered with the practices were representative in terms of age and sex of both the participating counties and the entire country. The prevalence of hypertension, diabetes mellitus and liver cirrhosis is high in each county but varies considerably, with higher levels in the western counties, especially among older age groups of both sexes. Conclusions: The establishment of sentinel stations to collect morbidity data is feasible and sustainable in Hungarian primary care. The data that have been generated provide a valid and comprehensive picture of important aspects of the Hungarian population's health, with important implications for health policy and health service planning. In regions where low prevalence rates of diseases and high mortality rates simultaneously exist special attention is required to explore the background of this caveat.

AB Landings of batoids (rays and skates) have been rising in Argentina, reaching 14 856 mt in 1998. These species are poorly known. and their low fecundity, late maturity and slow growth rates make them vulnerable to stock collapse even when subjected to low levels of fishing pressure. Skates are commonly present as bycatch of commercial fisheries. Bycatch is of great concern both ecologically and in terms of fishery management, particularly in shrimp fisheries. The Patagonian red shrimp (Pleoticus muelleri) is the main crustacean fishery of the Southwestern Atlantic Ocean. The skate bycatch in 313 tows of the double-beam trawl fishery was surveyed from September 2001 to September 2002. Seven species were recorded: Bathyraja albomaculata (n = 1), Dipturus flavirostris (n = 1008), Dipturus trachydermus (n = 138), Psammobatis normani (n = 1137), Psammobatis bergi (n = 9). Psammobatis rudis (it = 25), and Sympterygia bonapartei (n = 108 1). Length-weight relationships, length-frequency by sex, and estimation of density and bycatch per unit of effort are given for each species. While shrimp catches for the double-beam trawl fleet were up to 55 000 mt, overall estimation of skate bycatch for the period under consideration was nearly 1000 mt. Although rajids are released alive at sea, post-catch mortality is unknown. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The principles of sustainable development (or ecologically sustainable development as it is known in Australia) are now accepted as the foundation for natural resource management worldwide and there are increasing community expectations that they will be implemented explicitly. Previous attempts to assess sustainable development for fisheries have mostly failed because the methods have been too restrictive, often attempting to develop a single set of indicators. In 2000, all the fishery agencies and major stakeholder groups in Australia supported the development of a National ESD Framework. This initiative resulted in a practical system being generated through the results of a series of case studies and stakeholder workshops.
   The Australian National ESD Framework divides ESD into eight major components within the three main categories of ecological well-being, human well-being and ability to contribute: Four main steps are used to complete an ESD report for a fishery: (1) identify relevant issues, (2) prioritise these using risk assessment, (3) complete appropriately detailed reports on each issue and (4) compile the material into a report. The tools to assist this process are now available and have been used to generate reports for many Australian fisheries. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Quantitative assessment of the sustainability of non-commercial harvests from urban shellfish populations is rarely possible, as the scale of these fisheries does not usually warrant extensive research. Management is generally based upon a paucity of information, often resulting in the implementation of inappropriate controls. In this study, comparatively comprehensive data are used to assess the likely short-term sustainability of non-commercial cockle (Austrovenus stutchburyi) gathering at three beaches, by comparing harvest, biomass and yield estimates. Although harvest estimates were broadly similar to estimates of yield, these findings were sensitive to assumptions about size at recruitment to the fishery, temporal changes in biomass, and possible changes in the selectivity and behaviour of fishers. Because of this uncertainty, we conclude that management on the basis of sustainable yield is inappropriate given the unpredictable nature of non-commercial gathering effort and shellfish population dynamics. Further, we conclude that the current management regime of daily bag limits per gatherer may be inadequate. Daily bag limits fail to constrain annual non-commercial harvests to appropriate levels when accessibility and interest is high, yet gathering is one of the main determinants of urban shellfish abundance. In the absence of intensive monitoring and management, a precautionary minimum legal size limit based on a species reproductive biology, appears to be the most promising means of ensuring the viability of a shellfish population when its abundance is low. Other management measures such as daily bag limits and beach closures also have their role to play, but are not in themselves sufficient. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A feedback management procedure is proposed that is based on controlling the size of a Marine Protected Area (MPA): increasing the size of the MPA when the population is below a predetermined target level and reducing its size when it is above. The objective of fisheries management is to have the population size approximate the target level. Local stability was analyzed, to determine whether a population could remain close to the target level with small perturbations, using a generalized population dynamics model without including an age structure. The procedure was able to sustain the population at the target level if the target was set at a level that gives the maximum sustainable yield and if drastic changes in the MPA size were avoided. Global stability was analyzed numerically to determine whether a population would always approach the target level regardless of the present population size, using a specified model that allowed for temporal changes in the spatial distribution of a sedentary population. The procedure, which did not require direct control of catch quota or fishing effort, appeared to attain the objective successfully.

AB The blending of ethanol into fuels is expected to increase significantly in the coming years. In some regions of the United States, ethanol has already replaced MTBE as the oxygenate blended into gasoline. Biofuel blends, such as blends of gasoline with ethanol made from biomass, can play an important role in helping governments and corporations meet sustainability targets. However, the introduction of ethanol fuel blends into the market place requires addressing several issues related to phase equilibria. The highly non-ideal mixing of ethanol with hydrocarbons has a dramatic impact on phase behavior, with consequences for the production, storage, distribution, and use of ethanol-blended fuels. In this paper, we will (a) illustrate the impact of ethanol use on the transportation fuels industry, (b) use thermodynamics as a unifying theme to understand these phenomena, and (c) review available data and the state-of-the-art in modeling these effects. Topics will include (a) volatility characteristics (e.g. Reid vapor pressure, ASTM D-86 Distillation, vapor-liquid ratio, and evaporative emissions), (b) phase separation effects (e.g. water tolerance and enhanced solubility of aromatic fuel components in groundwater), (c) commingling of ethanol and non-ethanol fuels, and (d) materials compatibility (e.g. increased swelling and permeation).

AB Changes in both farm production and food transport have resulted in the imposition of new levels of environmental costs. This study analyses the full costs of foods in the average weekly UK food basket by calculating the costs arising at different stages from farms to consumers' plates. Of the 12 commodities assessed, livestock produce contributes the most costs per kg. The external cost of UK agriculture up to the farm gate is estimated to be pound 1.51 bn yr(-1); it is calculated that a switch to organic production could lead to avoided costs of pound 1. 13 bn yr(-1). Agricultural and food produce accounts for 28% of goods transported on UK roads, currently imposing estimated external costs of pound 2.35 bn yr(-1). The contribution made by sea and air transport is currently trivial owing to low volumes. However, road transport to carry food from the shop to home is estimated to impose a further 1.28 pound bn yr(-1) to total external costs. Subsidies not targeted at environmental improvements cost consumers 2.88 pound bn yr(-1). Thus the real cost of the per capita UK food basket (24.79) pound is calculated to be 2.91 pound more per person wk(-1) (11.8%) if externalities and subsidies are included, with farm externalities (81 p), domestic road transport (76 p), government subsidies (93 p) and shopping transport (41 p) contributing the most. We assess a variety of scenarios for adoption of organic farming, localised food systems and sustainable transport to indicate the substantial potential to reduce environmental costs in the UK food system.

AB The structure of the fuelwood supply chain and the impacts of urban residential fuelwood consumption on forests in Nicaragua are little known. To characterize the nature of fuelwood movements toward residential centers, we examined the fuelwood inventories and movements in the largest fuelwood market, in Masaya, during the peak of the rainy season, in October 1999, and again at the peak of the dry season, in May 2000. We found a stressed fuelwood supply that depended greatly upon natural forests. There was a diverse (64 tree taxa from 28 families) and strongly seasonally variable taxonomic composition of the supply of fuelwood. Greater volumes concentrated in fewer taxa (63,648 kg per 5-day period. with 58.9% in three species) were sold to vendors in the dry season than in the rainy season (12,921 kg per 5-day period with 24.6%, among the same three species). The proportion of fuelwood derived from natural forests increased from one-third of the market sales during the rainy season to one-half in the dry season; virtually none of the fuelwood was derived from plantation forestry. We recommend a fuelwood supply management strategy based on incentives to farm owners for supplying managed fuelwood and increased vigilance to limit forest destruction for fuelwood production.

AB Integration of conservation into sustainable forest management plans requires the accurate assessment of pre-harvesting biodiversity. An open question is how to efficiently and accurately sample biodiversity in production forests. Here we investigate one possible answer: the use of existing pre-felling inventories designed for the estimation of timber stocking. Using data drawn from two large permanent forest sample plots in Malaysia, we tested the ability of the Malaysian SPOS pre-felling inventory (PreF) to accurately assess alpha (alpha)- and beta (beta)-tree diversity. We found that the Pre-F did not accurately estimate variation in alpha-diversity at small spatial-scales, but could be used to accurately extrapolate alpha-diversity on larger spatial scales. The Pre-F also adequately assessed P-diversity in heterogeneous environments, but did not perform as well in homogeneous environments. The use of tree species codes as opposed to Latin nomenclature affected estimates of beta- but not a-diversity. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID LAND-USE SPECIALIZATION; MANAGEMENT
AB Based on the comparative advantages of forestland in providing a variety of products and services, it is not arguable that different kinds of forestland should produce different compositions of outputs. To investigate the issue regarding forestland-use specialization or the pursuit of multiple uses on same piece of land, this paper starts by revisiting Vincent and Binkley's paper `Efficient Multiple-Use Forestry May Require Land-Use Specialization' (see Land Economics 69 (3):370-376.1 would like to argue that their reasoning may not be entirely correct, but their conclusions may be right for the following reasons: (1) the constraints of input factors (including time), (2) cross-spatial interaction, (3) changes in technology and relative prices and (4) ecological and economic thresholds of production and management. Some evidence related to and trends in forestland-use specialization from New Zealand, the USA, Canada and China are presented. It is suggested that to promote forestland-use specialization, it is necessary to re-allocate research funding, to implement various sustainable forest management criteria and forest ownership reforms, to zone land for priority use, and to promote market development.

TI Development and economic significance of forest certification: the case
   of FSC in Bolivia
SO FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS
LA English
DT Article
DE forest certification; FSC; tropical natural forest management; economic
   significance; Bolivia
AB Certification receives major attention in the debate about sustainable forest management, and in Bolivia a relatively wide experience exists regarding Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certification of natural tropical forests. The present paper studies the conditions imposed on forest operators for getting certified, and the export prices of certified vs. non-certified timber products. This provides a basis for assessing aspects of the effectiveness, efficiency and equity of certification. Effectiveness in terms of certified area has been modest: almost 1 million ha of natural forests, or 14% of the area with management plans, dominated by only five large companies that probably are among the best performing. The conditions for certification are a proxy of its impact, and they mainly regarded documentation, monitoring and environmental issues that might immediately be complied with. Forest management in Bolivia has developed on the basis of an external supported law reform imposing restrictive and controlled regulations and norms, and when fulfilling the new law requirements the FSC principles and criteria are largely met. Only little improvement was obtained through certification in itself. Furthermore, deforestation persists unabated. Therefore, it appears that major roles of the FSC certification have been (i) regulation-oriented verification of compliance with already established norms and (ii) creation of a forum for consensus formation between dominating policy formulating actors. Higher prices, in the range of 5-51%, were paid for the majority of exported certified timber products. There are indications that the price premiums exceed the direct operational costs of certification, but this excess profit will presumably disappear when the market develops. However, the substantial support not based on private initiative that has been given to the certification development restricts the interpretation of the concept as a successful market-based forest policy instrument. The dominance of large enterprises in certification confirms the fear that this tool distorts the conditions of forest production at the national level-small-scale and community based enterprises had difficulties in getting certified.

TI Log export restrictions and trade policies in the Philippines: bane or
   blessing to sustainable forest management?
SO FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS

   general equilibrium model
ID UNITED-STATES; SECTOR; MODEL
AB Since the 1990s, the Philippines has begun to adopt the tenets of sustainable forest management (SFM) with respect to the use and management of its forests. Consequently, government policies affecting the forestry sector have been evolving, to reflect the new forest management paradigm. Although the country's forest policies have been mostly economic-oriented, such policies are now directed at multiple goals including social and environmental goals, either through deliberate considerations or on an ad hoc basis. Most of the policies affecting the forestry sector have been implemented since the 1970s. Such policies include the partial ban on log exports as well as trade policies directed at the exportation of logs and lumber and the importation of pulp. In the 1970s, the forestry sector was notably 1 of the top 10 sectors with respect to export earnings, mainly from the exportation of raw logs. For a country concerned with addressing poverty and deforestation problems, these socio-economic contributions seemed invaluable. However, the negative effects of logging on the forest resource overshadowed the economic benefits derived from such activities. The forest resource base was greatly reduced; consequently, the government implemented a log export ban policy aimed at mitigating deforestation problems. This export ban was also directed at improving the efficiency and competitiveness of the wood processing industry. With the global adoption of SFM and the mounting pressure from lending institutions for policy reforms as instruments of growth and development, the issue is revisited to examine whether these Philippine government policies promote or discourage such multiple goals. This article discusses the repercussions of the log export ban and trade policies on the Philippine government's multiple targets for the economy and for the environment. Using an aggregation of the global trade analysis project model, a computable general equilibrium model, the impacts of these resources and trade policies are analysed. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

AB "Learning to Live Healthy" is a cooperation project between the Central Association of Health Insurers and the Health Associations of Lower Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt and Rhineland-Palatinate. Our goal is to develop a healthy environment for all teachers and students in the "School Organization". Our focus lies - more strongly than with earlier projects for school health promotion - in the improvement of the health of teachers and non-teaching personnel. Not until their resources are strengthened and overwork/overload broken down, can resources be directed to health promotion for and with students, and health risks. connected with social inequalities can be diminished. The project operates with the setting approach, and uses the principles of Workplace Health Management-Integration, Participation and Project Management. The project utilizes the instruments of project organization to jump-start the process of change in the School Organization, systematically, through goal-oriented action and sustainable development, thus improving the quality of education.

DE teachers' health; health promotion; organizational development
AB The goal of this project is the development, implementation and evaluation of a concept designed for sustainable health promotion among occupational and trade school teachers. We assume that for sustainable health promotion - along with a behavioral prevention program - a change is necessary in the structure, as well as, the working and communication processes within schools. The realization of early teacher participation and self regulated cooperative groups initiates comprehensive and goal-oriented developmental processes in the project schools. The organizational development process was accomplished in the following way: At the beginning we conducted a diagnosis of school-specific and individual health risks and the resources available to the project schools. The results were reported for both the individual and for the teacher group. This was intended to clarify the potential for improvement and, thus, strengthen the teachers' motivation toward processes of change. Following the diagnosis, the teachers chose areas of stress-related strain and then worked in groups to develop and implement behaviour and working condition-orientated intervention strategies for health promotion. The diagnosis results confirm the necessity of school-specific health promotion: the schools demonstrate very different demand and resource profiles. Furthermore, is has become evident that the central success factor for health promotion in schools is the teachers'willingness for change. The individual and group reports of the diagnosis results seem to have made clear how essential individual and organisational changes are.

AB In our research project - supported by the German Federal Ministry for Education and Research (BMBF) - 35 key indicators were developed in an ongoing process in co-operation with 10 East German cities, which are all members in the German cities healthy network. With these indicators the cities should take up integrated sustainability - oriented health reporting, from which actions and projects for health promotion and prevention can be derived. The conceptual background for the research project and the reports to be made by the project in co-operation with the cities, are the three policy programmes that to be realised on a county level: Healthy Cities, Local Agenda 21 and the German city development programme "Soziale Stadt (socially oriented city)". The common goal of these programmes is the sustainable improvement of the quality of life in the counties. The project is part of the BMBF-supported research field "problem - oriented regional reporting systems", in which other projects are involved which are mainly being conducted in the newly-formed East German "Lander". In this article we describe the co-operative process of the development of the indicators. A synopsis of already applied or proposed sets of indicators for municipal reporting was the basis for the development of the project's set of 35 key indicators. The set of indicators is presented according to its usefulness for planning and realisation of actions for health promotion on county level. For each of the 35 indicators a meta - data description was made to support the counties and cities in our project for health reporting. These indicator profiles are also helpful and supportive for all counties and citiesaiming at such health reporting. The project started in May 2002 and lasts till Mai 2005, so that most reports should be completed in the spring of 2005.

AB Allies Against Asthma, a working group of the Consortium for Infant and Child Health (CINCH), conducted a comprehensive asthma needs assessment in Hampton Roads, Virginia, in 2001. Results from extant data and parent surveys indicated that asthma prevalence was high (15% to 18%), 45% to 50% of children received primary care for asthma in the emergency department, 30% had been recently hospitalized, and most children were not adequately medicated. Focus groups revealed inadequate asthma education, low income, lack of resources and consistent care, disparities in insurance coverage, and noncompliance with national asthma guidelines. An integrated community asthma action plan was developed and funded. Members were satisfied with the planning process-88% felt the plan reflected the needs assessment, and 86% agreed the plan would effectively improve asthma management. Interventions commenced in January 2002. The inclusive process that led to these interventions will ensure that the project is successful and sustainable.

ID WEED-CONTROL
AB Many vegetable growers rely on methyl bromide or other soil fumigants to manage soil pathogens, nematodes, and weeds. Nonchemical alternatives such as solarization and organic amendments are as yet largely unproven, but do offer promise of more sustainable solutions. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of long-term organic amendments and soil solarization on soil chemical and physical properties and on growth and yield of pepper (Capsicum annuum L.) and watermelon (Citrullus lanatus [Thunb.] Manst.). Main plots consisted of a yearly organic amendment or a nonamendment control. Four subplots of soil sanitation treatments consisted of solarization, methyl bromide, Telone, and nonfumigated. Each subplot was divided into two sub-subplots, one with weed control and one without weed control. Plant biomass was higher in plots with organic amendments than in nonamended plots. There were no differences in marketable pepper and watermelon yields between organic amended and nonamended plots during the 1998-99 and 1999-2000 seasons, respectively. However, higher pepper yields were produced from organic amended plots in the 1999-2000 season. Soil pH and Mehlich 1-extractable P, K, Ca, Mg, Zn, Mn, Fe, and Cu were higher in organic amended plots than in nonamended control plots. Soil organic matter concentration was 3-fold higher in amended soil than in nonamended soil. Effects of soil sanitation and weed management varied with crop and season. The methyl bromide and Telone treatments produced higher yields than soil solarization. In general, weed control did not affect plant biomass and yield for any of the crops and seasons. The results suggest that annual organic amendment applications to sandy soils can increase plant growth and produce higher or comparable yields with less inorganic nutrient input than standard fertilization programs.

TI Educating the compassionate water engineer - a remedy to avoid future
   water management failures?

ID ECOHYDROLOGY; PERSPECTIVE
AB The number of local and regional-scale water management failures appears steadily to increase despite an apparently higher level of engineering solutions at hand. The objective of this paper is to examine the challenges the existing education system needs to meet in order to produce water engineers capable of responding to the complexity of contemporary and future water problems in relation to societal needs. The next generation of water engineers may stay in their professional functions until 2040 or 2050. It is likely that in this period more critical water management and environmental problems will be experienced than have been encountered so far. The question then arises whether the present water engineers have the proper background education to understand environmental, hydrological, ecological and socio-economic problems to resolve related water management problems. Future water engineers must, to a greater extent, include socio-economic consequences in planned and/or designed water management systems and convey greater transparency regarding risks and societal effects.

DE alluvial aquifer; Brazil; exploitation; modelling; Nordeste; recharge;
   semiarid region
AB The exploitation of an alluvial aquifer (2 x 10(6) m(3)) has been developed since 1998 in the Valley of Forquilha (Quixeramobim, State of Ceara). For this purpose, 165 wells were drilled along the 23 km of the valley that supplies 500 families and their farms. Monthly monitoring of piezometric and electrical conductivity (2000-2003) show seasonal variations in the water volume (35%) and in the mean value of the conductivity (800-1200 muS cm(-1)). A conceptual hydrogeological model was developed. Analysis of the data and simulations highlight that the recharge of the aquifer is mainly due to infiltration from the river in the rainy season, which is of the order of 1% of the rain over the catchment area (195 km(2)). The abstractions increase the recharge between 30 and 60%. The model makes it possible to propose scenarios of sustainable exploitation of the water resource in the catchment. For the period between 1970 and 1988, other simulations show that it would have been possible to maintain irrigated cultures on 75 ha for 80% of the time. During the remaining 20%, the water level is too low, and farmers would have to reduce the irrigated area.

AB Variation in maturity-at-age, sex ratio, and potential egg production (through changes in length at age) were examined for northern cod (NAFO Division 2J + 3KL), southern Grand Bank cod (3NO), and southern Newfoundland cod (3Ps). All showed significant interannual variability in each stock. Estimates of reproductive potential were produced by sequentially incorporating estimates of proportion mature at age, sex ratio at age, and potential egg production. The estimates of reproductive potential produced by each method were broadly similar, but there were important differences. This leads to differing perceptions of stock productivity, as measured by relative rate of recruitment of a stock and in the spawning stock produced per recruit. These differing perceptions can have a major impact oil expectations for the recovery of depleted stocks and the sustainability of various levels of fishing. Efforts should be made to improve estimates of reproductive potential by further exploring the impacts of changes in the spawning characteristics of populations, and by collecting such basic information as fecundity data.

AB We have developed a process to fabricate dielectric waveguide structures with long hollow cores formed by etching a sacrificial core material. The process is compatible with other planar silicon fabrication techniques. Using aluminum as the sacrificial material, we have investigated fabrication limits and design parameters that determine mechanical integrity of the waveguides. Internal pressure due to the production of gaseous compounds during the core removal process was identified as the yield-limiting factor. A mechanical model based on finite element analysis and confirmed by experiment, predicts ultimate pressures sustainable by these structures. Waveguides less than 10 pm wide with 2-mum-thick coatings should sustain 50 MPa of internal pressure. Low-loss guided-mode propagation in optical waveguides based on these hollow cores is demonstrated.

AB This review briefly summarizes the latest findings on reproductive endocrinology of Atlantic hagfish (Myxine glutinosa) and implications for fisheries management. In response to a major decline or collapse of the fisheries (groundfish and anadromous species) industry in the Northeast, species that were once considered alternative or underutilized have and are being identified that may be suitable for commercial harvest, one such example is the hagfish. Hagfish in recent years have been sought after as valuable fish not only for their flesh, but also their skin. Currently, there are no regulations governing the harvesting of hagfish along the East Coast. There has been little to no information of the life history of hagfish including growth rate, age determination, reproductive biology, life span, and larval size at hatching. Thus, the level at which a sustainable fisheries for this species can be maintained is unknown. In some parts of the world, hagfish stocks are being depleted due to overfishing. In order for fisheries management to manage its hagfish stocks and develop a sustainable commercial hagfish fishery, critical information is needed to assist in determining the optimal use of this valuable resource.
   Key elements of the reproductive system have not been elucidated in hagfish. However, there is new evidence from recent reproductive studies that Atlantic hagfish may have a seasonal reproductive cycle. These data include seasonal changes in gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), gonadal steroids, estradiol and progesterone, corresponding to gonadal reproductive stages along with the putative identity of a functional corpus luteum. This newly acquired data may provide important information to fisheries managers of the East Coast.

DT Article
AB The approaches of economic and environmental economies with regard to the appraisal of biodiversity arc compared within the framework of sustainable development, through documentary research. The results indicate that the environmental appraisal methods collect a minimal portion of the value of goods and services associated to biodiversity and, when applied, the needed assumptions are grossly arbitrary. According to the perspective of ecological economics it is concluded that any appraisal methodology should include information from other fields, based on systems of values, so as to achieve an adequate interaction among socio-economic and ecological systems to warrant a sustainable management of biodiversity.

AB The author presents his personal experiences of practising ergonomics in industrially developing countries (IDCs), particularly in the rural sector and within the remit of Development Aid Programmes. Some key differences between IDCs and industrially advanced countries (IACs) are outlined and their relevance to ergonomics indicated. Examples of both indigenously and exogenously generated ergonomics research and development projects in IDCs are given. Analysis of these projects indicates a considerable overlap between ergonomics and occupational health and the issues this raises are discussed. Ignorance of the comprehensive nature of ergonomics, and the benefits it can deliver, have adversely affected the progress and outputs of projects aimed at improving human health and (work) performance. It is apparent that some projects, clearly requiring an ergonomics input have not involved a qualified ergonomist in the project team. As a subject, ergonomics fits in well with the sustainable livelihood approach and is well suited to the participatory processes needed to identify appropriate interventions for the alleviation of poverty. It is concluded that ergonomics has more to offer IDCs that is currently being taken up and that ergonomists may need to become more involved with occupational health initiatives in IDCs.

TI Risk, price regulation, and irreversible investment
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL ORGANIZATION

DT Article
DE regulation; cost of capital; rate base; sunk costs
AB We show that regulators' price-setting, rate base, and allowed rate of return decisions are inextricably linked if prices are set so that regulated firms just break even whenever they are forced to invest. Breaking even ex ante is a necessary condition for Ramsey pricing to be sustainable over time. Unless regulators adopt traditional rate of return regulation, the irreversibility of much infrastructure investment significantly alters the results of the approach to price-setting described by Marshall et al. (1981) [Marshall, William J., Yawitz, Jess B., Greenberg, Edward, 1991. Optimal regulation under uncertainty. Journal of Finance 36 (4), 909-921]. In particular, the practice of 'optimizing' inefficient assets out of the regulated firm's rate base, as occurs in total element long-run incremental cost calculations in telecommunications, exposes the firm to demand risk. The firm requires an economically significant premium for bearing this risk, and this premium is a function of both the systematic and unsystematic risk of demand shocks. In addition, we argue that if the firm is to break even under incentive regulation then the level of the rate base will exceed the optimized replacement cost by an amount which we interpret as the value of the excess capacity of the firm's assets. If this component is excluded from the rate base, incentive regulation will not be sustainable. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

   structures; seasonal migration; spate irrigation; Wadi Laba; water

AB The only source of irrigation water in the Wadi Laba (ephemeral stream) spate irrigation system is the flood, which is highly unpredictable in occurrence and amount. It frequently damages the brushwood and indigenous earthen structures, locally known as agims and musghas, making (re)construction and maintenance, and "fair" water distribution, key elements for the system's "sustainability".
   For the past 10 decades, the Wadi Laba farmers have used a number of indigenous water management practices to cope with the (re)construction and maintenance requirements and the need to distribute the floodwater "fairly" within and between the upstream and downstream fields. They have introduced the "full farmers' participation" principle, which obliges each farmer to participate in the (re)construction and maintenance of any damaged structure, regardless of whether or not that structure affects the delivery of water to his/her field. To achieve "fair" water distribution, they have formulated and implemented rules, which among other things, give the tail-end farmers absolute priority water rights to large manageable floods and restrict the rights of the head-end farmers to small floods. These efforts have, however, not been sufficient to enable the farmers to meet their annual food and fodder needs. Hence, as a supplementary livelihood strategy, they have seasonally migrated to the highlands in search of a grazing area for their livestock, and to cultivate their small (less than a hectare) rainfed fields. Nonetheless, this migration coincides with the flood season, making most (re)construction and maintenance, and water distribution activities, more difficult to carry out. To minimize the problem, the farmers have established "effective" organization, led by "strong" leaders that allow short communication lines. Farmers who migrate to the same villages are organized into the same sub-groups, and migrations are arranged on a rotational base, so that there are always some farmers on the ground to look after the flood and to communicate timely with their village colleagues in the highlands, when additional labour is necessary. The paper discusses in detail these management practices and their impact on the livelihood of the farmers. Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

ID DWARFING GENES; RAINFED CONDITIONS; ADAPTATION; IDEOTYPES; TRAITS;
   COMPONENTS; DROUGHT; SYSTEMS
AB In cereal-livestock farming systems of North Africa and West Asia the straw of durum wheat [Triticum turgidum (L.) Thell. ssp. turgidum conv. durum (Desf.) MacKey] is frequently used for feeding animals during the dry season and may enhance the sustainability and the flexibility of farming in various respects. In Algeria the average sale price per unit weight of the durum straw is around 30 % of that of grain. Six tall and 18 semi-dwarf locally well-adapted cultivars were grown in the season 2000/01 at five Algerian locations representing the main durum wheat cropping areas to verify: (i) the impact of straw yield on the economic merit of cultivars for recommendation and (ii) the interest of tall v. semi-dwarf plant types for breeding. The tall material comprised four cultivars derived from local landraces and two old varieties. The semi-dwarf germplasm originated from CIMMYT, ICARDA or various Mediterranean countries. In the economic assessment the straw value was expressed in terms of grain-equivalent, defining an economic yield as: grain yield+(0.30 x straw yield). The merit of individual cultivars was markedly affected by ignoring or taking into account the straw yield. On average, tall germplasm had a moderate (about 3 %) but significant (P < 0.02) economic advantage over semi-dwarf material as a result of much higher straw yield (+25 %) and aerial biomass (+ 12 %) and somewhat lower grain yield (-7 %). However, three semi-dwarf varieties from CIMMYT were top-ranking for economic yield. They possessed outstanding aerial biomass and similar harvest index compared with the mean response of other semi-dwarf germplasm. On average, the tall germplasm showed higher grain yield stability (P < 0.01), lower straw yield stability (P < 0.01) and slightly higher stability of economic yield (P < 0.11) than the semi-dwarf group as measured by Shukla's stability variance. Grain yield was negatively correlated with straw yield (r=-0.41, P < 0.05), and was not correlated with aerial biomass, in the whole set of cultivars. However, it was not correlated with straw yield, and was positively correlated with aerial biomass (r=0.61, P < 0.01), within the semi-dwarf germplasm. Information on straw yield can improve the targeting of cultivars for cereal-livestock farming systems. Breeding for these systems may target either a tall type within semi-dwarf material (i.e. a 'tall dwarf'), or a truly tall plant type.

AB 1. Coupled plant-herbivore models, allowing feedback from plant to herbivore populations and vice versa, enable us to predict the impact of biocontrol agents on their target weed populations; however, they are rarely used in biocontrol studies. We describe the population biology of the invasive plant Echium plantagineum and the weevil Mogulones larvatus, a biocontrol agent, in Australia. In order to understand the dynamics of this plant-herbivore system, a series of coupled models of increasing complexity was developed.
   2. A simple model was extended to include a seed bank, density-dependent plant fecundity, competition between weevil larvae and plant tolerance of herbivory, where below a threshold plants could compensate for larval feeding. Parameters and functional forms were estimated from experimental and field data.
   3. The plant model, in the absence of the weevil, exhibited stable dynamics and provided a good quantitative description of field densities before the weevil was introduced.
   4. In the coupled plant-herbivore model, density dependence in both plant fecundity and weevil larval competition stabilized the dynamics. Without larval competition the model was unstable, and plant tolerance of herbivory exacerbated this instability. This was a result of a time delay in plant response to herbivore densities.
   5. Synthesis and applications. The coupled plant-herbivore model allowed us to predict whether stable coexistence of target plant and biocontrol agents was achievable at an acceptable level. We found this to be the case for the Echium-Mogulones system and believe that similar models would be of use when assessing new agents in this and other invasive plant biocontrol systems. Density dependence in new biocontrol agents should be assessed in order to determine whether it is likely to result in the aims of classical biocontrol: low, stable and sustainable populations of plant and herbivore. Further work should be done to characterize the strength of density dependence according to the niche occupied by the biocontrol agent, for example the strength and functional form of density dependence in stem borers may be quite different to that of defoliators.

AB LiCoO2 cathodes coated with Al2O3 generated from carboxylate - alumoxanes have demonstrated sustainable extended cyclability. The carboxylate - alumoxanes were prepared by reacting boehmite with acetic and substituted acetic acids. TEM images of the coated powders revealed that the coatings were compact and had an average thickness of about 20 nm. XRD data on the coated materials indicated minor changes in the values of the lattice parameters, suggesting the formation of solid solutions of the composition LiAlyCo1-yO2 on the surface during calcination. ESCA depth profiles of the constituent elements in the coated particles support this theory. R-factor values from XRD analysis and galvanostatic cycling studies suggest that a 1.0 wt. % coating formed from a ( methoxyethoxy) acetate-alumoxane enhanced the cyclability by a factor of 12. The improved performance is attributed to suppression of the cycle-limiting phase transitions accompanying the charge - discharge processes. Being without environmentally hazardous organic chemicals and by-products, the coating procedure based on carboxylate - alumoxanes is a clean and benign process for industrial exploitation.

AB Growth, productivity and potential for exploitation of the clam Tawera gayi from shallow waters (3-5 m) of Ushuaia Bay, Beagle Channel were investigated. Mean abundance and biomass in the study area were 1091 +/- 737 ind. m(-2) and 901.83 g SFWM m(-2) (shell-free wet mass), respectively. Individual growth was described best by the von Bertalanffy growth model with the parameter values H-infinity = 28.03 mm, K = 0.288 year(-1), t(0) = -0.34 (r(2) = 0.83). Annual production of the population was estimated to be 120.45 g SFWM m(-2) year(-1), corresponding to a production-to-biomass ratio (P/B) of 0.134 year(-1). The single negative exponential mortality model does not fit the population mortality pattern, but predation by gastropods (Xymenopsis muriciformis, Trophon geversianus, Natica sp.) appears to be the major cause of mortality. These highly mobile predators together with the comparatively slow growth and low turnover of T. gayi in Ushuaia Bay limit its potential for sustainable commercial exploitation.

AB Resource extraction companies worldwide are involved with Indigenous peoples. Historically these interactions have been antagonistic, yet there is a growing public expectation for improved ethical performance of resource industries to engage with Indigenous peoples. (Crawley and Sinclair, Journal of Business Ethics 45, 361-373 ( 2003)) proposed an ethical model for human resource practices with Indigenous peoples in Australian mining companies. This paper expands on this work by re-framing the discussion within the context of sustainable development, extending it to Canada, and generalizing to other resource industries. We argue that it is unethical to sacrifice the viability of Indigenous cultures for industrial resource extraction; it is ethical to engage with indigenous peoples in a manner consistent with their wishes and needs as they perceive them. We apply these ideas to a case study in the coastal temperate rainforest of Clayoquot Sound, British Columbia, Canada. In this case a scientific panel comprised of Nuu-Chah-Nulth elders, forest scientists and management professionals, achieved full consensus on developing sustainable forest practice standards by drawing equally on Indigenous traditional ecological knowledge and Western science in the context of one of the most heated and protracted environmental conflicts in Canadian history. The resulting sustainable forest practice standards were later adopted by leading forestry firms operating on the coast. Our analysis of this scientific panel's success provides the basis for advancing an ethical approach to sustainable development with Indigenous peoples. This ethical approach is applicable to companies working in natural resource industries where the territories of Indigenous peoples are involved.

ID AGRICULTURAL-RESEARCH
AB Resource-based views of the firm and in particular Kay's (Why Firms Succeed. Oxford: Oxford Univ. Press, 1995) model of sustainable competitive advantage have been used to advance an understanding of differences in the competitive advantage of private-sector firms. We extend the analysis to a public-sector firm where its major purpose includes engaging in public good by giving away its knowledge base and services. The case highlights the paradox that many public-sector organizations face in simultaneously pursuing public good and sustainable competitive advantage. While Kay's model is applicable for understanding intergovernmental agency competition, we find it necessary to incorporate resource dependency theory to address the paradox. Implications for theory and practice are provided. (C) 2002 Elsevier Inc. All rights reseved.

AB The sustainability of surgically induced weight loss implies that energy homeostasis is favorably altered. We investigated the hypothesis that laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB) induces prolonged satiety and that plasma ghrelin is involved.
   Seventeen weight-stable subjects who had achieved LAGB-induced weight loss attended blind crossover breakfast tests, one with optimal band restriction and one with reduced restriction. Standardized meals were consumed (0900 h) after 14-h fasting. Satiety visual analog scales were completed hourly (0700-1100 h) before and after feeding. Blood glucose, plasma insulin, ghrelin, and leptin levels were measured. Seventeen body mass index-matched controls were tested.
   Optimal restriction was associated with significantly greater fasting and postprandial satiety levels than reduced restriction (P < 0.01). Glucose, insulin, ghrelin, and leptin levels did not alter between optimal and reduced restriction. LAGB subjects displayed higher ghrelin (+12%, P = 0.13) and lower glucose (-17%, P = 0.018), insulin (-33%, P = 0.016), and leptin (-32%, P = 0.05) 4-h area under the curve levels than controls.
   Optimal LAGB restriction increased fasting and postprandial satiety levels. This supports the hypothesis that LAGB provides prolonged satiety, present even during fasting, favorably influencing energy homeostasis. Plasma insulin, leptin, and ghrelin appeared unrelated to the satiety effect and displayed orexigenic compensatory changes. Identifying the mechanisms underlying LAGB-induced satiety may assist the understanding of human energy homeostasis and obesity.

AB Given a bipartite graph with bipartition V and W, a cover is a subset C subset of or equal to V such that each node of W is adjacent to at least one node in C. The set covering problem seeks a minimum cardinality cover. Set covering has many practical applications. In the context of reserve selection for conservation of species, V is a set of candidate sites from a reserve network, W is the set of species to be protected, and the edges describe which species are represented in each site. Some covers however may assume spatial configurations which are not adequate for conservational purposes. Indeed, for sustainability reasons the fragmentation of existing natural habitats should be avoided, since this is recognized as being disruptive to the species adapted to the habitats. Thus, connectivity appears to be an important issue for protection of biological diversity. We therefore consider along with the bipartite graph, a graph G with node set V, describing the adjacencies of the elements of V, and we look for those covers C subset of or equal to V for which the subgraph of G induced by C is connected. We call such covers connected covers. In this paper we introduce and study some valid inequalities for the convex hull of the set of incidence vectors of connected covers.

DE sustainability; real interest rates; sovereign default
ID DEBT; REPUDIATION; CONSUMPTION
AB We analyze the joint determination of interest rate risk and debt sustainability for governments with fiscal imbalances. Because higher interest rates imply increased debt services, they worsen the government's financial situation and increase the probability of sovereign default. Thus, higher interest rates eventually lead to a decrease in the real demand for government bonds, which imposes an additional constraint on government debt sustainability.

SO JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT ECONOMICS

ID LAND DEGRADATION; SUSTAINABILITY; AGRICULTURE
AB Salt and water transport external costs of irrigation are borne disproportionately by lower elevation farmers. The relationship between fields for an optimal Pigouvian tax plan varies considerably as the amount of available water changes, demonstrating that a simple rule cannot be relied upon. A numerical example demonstrates the optimal application pattern and Pigouvian tax plan in contrast to the sequential Nash equilibrium. Shadow values for water are used to argue that between distributaries, the second best optimum is unlikely to be equal allocation. Physical measures of soil state are also shown to be worse under the optimal plan, throwing doubt on their usefulness. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Sustainable disposal of domestic sanitary waste
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING-ASCE
LA English
DT Article
ID SEWER SOLIDS; TRANSPORT
AB The study presented is an example of the assessment of the relative sustainability of either option for disposal of domestic sanitary waste, either via the toilet or via the solid waste route. This required an evaluation of the total (social, economic, environmental, and technical) benefit/cost of implementing and adopting the alternative routes and an assessment of public responsiveness to encouragement to change sanitary waste disposal practices. It illustrates how, even for an apparently straightforward either/or question, the assessment of relative sustainability is complex and the amount of data needed to quantify sustainability indicators is prodigious. The study also provides an appraisal of the effectiveness of public campaigns to reduce waterborne disposal. Important information regarding public attitude and behavior in relation to wastewater systems has been acquired and lessons for ways of encouraging behavioral change to more sustainable ways of living have been gleaned.

TI Explaining MERCOSUR's survival: Strategic sources of Argentine-Brazilian
   convergence
SO JOURNAL OF LATIN AMERICAN STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
AB This article aims to address a fundamental question for analysts and students of MERCOSUR: what explains the bloc's survival despite its recurrent crises and frequent pessimistic forecasts predicting its collapse? It argues that the maintenance of co-operation after 1999, when the economic and political economy rationale of the project had almost disappeared, is best understood in terms of the convergent strategic interests of MERCOSUR partners. This convergence of interests in the continuity of the regional regime reflects three types of strategic incentives. First, defensive considerations reflecting external forces and a shared sense of vulnerability vis-A-vis the external environment have provided the main motivation for partners to engage in negotiations and attempt to move the process of integration forward. Secondly, the offensive incentives faced by Brazil, given its relatively stronger position within the region have also worked to foster regional co-operation. But besides these power considerations, the sustainability of co-operation has been at least partially assisted by an emerging process of socialisation among executive officials taking place within regional institutions. These processes of increased interaction and enmeshment have reinforced interests in regional integration, giving way to positive incentives to maintain MERCOSUR.

AB Factors related to the success and survival of skill-based pay (SBP) plans are addressed in a longitudinal study of 97 facilities. Results indicate that certain design features and support variables relate to increased workforce flexibility and to SBP survival, and supervisor support also relates strongly to SBP survival. The results also show that SBP plans are more successful and sustainable in manufacturing facilities than in service facilities, and SBP survival is less likely in facilities pursuing a technical innovation strategy. Implications of the research for theory and practice regarding SBP plans, compensation systems, and human resources management innovations are addressed.

AB Many not-for-profit organizations rely on volunteers to help accomplish their service objectives. Although volunteers work alongside or in some cases replace employees in the delivery of service, incorporating volunteer labor into the service delivery system of the not-for-profit poses unique challenges. Understanding these challenges represents an important foundation building step in understanding the implications for service design and service operations when using volunteers. This paper identifies and describes service design and operational factors relevant to volunteer satisfaction in not-for-profit organizations. Using data collected from 288 volunteers working in 43 not-for-profit agencies, the study explores the elements of service delivery that impact volunteer satisfaction, and further tests the relationship between volunteer satisfaction and loyalty to the not-for-profit organization. Findings include that satisfied volunteers are more likely to remain for longer periods of time with the same organization, are more likely to donate financially to the not-for-profit, and are more likely to recommend the volunteer experience to others. Each of these outcomes helps to ensure the continued sustainability of the not-for-profit organization. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Partitioning and Transmutation (P&T) of Minor Actinides (MAs) and Long-Lived Fission Products (LLFP) arising out of the back-end of the fuel cycle would be one of the key-steps in any future sustainable nuclear fuel cycle. Pyro-chemical separation methods would form a critical stage of P&T by recovering long-lived elements and thus reducing the environmental impact by the back-end of the fuel-cycle. This paper attempts to overview global developments of pyro-chemical process that are envisaged in advanced nuclear fuel cycles. Research and development needs for molten-salt electro-refining as well as molten salt extraction process that are foreseen as partitioning methods for spent nuclear fuels such as oxide, metal and nitride fuels from thermal or fast reactors; high level liquid waste from back-end fuel cycle as well as targets from sub-critical Accelerator Driven Sub-critical reactors would be addressed. The role of high temperature thermodynamic data of minor actinides in defining efficiency of recovery or separation of minor actinides from other fission products such as lanthanides will also be illustrated. In addition, the necessity for determination of accurate high temperature thermodynamic data of minor actinides would be discussed. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This article adapts a regional adjustment model to examine land use change in the Rocky Mountain West region of the United States. Three interrelated questions motivate the research. How does the proliferation of urban, suburban, and exurban sprawl in the Rocky Mountain West relate to the population and employment growth process? Are population and employment endogenously determined there? And what does this imply for the sustainability of economic development in the region? Through a series of regional adjustment models, the empirical analysis links population and employment growth in the Rocky Mountain West to explicit spatial outcomes and delivers substantive evidence of endogeneity between the two. The results suggest that the long-term prosperity of the region depends on the preservation of the high quality of life it offers, and that greater intergovernmental coordination, careful infrastructure planning, and attention to the character of its economic structure may help to accomplish this. Future research should focus on looking deeper into certain explanatory variables used in this analysis and on developing a better picture of what the spatial equilibrium that regional adjustment models emulate may look like.

AB The common filamentous fungi can sorb heavy metals (Zn, Cd, Pb, Fe, Ni, Ag, Th, Ra & U) from aqueous solutions to varying extents. Fungal biosorption largely depends on parameters such as pH, metal ion and biomass concentration, physical or chemical pretreatment of biomass, and presence of various legends in solution. When compared with commercial ion exchange resins, carbons and metal oxides, fungal derivatives generally perform well. Biomass can be regenerated by using various elutants. The availability of variety of biomass and their metal binding potential makes it a economical and Sustainable option for developing effluent treatment process for removal and recovery of heavy metals.

TI Risk in project preparation - 'determining the project needs and the
   effects on the management strategy'
SO JOURNAL OF THE SOUTH AFRICAN INSTITUTE OF MINING AND METALLURGY
LA English
DT Article
AB in general, overall experience has shown that the approach to the appointment of a project manager is given much attention, but little specific attention is given first to the risk associated with the project conceptual design and its overall executability within either the new legislative framework or the sustainability of the outcome.
   The risk in project executability and sustainability within the 'new age' legislative framework of the Mining Charter, etc, is itself however, of far greater importance. The degree of importance being defined by the intended projects impact on the business going forward. This is particularly the case where the intention of the implementation is effectively to turn around or even enhance a loss-making strategic investment like a mine or process plant operation in an 'old-order rights' or Brownfield's operation.
   This paper attempts to highlight the importance of a 'pre-project project' (PPP) to mitigate the risk in the 'new age,, with specific reference to operational due diligence (ODD) and project conceptual design.

TI Characterization of the coal resources of South Africa
SO JOURNAL OF THE SOUTHERN AFRICAN INSTITUTE OF MINING AND METALLURGY
LA English
DT Article
AB Estimates for South Africa's coal recoverable reserves made in 1999 range from nine to 59 billion tons; latest estimates by the Minerals Bureau suggest that 33 billion tons is a more likely figure. As much as 70% of that coal is located in the Waterberg, Witbank, and Highveld coalfields, as well as lesser amounts in the Ermelo, Free State and Springbok Flats coalfields. However, the Witbank and Highveld coalfields are approaching exhaustion (estimated 9 billion tons of recoverable coal remaining in each), while the coal quality or mining conditions in the Waterberg, Free State and Springbok Flats coalfields are significant barriers to immediate, conventional exploitation. New extraction technologies, technologies exploiting the energy content of the coal in situ, as well as suitable uses and markets for low-grade, high-ash coal are required before the country can utilize its admittedly vast coal resources.
   Major challenges for exploiting some Limpopo province coalfields are severe water shortages, insufficiently developed infrastructure, fragile environments and poor roof conditions due to the depth and complex geology. in the Central Basin (Witbank, Highveld and Ermelo coalfields) technical innovations for thin seam extraction, economic mining of both pillar coal and intrusion-fragmented resource blocks and the utilization of lower-grade coals are required. The success of the fluidized bed combustion technology is necessary to utilize the low-grade coals of the Free State and Molteno coalfields, while environmental exemption for past problems, together with strategies for mining small, disjointed thin-seam resource blocks, is required in KwaZulu-Natal. Clean coal technologies, coal cost and quality, environmental considerations, sustainable development, the growth of the South African economy and Government's regulation of the electricity industry are the main challenges to the continued use of coal as South Africa's primary energy source.

AB Despite the fact that mollusc species play an important role in many aquatic ecosystems, little is known about their biodiversity and conservation genetics. Freshwater pearl mussel (Margaritifera margaritifera L.) populations are seriously declining all over Europe and a variety of conservation programs are being established to support the remaining endangered central European populations. In order to provide guidelines for conservation strategies and management programs, we investigated the genetic structure of 24 freshwater pearl mussel populations originating from five major central European drainages including Elbe, Danube, Rhine, Maas and Weser, representing the last and most important populations in this area. We present a nondestructive sampling method of haemolymph for DNA analyses, which is applicable for endangered bivalves. The analyses of nine microsatellite loci with different levels of polymorphism revealed a high degree of fragmented population structure and very different levels of genetic diversity within populations. These patterns can be explained by historical and demographic effects and have been enforced by anthropogenic activities. Even within drainages, distinct conservation units were detected, as revealed from high F-ST values, private alleles and genetic distance measures. Populations sampled close to contact zones between main drainage systems showed lowest levels of correct assignment to present-day drainage systems. Populations with high priority for conservation should not only be selected by means of census population size and geographical distance to other populations. Instead, detailed genetic analyses are mandatory for revealing differentiation and diversity parameters, which should be combined with ecological criteria for sustainable conservation and recovery programs.

AB Agroforestry ecosystems may be an important resource for conservation and sustainable use of tropical trees, but little is known of the genetic diversity they contain. Inga edulis, a widespread indigenous fruit tree in South America, is used as a model to assess the maintenance of genetic diversity in five planted vs. five natural stands in the Peruvian Amazon. Analysis of five SSR (simple sequence repeat) loci indicated lower allelic variation in planted stands [mean corrected allelic richness 31.3 (planted) and 39.3 (natural), P = 0.009].. Concerns regarding genetic erosion in planted Amazonian tree stands appear valid, although allelic variation on-farm is still relatively high.

AB This paper examines the changing conditions, including accelerating environmental degradation and the influence of modernism, and the impact that these are having on Tibetan architecture and the Tibetan building tradition. Examples of architectural design and resource management projects throughout the region are used to explore how the cultural significance of building traditions and environmental resource management can provide a methodology to promote preservation of traditional architecture and the natural environment. The issues examined and solutions explored could easily apply to other rapidly changing mountain regions of the world where the deterioration of natural resources calls for a richer under-standing of the connection between environmental and cultural sustainability. The growth of ecotourism as an industry in many mountain regions gives greater weight to the issues discussed.

AB The aim of this study was to develop a comprehensive index system based on remote sensing (RS) and geographic information system (GIS) techniques to evaluate the status quo of ecological security in the farming-pastoral zone of northern China, for the purpose of facilitating sustainable development in ecotone regions. Taking a typical transitional piedmont region with farming-pastoral production mode as a case study area, the region's present ecological security situation was evaluated by constructing an index system with 3 types of indicators. These indicators were: 1) vegetation growth, measured by the decadal difference in the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI); 2) change in landscape pat-terns, measured by the deviation of present from potential landscapes; and 3) severity of soil erosion, measured by organic matter content in topsoil. Data for the indicators, derived from RS images, historical maps, field surveys, and archival materials, were all mapped with the aid of a digital elevation model (DEM), according to their conjugation relationships. The results were obtained by classifying different combinations of elements in an index matrix of 3 indicators by means of mapping. The final results show that nearly the entire study area was in a condition ranging from somewhat insecure (SIN) to insecure (INS), with an average score of 3.46 in a 5-grade range, indicating declining ecological security. The situation was better in the farming-pastoral district. The whole region needs to adjust its production modes to learn from practices in the farming-pastoral district, in order to alleviate deterioration and improve ecological security in the region.

AB Scanning probe microscope (SPM) oxidation was used to form zirconium oxide features on 200 nm thick ZrN films. The features exhibit rapid yet controlled growth kinetics, even in contact mode with 70 V dc applied between the probe tip and substrate. The features grown for times longer than 10 s are higher than 200 nm, and reach more than 1000 nm in height after 300 s. Long-time oxidation experiments and selective etching of the oxides and nitrides lead us to propose that as the oxidation reaches the silicon substrate, delamination occurs with the simultaneous formation of a thin layer of new material at the ZrN/Si interface. High-voltage oxide growth on ZrN is fast and sustainable, and the robust oxide features are promising candidates for multiscale (nanometre-to-micrometre) applications.

ID RESOURCES
AB Throughout history, mining communities have invariably found themselves striving for a good quality of life and a long-term future. In the 21st century, problems of maintaining the economic vitality of mining regions are now compounded by concerns about the biophysical integrity of the local environment. In regions of the world where the economic viability of the resource is marginal and achieving a reasonable quality of life is a daily struggle, sustainable mining may seem to be a dubious prospect at best. Yet the twin imperatives of global political forces and burgeoning environmental concerns are requiring industry, governments and other interests to re-conceptualize the way in which mining takes place in communities. Although mining itself may not be seen as an industry that contributes to the achievement of environmental objectives, it could - with careful planning - be used as a tool to foster a more sustainable and healthier community. This argument is considered in the context of the coal mining region of Santa Catarina, Brazil.

ID CURCAS
AB The concept of substituting bio-diesel produced from plantations on eroded soils for conventional diesel fuel has gained widespread attention in India. In recent months, the Indian central Government as well as some state governments have expressed their support for bringing marginal lands, which cannot be used for food production, under cultivation for this purpose.
   Jatropha curcas is a well established plant in India. It produces oil-rich seeds, is known to thrive on eroded lands, and to require only limited amounts of water, nutrients and capital inputs. This plant offers the option both to cultivate wastelands and to produce vegetable oil suitable for conversion to bio-diesel. More versatile than hydrogen and new propulsion systems such as fuel cell technology, bio-diesel can be used in today's vehicle fleets worldwide and may also offer a viable path to sustainable transportation, i.e., lower greenhouse gas emissions and enhanced mobility, even in remote areas. Mitigation of global warming and the creation of new regional employment opportunities can be important cornerstones of any forward looking transportation system for emerging economies.

AB CARIBELATE, the Caribbean Environmental Laboratory for the Advancement of Technological Entrepreneurship is an evolving institutional concept, as well as a physical complex, that provides a dynamic environment for public, academic and private sector organizations to conduct proof of concept technology demonstrations in a landfill environment. This article traces the successful networking of demonstrations at a landfill in New Jersey and the subsequent design of the CARIBELATE project in the Municipality of Carolina, Puerto Rico. The institutional model developed for the Puerto Rico facility has brought together an unlikely combination of stakeholders. Those from the private sector, here called industrial partners, are paired with academic researchers to optimize products for local markets. The basic technology system demonstrated in New Jersey and to be replicated in Puerto Rico removes harmful contaminants from landfill gas and in so doing produces a variety of useful products. A portion of the landfill gas is utilized for micro-turbine electricity generation and for heating a demonstration greenhouse that houses aquaculture coupled with hydroponic crop production, where aquaculture effluents are recycled as plant nutrients. A strict protocol to verify emission reduction is imposed on all the demonstrations at the CARIBELATE project. Although greenhouse gas credit verfication is not the prime mission, it is suggested that the credits verified from these demonstrations are of high quality, and can serve as an excellent training platform. CARIBELATE is conceived to be operated at the municipal level and contribute to income generation and economic development. The continuing networking of stakeholders from the public and private sectors offers some potential guidance for replicating this design in the developing world.

AB The development and effective introduction of strategies designed to ensure the ecologically and economically sustainable utilization of coastal and marine resources is perhaps the major challenge for Small Island Developing States (SIDS). In response, the 1994 Barbados Programme of Action (BPoA) called upon the SIDS to implement appropriate coastal and marine strategies and, crucially, ensure that such strategies were integrated into sustainable national development plans (NDPs). This article examines the extent to which contemporary NDPs and donor support programmes have incorporated the fisheries sector - arguably the most important coastal/marine resource for many SIDS - into such documents. Applying an assessment methodology, originally developed to identify levels of environmental mainstreaming within World Bank country assistance strategies to NDPs and donor support programmes, we are able to identify those SIDS who have most effectively integrated the fisheries sector into such documents. Comparison with data indicating the importance of the sector to the national economy (in terms of generating foreign exchange, employment generation and/or supporting domestic protein consumption levels) enables us to pinpoint those countries with substantial fisheries sectors, but a correspondingly lower than expected degree of sectoral mainstreaming. We suggest that the January 2005 review of the BPoA offers an opportune moment for such countries to redress these omissions.

AB This article makes an assessment of the following key natural resources in the Okavango Delta: arable land, basket-making resources, fish stocks, and river reeds. Non-data-intensive socio-economic indicators (as opposed to conventional data-intensive indicators) of trends in resource prices, trends in labour time for resource extraction, substitution of less preferred commodities, maximum sustainable yield and perceived scarcity were utilized to assess the scarcity of the resources. The study reveals that basket-weaving resources, land for flood recession arable (molapo) agriculture, and river reeds are increasingly becoming scarce in the harvesting areas, whereas fish stocks are still abundant. It is recommended that appropriate policies should be introduced for the management of natural resources. Property rights could be granted to communities to manage natural resources such as fish and veld products in line with the wildlife model for community based natural resources management (CBNRM). In addition, the authors suggest that the Government of Botswana should take the responsibility for allocating land for molapo arable farming in order to make it more accessible.

   communities and small scale mining (CASM)
AB This short note discusses methodological obstacles to the collection of microeconomic data in artisanal and small-scale mining communities. International donor organizations are supporting policy efforts that enhance the contribution to poverty alleviation of this mining subsector. The design and evaluation of such policy interventions require data on income, expenditure, investment, and savings in mining households and communities. These data are difficult to come by. Incomes are variable; migrants may work far from home; miners often work informally and sometimes illegally; mining populations and communities are heterogeneous and transient; and miners have many reasons to distort information. Legalization and organization of miners in cooperatives would facilitate documentation and research. These processes, however, are beyond the control of the typical policy consultant or donor organization. On their part, these parties can adopt an alternative model of research. This model involves the community in project development, data collection, and monitoring. It emphasizes continuity, cultural diversity, trust building and learning. The data thus collected should provide a firm basis for programmes that promote more sustainable livelihoods in artisanal and small-scale mining communities.

AB In the development of short fallow systems as alternatives to shifting cultivation in West Africa, a long-term trial was established at the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA) on an Alfisol in the forest-savanna transitional zone of southwestern Nigeria, comparing three fallow systems; natural regrowth fallow, cover crop fallow and alley cropping on soil productivity and crop yield sustainability. The natural fallow system consisted of natural regrowth of mainly Chromolaena odorata shrub as fallow vegetation. The cover crop fallow system consisted of Pueraria phaseoloides, a herbaceous legume as fallow vegetation. The alley cropping system consisted of woody hedgerows of Leucaena leucocephala as fallow vegetation. The fallow lengths were 0 (continuous cropping), 1, 2 and 3 years after 1 year of maize/cassava intercropping. Biomass produced from natural fallow and cover crop fallow was burnt during the land preparation. Fertilizer was not applied throughout the study. Without fertilizer application, maize yield declined from above 3.0 t ha(-1) to below 0.5 t ha(-1) during 12 years of cultivation (1989-2000) on a land cleared from a 23-year old secondary forest. Temporal change in cassava tuber yield was erratic. Mean maize grain yields from 1993-2000 except for 1999 were higher in cover crop fallow system (1.89 t ha(-1)) than in natural fallow system (1.73 t ha(-1)), while natural fallow system outperformed alley cropping system (1.46 t ha(-1)). During the above 7 years, mean cassava tuber yield in cover crop system (7.7 t ha(-1)) did not differ from natural fallow system (8.2 t ha(-1)), and both systems showed higher cassava tuber than the alley cropping system (5.7 t ha(-1)). The positive effect of fallowing on crop yields was observed for both crops in the three systems, however, insignificant effects were seen when fallow length exceeded 1 year for cover crop and alley cropping, and 2 years for natural fallow. Soil pH, organic carbon, available P and exchangeable Ca, Mg and K decreased considerably after 12 years of cultivation, even in a 3-year fallow subplot. After 12 years, soil organic carbon (SOC) within 0-5 cm depth in alley cropping (13.9 g kg(-1)) and natural fallow (13.7 g kg(-1)) was higher than in cover crop fallow (11.6 g kg(-1)). Whereas significant increase in SOC with either natural fallow or alley cropping was observed only after 2 or 3 years of fallow, the SOC in the 1-year fallow alley cropping subplot was higher than that in continuous cropping natural fallow subplot. It can be concluded from our study that in transforming shifting cultivation to a permanent cropping, fallow with natural vegetation (natural fallow), herbaceous legumes (cover crop fallow) and woody legumes (alley cropping) can contribute to the maintenance of crop production and soil fertility, however, length of fallow period does not need to exceed 2 years. When the fallow length is reduced to 1 year, a better alternative to natural regrowth fallow would be the cover crop for higher maize yield and alley cropping for higher soil organic matter. For fallow length of 2 years, West African farmers would be better off with the natural fallow system.

AB This paper analyses the relationship between environmental proactivity and business performance on a sample of 186 industrial companies. This relationship is approached by studying a bundle of relationships between different dimensions or manifestations of environmental proactivity and different measures of business performance. The analysis in part supports the idea that environmental management can bring about competitive opportunities for companies, although it also reveals that some environmental practices produce negative effects. It is thus concluded that there is no one single response for the question of whether environmental proactivity has positive effects on business performance and that this relationship must be disaggregated into more specific and concrete relationships.

AB Subcutaneous immunization with SYI, a peptide construct based on Streptococcus mutans glucan binding protein B (GbpB) residues 113-132, significantly reduces experimental dental caries. Since mucosal immunization may be preferred for human vaccine applications, the present objective was to determine what formulation of SYI combined with polylactide-coglycolide microparticles could give rise to significant levels of salivary IgA antibody reactive with the native GbpB protein. A comparison of the SYI construct, loaded into or mixed with polylactide-coglycolide revealed the SYI-loaded microparticles to induce significant and sustainable levels of salivary and nasal wash IgA antibody to the peptide and the native protein. SYI mixed with unloaded microparticles was less effective in mucosal antibody response induction. These studies indicate that mucosal immunization with the SYI construct can induce salivary IgA antibody to a pathogenesis-associated component of S. mutans if delivered within polylactide-coglycolide microparticles, suggesting that this approach could successfully induce protective salivary immunity to dental caries caused by S. mutans.

AB Somatic embryogenesis ( SE), the most promising technology to multiply high-value coniferous trees from advanced breeding and genetic engineering programs, is expected to play an important role in increasing productivity, sustainability, and uniformity of future forests in the United States. For commercial use, SE technology must work with a variety of genetically diverse trees. Initiation in loblolly pine ( LP; Pinus taeda L.), our main focus species, is often recalcitrant for desirable genotypes. Initiation of LP, slash pine (SP; Pinus elliottii), Douglas-fir (DF; Pseudotsuga menziesii), and Norway spruce (NS; Picea abies) were improved through the use of paclobutrazol, a gibberellin synthesis inhibitor. Paclobutrazol was effective at concentrations ranging from 0.25 mg/l to 3.0 mg/l (0.85 - 10.2 muM) and optimal in LP at 1.0 mg/l. Using control media (no paclobutrazol) and 0.33 - 1.0 mg/l paclobutrazol, initiation percentages in LP, SP, DF, and NS were improved from 37.7% to 44.2% ( across experiments), 19.3% to 28.5%, 16.9% to 23.7%, and 38.8% to 48.5%, respectively. Other gibberellin inhibitors such as flurprimidol, chlormequat-Cl, and daminozide also caused statistically significant increases in LP initiation when added to the medium at concentrations of 0.34, 10.0, and 1.0 muM, respectively. No detrimental effects on subsequent embryo development were observed when 29 new initiations from medium without GA inhibitor and 28 new initiations from medium containing paclobutrazol were tracked through culture capture, liquid culture establishment, cotyledonary embryo development, and germination.

AB We report a protocol for in vitro germination and sustainable growth of two tropical mistletoes, Dendrophthoe pentandra and Macrosolen cochinchinensis. Normal mistletoe shoots with haustoria have been produced using Murashige and Skoog (MS) media supplemented with coconut water (15-20% v/v) in ventilated culture vessels. Germination of mistletoes took place on hormone-free basal MS media, and the time needed for germination was much shorter for Macrosolen than for Dendrophthoe. After germination, further development of the mistletoes required a hormonal input from the medium. We found that 20 muM 6-benzylaminopurine (BA) did allow normal development of only Dendrophthoe, while coconut water (15-20% v/v) gave complete development of both species in ventilated culture vessels. Multiplication of these mistletoes is also possible via the callus stage using half-strength MS media supplemented with BA at various concentrations in ventilated culture vessels. This is probably the first report of a successful culture for the mistletoe genus of Macrosolen. Compared to Macrosolen, the nutritional and hormonal requirements for Dendrophthoe are less demanding, making the latter a useful model for further mistletoe research.

   DIETS
AB Obesity is a serious and increasing health issue. Approximately two-thirds of adults in the UK are now overweight or obese. Recent public health reports firmly reinforce the importance of engaging individuals to look after their health, including their weight. They also spell out the need for individuals to be supported more actively, on many levels, to enable this 'engagement'. Meanwhile, national surveys indicate that approximately two-thirds of adults are concerned about weight control, with one-third actively trying to lose weight. This finding is hardly surprising considering current weight statistics, plus the plethora of popular diets on offer. Weight-loss methods include diet clubs, diet books, exercise, meal replacements, advice from healthcare professionals and following a self-styled diet. Obesity is a multi-factorial problem, and losing weight and, in particular, maintaining weight loss is difficult and often elusive. It is argued that the modern obesogenic or 'toxic' environment has essentially taken body-weight control from an instinctive 'survival' process to one that needs sustained cognitive and skill-based control. The evidence suggests that health professionals can help individuals achieve longer-term weight control by supporting them in making sustainable lifestyle changes using a range of behavioural techniques. These techniques include: assessing readiness to change; self-monitoring; realistic goal setting; dietary change; increased physical activity; stimulus control; cognitive restructuring; relapse management; establishing ongoing support. Consistently working in a client-centred way is also being increasingly advocated and incorporated into practice to help motivate and encourage, rather than hinder, the individual's progress.

AB The World Health Organization (WHO) has a commitment to helping Member States achieve safe, sustainable and health-enhancing human environments, protected from biological. chemical and physical agents. The latter includes advising on the health impact of electromagnetic fields (EMFs) and radiation.
   The results of the WHO/ICNIRP/NRPB workshop oil static magnetic fields, published in this volume. provide a valuable and much needed contribution to the health risk assessment of exposure to static electric and magnetic fields, which is currently being coordinated by the WHO's International EMF Project. This WHO health risk assessment will be published as an environmental health criteria (EHC) monograph in early 2005.
   This paper briefly gives an overview of the process of developing the WHO static fields EHC monograph. the criteria applied to studies that could contribute to the EHC, along with the 'weight-of-evidence' approach to health risk assessment. In addition, there is an increasing awareness of the need to account for uncertainty in the science database. This is traditionally addressed by further research. and the EMF project addresses these needs through the development of a 'research agenda'. However, research programmes may take several years to complete, and the Ions! latency associated with diseases such as cancer in people may also preclude a rapid outcome in some studies. The issue of current uncertainty Is being addressed by the WHO EMF project through the development of a 'precautionary framework' in which precautionary measures will be applied to policy recommendations.

AB PhosphaBase is an ontology-driven database resource containing information on the protein phosphatase family. It is the first public resource dedicated to protein phosphatases, which are enzymes that perform dephosphorylation reactions. In conjunction with the phosphorylation action of protein kinases, phosphatases are involved in important control and communication mechanisms in the cell. They have also been implicated in many human diseases, including diabetes and obesity, cancers, and neurodegenerative conditions. PhosphaBase aims to centralize the growing base of knowledge in the phosphatase research domain. The resource is built around a formal, domain-specific DAML+OIL ontology, and the data are collected from heterogeneous biological sources using Gene Ontology terms as a means of data extraction. The overall ontology-driven architecture provides a robust structure with distinct advantages for sustainability and provides the potential for the development of diagnostic tools, as well as a data repository.

AB Forestry is a valuable natural resource for many countries. Rapid production of large quantities of genetically improved and uniform seedlings for restocking harvested lands is a key component of sustainable forest management programs. Clonal propagation through somatic embryogenesis has the potential to meet this need in conifers and can offer the added benefit of ensuring consistent seedling quality. Although in commercial use, mass production of conifers through somatic embryogenesis is relatively new and there are numerous biological unknowns regarding this complex developmental pathway. To aid in unravelling the embryo developmental process, two-dimensional electrophoresis was employed to quantitatively assess the expression levels of proteins across four stages of somatic embryo maturation in white spruce (0, 7, 21 and 35 days post abscisic acid treatment). Forty-eight differentially expressed proteins have been identified, which display a significant change in abundance as early as day 7 of embryo development. These proteins are involved in a variety of cellular processes, many of which have not previously been associated with embryo development. The identification of these proteins was greatly assisted by the availability of a substantial expressed sequence tag (EST) resource developed for white, sitka and interior spruce. The combined use of these spruce ESTs in conjunction with GenBank accessions for other plants improved the rate of protein identification from 38% to 62% when compared with GenBank alone using automated, high-throughput techniques. This underscores the utility of EST resources in a proteomic study of any species for which a genome sequence is unavailable.

   conflict-affected countries
SO PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION AND DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB Security for people, communities and states is essential for sustainable development, democratisation and conflict mitigation. Polificised, badly managed or ineffective security bodies and justice systems often create instability and insecurity, largely due to the lack of effective democratic systems. Strengthening democratic security-sector governance after conflict presents enormous challenges, particularly: (1) developing and implementing a legal framework consistent with international law and democratic practice; (2) developing effective, well-functioning civil management and oversight bodies; (3) developing viable, accountable and affordable security forces; (4) ensuring that the institutional culture of the security forces supports the legal framework, international law, good democratic practice and civil management and oversight bodies. Addressing these challenges requires professional security forces, capable civil authorities, rule of law and regional approaches. Reform activities should be guided by local ownership, sensitivity to the politics of reform, local capacity, local context and a comprehensive sector-wide framework. Local stakeholders must make hard decisions about priorities on the availability of domestic resources available and the costs and benefits of accepting external assistance.

AB The pharmaceutical and chemical industries are facing significant internal and external pressure to boost the experimental efficiency and effectiveness by cutting the direct research costs and reducing the time to market for new sustainable products. Other key issues to secure a competitive return on investment are to enable the rescue of stalled product development projects, abort failing projects early, enhance collaborative multidisciplinary ventures, and ensure an effectual risk management and cost savings through safety testing and failure analysis. Typically, modern organizations rely on a variety of informatics solutions from well-established software vendors. These typically operate on different platforms and are controlled by different management systems using different data types and proprietary formats. Maintaining, integrating, updating and monitoring these powerful, but disparate, ensembles of tools, are an intricate and expensive operation. We present the concept of the Enterprise Discovery Planning (EDP) software platform design to facilitate the optimization of discovery activities at an enterprise level. We also briefly present how Inforsense addresses these issues.

TI Sustainable maternity services in remote and rural Scotland? A
   qualitative survey of staff views on required skills, competencies and
   training
SO QUALITY & SAFETY IN HEALTH CARE
LA English
DT Article
AB Objectives: To explore staff views on their roles, skills and training to deliver high quality and local intrapartum services in remote and rural settings against national recommendations.
   Design: Interview and postal survey.
   Setting: A stratified representative sample of remote and rural maternity units in Scotland ( December 2002 to May 2003).
   Participants: Staff proportionally representative of professional groups involved in maternity care.
   Results: Staff interviews took place at 11 units ( response rate 93%). A subsequent postal survey included the interview sample and staff in a further 11 units ( response rate 78%). Medical specialisation, workforce issues, and proposed regulatory evaluation of competencies linked to throughput raised concerns about the sustainability and safety of services, particularly for "generalists'' in rural maternity care teams and for medical cover in small district general hospitals with large rural catchments. Risk assessment and decision making to transfer were seen as central for effective rural practice and these were influenced by rural context. Staff self-reported competence and confidence varied according to procedure, but noted service change appeared to be underway ahead of their preparedness. Self-reported competence in managing obstetric emergencies was surprisingly high, with the caveat that they were not independently assessed in this study. Staff with access to video conference technology reported low actual use although there was enthusiasm about its potential use.
   Conclusions: Considerable uncertainties remain around staffing models and training to maintain maternity care team skills and competencies. Further research is required to test how this will impact on safety, appropriateness, and access and acceptability to rural communities.

ID CONSUMPTION
AB Yunnan is one of the less developed provinces in China, but has abundant energy resources, and is an ideal destination for tourists around the world due to its perfect climate and unique sightseeing resorts. However, energy consumption in rural households relies mainly on straw (12.15%), firewood (41%), and coal (38.5%). This pattern of energy consumption has been imposing pressure on the environment, water resources and soil in recent years with the rapid growth of Yunnan's economy. This paper reports the achievements in Yunnan's rural energy development in the past two decades. Issues of the greatest concern and interest, which are unfavorable for further development of rural energy, have been identified, and a new proposal of developing green rural energy in Yunnan is suggested based on its economy and resource conditions. The proposal addresses the development of biogas, small hydropower and solar energy, which are abundant in Yunnan. It is estimated that the new program will annually bring direct benefits of about 5 billion yuan to farmers by 2010, and the indirect benefits, such as those from tourism due to the improvement of the environment resulting from the use of green rural energy, will be enormous. It is believed that the program will speed up rural economic growth through the integrated utilization of rural energy. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The ongoing depletion of the fossil fuels and the dependency of the economies on them have made the need for new sources of energy more obvious. Renewable energy sources (RES) can ensure the sustainable development of the communities, and especially of those in which RES are in abundance. This study deals with the exploitation of RES in the Dodecanese Islands. Specifically, it is examined the optimum percentage by which the renewable sources can participate in the energy production system. Three different scenarios are examined. The first scenario considers that the existent system should be used less than 75% for environmental reasons, in the second scenario, a minimization of the electricity production cost is sought without any environmental constraints, while in the third scenario, it is considered that the RES' participation in the electricity production would be 30% at most according to the current legislation. The environmental impacts from the energy production are quantified and a comparison is made between the impacts resulting from the existing system and the system found from the first scenario, because this is the scenario with the highest penetration of the RES to the energy production system.

AB This paper presents a study where sustainable development indicators (SDIs) for sludge handling and wastewater treatment systems were constructed in co-operation with a large Swedish water company. Results from a life cycle assessment, a risk assessment. an economic assessment and an uncertainty assessment were used as inputs for ranking technical options of sludge handling by use of multi-criteria analysis (MCA). The MCA included assessment of the different technical options, valuation of different, and often conflicting, aspects of sustainability and weighting of various criteria. On basis of the preferences expressed in the MCA, a number of SDIs and when possible, targets for sustainable development, were formulated. The resulting SDIs reflected economic, environmental, technical and social aspects of sustainable development of sludge handling systems. Where possible, the coverage of the indicators was extended to the entire wastewater system. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Joint Australia-Indonesia scientific workshops on the fisheries of the Arafura Sea, held in 1992 and 1994, concluded that the two countries might share stocks of the red snappers Lutjanus malabaricus and L. erythropterus and the gold-band snapper Pristipomoides multidens. At that time, no information concerning stock structure, distribution and movements of these species was available. Moreover, data on the population biology and on commercial catches were inadequate. Such data are crucial for stock assessment and for managing the stocks. Clearly, if the stocks being fished were shared, joint management would be appropriate. In order to answer the questions related to managing shared stocks, a collaborative research project was initiated by Australia (CSIRO as the lead agency) and Indonesia in 1999. The objectives were firstly, to describe the population dynamics, stock structure and biology of snappers relevant to the management of stocks shared between Australian and Indonesian fisheries; secondly, to characterize the social and financial structures of the Indonesian fishery so they could be taken into account in the development of management strategies; and thirdly, to explore ways of developing complementary management for the long term sustainability of the snapper fisheries. This project finished in 2003 and in this paper we bring together the results of the biological, genetic, population dynamics and socioeconomic research in relation to managing shared stocks in the context of managed versus unmanaged fisheries, small scale and industrial fisheries, and in both developed and developing country regulatory environments. Severe data limitations necessitated an innovative approach making use of comparative analyses, often data-poor values, and the drawing together of fishery dependent and independent data to evaluate the status of the stocks.

AB The discharge of the Lower Ord River has been regulated since 1972 when a second dam was built on this major river system. This previously ephemeral river, punctuated by peak wet season flows, is now characterized by permanent, regulated flows all year, and complex adjustments to the downstream channel morphology are evident. Geographic Information System techniques, combined with field surveys, reveal a series of interrelated adjustments in response to recent flooding. These include sedimentation, channel narrowing and vegetation encroachment, all of which have implications for sustainable management and are issues that have been managed by flushing flows in other rivers. The largest flood events since regulation occurred some 27 years after dam construction during consecutive wet seasons. These events have prompted an examination of the potential to 'flush' the post-regulation Lower Ord channel to modify some of the channel changes that occurred in response to dam construction. A detailed geomorphic investigation of the Lower Ord river showed that that some of the features formed under low flows have been eradicated (partly or completely) by these large flood events, while others have withstood them. The modification of changes since dam construction varies according to a range of factors including reach position, extent of vegetation cover and local morphological variation. It is clear, however, that features not removed during floods may be considered quasi-permanent, and therefore are likely to play an important role in the evolution of this regulated river.

AB Thirty-seven years of fisheries records covering a fishing area of 6231 ha in the lower Havel River, Germany, have been analysed to address two issues: (1) detection of the effects of habitat bottlenecks caused by extreme floods and droughts on adult fish assemblage; and (2) evaluating the appropriateness of commercial fisheries statistics in testing the habitat bottleneck concept. Time series analyses of the data were first tested for autocorrelations and then classified using the CHAID (Chi-squared Automatic Interaction Detector) and C&RT (Classification and Regression Trees) algorithms. The significant environmental predictors revealed by these segmentation procedures were used in cross-correlations with various time series of fisheries yields. No single hydraulic flood parameter was significantly correlated with fisheries yield but two drought parameters were. The strongest predictor of native fish species was the minimum discharge during the spawning season (March to June). Although total fisheries yield typically increased in years with low flows, probably because of higher catch efficiencies, the yields of pike and pikeperch significantly decreased in the following two years. By comparison, significantly higher catches of pike, perch, asp, burbot, and ide were recorded in the three years following periods of sustained higher base flows. Our findings suggest that habitat bottleneck effects on fish assemblages have an important role in influencing fish community structure and do require further study. Information on habitat bottlenecks will contribute to the setting of ecological flow requirements and sustainable fisheries in large rivers systems. Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Acid mine drainage (AMD) is a widespread environmental problem associated with both working and abandoned mining operations. As part of an overall strategy to determine a long-term treatment option for AMD, a pilot passive treatment plant was constructed in 1994 at Wheat Jane Mine in Cornwall, UK. The plant consists of three separate systems; each containing aerobic reed beds, anaerobic cell and rock filters, and represents the largest European experimental facility of its kind. The systems only differ by the type of pre-treatment utilised to increase the pH of the influent minewater (pH<4): lime-dosed (LD), anoxic limestone drain (ALD) and lime free (LF), which receives no form of pre-treatment. The Wheal Jane pilot plant offered a unique facility and a major research project was established to evaluate the pilot plant and study in detail the biological mechanisms and the geochemical and physical processes that control passive treatment systems. The project has led to data, knowledge, models and design criteria for the future design, planning and sustainable management of passive treatment systems. A multidisciplinary team of scientists and managers from the U.K. universities, the Environment Agency and the Mining Industry has been put together to obtain the maximum advantage from the excellent facilities facility at Wheal Jane.

AB In the context of an ongoing debate on the type of institutions or tenurial arrangements that are appropriate for the sustainable management of common pool resources (CPRs), this article examines the role played by local institutions in determining the conditions of two forests located in the Middle Hills of Nepal. The institutional robustness of the forests' governance systems is evaluated using Ostrom's (1990) design principles that characterize the configuration of rules devised and used by long-enduring CPR institutions. The findings show that the two forests are different in level of historical degradation as well as present condition, and these differences are generally explained by the structural characteristics of the local institutions governing the forests. The analysis indicates that Ostrom's design principles are useful for analyzing institutional robustness of local forest governance systems. However, some of the principles need modification or expansion if they are to be prescribed for forestry situations.

AB We examined how managers' perceptions of different types of stakeholdcr influences in the Canadian forestry industry affect the types of sustainability practices that their firms adopt. Both influences involving withholding of resources by social and ecological stakeholders and those involving directed usage of resources from economic stakeholders were found to drive such practices. We found that the industry and its stakeholders have moved beyond a focus on early stages of sustainability performance such as pollution control and eco-efficiency. However, more advanced practices, such as those involving the redefinition of business and industrial ecosystems where firms locate in a region so that they can exchange and utilize wastes generated by other firms, are in their infancy. Stakeholders and firms in the industry are focused on the intermediate sustainability phases involving recirculation qfniaterials ond redesign of'processes including sustainable harvesting of lumber.

TI Incentives towards sustainable management of the municipal solid waste
   on islands
SO SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper analyses the integral management of solid waste from the viewpoint of the life cycle of the product. We discuss the different phases of the product's life cycle, establishing the conceptual framework that permits an improvement in management, from a social point of view. We also show a price model for the urban waste treatment service in Salto del Negro on the island of Gran Canaria. We conclude that pricing must include all external costs, that social welfare is increased when separation occurs at source and that on small islands waste reduction policies have a greater influence on welfare than they do in the context of mainland territory.

TI Social capital influence on Sustainability of development - (Case study
   of Bulgaria)
SO SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB Social capital is presented as feedback playing the role of a homeostatic mechanism of keeping the sustainability of economic systems in dynamics. Two basic measures of social capital are considered: the level of confidence (trust) among the members of society and the level of integration (consensus in ranking the social preferences). The author illustrates these assumptions in a case study of Bulgaria by means of a survey, which reflects the level of confidence and the level of integration in society. It is indicated that at present both levels are in a relatively good state in the micro aspect, but in the macro aspect the level of integration is not high, which creates problems with the consensus of ranking social preferences. The conclusion is that the need to improve the quality of social capital is a paramount task for the success of transition and building a democratic society.

TI Sustainable development: Mapping different approaches
SO SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB Sustainable development, although a widely used phrase and idea, has many different meanings and therefore provokes many different responses. In broad terms, the concept of sustainable development is an attempt to combine growing concerns about a range of environmental issues with socio-economic issues. To aid understanding of these different policies this paper presents a classification and mapping of different trends of thought on sustainable development, their political and policy frameworks and their attitudes towards change and means of change. Sustainable development has the potential to address fundamental challenges for humanity, now and into the future. However, to do this, it needs more clarity of meaning, concentrating On sustainable livelihoods and well-being rather than well-having, and long term environmental sustainability, which requires a strong basis in principles that link the social and environmental to human equity.

TI Sustainable sufficiency - an internally consistent version of
   sustainability
SO SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB Sustainable development has achieved widespread acceptance throughout the world as an appropriate goal for humankind. Applying the concept at both government and corporate levels has proved difficult due in part to an inherent conflict between the ecological, social and economic dimensions contained within contemporary interpretations of sustainable development. This paper describes a version of sustainability that provides clear and unambiguous direction for decision makers. Replacing the typically Western neoclassical economic perspective contained within most interpretations of sustainable development with a Buddhist perspective of economics leads to an internally consistent version of sustainability referred to as sustainable sufficiency. A study of a decision process within an organization operating within a sustainable development framework is used to provide contrast with decision making within a sustainable sufficiency framework. A conclusion of this paper is that the sustainable sufficiency concept reinforces the view that neoclassical economic principles provide a barrier to achieving the social and ecological objectives contained within contemporary interpretations of sustainable development.

TI Architecting gloCal (global-local), real-virtual incubator networks
   (G-RVINs) as catalysts and accelerators of entrepreneurship in
   transitioning and developing economies: lessons learned and best
   practices from current development and business incubation practices
SO TECHNOVATION

DE entrepreneurship; catalysts and accelerators; developing economies;
   business incubation practices
AB Entrepreneurship is at the heart of sustainable, organic growth for most developed, as well as transitioning and developing economies and incubators have often served as catalysts and even accelerators of entrepreneurial clusters formation and growth.
   Our premise is that this may be more so in less developed economies where incubators can help bridge knowledge, digital, socio-political and even cultural divides and help increase the availability, awareness, accessibility and affordability of financial, human, intellectual, and even social capital, the key ingredients of entrepreneurial success.
   Incubation has recently experienced increased attention as a model of start-up facilitation. Venture capitalists see incubators as a means to diversify risky investment portfolios, while would-be entrepreneurs approach incubators for start-up support. Incubators are faced with the challenge and the opportunity of managing both investment risks, as well as entrepreneurial risks. As an indication of their usefulness, more than a thousand incubators have been established in the last few years based on a number of different incubation business models (not-for-profit, for-profit, public/private entity, etc.), which we categorize in five incubator archetypes: the university incubator, the independent commercial incubator, the regional business incubator, the company-internal incubator, and the virtual incubator.
   In this paper, we propose an overarching incubator model that synthesizes elements and best practices emanating from the five archetypes empirically identified and also incorporates substantially higher economies of scale and scope, as well as global and local (gloCal) knowledge arbitrage potential. This paper presents an architectural blueprint for designing a gloCal, real and virtual network of incubators (G-RVIN) as a knowledge and innovation infra-structure and infra-technology which would link entrepreneurs and micro-entrepreneurs with local, regional, and global networks of customers, suppliers and complementors and thus help not only bridge, but also leverage, the diverse divides (digital, knowledge. cultural. socio-political, etc.).
   The implications of this archetype of new ventures incubation for facilitating both venture business activity and broad-based economic development are discussed and early findings from pilot projects in central and eastern Europe are discussed. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Delivering health care in rural Cambodia via store-and-forward
   telemedicine: A pilot study
SO TELEMEDICINE JOURNAL AND E-HEALTH
LA English
DT Article
AB Since 2001, a monthly telemedicine clinic has helped provide health care to residents in a remote region in Cambodia. Physicians at Massachusetts General Hospital and Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts, and Sihanouk Hospital of HOPE in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, provide consultations via e- mail to a mobile nurse in the district of Rovieng, Cambodia. We describe the operations of the monthly clinic and report the results of a retrospective case review of the first 28 months of consultations. We also report the results of a satisfaction and willingness to pay survey. A total of 264 visits were made during the 28 monthly sessions. Mean duration of chief complaint at initial visit declined from 37 months to 8 months during the first and last 6 months of the study period, respectively. Thirty- six percent ( n = 76) of new patients complained of abdominal pain. Nine percent ( n = 20) of new patients were given an empiric diagnosis of goiter. The percent of patients requiring referral to a hospital outside of the village decreased over time. All patients surveyed were either " very satisfied" or " satisfied" with their care, and most patients were willing to pay for a visit, with a median amount of USD 0.63. We conclude that store- and- forward e- mail consultative support for mobile nonphysician health care workers is a feasible model for delivering care in the developing world. Further research is needed to demonstrate improvement in health status, cost effectiveness, and sustainability.

AB For years, labour market policy in the UK has been dominated by activation measures that seek to increase employment levels among the unemployed. This supply-side focus emphasises individual characteristics and responsibilities in isolation from wider labour market factors. However, there is widening acceptance that policies for employability can provide a link between the supply and demand sides of the labour market. This implies the involvement of employers in the design of skills training and work experience programmes, and for these to be related to employment sustainability and career progression. Several projects in the UK under the New Deal Innovation Fund are currently testing the merits of what is termed a 'demand-led approach'. This paper examines this in terms of increasing job procurement and retention, and critically assesses the way in which it has been applied in the UK to date. It investigates the role played by labour market intermediaries in engaging both job seekers and employers, and considers the difficulties of successfully implementing the approach in different circumstances. It concludes that in most cases demand-led schemes in the UK have been less about improving employability than meeting employers' short-term labour needs.

AB The European Union's Water Framework Directive, and in Spain the National Irrigation Plan, call for the sustainable and integrated use of water resources. Here we report the results of a questionnaire administered to irrigation users in the Terra Cha region of northwest Spain, as the basis for a water management model, and to allow identification of a representative subsample of respondents for ongoing monitoring of irrigation use in this region. The proposed management model should fulfill the dual aims of sustainable water management, namely to promote long-term social and economic development and at the same time ensure long-term environmental protection.

AB This paper introduces a special issue featuring a set of papers on institutional arrangements for reconciling rural poverty reduction with renewable natural resources conservation in the low-income tropics. Collectively, these papers make four core points. First, synergies do not naturally emerge just because rural poverty reduction and renewable natural resources conservation are each appealing goals with common drivers and some intrinsic interlinkage. Second, it matters less which rules a community or country adopts than how well they monitor and enforce the rules they set. Third, flexibility and adaptability in design are critical to establishing cooperative partnerships that can advance both conservation and development goals. Fourth, multiscalar approaches are commonly desirable. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The hypothesis that sustainable resource management and biodiversity conservation can result in material benefits to participating communities has existed under different guises in the concepts of sustainable development, integrated conservation and development projects, sustainable use, and community-based resource management. What these approaches have in common is the belief that win-win situations between the environment and human development are possible under particular institutional arrangements. Disentangling the factors that contribute to effective conservation and improved human welfare is difficult, but necessary for understanding when these win-win scenarios are likely to emerge. This paper analyzes data on 40 community-based marine protected areas in the Philippines, to determine the correlates of win-win versus lose-lose or trade-off outcomes, measured in terms of children's nutritional status and coral reef health.

AB Costa Rica has long been a leader among developing countries in the design of and experimentation with innovative environmental Programs. Since 1997, Costa Rica's "Pagos de Servicios Ambientales" (Payments for Environmental Services) Program has provided payments to more than 4,400 farmers and forest owners for reforestation, forest conservation, and sustainable forest management activities. Econometric analysis of a survey. of farmers and forest owners, including both PSA participants and nonparticipants, shows that farm size, human capital and household economic factors, and information variables significantly influence participation in PSA program alternatives. Large farmers and forest owners are disproportionately represented among program participants. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB There is increasing interest in community-based approaches to the management of natural resources in Africa. Pastoral areas present particular challenges and opportunities to community-based management programs. We consider an example where there are multiple definitions of the community that uses a resource, and these definitions are both nested and overlapping. Working at multiple levels of social organization and in multiple sites was critical for overall program success. We find addressing conflict can be a measure to address resource scarcity. We conclude noting signs that reduced insecurity has established the preconditions under which sustainable resource management can be accomplished. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB By issuing its Millennium Development Goals, the United Nations has declared its intention to alleviate poverty and hunger at a global scale over the next decade. But, the perspectives and policies to achieve those goals have not addressed the failures of previous development efforts of this kind. Nor have the plans to meet the Millennium Development Goals paid sufficient attention to the costs of rural development for wild nature. This paper points up the absence of a new analytical framework for sustainability and an action program in favor of a poverty- and conservation-oriented rural development program to ensure that the benefits of multilateral development plans accrue to the truly poor and to the future of wild nature.

Forest and forested landscapes in Slovenia encompass 72% of the country's surface area. Using the spatial model, open space without forest patches, hedgerows and remnants of natural vegetation was observed in 44% of the area designated as farmland with intensive agricultural production. Pomurje is the sole Slovenian macroregion in which agricultural landscape still prevails. Most forest patches and forest fragments in the central part of the Pomurje macroregion are isolated and have a minor depth of interior forest area. They represent the ecological infrastructure for sustainable management of the cultural landscape. Despite the low level of forest cover in the macroregion (27%), just 52% of the area of agricultural and urban land is located more than 150 m from forest edges, hedgerows, and remnants of the former natural vegetation. Human corridors, urban centers, and smaller, scattered settlements also affect the stability and processes sustained by these landscape elements. It is in such cases that this spatial model may prove to be an efficient tool for spatial planning and for assisting in the coordination of different land users. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

AB The Spree and Schwarze Elster river catchments have been heavily influenced by excessive open-cast lignite mining for 100 years. The extent of the problem, concerning water quantity and quality, is a threat for the ecosystems and the commercial water users of the region and other areas located downstream. Climate change and socio-economic trends of global change may aggravate the conflicts. Scenarios of future development with specific adaptation measures are derived and modelled, using an "integrated assessment procedure". The methodological procedure and the models used are presented in this paper while first results are provided and future work is described. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This contribution, which reviews some broad trends in human history and in the history of fishing, argues that sustainability, however defined, rarely if ever occurred as a result of an explicit policy, but as result of our inability to access a major part of exploited stocks. With the development of industrial fishing, and the resulting invasion of the refuges previously provided by distance and depth, our interactions with fisheries resources have come to resemble the wars of extermination that newly arrived hunters conducted 40 000-50 000 years ago in Australia, and 12 000-13 000 years ago against large terrestrial mammals in North America. These broad trends are documented here through a map of change in fish sizes, which displays characteristic declines, first in the nearshore waters of industrialized countries of the Northern Hemisphere, then spread offshore and to the Southern Hemisphere. This geographical extension met its natural limit in the late 1980s, when the catches from newly accessed stocks ceased to compensate for the collapse in areas accessed earlier, hence leading to a gradual decline of global landing. These trends affect developing countries more than the developed world, which have been able to meet the shortfall by increasing imports from developing countries. These trends, however, together with the rapid growth of farming of carnivorous fishes, which consumes other fishes suited for human consumption, have led to serious food security issues. This promotes urgency to the implementation of the remedies traditionally proposed to alleviate overfishing (reduction of overcapacity, enforcement of conservative total allowable catches, etc.), and to the implementation of non-conventional approaches, notably the re-establishment of the refuges (also known as marine reserves), which made possible the apparent sustainability of pre-industrial fisheries.

AB Predicting global fisheries is a high-order challenge but predictions have been made and updates are needed. Past forecasts, present trends and perspectives of key parameters of the fisheries-including potential harvest, state of stocks, supply and demand, trade, fishing technology and governance-are reviewed in detail, as the basis for new forecasts and forecasting performance assessment. The future of marine capture fisheries will be conditioned by the political, social and economic evolution of the world within which they operate. Consequently, recent global scenarios for the future world are reviewed, with the emphasis on fisheries. The main driving forces (e.g. global economic development, demography, environment, public awareness, information technology, energy, ethics) including aquaculture are described. Outlooks are provided for each aspect of the fishery sector. The conclusion puts these elements in perspective and offers the authors' personal interpretation of the possible future pathway of fisheries, the uncertainty about it and the still unanswered questions of direct relevance in shaping that future.

AB Fisheries around the world are managed with a broad range of institutional structures. Some of these have been quite disastrous, whereas others have proven both biologically and economically successful. Unsuccessful systems have generally involved either open access, attempts at top-down control with poor ability to monitor and implement regulations, or reliance on consensus. Successful systems range from local cooperatives to strong governmental control, to various forms of property rights, but usually involve institutional systems that provide incentives to individual operators that lead to behaviour consistent with conservation.

ID MANAGEMENT
AB Since agreement was reached in 1982 on the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, and particularly since the conclusion of the 1992 UN Conference on Environment and Development, the rate of development of global instruments impacting on fisheries has escalated considerably and is apparently continuing to do so. A flood of global and regional instruments relevant to fisheries has been generated, including, for example, the 1973 Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora which pre-dates the UN Convention, the 1992 Convention on Biological Diversity, 1992 Agenda 21: Programme of Action for Sustainable Development, the 1993 FAO Agreement to Promote Compliance with International Conservation and Management Measures by Fishing Vessels on the High Seas, the 1995 UN Agreement for the Implementation of the Provisions of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982 relating to the Conservation and Management of Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks, the 1995 FAO Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries and its four international plans of action and strategy, and the 2001 FAO Reykjavik Declaration on Responsible Fisheries in the Marine Ecosystem reflecting the growing international interest in ecosystem approaches to fisheries. Most recent has been the 2002 World Summit on Sustainable Development's Plan of Implementation. These instruments have been motivated by real problems associated with environmental degradation and living resource depletion, in several cases specifically in connection with fisheries. They have attempted to address these problems, and each instrument is recognized as being a positive contribution towards the sustainable use of resources and ecosystems. However, taken collectively they form a large, often confusing and potentially overwhelming set of recommendations and requirements that is putting many fishery management agencies under severe pressure as they seek to implement them. This paper provides a brief overview of the range of recent instruments and their implications for sustainable fisheries management, considers the progress being made in implementing them, identifies general problems being encountered and how they might be ameliorated in the future. A key problem is a lack of political will, or political ability, to address effectively the problems facing fisheries and marine ecosystems. One consequence of this is that the agencies charged with fisheries management are not provided with adequate technical and financial capacity to implement the instruments in most, if not all, countries. The problem is especially acute in developing countries where they are strained by the full effects of 'instrument implementation fatigue'.

AB Modern fishery science, which began in 1957 with Beverton and Holt, is ca. 50 years old. At its inception, fishery science was limited by a nineteenth century mechanistic worldview and by computational technology, thus, the relatively simple equations of population ecology became the fundamental ecological science underlying fisheries. The time has come for this to change and for community ecology to become the fundamental ecological science underlying fisheries. This point will be illustrated with two examples. First, when viewed from a community perspective, excess production must be considered in the context of biomass left for predators. We argue that this is a better measure of the effects of fisheries than spawning biomass per recruit. Second, we shall analyse a simple, but still multi-species, model for fishery management that considers the alternatives of harvest regulations, inshore marine protected areas and offshore marine protected areas. Population or community perspectives lead to very different predictions about the efficacy of reserves.

AB Many fishery management tools currently in use have conservation value. They are designed to maintain stocks of commercially important species above target levels. However, their limitations are evident from continuing declines in fish stocks throughout the world. We make the case that to reverse fishery declines, safeguard marine life and sustain ecosystem processes, extensive marine reserves that are off limits to fishing must become part of the management strategy. Marine reserves should be incorporated into modem fishery management because they can achieve many things that conventional tools cannot. Only complete and permanent protection from fishing can protect the most sensitive habitats and vulnerable species. Only reserves will allow the development of natural, extended age structures of target species, maintain their genetic variability and prevent deleterious evolutionary change from the effects of fishing. Species with natural age structures will sustain higher rates of reproduction and will be more resilient to environmental variability. Higher stock levels maintained by reserves will provide insurance against management failure, including risk-prone quota setting, provided the broader conservation role of reserves is firmly established and legislatively protected. Fishery management measures outside protected areas are necessary to complement the protection offered by marine reserves, but cannot substitute for it.

AB In this paper, we review the concept of sustainability with regard to a single-species, age-structured fish population with density dependence at some stage of its life history. We trace the development of the view of sustainability through four periods.
   The classical view of sustainability, prevalent in the 1970s and earlier, developed from deterministic production models, in which equilibrium abundance or biomass is derived as a function of fishing mortality. When there is no fishing mortality, the population equilibrates about its carrying capacity. We show that carrying capacity is the result of reproductive and mortality processes and is not a fixed constant unless these processes are constant. There is usually a fishing mortality, F-msy, which results in MSY, and a higher value, F-ext, for which the population is eventually driven to extinction. For each F between 0 and F-ext, there is a corresponding sustainable population. From this viewpoint, the primary tool for achieving sustainability is the control of fishing mortality.
   The neoclassical view of sustainability, developed in the 1980s, involved population models with depensation and stochasticity. This viewpoint is in accord with the perception that a population at a low level is susceptible to collapse or to a lack of rebuilding regardless of fishing. Sustainability occurs in a more restricted range from that in the classical view and includes an abundance threshold. A variety of studies has suggested that fishing mortality should not let a population drop below a threshold at 10-20% of carrying capacity.
   The modem view of sustainability in the 1990s moves further in the direction of precaution. The fishing mortality limit is the former target of Fmsy (or some proxy), and the target fishing mortality is set lower. This viewpoint further reduces the range of permissible fishing mortalities and resultant desired population sizes. The objective has shifted from optimizing long-term catch to preserving spawning biomass and egg production for the future. The use of discount rates in objective functions involving catch is not a suitable alternative to protecting reproductive value.
   As we move into the post-modem time period, new definitions of sustainability will attempt to incorporate the economic and social aspects of fisheries and/or ecosystem and habitat requirements. These definitions now involve 'warm and fuzzy' notions (healthy ecosystems and fishing communities, the needs of future generations, diverse fish communities) and value judgements of desired outcomes. Additional work is needed to make these definitions operational and to specify quantitative objectives to be achieved. In addition, multiple objectives may be incompatible, so trade-offs in what constitutes sustainability must be made. The advances made under the single-species approach should not be abandoned in the post-modem era, but rather enhanced and combined with new approaches in the multi-species and economic realms.

AB Using life-history invariants, this paper develops techniques that allow the estimation of maximum sustainable yield and the fishing mortality rate that produces the maximum yield from estimates of the growth parameters, the length at first capture and the steepness of the stock recruitment relationship. This allows sustainable yields and fishing capacity to be estimated from sparse data, such as those available for developing country fisheries.

AB Measuring soil loss is costly, must cover a range of field situations, is not standardized, and is season dependent. In addition, use of sparse soil loss data (from other studies) compromises the integrity of many erosion models. Easily assessable soil erosion indicators to monitor the cumulative effect of erosion between tillage/weeding and harvesting called eroding clods, flow surfaces, pre-rills, and rills were surveyed directly after the 1995 rainy season in the Taita Taveta district of Kenya, to assessed the utility of each indicator. Their incidences were modeled using CPA. In the area, 70 maize plots in 11 map units, having considerable variation in altitude, land cover, rainfall, and geomorphology, were surveyed. Soil loss was considered variable between plots due to differences in surface soil, land cover, infrastructure (trash lines, grass strips, and Fanya-juu), crop management, slope, and map unit. The eroding clods indicator proved of little significance because the initial clods cover was unknown; the indicator probably relates better to soil erodibility then to soil loss. Flow surfaces, formed during erosive showers, were less present on fields with a higher ground and canopy cover, if the area of eroding clods was high, and if the topsoil had no loam which reduces chances of sealing; no impact of infrastructure, tillage, and weeding were detected. Fewer pre-rills were present where the fraction of groundcover was high, where Pigeon Peas were not grown (they cause micro-relief and concentrated flows), where weeding ended late (time effect), where more flow surfaces occurred, where Fanya-juu was constructed (less steep slopes), where the top-soil contained little sand (less sediment entrainment), and where maize was intercropped with vegetables (positive canopy cover effects). The model was not map unit specific and had an Adjusted R-2 of 67%. The log-linear relationship indicates that combined positive conditions exponentially reduce the occurrence of pre-rills. The "pre-rill" indicator related best to management-affected site conditions and seems to reflect best the cumulative effects of soil loss over time. Rills were found at 18 sites located in drier areas on sandy-clay soils. The model suggested more rills if the topsoil contains no silt; this makes the soil susceptible to compaction, peptisation when wet, and rill formation. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Use of starch solution as feed for butanol bioconversion processes employing Clostridium beijerinckii BA101 may have added economic advantage over the use of glucose. Acetone butanol ethanol (ABE) was produced from 30g L-1 starch solution using a continuous process. The bioreactor was fed at a dilution rate of 0.02 h(-1) and starch solution/feed volume (3 L) was replaced every 72 h. The continuous reactor fed with cornstarch solution (feed temperature 19degreesC) produced approximately 6.0g L-1 total ABE. Increasing the feed storage temperature to 37degreesC improved ABE production to 7.2g L-1 suggesting that retrogradation was occurring more rapidly at 19degreesC. In both these cases the fermentation drifted toward acid production after approximately 260 h, consistent with the retrogradation of starch overtime. The use of soluble starch, which is less prone to retrogradation, resulted in the production of 9.9g L-1 ABE at 37degreesC feed storage temperature, as compared to 7.2g L-1 ABE when cornstarch was used. It should be noted that gelatinized starch retrogradation takes place after sterilization and prior to use of the feed medium, and does not occur during long-term storage of the raw corn material in the months leading up to processing. The degree of hydrolysis of gelatinized starch decreased from 68.8 to 56.2% in 3 days when stored at 37degreesC. Soluble starch which does not retrograde demonstrated no change in the degree of hydrolysis. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper proposes a new intergenerational discounting approach for computing net benefits from the use of environmental resources. The approach explicitly incorporates the perspectives of both the current and future generations, as argued for by Pigou [Pigou, A.C., 1920. The Economics of Welfare 1952 (4th edition), London: Macmillan] and Ramsey [Ramsey, F.P., 1928. A mathematical theory of saving, Econ. J., 38 543-559], and required by most national and international laws related to the use of these resources. An equation for use in the calculation of net discounted benefits is developed, which provides a 'middle' position whereby both the 'reality' of 'personal' discounting and that of 'social' discounting are included in a social welfare function.

AB Triple Bottom Line accounting is widely advanced as a way in which firms can realise broader societal objectives in addition to increasing shareholder value. In our analysis of the Australian economy, we integrate financial input-output tables that describe the interdependencies between economic sectors, with national social and environmental accounts to construct numerate 'triple bottom line' accounts for 135 discrete sectors. The accounts are portrayed against the numeraire of 'one dollar of GDP'. Thus, for a sector of the economy, financial aspects of performance can be expressed for example as dollars of export earnings per dollar of GDP. Social aspects such as employment can be portrayed as minutes of employment generated per dollar. Greenhouse issues can be portrayed as kilograms of carbon dioxide emitted per dollar.
   Since these indicators of 'triple bottom line' performance are referenced against financial units and are consistent with the system of national accounts, they can be applied to financial accounts of a firm, a service or a product, and allow a robust triple bottom line account to be developed across a range of scales. The critical advantage of this approach is that it includes both the direct or immediate effects as well as the indirect or diffuse effects associated with a large and distant chain of supply paths. The incorporation of most indirect or upstream effects therefore expands the range of issues and effects within the analytical boundary, and also includes imports and exports. Both products and firms can then be assessed properly in sustainable chain management (SCM) terms. Thus, a firm that uses a key intermediate input that requires a large amount of water for example cannot hide the environmental implications since they are revealed in the analysis of the full production chain. This revelation can also underpin progress when firms acknowledge both the direct and indirect effects, and improve their selection of key inputs on a wider range of criteria, rather than on price alone.
   Our analysis is well developed at the economic sector level for Australia and is also being applied to number of government institutions, firms, and individual products. Before the full benefits of numerate triple bottom line accounting can be applied to the equity issues of globalisation, trade interdependencies between groups of typical countries will have to be analysed using these whole economy approaches. This will allow country-specific intensities to be applied to important items in the international production chain. Crown Copyright (C) 2004 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Industrial ecology and the industrial ecosystem approach (IE) are emerging concepts in ecological economics, environmental policy and corporate environmental management. The natural ecosystem model of diverse recycling and cascading material and energy flow systems has been used in industrial systems that are contrasting to this, operating with linear flows and unsustainable. Understanding the evolution of industrial systems over time toward sustainable or unsustainable ways of operating is important for learning about environmental performance analyses as well as for future planning of policy and management. The evolution over time of the Uimaharju forest industry park in Eastern Finland is studied. First, the system development is described by identifying the number of IE-type 'roundput' material and energy flows denoting waste utilisation and sustainable use of renewables. Second, development of the system over time is shown in terms of the number of the actors involved. This structural characteristic is termed system 'diversity'. Third, the relation of the two is considered. Fourth, the drivers of the case system development are discussed. Fifth, an initial effort is made to calculate some of the environmental effects of the system during its development. An increase in roundput and diversity over time is observed. Diversity is affecting roundput. The park tends to enlarge its activities outside the industrial park boundary over time. While the system illustrates high roundput and high diversity, we can only speculate if these characteristics contribute to sustainability, because of difficulties in system boundary definition.

AB Invasions of ecosystems by exotic species have been the focus of a growing body of research in applied biology and ecology, but relatively little attention has been paid to their economic consequences. Even where economic estimates have been made these often make ad hoc assumptions about the biological relationships of interest and lack grounding in economic theory. This paper develops an integrated ecological-economic approach to assess the economic consequences of invasion for a commercially harvested endemic species whose population dynamics are altered by the invader. As a case study, the Black Sea anchovy fishery represents an interesting example of such a situation. In the early 1980s, the comb jelly Mnemiopsis leidyi invaded the Black Sea, eventually becoming established and experiencing a population explosion with dire consequences for the commercial anchovy fishery. In modeling the population dynamics of the Black Sea anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus), the influence of Mnemiopsis is incorporated as a structural change in the anchovy stock-recruitment relationship. Then the economic loss associated with this structural change is assessed, using a discrete, dynamic bioeconomic model. It is shown that Mnemiopsis had a dramatic effect on the potential sustainable harvest from an optimally managed anchovy fishery but these losses were at least an order of magnitude lower than estimates cited elsewhere.

AB We present a model that synthesizes decades of field data on white-winged doves (Zenaida asiatica asiatica; WWDO) in the Tamaulipan Biotic Province. The model is represented as a discrete-time, deterministic compartment model based on difference equations with a one-week time step designed to simulate annual productivity and long-term trends in abundance. We evaluated the model by comparing simulated annual productivity and long-term population trends to field data. Based on simulation results, we identified apparent inconsistencies in the database; we could not generate the observed annual production index with the model parameterized based on field nest success and survivorship data, nor could we generate a stable long-term population trend with the model parameterized based on suggested sustainable harvest rates and empirically-based estimates of migratory return rates. Simulation results suggest that nest success might be closer to 22% (rather than 35%). A similar trend resulted when simulated hunting pressure was increased by 25% (to 31%), or return rates of migrating juveniles and adults were decreased by 5.5 and 5.0%, to 69 and 77%, respectively, with all other values at the baseline level. For these reasons, until better estimates of nest success and migratory return rates are available, model predictions must be viewed with caution. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All fights reserved.

AB Clear-cut harvesting can alter ecosystem conditions and dynamics drastically compared to natural disturbance regimes. hence alternative harvesting systems are being developed in an attempt to better mimic natural forest structure. A recent approach is to harvest trees at variable intensities and spatial configurations in what is known as variable retention harvesting. Our study examines the responses of aerial insect assemblages to a gradient of forest retention at the landscape scale. and provides an assessment of the conservation benefits of alternative versus traditional harvesting systems in lowland boreal forest. The experimental design consisted of six treatments representing decreasing levels of structural retention at the landscape scale (with four replicates per treatment): (1) unharvested forest interior. (2) unharvested forest edge; (3) high-structural retention (strip retention harvesting areas at the edge of adjacent areas of unharvested forest): (4) medium-structural retention (strip retention harvesting areas in the interior of contiguous retention harvesting areas): (5) low-strucrural retention (strip retention harvesting areas adjacent to clear-cutted areas); (6) clear-cut harvesting. Response variables were the abundances of selected families and trophic assemblages of aerial insects, which were sampled with Malaise traps at each site. Univariate and multivatiate analyses showed that the structural-retention harvesting influenced the abundance of most families and trophic assemblages. Most insect families and assemblages were most abundant in the strip retention harvested areas, especially in the medium retention treatment. These increases in abundance reflected strong edge effects. as evidenced by the fact that significant treatment effects were observed even within the two major habitat types of the study (cleared or forested habitat). Increasing structural retention favoured some assemblages such as Diapriidae, herbivores, and parasitoids whereas other groups such as predators decreased in abundance. Results support the potential use of high-level taxonomic and trophic assemblages of aerial insects in monitoring the ecological sustainability of forest harvesting practices. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

AB Landscapes change because they are the expression of the dynamic interaction between natural and cultural forces in the environment. Cultural landscapes are the result of consecutive reorganization of the land in order to adapt its use and spatial structure better to the changing societal demands. Particularly in Europe, history has recorded many successive and even devastating landscape changes, which have left barely any relics today. Today, the changes are seen as a menace, as a negative evolution because they cause a loss of diversity, coherence and identity, which were characteristic for the traditional cultural landscapes that are rapidly vanishing. This growing concern is also expressed in the European Landscape Convention, which will be used as a start for the analysis in this article. Three periods of landscape dynamics are considered: the traditional landscapes before the important changes that started in the 18th century, the landscapes of the revolutions age of the 19th to 20th century, and the post-modem new landscapes. The combined effect of the driving forces such as accessibility, urbanization, globalization and the impact of calamities have been different in each of the periods and affected the nature and pace of the changes as well as the perception people have had about the landscape. Values change accordingly and so does the way of using and shaping the landscape. It is argued that this changing perception also influences what kind and aspects of landscapes are studied, protected and managed. Diversity and identity of cultural landscapes are central in the discussion. It is shown that coherence between small composing elements in a broader spatial context is important for the legibility of the landscape and that the ability to tell the (his)story of a place strongly enhances the identity and the overall value. This offers criteria for inventorying and assessing landscapes, which is needed to define future management and development. Although the general trends of future development of the European landscapes are rather well known, planning and managing future landscape remains difficult and extremely uncertain. The processes and management in past traditional landscapes and the manifold relations people have towards the perceivable environment and the symbolic meaning it generates, offer valuable knowledge for more sustainable planning and management for future landscapes.

DE landscape-design; applied historical geography; military defence line;
   participatory planning; cultural heritage
AB In a time of increasing pressure and increasing demands on space a critical view is needed in order to preserve our cultural heritage. Mere preservation or restoration is not an approach that assures the survival of heritage in the future. In The Netherlands a new approach is being developed by which cultural heritage is integrated into physical planning and the development of new functions. In addition to contemplating on the theoretical advantages and disadvantages of the approach, this article shows an example of a successful participatory approach by which a landscape plan was designed for an area around a historical military defence line. The defence line is one of the first of the kind and originates from the Dutch War for Independence (1568-1648). The structure is threatened by present spatial developments. In co-operation with stakeholders a vision was formulated that formed a framework for future developments. The project showed that preservation through development is an approach that has great potential and should in many cases be preferred to the more common approach of protection and restoration of relics. The new approach provides more support for the preservation of cultural heritage and doesn't block other social developments. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Traditional ideas of intraseasonal and interannual climatic variability in the Western Indian Ocean, dominated by the mean cycle of seasonally reversing monsoon winds, are being replaced by a more complex picture, comprising air-sea interactions and feedbacks; atmosphere-ocean dynamics operating over intrannual to interdecadal time-scales; and climatological and oceanographic boundary condition changes at centennial to millennial time-scales. These forcings, which are mediated by the orography of East Africa and the Asian continent and by seafloor topography (most notably in this area by the banks and shoals of the Mascarene Plateau which interrupts the westward-flowing South Equatorial Current), determine fluxes of water, nutrients and biogeochemical constituents, the essential controls on ocean and shallow-sea productivity and ecosystem health. Better prediction of climatic variability for rain-fed agriculture, and the development of sustainable marine resource use, is of critical importance to the developing countries of this region but requires further basic information gathering and coordinated ocean observation systems.

AB The Western Indian Ocean represents ca. 8% of the world's oceans but generates only 4% of the global industrial catch. This region is also home to a great proportion of the world's population, living in developing countries with a high dependence on marine resources. Trends in the declared landings of marine resources from the Western Indian Ocean suggest that this ocean may be approaching its maximum harvest potential of ca. 4 Mt per annum, but underreported artisanal catches complicate more-detailed analyses. There is a growing demand for 'new resources' to make up for declining stocks, while several large fluctuations are linked to changes in market demand and over exploitation.
   Artisanal fisheries in the region are highly diversified. Preliminary results are presented of a project that evaluates the conservation status and sustainable management practices in 168 different fishery types. It is concluded that the majority of the region's artisanal fisheries are not adequately supported by scientific information and that management strategies need to be improved if the enormous development challenges of East African countries are to be met.

AB Management of marine resources over the large ocean areas provides a great challenge, albeit one with hope for sustainable governance. Despite extensive studies in many of these large ocean areas, the interaction of physical and biological processes in large shallow mid-oceanic areas, such as the Mascarene Plateau in the Western Indian Ocean, is not yet well enough understood to influence management practices.
   The Mascarene Plateau arches across the Western Indian Ocean from the Seychelles down to Mauritius, with water depths up to 100 m. Such a large shallow mid-oceanic area supports a wide diversity of ecosystems with potential for exploitable resources. A recent marine research programme by the Royal Geographical Society of London led to the establishment of a research framework for long-term research and assessment of the Mascarene Plateau. This paper presents an extension to this approach., with a particular focus on the management, governance and socioeconomics of this area.

AB Understanding global climate change and developing strategies for sustainable use of our environmental resources are major scientific and political challenges. In response to an announcement of the German Aerospace Center (DLR) for a national Earth observation (EO) mission, the Friedrich-Schiller University Jena and the JenaOptronik GmbH proposed the EO mission Carbon-3D. The data products of this mission will for the first time accurately estimate aboveground biomass globally, one of the most important parameters of the carbon cycle. Simultaneous acquisition of multiangle optical with Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) observations is unprecedented. The optical imager extrapolates the laser-retrieved height profiles to biophysical vegetation maps. This innovative mission will reduce uncertainties about net effects of deforestation and forest regrowth on atmospheric CO2 concentrations and will also provide key biophysical information for biosphere models.

AB Maize and sorghum were grown in the field in north Cameroon, Africa, during the cropping seasons (June-October) of 2000 for maize, and 2001 and 2002 for sorghum. Both cereals were grown in fields infested with or free of seeds of the root hemiparasite Striga hermonthica, and with or without inoculation with arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi (Glomus clarum and Gigaspora margarita). Infection of maize by S. hermonthica resulted in a significant reduction in cob yield of 20%. The effects of S. hermonthica on sorghum were not significant. With AM fungal inoculation, a significant reduction (30% and more than 50% on maize and sorghum, respectively) in the number of S. hermonthica shoots was noted. Dry weight of Striga followed the same pattern (40% reduction on maize, and 46 and 63% reduction on sorghum in 2001 and 2002, respectively) after AM fungal inoculation. There was a significant interaction effect between S. hermonthica and AM fungi on yield parameters of sorghum in the cropping season of 2002. No significant yield increase due to AM fungal inoculation was noted for maize or sorghum in 2001. The results are discussed in the context of managing mycorrhizas as a component of integrated management of S. hermonthica on cereals aimed at sustainability. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

AB Background: Published data indicate that there is a significant treatment gap between the evidence for and the implementation of lipid-lowering therapy and that recidivism is as high as 60% at 1 year. The aim of this study is to examine the impact of a clinical pharmacy cardiac risk service (CPCRS) on lipid screening, control, and treatment outcomes.
   Methods: A computer-generated list of all patients with documented coronary artery disease, enrolled in a CPCRS between March 1, 1998, and October 1, 2002, and followed up for a minimum of 6 months was obtained. Outcome measures were the percentage of patients with up-to-date lipid screening results and the percentage achieving low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) goals at enrollment in CPCRS and at study end.
   Results: A total of 8014 patients (mean age, 69.3 years; 69.8% men) met the entry criteria. The mean duration of follow-up was 2.3 years. Most patients (97.3%) had up-to-date lipid screening results at study end compared with 66.9% of patients at baseline. At study end, a total of 72.9% of patients achieved a LDL-C level of less than 100 mg/dL (<2.6 mmol/L) compared with 25.5% at baseline. The mean +/- SD LDL-C level for the cohort at study end was 89 +/- 24 mg/dL (2.3 +/- 0.6 mmol/L). Of patients receiving medication, most (84.8%) were receiving therapy with statins alone, whereas 11.7% were receiving combination therapy.
   Conclusions: A CPCRS working in conjunction with a patient-tracking system can achieve improved lipid results in a large and inclusive cohort of patients with coronary artery disease. Our approach is unique in that the results were sustainable and demonstrate reduced recidivism.

ID SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
AB Decision making to reach for sustainable development of a region can be seen as a debate about the possibilities to integrate social, economic, physical, ecological, and cultural development goals. To make this integration successful, it is necessary to consider a region as a socio-environmental system (SEnS). We use this system concept to make sure that different types of goals and their adverse side effects will be taken as much as possible into account in decision making for regional sustainable development. For setting development goals, we have constructed a framework that we present here.
   First, we formulate the requirements for goal setting for sustainable development. This results in a kind of framework as search-and-check instrument. This framework can be used to translate people's development goals into valuable characteristics of the socio-environmental system considered. Then we present a case to illustrate the use of the framework in regional development plans. The case shows that the instrument can provide a more balanced survey than usual in practice. For the people involved, it shows which type of goals is missing in the debate about the development of their region. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID SUSTAINABILITY; INDICATORS; TIME
AB The Ecological Footprint (EF) has received considerable attention as a useful indicator in the context of sustainable development. So far, it has mostly been applied as a static indicator. Here, we have derived a set of long-term EF scenarios for 17 world regions using the IMAGE 2.2 implementation of the IPCCs SIZES scenarios. The scenarios are used to discuss potential trends in EFs in different world regions but also to analyse underlying trends driving changes in the EF. The baseline scenarios show the EF for real land use only (not accounting for CO2) to increase further in the next few decades in most world regions, being driven by population growth, changes in human diets towards more land-intensive products and overall increases in consumption levels. Future crop yield improvements and technology development will partly offset these trends, resulting in decreasing per capita El's, but increasing total EFs. In the longer term, EF development may strongly diverge on the basis of assumptions made in the different baseline scenarios (from 5.4 Gha at present to 6.0-8.2 Gha in 2050 depending on the scenario). The aggregated EF following the definition of Wackernagel et al. (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 99 (2002) 9266-9271) (including virtual land for CO2) increases more strongly, from 12.6 to 20-31 Gha depending on the different scenarios. An alternative scenario was developed to explore whether optimistic assumptions for changes in consumption and production patterns could limit the increase of the global EF, which limited EF increase to 15 Gha in 2050. This scenario still allowed for population growth and strong economic development in low-income regions. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB For recruitment-limited, severely depleted fishery stocks, stock enhancement may become an important technique in the return of population sizes to sustainable levels. Aquaculture-reared individuals, however, may face some disadvantages upon release into the wild due to differences between natural conditions and the hatchery. The goal of this study was to test whether field survivorship of hatchery-raised blue crabs, Callinectes sapidus, could be improved by simple conditioning steps, taking advantage of phenotypic plasticity in certain traits. This species is currently the focus of a preliminary stock enhancement program in the Chesapeake Bay. Results indicate that unconditioned hatchery crabs had lower survivorship than wild crabs in the field and differed in carapace color and lateral spine length. Both traits were plastic. Carapace color was changeable within 1-2 days, without a molt, upon the exposure of crabs to new substrates. However, colors within the range produced in this study did not significantly affect survivorship in a field or a laboratory experiment. Change in spine length required exposure to predators for 1-4 weeks. Exposure to fish predators resulted in increased spine length, though exposure to adult blue crabs had no significant effect. Crabs with lengthened spines had significantly higher survivorship in both laboratory and field experiments, suggesting that this feature may be one on which to focus large-scale conditioning efforts. Results of this study suggest a level of phenotypic plasticity that may contribute to the blue crab's ability to take advantage of multiple estuarine habitat types. On a more applied level, results of this study suggest that at least some deficiencies in hatchery-raised organisms can be alleviated and would likely lead to improved success and efficiency of stock enhancement efforts. Similar studies on other hatchery-raised invertebrates and finfishes may also lead to improvements in their enhancement programs. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Landscape dynamics of Amazonian deforestation between 1984 and 2002 in

AB Central Rondonia is one of the most deforested regions in the Brazilian Amazon and contains areas at different stages of degradation forming a gradient from mature forest to highly urbanized and built-up areas. Regional data from satellite imagery are available from the 1980s, but apart from studies that quantify deforestation, the broad-scale landscape dynamics of Rondonia have not been examined well. This paper assesses the landscape changes between 1984 and 2002 in a watershed located in the central region of the state of Rondonia, Brazil, which has undergone systematic and rapid deforestation due to introduction of pasture that began in the 1970s. Bi-annual Landsat TM/ETM+ images from 1984 to 2002 were classified into three broad land cover types: mature forest, secondary forest, and pasture, resulting in a time series of land-use/land-cover maps. Landscape changes were evaluated by computing a cross tabulation between years, transition rates, and landscape metrics related to size, density, connectivity, configuration, and deforested patches distribution related to patch size and spatial proximity to roads and old pastures. Transition probability functions were fitted to the temporal series to predict land-use changes for the next 10 years, for three different scenarios: (1) continued land-use change; (2) eliminating clear-cutting and selective logging; and (3) eliminating clear-cutting, selective logging, and secondary vegetation clearing. Current land-use transitions cannot be sustained beyond the next 10-15 years. A more sustainable scenario for the region requires a major reduction of deforestation activities, implementing the "permanent preservation area" policy along riversides, and controlling land-use transitions at balanced levels. We recommend that forest managers in regions facing similar deforestation pressures should strive to maintain at least 35% mature or primary forest, because landscape fragmentation proceeds rapidly below this critical threshold.

AB Aim: To describe the development and testing of a monitoring model with quantitative indicators or progress markers that could measure the progress of individual hospitals in the implementation of kangaroo mother care (KMC). Methods: Three qualitative data sets in the larger research programme on the implementation of KMC of the MRC Research Unit for Maternal and Infant Health Care Strategies in South Africa were used to develop a progress-monitoring model and an accompanying instrument. Results: The model was conceptualized around three phases (pre-implementation, implementation and institutionalization) and six constructs depicting progress ( awareness, adopting the concept, mobilization of resources, evidence of practice, evidence of routine and integration, sustainable practice). For each construct, indicators were developed for which data could be collected by means of the monitoring instrument used in a walk-through visit to a hospital. The instrument has been tested in 65 hospitals.
   Conclusion: The progress-monitoring model enables the quantification of individual hospitals' progress in the process of implementing KMC and an objective measurement of the effectiveness of different outreach strategies. The model also has potential to be adapted for measuring progress in other innovative healthcare interventions on a large scale.

AB This paper presents a dynamic systems view of assertive community treatment (ACT), a recognized evidence-based treatment for adults with severe and persistent mental illness (SPMI). It is argued that because an ACT team operates as a complex adaptive system (CAS), it engages in the organizational processes of "sensemaking" and self-organization, which help to bring order to the actions of team members and sustainability of the intervention itself. Consequently, successful implementation of ACT requires that management technologies Such as meaning-creation and design are used in conjunction with traditional "command and control" technologies of policies, procedures, processes, and structures.

AB Simulation-based optimization can assist green building design by overcoming the drawbacks of trial-and-error with simulation alone. This paper presents an object-oriented framework that addresses many particular characteristics of green building design optimization problems such as hierarchical variables and the coupling with simulation programs. The framework facilitates the reuse of code and can be easily adapted to solve other similar optimization problems. Variable types supported include continuous variables, discrete variables, and structured variables, which act as switches to control a number of sub-level variables. The framework implements genetic algorithms to solve (1) unconstrained and constrained single objective optimization problems, and (2) unconstrained multi-objective optimization problems. The application of this framework is demonstrated through a case study which uses a multi-objective genetic algorithm to explore the trade-off relationship between life-cycle cost and life-cycle environmental impacts for a green building design.

AB The industry of ornamental stones processing from Espirito Santo State produces high amounts of powder waste from sawing and polishing of granite. This waste is a non-biodegradable material that when disposed generates pollution and environmental damage. Clay/waste mixtures were prepared with a kaolinitic clay and waste additions up to 10 wt.%. Various bodies were prepared by uniaxial pressing and sintered in air between 850 degrees C and 1150 degrees C. Emphasis is given on the drying and firing properties. The results revealed that the ceramic bodies containing granite powder waste are adequate for manufacture of structural ceramic. In addition, the employed methodology is environmentally correct and can contribute to the sustainable development.

AB We present two original computational models - globular universe and autopoietic automata - capturing the basic aspects of an evolution: a construction of self-reproducing automata by self-assembly and a transfer of algorithmically modified genetic information over generations. Within this framework we show implementation of autopoietic automata in a globular universe. Further, we characterize the computational power of lineages of autopoietic automata via interactive Turing machines and show an unbounded complexity growth of a computational power of automata during the evolution. Finally, we define the problem of sustainable evolution and show its undecidability.

AB End-stage kidney disease (ESKD), defined as the need for dialysis, receipt of a transplant, or death from chronic kidney failure, generally affects fewer than 1% of the population. However ESKD is the end result of chronic kidney disease (CKD), a widely prevalent but often silent condition with elevated risks of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality and a range of metabolic complications. A recently devised classification of CKD has facilitated prevalence estimates that reveal an "iceberg" of CKD in the community, of which dialysis and transplant patients are the tip. Hypertension, smoking, hypercholesterolemia, and obesity, currently among the World Health Organization's (WHO's) top 10 global health risks, are strongly associated with CKD. The factors, together with increasing diabetes prevalence and an aging population, will result in significant global increases in CKD and ESKD patients. Treatments now available effectively reduce the rate of progression of CKD and the extent of comorbid conditions and complications. The challenges are (1) to intervene effectively to reduce the excess burden of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality associated with CKD, (2) to identify those at greatest risk for ESKD and intervene effectively to prevent progression of early CKD, and (3) to ultimately introduce cost-effective primary prevention to reduce the overall burden of CKD. The vast majority of the global CKD burden will be in developing countries, and policy responses must be both practical and sustainable in these settings.

AB The assessment of aircraft noise is becoming an increasingly important task in ensuring sustainable airport development. Aircraft noise is influenced by many complex factors and traditional laboratory models are not sufficient to assess the exposure to noisy flights of specific local communities in proximity to an airport. In this paper neural network and fuzzy set methods have been integrated with Geographical Information Systems to provide an alternative method to evaluate airport noise.

AB Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is widely used in business to optimize forecasting. Various techniques have been developed to improve outcomes such as adding more diverse algorithms, feature selection and feature weighting in input variables, and modification of input case using instance selection. In this research, ANN is applied to solve problems in forecasting a Supply Chain Management (SCM) sustainable collaboration. This research compares the performance of forecasting SCM sustainable collaboration with four types of ANN models: COANN (COnventional ANN), FWANN (ANN with Feature Weighting), FSANN (ANN with Feature Selection), and HYANN (HYbrid ANN with Feature Weighting and Feature Selection). Using HYANN to forecast an SCM sustainable collaboration gave the best results.

AB Several different techniques have been developed and currently are in use for correction of the inverted nipple. The diversity of techniques indicates the lack of a good, sustainable, and durable solution for this quite common problem. This report discusses a new technique in which two flaps are inserted beneath the nipple through a small tunnel. The advantages of this procedure are its simplicity, the creation of a durable support for the nipple, and the lack of transverse scars in the areola surrounding the nipple. The follow-up period up to 4 years for 11 patients (18 nipples) demonstrates the validity of this technique.

AB The paper examines the main issues surrounding distributional effects in the domains of natural resource management and land policies, agricultural technology and research policies, agricultural market and trade policies, and consumer-oriented policies, including standards, subsidies, and labeling. Agriculture is drifting into an ever more drastic bifurcation at a global level and within many countries. Correcting that bifurcation will require large investments in rural areas and rural people, in institutions, and in information and biological technologies accessible by the poor in the world's smallholder sector. Large and growing national and international inequalities related to agriculture and rural areas threaten peace, growth, and sustainable development.

AB Policy makers and other stakeholders concerned with regional rural development increasingly face the need for instruments that can improve transparency in the policy debate and that enhance understanding of opportunities for and limitations to development. To this end, a methodology called SOLUS (Sustainable Options for Land Use) was developed by an interdisciplinary team of scientists over a 10-year period in the Atlantic Zone of Costa Rica. The main tools of SOLUS include a linear programming (LP) model, two expert systems that define technical coefficients for a large number of production activities, and a geographic information system (GIS). A five-step procedure was developed for GIS to spatially reference biophysical and economic parameters, to create input for the expert systems and the LP model, to store and spatially reference model output data, and to create maps of both model input and output data. SOLUS can be used to evaluate the potential effects of alternative policies and incentive structures on the performance of the agricultural sector. A number of practical applications demonstrate SOLUS's capability to quantify trade-offs between economic objectives (income, employment) and environmental sustainability (soil nutrient balances, pesticide use, greenhouse gas emissions). GIS-created maps visualize the spatial aspects of such trade-offs and indicate hotspots where local goals may conflict with regional goals.

TI Poverty amidst plenty: food insecurity in the United States
SO AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS
LA English
DT Article
DE poverty; food security; household income; labor market
AB The United States faces domestic food security issues that differ from those encountered by many countries. Yet, in 2001, 10.7% of U.S. households were estimated to be food insecure at some point during the year. Food security, poverty, and food insecurity are strongly linked by economic conditions. Job transitions, layoffs, and family disruptions result in periods of low income and vulnerability to food insecurity. Economic and food assistance programs have helped protect many U.S. households when the market economy has failed to do so. These programs have reduced vulnerability to falling income and food insecurity during economic downturns in the business cycle. However effective food assistance programs have been for reducing short-term vulnerability, they do not enhance a household's ability to achieve sustainable food security. Prospects for improving long-term food security are tied to the same economic forces shaping a household's income and budget, particularly those related to labor productivity and wages.

DE sustainability; institutions; evolution; purposes of nature
AB The idea of sustainability has become confused and incoherent. If sustainability is to regain a plausible pertinence to economic policy it must be understood to encompass two realms: (1) human interaction with nature; and ( 2) human interaction with others with respect to their interaction with nature. The on-going redefinition of the purposes of nature requires that institutions norms, rules-property regimes-undergo constant evolution so that human action conduces to nondestructive action. Caution in the social realm is the greatest risk to environmental sustainability.

   economy; globalization
ID INVESTMENT; CREDIT; BRAZIL
AB A common factor that explains why agriculture causes too much environmental degradation, grows too slowly, and has been ineffective in reducing rural poverty is the generalized tendency by governments to under invest in public goods despite the high rates of return to such investments. A large share of rural public expenditures is deviated to private goods (mostly subsidies to the wealthy), which generally have low or even negative rates of return. Behind such an obviously aberrant choice are political economy forces; a highly unequal political lobby market leads to government policies that are biased in favor of economic elites and detrimental for both the environment and rural development. Globalization may affect this important distortion on the allocation of government expenditures in various ways. One such way is by restricting the ability of governments to repress the political mobilization of the poor to counter the almost unchallenged power of the elites in the lobby market. This may contribute toward creating conditions that are more consistent with sustainable and socially equitable development.

ID MANAGEMENT
AB Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) has the lowest agricultural productivity in the world, while almost half of the population lives below US$1 per day. The biggest development policy challenge is to find appropriate solutions to end hunger and poverty in the region. Building on several years of empirical research conducted in East Africa, this paper identifies potential strategies for sustainable development in this region. In general, the empirical evidence reviewed confirms that different strategies are needed in different development domains of SSA. Nevertheless, some elements will be common to all successful strategies, including assurance of peace and security, a stable macroeconomic environment, provision of incentives through markets where markets function, development of market institutions where they do not, and public and private investment in an appropriate mix of physical, human, natural, and social capital. The differences in strategies across these domains mainly reflect differences in the mix of those investments as influenced by different comparative advantages.

ID PERSISTENCE
AB In this paper we employ a simple dynamic simulation model to illustrate and extend the pasture envelope concept as an approach to characterising the stability, resilience and sustainability of pasture-based beef grazing enterprises. The pasture envelope is a form of phase diagram in which the trajectories over time of key biophysical variables such as pasture biomass and composition are graphed against critical thresholds established on the basis of pasture growth rates and livestock growth requirements. We extend the concept to incorporate key financial variables such as cash flow and critical financial thresholds. The model simulates a steer fattening enterprise based on a phalaris and sub-clover pasture in the Northern Tablelands of New South Wales, Australia. The model incorporates pasture growth and senescence for the two pasture species with competition between the species for soil nutrients and light, preferential grazing of the two species by the livestock with livestock growth based on pasture consumption. The model incorporates a variety of decision rules for rotating livestock among multiple paddocks. The model did not simulate changes in soil nutrients. Scaling the seasonal growth pattern of the pasture species captured the influence of rainfall and temperature on pasture growth.
   Two sets of simulations were run to illustrate the use of the pasture envelope concept to explore the economic and biological stability and resilience of the pasture system. The first set was designed to explore the financial and biological stability of the enterprise and involved simulating the impact of different stocking rates and rotation period on pasture production and composition, and cash flow. The second set of simulations was designed more to explore the resilience of the enterprise and involved introducing shocks to the enterprise in the form of 'droughts' of varying strengths. This was achieved by, for example, reducing the maximum growth rate for both pasture species by 50% but maintaining the same seasonal pattern in the maximum growth rates of each species. The first simulation showed that at low stocking rates the enterprise was biologically stable, but cash flow was also low. Increasing stocking rates increased the cash flow, but also reduced the biological stability of the pasture until at very high stocking rates the pasture system collapsed. Changing the rotation period also affected the stability of the enterprise. In situations where the rotation period was very long, greater than 120 days (or 20 days/paddock), the biological system became unsustainable due to detrimental changes in pasture composition. The enterprise was somewhat resilient to drought at stocking rates less than 1 steer/ha. At stocking rates of I steer/ha, the enterprise was economically and biologically unsustainable in moderate or severe droughts. At a stocking rate of 1.25 steers/ha, the enterprise was unsustainable for droughts of any severity. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID IRRIGATION
AB After the reunion of North and South Vietnam in 1975, the area under small-holder, irrigated cultivation of Robusta coffee increased by a factor of 10 in the Central Highlands. The actual coffee acreage in Dak Lak province is estimated to be over 260,000 ha, representing 60% of the national production, with 405,000 t year(-1) for the world market. Vietnam is presently the second largest exporter worldwide and expansion is still going on. In cooperation with the National Institute for Agricultural Planning and Projection (NIAPP), a 5-year development project "Land Evaluation for Land Use Planning and Development of Sustainable Agriculture in the Central Highlands of South Vietnam" was set up, with a goal of diagnosing the sustainability of the rapidly expanding Robusta coffee sector in Central Vietnam. This paper describes the reasons for this quick expansion and investigates the consequences in ecological and social terms. This is done based on a large-scale natural resources inventory, land suitability analysis for Robusta coffee and participatory rural appraisal combined with secondary statistical records from Dak Gan commune. It is representative of the Central Highlands in terms of geomorphological and pedological variability, ethnic identity and with regard to trade-offs between forest conservation and coffee expansion at the cost of available water stocks. Local institutional reforms in the eighties have accelerated coffee expansion in three ways: demographic resettlement, socio-economic liberalization and legislation towards land ownership. Interaction between these three factors has induced a second spontaneous migration flow towards the Highlands in the nineties. Forest area declined by 19% and was converted to coffee plantations, encouraged by the high economic return of this cash crop. The results indicate that this has happened in an haphazard manner and led to a mismatch between the present land use pattern and the natural resource base. Unsustainable land use manifests itself at four levels. (i) The areal limits for sustainable coffee production have been exceeded. (ii) As a consequence over 74% of the present coffee stand is situated on sub-optimal land units. (iii) An excessive coffee area in combination with over-irrigation is likely to deplete groundwater resources. (iv) And paradoxically 24.3% of suitable soils for coffee production is still under forest in Dak Gan. In turn this leads to large-scale environmental and socio-economic decline: soil erosion, water scarcity and social inequity resulting in conflicts between migrants and the indigenous tribes. Besides local reforms, world trade liberalization changed the global coffee market in the late nineties from a regulated system to a free trade market. This fostered global oversupply, which in combination with a stagnant coffee demand suppressed the world market price. Since Vietnam became the second world producer of Robusta, prices have declined by a factor of 3, not only affecting the local sector but households worldwide. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

AB The sugarcane (Sacharum officinarum) monocropping has had a great socio-economic and environmental impact in Brazil, and agroforestry (AFs) has been considered as an alternative to its sustainable production. However, there is a lack of field experiments results under such conditions. Therefore, yield measurement across transect in the tree-crop interface in on-farm conditions, as well as the use of simulation models, may allow the evaluation of biophysical interactions between trees and crops and system productivity. In this work, plant growth and yield in a sugarcane-eucalyptus (Eucalyptus grandis) on-farm interface were evaluated. The experimental site had a Chromic Ferralsol soil and it is located in a sub-tropical region of Brazil. Availability of solar radiation for the crop along the transect was estimated and its effect on sugarcane dry matter production was evaluated. Using such relations, two sugarcane-eucalyptus AFs cycles were simulated to estimate system productivity. The field results showed that the trees presented a higher growth in the AFs, while the crop growth and yield were inversely proportional to their distance from the trees. The eucalyptus wood volume increased from 0.15 to 0.29 m(3) per tree from monocropping to AFs. The sugarcane dry matter decreased from 35.1 to 8.70 t ha(-1) from the furthest to the closest position from tree along the transect. Simulations suggested that light was the main cause of the crop yield reduction, but the importance of competition for water and nutrients increased inversely according to tree distance. However, both simulated AFs provided land equivalent ratio (LER) similar to one (1). Field measurements and simulations indicate that agroforestry systems are a sound alternative for sugarcane cultivation in the studied region. Combination of on-farm studies and simulation models provided conditions to understand tree-crop interactions and to extrapolate field results so that the performance of a new system could be estimated.

AB Nitrogen and phosphorus budgets over two annual periods are presented for an establishing surface-flow constructed wetland treating subsurface drainage from rain-fed, dairy cattle grazed pasture in the North Island of New Zealand. Drainage flows to the wetland (occupying similar to1% of the catchment area) were highly pulsed, associated with rainfall and soil water status, and differed between years (305 and 197 mm drainage). Flow-proportional sampling of inflow and outflow concentrations were combined with continuous flow records to calculate mass balances for the wetlands. Influent nitrate concentrations were high (median 11 g m(-3)) in both years, but transient loads of organic N were also an important form of N in the first year. Mass removal of total nitrogen (TN) and its main constituent forms nitrate/nitrite and organic N was recorded for all seasons over both annual periods studied. TN mass removal efficiency of 79% (841 g m(-2) per year) in the first year, declined to 21% (40 g m(-2) per year) in the second year, associated with changes in the magnitude, speciation and seasonal pattern of N export from the catchment. Ammoniacal N (NH4-N), which comprised <0.5% of TN loadings to the wetland, was generated in small amounts during passage through the wetland in both years. Total phosphorus (TP) in the drainage waters occurred at median concentrations of 0.1-0.2 g m(-3), mainly in dissolved reactive forms (DRP 92% by mass). TP export rose by 101% (5.0 g m(-2) per year) after passage through the wetland in the first year, but decreased by 12% (0.2 g m(-2) per year) in the second year. The results show that constructed wetlands comprising similar to1% of catchment area can markedly reduce N export via pastoral drainage. but may be net sources of NH4-N, DRP and TP during establishment. Performance of the wetland appeared to be affected by both establishment/maturation factors and year-to-year climatic variations. Longer-term studies, supplemented by process-based laboratory and mesocosm investigations, are required to evaluate sustainable nutrient removal rates over a range of climatic conditions, and identify the key factors regulating performance.

AB An impact assessment of current upland cropping systems in Haiti was carried out using a combined experimental and agronomic survey approach on fields that were chosen as being representative of the diversity of land use practices and intensities. These cropping systems were mostly developed on ferralsols with differing degrees of weathering owing to the varying depths to the limestone bedrock. Three soil types for which the CEC of the mineral fraction was less than 3, 4-7, or 11-18 cmol((divided by)) kg(-1) were distinguished. The study shows that apart from phosphorus, soil cation availability (K, Mg) is the most limiting factor for a successful bean crop. With the insertion of a fertilized cabbage crop into the rotation, the soil bioavailable P at the sowing of the bean-maize intercrop (BMI) did not significantly increase, whereas the exchangeable K content of the soils increased from 0.22 to 0.38 and led to a significant increase in the bean yield from 654 to 1079 kg ha(-1). It is clear that the trend of the cropping systems towards a shorter fallow period, increasing frequency of the BMI and introduction of N-P-K fertilizers, may all increase crop production in the short term. However, these changes are unlikely to lead to sustained benefits. One of the potential risks is the soil Mg depletion due to K fertilization as revealed by a microlysimeter experiment. Another risk is the increased proportion of plants with bean root diseases, due to the shortening of the BMI rotation interval. The proportion of plants with bean root diseases increased from 7 to 22% in 1989 and from 10 to 39% in 1990. when the bean rotation interval was reduced front 3 to 1 years. Another risk is the spatial spread of fall armyworm (Spodoptera frugiperda) from the plots covered with residues of a preceding maize crop, to the neighboring plots recently sown with maize. Future research should therefore focus on optimizing the K:Mg ratio of fertilizer, breeding bean varieties resistant to Fusarium disease, diversifying the range of crops cultivated, and management of the maize residues. The evolution of the cropping systems in the last 10 years is somewhat consistent with the diagnosis made about 15 years earlier. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Traditional approaches to soil quality evaluation were based on the use of physical, chemical and microbiological indicators. Recently, new methods, based on soil microarthropods have been proposed for soil quality evaluation. Soil microarthropods have been shown to respond sensitively to land management practices and to be correlated with beneficial soil functions. In Italy, a new approach (called QBS index) based on the types of edaphic microarthropods has been proposed to assess soil biological quality. The QBS index is based on microarthropod groups present in a soil sample. Each type found in the sample receives a score from 1 to 20 (eco-morphological index, EMI), according to its adaptation to soil environment. The QBS index sums up these scores, thereby characterizing the microarthropod community of the sample being studied. QBS has been applied on a range of soil types and land uses in Italy, its validity evaluated for assessing biological quality of soil in different situations. This paper describes the QBS methods and presents three applications of the proposed methodology. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In Ethiopia land degradation in the forms of soil erosion and declining soil fertility are serious challenges to agricultural productivity and economic growth. Despite the general recognition of the threat from land degradation on agricultural productivity, few studies have been made to quantify the extent, rate and process of soil fertility depletion under various land use systems and management practices in the country. In this study we assessed soil chemical and physical property responses to deforestation and subsequent cultivation along a chronosequence of closely located farmlands of different ages (7, 10, 26, 34 and 53 years) since conversion from a tropical dry Afromontane natural forest in Ethiopia. These properties were compared with soil properties under an adjacent natural forest. The changes were used as indicators to evaluate the sustainability of the farm management. All the soils in the study were Mollic Andosols/Humic Haplustands. Soil bulk density (g cm(-3)) in the 0-10 and 10-20 cm soil layers increased significantly while percent pore space decreased significantly in a continuum with increasing cultivation period. Soil C and total N contents (g ka(-1)) in the 0-10 cm soil layer declined significantly and exponentially with increasing years under cultivation. However, in the 10-20 cm soil layer both soil C and total N on the farmlands were significantly higher until after 34 years of continuous cultivation compared to the same soil layer under the natural forest. Consequently, the soil C stock (g m(-2)) of the upper 0.20 m mineral soil was not significantly lower on the farmlands until after 26 years of continuous cultivation compared to the natural forest soil. Available P and K (mg kg(-1)) in the 0-10 cm layer were higher in the soils of the farmlands throughout the 53 years of continuous cultivation compared to the soil under the natural forest. Exchangeable Ca, CEC and base saturation in the 0-10 cm soil layer declined more or less throughout the Cultivation period while in the 10-20 cm soil layer they followed the patterns of soil C of that depth. Generally, the magnitudes and rates of degradation of the soil properties following conversion and subsequent cultivation were lower than expected for a low input tropical farming system as the one investigated. Nevertheless, almost all soil quality attributes showed overall declining trends in the long perspective. This continuous decline, albeit slowly, in soil quality with increasing cultivation period indicated that the present land management is not sustainable. Therefore, improved management is imperative to sustain the soil quality and maintain long-term productivity of the farmlands. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Organic farming has undergone significant expansion in Europe over the last decade and it is often seen as a sustainable alternative to intensive agricultural systems. If it is to be truly sustainable, it must maintain levels of soil fertility sufficient for economic crop production in the long-term, whilst also protecting the environment. This paper presents results comparing soils managed organically for at least 15 years, with soils under conventional management, on four arable farms in England. There were no significant differences in total soil organic matter, total nitrogen or C:N ratio between the conventionally and organically managed soils. However, concentrations of extractable potassium and phosphorus were significantly lower in soils managed organically. The largest difference between the conventional and organic fields in potassium concentration was on the oldest organic farm. These results support the argument that organic mixed arable systems are mining reserves of potassium and phosphorus, built up during conventional management, and that changes to organic management practices to increase inputs of potassium and phosphorus are required, if long-term declines in soil fertility, and thus, yields are to be avoided.

AB Clear land ownership and community involvement in managing forests are key determinants in securing sustainable land management. A recent study in Lampung in the province of Sumatra, Indonesia revealed that, even with the use of military force, forest policy and management has largely failed to protect forest resources when local communities were not involved. In contrast, with less government intervention but more secure land rights (as perceived by farmers), local communities have successfully rehabilitated degraded land, including that designated as state forest area, through establishment of coffee based agroforestry. The main incentive for local communities to manage land more sustainably was the expectation of secure land rights on state forest land through which livelihood and income could be realized. The study indicated that under such circumstances there is room for negotiation between the government forestry department and local communities to better manage state forest land. This not only can generate income for local communities but can also improve the overall environment through reduction of fire incidence. This indicates that legal land use rights for local communities on state forest land could be used as a 'reward' for upland farmers for their role in maintaining environmental services of forest land.

AB The conversion of forests to agroecosystems or agroforests comes with many changes in biological and chemical processes. Agroforestry, a tree based agroecosystem, has shown promise with respect to enhanced system nutrient accumulation after land conversion as compared to sole cropping systems. Previous research on tropical agroforestry systems has revealed increases in soil organic matter and total organic nitrogen in the short term. However, research is lacking on long-term system level sustainability of nutrient cycles and storage, specifically in traditional multi-strata agroforestry systems, as data on both the scope and duration of nutrient instability are inconclusive and often conflicting. This study, conducted in Ghana, West Africa, focused on carbon and nitrogen dynamics in a twenty-five year chronosequence of cacao ( Theobroma cacao Linn.) plantations. Three treatments were selected as on-farm research sites: 2, 15 and 25-year-old plantations. Soil carbon ( C, to a depth of 15 cm) varied between treatments ( 2 years: 22.6 Mg C ha(-1); 15 years: 17.6 Mg C ha(-1); 25 years: 18.2 Mg C ha(-1)) with a significant difference between the 2- and 15- and the 2- and 25-year-old treatments ( p < 0.05). Total soil nitrogen in the top 15 cm varied between 1.09 and 1.25 Mg N ha(-1) but no significant differences were noted between treatments. Soil nitrification rates and litter fall increased significantly with treatment age. However, photosynthetically active radiation ( PAR) and soil temperature showed a significant decrease with age. No difference was found between decay rates of litter at each treatment age. By 25 years, system carbon sequestration rates were 3 Mg C ha(-1) y(-1), although results suggest that even by 15 years, system-level attributes were progressing towards those of a natural system.

AB A field experiment was performed in eastern Kenya to estimate N-2 fixation by Sesbania sesban over an 18-month period using the N-15 dilution method. The influence of three reference species, Senna spectabilis, Eucalyptus saligna and Grevillea robusta, on the estimates of N-2 fixation was also assessed. Percentage Ndfa ( nitrogen derived from the atmosphere) was calculated based on foliar atom excess (FAE), above-ground atom excess (AAE) or whole tree atom excess (WAE) data. The differences in atom% N-15 excess values between species and plant parts are presented and discussed. We recommend the use of several reference species for estimating % Ndfa and that the different results obtained should be carefully considered in relation to the issues being addressed. In this study, Senna was the most suitable of the three reference species because its N uptake pattern and phenology were very similar to those of Sesbania. When well established, the amount of N fixed by Sesbania accounts for more than 80% of its total N content, according to FAE-based estimates. We estimated the Ndfa by Sesbania after 18 months to between 500 and 600 kg ha(-1), depending on whether FAE, AAE or WAE data were used and on the choice of reference species. The substantial accumulation of N in planted Sesbania highlighted its potential to increase the sustainability of crop production on N-limited soils. We consider the N-15 dilution method to be appropriate for quantifying N-2 fixation in improved fallows in studies, similar to this one, of young trees with high N-2-fixing ability.

AB Kayu putih oil, extracted from the kayu putih tree (Melaleuca leucadendron), is an important non-timber forest product (NTFP) in Indonesia. We compared productivity of kayu putih tree plantations among three different sites in East, Central, and West Java, Indonesia. Leaf-twig, and branch production per tree differed significantly among the three sites. Tree biomass production was highest at the site in West Java practicing tumpangsari (a form of shifting cultivation) of kayu putih with rice (Oryza sativa) on alluvial soils. Tree biomass production was lowest at the site in East Java, practicing tumpangsari of kayu putih with maize (Zea mays) and cassava (Mani- hot esculenta). At this site, tree biomass production increased with increasing stand age and low production was compensated by greater biomass yield of companion crops. Intermediate tree biomass production was observed at the site in Central Java where intercropping is only practiced for the first two years after plantation establishment. Production of tree biomass and kayu putih oil did not increase with increasing stand density, indicating that at a given site, high tree stocking did not lead to high production. Stand-level productivity of the plantations increased with increasing stand age and maximum productivity was attained at 15 to 35 years, after which productivity declined. This suggested unsustainable stand productivity as plantations increase in age.

AB The main aim of this study is to review the environmental and socioeconomic sustainability of the gum arabic farming system in central Sudan. A further aim is to analyse some of the main factors influencing production in recent decades in order to understand the future trade potential and consequently the smallholder livelihood. The study shows that end-user imports of gum arabic have increased during recent decades. Gum arabic is mainly for uses such as soft drinks, confectionary, and pharmaceuticals. However, even with this increased demand the production in Sudan, the main country of production, is declining. The producers, mainly smallholders, suger from fluctuating prices. If the gum arabic farming system should be able to provide the environmental benefits of improved soil fertility and the socioeconomic benefits of risk spreading and dry season income opportunities, the prices paid to smallholders must be stabilized at a fair level, otherwise a shift to other crops or practices might take place.

AB Trees provide many environmental services including improved soil fertility and soil structure, which often leads to increased productivity and sustainability of the land. Trees also increase the average carbon stocks of land-use systems. Under the Clean Development Mechanism of the Kyoto Protocol, landholders may receive payments for the carbon-sequestration services provided. This study is the first of a series aimed at assessing the appropriateness of tree-based land-use systems as alternatives to continuous cropping and/or Imperata-fallow systems. The performance of a Gliricidia sepium woodlot, grown over 25 years and under various pruning and harvesting regimes, was assessed through modelling. The assessment was based on the system's ability to sequester and store carbon, maintain land productivity, and be financially pro. table for landholders. It was found that the system was pro. table under most management regimes tested. Profits were maximised by pruning and harvesting as much biomass as possible when no carbon payments were available, but this strategy decreased system productivity and profitability in the long run. Carbon-sequestration payments encouraged landholders to adopt less intensive practices since net revenues were higher with carbon payments. It was also shown that the carbon pools included in a carbon-trading scheme were sensitive to carbon-measuring costs. For example, if the annual cost of measuring soil carbon was greater than US$1.19 ha(-1) it would not be economical to account for this pool in a carbon-sequestration project.

TI Genetic bottlenecks in agroforestry systems: results of tree nursery
   surveys in East Africa
SO AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS

DT Article
DE genetic diversity; tree seed sources
AB Seedlings sourced through tree nurseries are expected to form an important component of future tree cover on farms. As such, the genetic composition of nursery seedlings is expected to impact on the productivity and sustainability of agroforestry ecosystems. By surveying current practices of nursery managers in five areas from Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda, we quantified parameters associated with the collection, production and distribution of tree germplasm in East Africa. Considerable variation for seed-propagated nursery species was observed in the number of maternal parents (mother trees) sampled to establish nursery lots, the quantity of seedlings raised in nursery lots and the projected number of clients for nursery lots. Current seed collection practice was the most obvious limiting bottleneck in delivering high levels of genetic diversity to farmers. In the 143 cases analysed, seed to establish nursery lots was collected from a mean of only 6.4 maternal parents. In 22% of cases, nursery lots were established from a single maternal parent. On average, each maternal parent produced sufficient progeny to provide all the seedlings received by an individual nursery client. Consequently, the potential impact on farm and landscape genetic diversity of possible non-randomisation of progeny within nurseries is serious. In two instances, pair-wise analysis of transformed data suggested significant differences between geographic areas in the projected number of clients for nursery lots. We discuss improved nursery practices likely to promote genetic diversity, in particular increased maternal parent sampling and germplasm exchange.

AB Biological activity in tree rhizosphere and association of VAM fungi with tree-roots could be used as selection criteria for agroforestry trees in and ecosystems. Dehydrogenase activity and VAM fungi association in rhizosphere of six agroforestry trees (Azadirachta indica, Acacia tortilis, Eucalyptus camaldulensis, Prosopis cineraria and Tecomella undulata) were studied under irrigated and rainfed conditions in the and zone of India. Higher dehydrogenase activity (9.5 to 16.8similar top kat g soil(-1)), root colonization (58.3 to 68.5%) and spore density (132.5 to 234.7 spores 100 g soil(-1)) were observed in tree rhizosphere as compared to that in non-rhizosphere (7.4, 37.7 and 44.4). Irrigation had increased dehydrogenase activity by 2.2.1% while it reduced root colonization and spore density by 14.2% and 16.2%, respectively. Trees of A. indica had registered maximum growth while E. camaldulensis the least. Findings suggest that selection of A. nilotica, A. indica, and T. undulata for plantations of agroforestry in and region would reduce the risk and ensure sustainability of the agroforestry system.

DE Brazil; inequality; land cover change; land use; livelihoods
ID INCOME DIVERSIFICATION; BRAZILIAN AMAZON; DETERMINANTS
AB This paper focuses on agricultural diversity, a key property of agroforestry systems, and examines the influences of household asset endowments. The analysis addresses a debate between 'differential motivation' and 'differential capacity' arguments concerning the importance of asset inequality for agricultural diversification among rural households in developing regions. I draw on data from a survey of small farm colonists in the Brazilian Amazon to assess components and measures of agricultural diversity, and to model those diversity measures using indicators of household asset endowments. The results indicate that agricultural diversification is modest in the study site, but varies among households, as do asset endowments. Models of agricultural production and income diversity indicate that agricultural diversity primarily reflects labor endowments, though certain types of capital are also important. These findings bear implications for research on agricultural diversity in other contexts, and for policies aiming to promote 'productive conservation' by compatibilizing poverty reduction, economic development and environmental sustainability.

AB The trade-off between early spring harvest of cool-season annual forage legumes and summer seed production may shed light on subsequent yearly stand regeneration. Sixteen annual clover and medic cultivars or locally collected accessions were seeded in the autumn of 1999 at Stephenville, TX, on a Windthorst (fine, mixed thermic Udic Paleustalf) fine sandy loam and allowed to self-reseed in the autumn of 2000 and 2001. During the first 2 yr, three harvest treatments were imposed: harvest at 5 cm from crown whenever branches reached 10 cm from crown, harvest at 10 cm when branches attained 15 cm, and a single April harvest. Forage yields showed a year X species interaction (P = 0.001) and ranged up to 6 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1). Plants harvested in April only were consistently more productive than the 5-cm harvest and yielded nearly 4.9 Mg ha(-1) in Year 1. Forage acid detergent fiber and crude protein concentrations reflected entry x harvest x year interactions (P < 0.05). Seed yields varied considerably among entries, and all the annual clovers and most medics were able to self-reseed regardless of harvest treatment, showing promise for self-reseeding, sustainable pasture systems in the southern Great Plains.

AB To be effective and sustainable, HIV-prevention interventions need to be sufficiently powerful to counteract prevailing social norms and diffuse through the targeted community to provide social reinforcement for behaviour change. Social structural and environmental factors are major influences on HIV-related behaviours yet the dearth of conceptualization and operationalization of these factors impede progress in intervention development. In this paper we propose a social ecological perspective to intervention and highlight relevant theories from social psychology and organizational behaviour literatures. We examine social networks and social settings as micro-structural and environmental influences on HIV risk behaviours, social identities and norms, and as important targets for HIV-prevention intervention. Intervention approaches are proposed that target networks and behavioural settings and provide participants with socially meaningful and rewarding behavioural options that are consistent with valued prosocial identities or roles. Examples are presented on how such an approach has been utilized in prior HIV prevention interventions, including our social network-oriented intervention that trained disadvantaged former and current illicit drug users to conduct peer outreach. We describe how behavioural interventions may enhance or introduce new prosocial identities and social roles, and that network members may confer social approval to reinforce these identities and roles, leading to sustained behavioural risk reduction and changes in risk behaviour norms.

AB China has rich plant biodiversity and many plants show bioactivities on human and animals. Allelopathic studies on traditional Chinese medicinal plant species have started recently. Twenty three traditional Chinese medicinal plant species were selected to test their allelopathic activities on wheat and cucumber. The allelopathic activities of S. alopecuroides, C komarovii, V. officinalis, R. officinale, R. glutinosa, C komarovii, S. nux-vomica and L. lucidum on plants are reported first time on agricultural pests. The extract from L. radiata drastically inhibited (> 90%) the growth of monocotyledon and dicotyledon plants, its inhibitory effects stopped the germination of wheat and cucumber seeds. C. komarovii and C hederacea plants extracts were most inhibitory (>80%) to root growth of both monocotyledon and dicotyledon plant roots. C komarovii also inhibited the plant shoot elongation. The other plant species with higher allelopthic activity only inhibited either monocotyledon or dicotyledon plants. Fourteen plant species inhibited the growth of monocotyledons, but only 3 plants spp. (L. radiata, Artemisia scoparia and C. komarovii) were inhibitory to the root and shoot growth of dicotylecon plants. Extracts of R. glutinosa, L. radiata, A. scoparia, L. lucidum, C. ambrosiodes and S.nux-vomica strongly inhibited the shoot length of endosperm removed wheat seedlings, indicating that the extracts might inhibit the photosynthesis. The traditional Chinese medicinal plant spp. possess numerous allelochemicals with different mechanisms and selectivity. This study clearly demonstrated that the medicinal plant species are potent sources of allelochemicals, which could be used for sustainable weed management and ecofriendly environment.

AB Objectives. To develop a sustainable formal faculty mentoring program to support professional development of new faculty members at the Massachusetts College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences.
   Methods. Program components included a mentorship subcommittee, faculty mentoring guidelines, protege/mentor pairs, an orientation, seminars/workshops, and meetings between mentor/proteges pairs. Preparticipation and postparticipation questionnaires about the faculty mentoring program were used to assess changes in perceived level of abilities of proteges and mentors in areas of teaching, service, and scholarship.
   Results. After 5 years, 93 proteges and 73 mentors have participated in the faculty mentoring program. Program evaluations were largely positive. Self-perceived abilities of proteges increased in all areas addressed, program self-study, faculty recruitment, grant application preparation, program development, and promotion process. Perceived abilities of mentors also showed some increases following the faculty mentoring program.
   Conclusion. Both proteges and mentors can benefit from mentoring relationships. Faculty mentoring programs are important for faculty development and retention and achievement of academic and institutional goals.

AB Low- and middle-income countries suffer disproportionately from reduced life expectancy and quality of life. Injuries are overlooked as contributors to global inequities in health, yet the long-term disabilities they frequently produce represent a significant burden. The Fogarty International Center of the National Institutes of Health convened a panel of experts in trauma and injury from the United States and low- and middle income nations to identify research gaps in this area and opportunities to create new knowledge. Panel members identified sustainable programs of research established through stable linkages between institutions in high-income nations and those in low- and middle income nations as a priority. The resulting benefits of addressing the growing burden of trauma and injury to communities in resource-constrained settings around the world would be substantial.

AB Elucidation of genetic variability and genetic relationship among breeds has direct relevance with the issues of sustainable use of domestic animal genetic resources. In the present study, genetic polymorphism was evaluated using 22 microsatellite loci in unrelated samples of Red Kandhari and Deoni cattle breeds inhabiting the same geographical area of Marathwada region in Maharashtra state (western India). This work was mainly aimed at assessing the current genetic diversity to understand whether the two zebu populations in question are genetically differentiated. A total of 164 alleles were detected with an average of 5.82 and 5.86 alleles per locus (MNA) in Red Kandhari and Deoni breeds, respectively. The estimated mean observed (Ho) and expected (He) heterozygosity were 0.47 and 0.64 in Red Kandhari vs. 0.57 and 0.69 in Deoni cattle, respectively, demonstrating considerable level of genetic variation in both the populations. Mean estimates of F statistics were: F (F(IT)) = 0.315 +/- 0.035, f(F(IS)) = 0.231 +/- 0.031, theta(F(ST)) = 0.110 +/- 0.022, with both the breeds exhibiting significant deficit of heterozygotes (F(IS) = 0.179 in Deoni; 0.278 in Red Kandhari). The multilocus F(ST) values implied that 11.0% of the total genetic variation corresponds to breed and were statistically greater than zero for the two populations, suggesting population division. The evaluation of exact test also indicated that allele frequencies across all the loci differed significantly (P < 0.001) between two zebu breeds, further supporting population differentiation. Different genetic distance measures showed considerable levels of distances between the two cattle breeds (0.318 = Nei's standard D(S); 0.250 Nei's D(A); 0.416 = Cavalli-Sforza and Edwards's D(C); 0.164 = Reynold's, and 2.64 Delta mu square (d mu)(2). Bayesian statistical approach to assign each individual to the population also supported considerable differentiation between the two cattle breeds, possibly reflecting the limited gene flow between the two Marthwada cattle populations. The existence of cohesive breeding structure of both the breeds was further substantiated by allele-sharing distance measures (D(AS)) among individual animals. The results of this study thus revealed that the two Bos indicus breeds sharing the common breeding tracts are genetically differentiated enough as separate breeds.

DT Article
AB This work compares two dramatically different types of wildlife management in Senegal, a country threatened by poaching and deforestation : the first concerns the management of the Niokolo Koba National Park, by a public utility service and the second, the management of the Bandia Reserve, a fenced area which surface is more than thousand times lower, by private investors. In order to do this comparison, the structure, type of management, evolution of flora and fauna, and management problems encountered for each protected area are analysed. This comparison allows to formulate some recommendations for a sustainable management of Senegalese wildlife.

AB My proposals for reducing soil erosion are based on my experience of assessing erosion, largely in Britain, both of cultivated land and of upland grazings. I have assessed the extent and rates of erosion in the field mostly by using easily- and rapidly-used photographic and measurement techniques, rather than by using experimental plots set up either in the field or laboratory which overstate erosion. Policies which have governed the economics of agricultural production have also been examined. Much of the increase in Occurrence of runoff and soil erosion in Britain is due to changes in land use and in intensity of use since the Agriculture Act was passed in 1947, and especially since joining the Common Market in 1973, with its even greater emphasis on paying for increased production. The increasing numbers of animals grazing the land, especially sheep, led to the initiation and erosion of bare soil in the uplands and to trampling and puddling of soils in lowland pastures. There is evidence that runoff from the land, and sedimentation of water courses have also increased. In the cultivated lowlands, the expansion in area of land drilled to winter cereals, the increase in area of land sown to maize or used to rear outdoor pigs, changes in farming techniques, and larger machines working in larger fields can explain much of the increase in erosion. Reversing some of these changes, for example by lowering the intensity of grazing and inserting grass (set-aside) into the arable rotation will reduce the extent of erosion. Other techniques to reduce erosion are well-known but need national and international agricultural policies that improve farmers' incomes to bring them into use. In developed countries, erosion need not reduce soil fertility, as nutrients removed from the soil by animals or crops can be affordably replaced. This may not be so in other parts of the world. Education of farmers also has a vital role to play in persuading them to use the land more sustainably, for many of the impacts of erosion such as flooding and pollution of water supplies bear on society as a whole, not just farmers who are themselves little affected. The principles devised to reduce erosion in developed countries are likely to be Successful in developing countries. However, it may take many years for better and more sustainable agricultural policies at national and international level to be devised and brought into being.

AB Technology change stimulates the expectations of society and seeks to satisfy its demands. Continuing advances in electronics and information technology over the last 20 years have responded to the challenge posed by the environmental impacts of agricultural production systems. Future agriculture will require precision techniques to assemble information and achieve increasingly precise and responsive management practices in order to reduce wasteful inputs, and meet the social and economic pressures for safe high quality food at lower cost. Biosystems engineering, an interdisciplinary science linking biology, physics, engineering and mathematics, can provide understanding and then innovative precision Solutions for agriculture. Public and industry investment will be needed to achieve the necessary goals of lower environmental impact, and precision techniques will make a significant contribution. Worldwide, the availability of tools that allow accurate control of inputs and traceable management of food production will contribute to sustainable food production for all. The vision is of systems that utilise sensing methods and mathematical models of the biological process, and link them through to control algorithms that realise practical benefits. Tools to measure spatial variation in crop yield will draw on statistical models to interpret complex variation and provide robust information to justify variable input management. Machine vision will interpret complex natural scenes, leading to real-time control, and biosensors will be incorporated into automated systems for sensing animal fertility status, leading to automatic monitoring of animal health and welfare.

AB Agricultural policy in Europe is changing from supporting production to encouraging environmental benefits in the context of sustainable rural development. As a result, there is a window of opportunity to reconsider the balance between agricultural production and biodiversity management on British farmland, to seek to redress the problems for biodiversity that accrued during intensification without reducing the capacity to meet the coming challenges of global change and population increase. These challenges are discussed in the context of longer term historical change, and in terms of how readily they can be overcome. Current policies can deliver conservation targets that are within the control of individual land managers, and are likely to increase landscape heterogeneity significantly. However, it will be more difficult to plan landscapes to deliver agricultural production, ecosystem services and conserve biodiversity in the face of nutrient deposition and climate change. There can be no theoretical '' optimum '' balance between production and biodiversity, as environmental goals depend greatly upon decisions about scales (from local to global, immediate to long) and the viewpoints of stakeholders. Indeed, the social challenge of delivering sustainable agricultural landscapes is far greater than the scientific one of researching what they might be like.

AB The development of new varieties of crop plants is ongoing for plant breeders and progress since the Green Revolution has been steady, if not dramatic. With the recent sequencing of Arabidopsis thaliana and of rice the development of both physical and informational resources has entered a new phase. This paper examines the state of plant bioinformatics as it is now and as it is likely to develop in the future. It also looks rather further forward to what crop scientists might want from bioinformatics, before examining the likely physiological targets for sustainability traits and the prospects for their improvement in wheat. Wheat is taken as the focus crop because it is potentially one of the most difficult to work with in molecular terms, both because of its large hexaploid genome size and because of its considerable genetic distance from the most information rich plant species, Arabidopsis. Finally, we examine how these tools might be used to track down the underlying genes controlling sustainability traits and how these may then be exploited in plant breeding programmes using marker-assisted selection.

AB This paper deals with a multigeneration game that provides a new rationale for representing time preference in very long term cost benefit analysis, as it happens typically in the economics of global climate change. One defines an intergenerational game where each generation has a random life duration and transfers the control of the economic system to the next generation at the end of its life. The payoff to a generation is a discounted sum of the expected consumption by the whole infinite sequence of generations, starting with the current one. The equilibrium is characterized by a dynamic programming equation; a unique solution is proved to exist; a numerical technique is proposed and implemented on a continuous time simplified version of the model DICE94. The results show the influence of this form of altruism on the asymptotic steady states of the economy subject to a global climate change effect.

TI Automatic control of additives with modern online measurement technology
   raises papermaker productivity
SO APPITA JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
AB In recent years, paper machines have undergone remarkable changes in terms of speeds and usable widths to meet ever-increasing demands on paper quality. This development has necessitated novel techniques for monitoring the stock properties. Today, lab-scale measurements alone fail to efficiently monitor PM processes because the latter are extremely difficult to simulate. Instead, online/inline measuring procedures have to be applied.
   After the introduction of online measurement, the next and decisive step is to implement closed-loop control. This is the only way to achieve targeted chemical dosages to ensure a sustainable improvement of paper properties.
   As far as deaerator chemicals are concerned, the installation of control loops successfully achieves the desired advancement.
   At Holmen Paper, deaerator control achieved a 37% reduction in the consumption of this chemical.
   Advanced, low-maintenance sensors enable retention control via effective consistency control in the white water. Once Inline Retention Control had been installed at the Braviken mill, the white water consistency was kept more constant than had been possible with the previous sensor. Owing to it's lower maintenance requirements, sensor availability was increased.
   The trials at Braviken were intended to study the impact of charge on wet end processes. Specifically, the charge variation caused by DIP and TMP as furnish components was studied. It was found that the measured fluctuations are also seen in subsequent process steps, where they may be successfully controlled. At Braviken, a fixative control loop was installed ahead of the blend chest, i.e. before starch dosage.

AB The objective of this study was to identify the potential area for the commencement of sustainable shrimp farming with the help of remote sensing and geographical information systems (GIS). Current land use pattern of the Study area (coastal area of Palghar Taluk, Thane district, Maharashtra, India) was extracted from the satellite image (IRS ID LISS III FCC Print) with the, help of global positioning system (GPS) data. Intertidal areas (mudflats) were evaluated for the development of brackish water aquaculture (shrimp farming) and the data on 37 parameters under Six major categories namely, engineering parameters, water quality parameters, soil quality parameters, infrastructure facility, meteorological parameters, and social restriction were collected for different mudflat areas GRAM++ (geo referenced area management system) GIS software was used for data analysis. The weighted overlay method was adopted in GIS to delineate the potential area into four major categories as highly Suitable. Suitable, moderately suitable. and unsuitable. This-study revealed that of the total study area of 20431.034 ha, 0.377% is highly suitable, 9.873% is suitable, 1.772% is moderately Suitable, 85.027% is unsuitable, and 2.951% is already under aqua farms. The suitable area was further classified into 11 sub-categories indicating priority for development. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Sustainable and long-term growth of the aquaculture industry should involve both ecologically sound practices and appropriate resource management. The increasing economic dimension of Mediterranean aquaculture is opening new economic niches and may be a valid support to reduce the pressure of traditional fisheries. Aquaculture practices can also lead to modi. cations of coastal habitats through the impact of wastes of land-based and open-sea mariculture facilities. In addition to these aspects which place a direct pressure on aquatic ecosystems and wild fishery resources, a wide range of environmental contaminants, such as chemicals used in farming operations, can accumulate in farmed organisms and put fish health and quality at risk. Thus, as aquaculture makes its transition to a major food-producing sector, proper assessment and control of environmental impacts and food safety awareness are becoming increasingly important. The development of simple tools able to monitor the extent of environmental and biological impacts associated with farming operations at various levels of biological complexity from the ecosystem to the organism level is required. Although a number of techniques for assessing the environmental and biological impact of pollutants in natural ecosystems are available, the development of practical and validated tools is sorely needed in aquaculture.

AB Arthropod-borne virus (arbovirus) diseases (ABVDs) remain major threats to human health and well-being and, as an epidemiologic group, inflict an unacceptable health and economic burden on humans and animals, including livestock. The developed world has been fortunate to have escaped much of the burden that arboviruses and their arthropod vectors inflict on humans in disease endemic countries, but the introduction and rapid spread of West Nile virus in the Western Hemisphere demonstrated that we can no longer be complacent in the face of these emerging and resurging vector-borne diseases. Unfortunately, as the burdens and threats of ABVDs have increased, the U.S. and international public health capacity to address them has decreased. Vaccines are not available for most of these agents. Previously successful strategies to control ABVDs emphasized vector control, but source reduction and vector control strategies using pesticides have not been sustainable. New insights into vector biology and vector pathogen interactions, and the novel targets that likely will be forthcoming in the vector post-genomics era, provide new targets and opportunities for vector control and disease reduction programs. These findings and approaches must be incorporated into existing strategies if we are to control these important pathogens.

The total livestock population in the arid region of Rajasthan has reached 29.25 million in the year 2001 from 10.34 million in the year 1951. In terms of adult cattle units (ACU) the livestock pressure was 9.58 million in 1983, which increased to 11.27 million in 2001. Local grazing pressures are surpassing the recommended stocking rates of the rangelands at an enormous pace. The pressure was 0.87 ACU ha(-1) in 1981 which increased to 1.02 ACU ha(-1) ha in 2001 against the optimum desirable density of 0.2 ACU ha(-1). Excellent, good, fair, poor and very poor condition rangelands (having approximate productivity of 2.0, 1.5, 1.0, 0.75, and 0.5 Mg ha(-1), respectively) can safely provide year long grazing to 0.25-0.30, 0.20, 0.17, 0.13, and 0.01-0.06 ACU hat blocks, respectively, during normal years. The carrying capacities of the rangelands were estimated several decades ago, however, qualitative evidence is available regarding changes in soil and vegetation patterns. There is need to evolve practices for improving the long-term productivity and sustainability of rangeland ecosystems. An increase of 639% in forage yield was observed over control by adopting moisture conservation technique. Increase in forage yield was recorded in the range of 30 to 122% in "poor" and 29 to 107% in "fair" class rangelands after 3-5 years of reseeding. Premonsoon solving of grass seeds give 36% higher forage yield over monsoon sowing. Application of 22.5 kg N ha(-1) during normal year resulted in additional increase in forage yield by 20 to 70%. If sustainable productivity increases are to be achieved, mechanisms must be developed to involve fully range users (herders) in all aspects of project planning and implementation. A flexible stocking rate, dependent on seasonal and annual variation in feed availability, is suggested as a key element in any improved range and livestock management strategy.

ID HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY; INDIA
AB Irrigated agriculture in arid and semiarid regions of the world has resulted in salinity and waterlogging problems that are threatening the sustainability of our lands. Based on pH of the saturated paste, electrolytic conductivity of the saturated paste extract (ECe), and exchangeable sodium percentage (ESP), these soils have been classified as saline, alkali, and saline-alkali per the criteria of the U. S. Salinity Laboratory. Apart from textural B horizon, the Soil Taxonomy considers only ESP for defining a natric and ECe for defining a salic horizon. It does not consider pH and the nature of soluble salts as criteria for classifying these soils. All soils with high pH values (>8.5) as well as high ESP (>15) and high ECe (>4 dS m(-1)) developed in situ, soils with high pH values (>8.5) as well as high sodium adsorption ratio (SAR >13) and high ECe (>4 dS m(-1)) formed due to use of irrigation waters containing high residual sodium carbonate (RSC >2.5 mol m(-3)), and those with moderate pH values (7 to 8.5) but high SAR (>13) and high ECe (>4 dS m(-1)) formed due to shallow saline water table, are classified as saline-alkali soils. These are classified as Salidic Natrustalfs under Alfisols, since such soils contain both salic and natric horizons. Reclamation of such soils requires both leaching to remove soluble salts and application of amendments to lower ESP. This creates confusion in the mind of soil survey officials, planners, and development authorities. An examination of the composition of saturated paste extracts of these soils shows that these are either to be treated as saline or alkali for the put-pose of adopting reclamation techniques. Soils that have the ratio of either (2CO(3)(2) + HCO3-)/(C-l-+2SO(4)(2-)) and/or Na+/(Cl-+2SO(4)(2-)) > 1, expressed in mol m(-3), should be treated as natric and require chemical amendments for reclamation. When soils have both these ratios <1, then, irrespective of their pH and SAR, these should be treated as salic. Under such situations, both SAR and ECe decrease simultaneously on leaching. It is suggested that definitions of salic and natric horizons should be amended to include limits of pH and ionic ratios of the soluble salts to solve the problem of saline-alkali soils. The term "episalic" and "epinatric" should be included to highlight surface salinity or sodicity at the subgroup level similar to the term "external" used in FAO classification.

ID RESEARCH PRIORITIES
AB Mental health research has received relatively little philanthropic support in Australia compared with other areas of health research. Philanthropic trusts do not generally provide recurrent funding or make grants for that perceived to be the responsibility of the state or the market. The emergence of 'strategic philanthropy' however, provides potential for mental health researchers to form partnerships with philanthropic foundations, particularly on initiatives that are focused on prevention and innovative and sustainable models with the capacity to 'go to scale' across the service system.

AB Objective:
   The study aimed to explore contemporary collaborative experiences of nurse practitioners (NPs) in providing care with general practitioners (GPs) and allied health care professionals.
   Design:
   A qualitative descriptive, exploratory design was considered the most appropriate to achieve the study objectives. This allowed the researcher at first hand to gain a thorough understanding of the nurse participants' experiences.
   Setting:
   The study was conducted in urban, rural and remote clinics and hospitals throughout New South Wales, Australia, where the NPs were authorised to care for the community.
   Participants:
   Nine authorised NPs were the key participants in the study.
   Results:
   Analysis identified one main theme of Collaboration and three sub themes that were named as Total Collaboration, Partial Collaboration and Non Collaboration.
   Conclusion:
   In this study, most NPs reported dissatisfaction from working in ineffective collaborative relationships with medical and allied health care professionals. Total collaboration did not automatically occur and was identified as the exception. Sustainable collaborative partnerships should be developed with all heath care providers by acknowledging each others unique, valuable contribution. Despite this challenging and complex situation, NSW NPs remained determined to provide advanced nursing care for patients and to establish and maintain effective collaboration with all health care professionals.

AB Major trends that are draining people from the Wheatbelt are globalisation of the economy ( and its associated global urban culture) and coastalisation based on lifestyle preferences. A focus on Wheatbelt towns in partnership with the adjacent global city is needed to reverse the decline. It will require a new quality of life attraction similar to that drawing people to the coast, a stronger sense of place, and greater social diversity. It will also require tapping of new global city sustainability obligations through partnerships between the city and its bioregion on issues of biodiversity, new bioindustries, and new water regimes, and clear planning to contain sprawl in the city and coasts. Hope for rejuvenation can be provided through the example of inner city areas, which suffered similar problems of decline, and reversed them over a 30-year period.

TI The Avon River Basin in 2050: scenario planning in the Western
   Australian Wheatbelt
SO AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH

DE water for a Healthy Country flagship; grainbelt; community planning
AB Scenario planning was used to identify issues and drivers of change that are relevant to community efforts to improve regional prospects in the Western Australian Wheatbelt. The region, some 20 million hectares in area, is under pressure to respond to a variety of environmental ( salinity, erosion, acidification, biodiversity decline), economic ( declining agricultural terms of trade), and social forces ( rural decline, isolation). Regional strategic plans have been increasingly seen as the means of achieving sustainability in the face of these challenges, but until recently typically had single-activity outlook and timeframes of up to a decade into the future. Systematic futures-based research has been used in various regions to avoid reliance on business-as-usual as the default strategy, and to identify opportunities and challenges not presently apparent. The Avon River Basin, the central region of the Wheatbelt, was selected as the geographic focus of the project, and the time horizon was set at 2050. The project was developed by a group of 50 stakeholders from the basin, with expertise and strategic interests across a wide range of economic, social, and environmental themes. Through a series of workshops the stakeholders identified critical issues and their attendant drivers, then documented relevant past trends. Four regional scenarios, Saline Growth, Grain and Drain, Landcare Bounty, and Harmony with Prosperity, were developed based on positive and negative combinations of 2 clusters of uncertain and important drivers: environmental change and access to new markets. Common opportunities, threats, and critical success factors for the Avon River Basin region out to 2050 were also identified. We also found that the stakeholders have a tendency to strive for positive outcomes despite negative initial conditions. This resulted in 4 scenarios that were superficially similar due to the regional scale of analysis and the continuation of agricultural industries as significant shapers of economy, society, and environment. However, each scenario represents profoundly different outcomes for the residents and communities of the Avon River Basin in 2050. The triple-bottom line outcomes for the Avon River Basin in 2050 were estimated to be in the range 4.9 - 9.7 Mt of wheat ( currently 4.0), 46 000 - 66 000 people ( currently 43 000), and 10 - 30% of farmland salinised ( currently 6). The application of these results to other regions in Australia is discussed.

AB Mediterranean environments are characterised by hot, dry summers and cool, wet winters. The native vegetation in Mediterranean-climatic regions is predominantly perennial shrubs and trees intermixed with annual forbs. In south-western Australia, the spread of agriculture has seen the well adapted perennial vegetation replaced by rainfed annual crops and pastures. This has increased waterlogging and secondary salinity, thereby causing loss of productivity in similar to 10% of the cleared land area. To reduce deep drainage and make the agricultural systems environmentally sustainable requires the re-introduction of perennial vegetation in the form of belts of trees or shrubs, and phase-farming systems with perennials such as lucerne replacing annual pastures between the cropping years. To be economically viable, agricultural productivity needs to increase by at least 3% per annum. Yields of dryland wheat, the predominant crop in the Mediterranean agricultural regions of Australia, have increased at similar to 1%/year for the century preceding the 1980s and since then by nearly 4%/year. Increases have arisen from both genotypic and agronomic improvements. Genotypic increases have arisen from selection for earliness, early vigour, deep roots, osmotic adjustment, increased transpiration efficiency, improved disease resistance, and an improved harvest index from high ear weight (grain number) at flowering and high assimilate storage and remobilisation. Agronomic increases have arisen from early sowing that has been enabled by minimum tillage, increased fertiliser use, especially nitrogen, weed control, and rotations to improve weed control, minimise disease risk, and increase nitrogen availability. Evidence is presented suggesting that the rapid increase in yield of wheat in the last two decades has likely arisen from the rapid adoption of new technologies. For productivity to be maintained in the face of the increasing requirement to be environmentally sustainable will be a challenge and will require better integration of breeding and agronomy.

AB Perennial grasses are the key to the economic and environmental sustainability of pastures for livestock grazing in south-eastern Australia. Mortality of perennial grasses can occur during drought periods and there is anecdotal evidence of differences in drought resistance among species, but information on the basic ecophysiological responses of these species to drought is lacking. An experiment was conducted to determine the responses of 7 native and 3 introduced perennial grass species to continuous drought. Leaf survival during severe drought varied among the species nearly 4-fold, from 11 to 40 days, and was considered a measure of their overall drought resistance. All of the species had good dehydration tolerance, so the differences in drought resistance were related more to their dehydration avoidance traits, specifically to the amount of water available to the plant at the point where plant transpiration became minimal. The native species had both the longest and shortest leaf survival periods, with the introduced species ranking intermediate. Species exhibited various morphological traits that contributed to dehydration avoidance during severe drought, including leaf folding or rolling, rapid leaf shedding, and large amounts of cuticular wax. The results are discussed in terms of their implications for perennial grass persistence in south-eastern and in south-western Australia.

AB Policy issues have impacted on cropping since the earliest days of European colonial settlement. Following emigration to Australia, secure land titles were required, with the Torrens title system being progressively introduced from 1858. This provided the basis for landholders to be able to borrow to develop land. Closer settlement policies were adopted, underpinned by the development of transport infrastructure. The demand for education resulted in Agricultural Colleges in the colonies from the 1880s, with Departments of Agriculture soon afterwards. Federation of the colonies into the Commonwealth of Australia and the creation of the states resulted in a separation of powers, with the Commonwealth assuming responsibility for external powers including overseas marketing, import quarantine, health and quality standards of exports and credit and financial powers. Natural resource management matters and education were among those remaining with the states. Regular intergovernmental meetings were held to discuss research from 1927 and a broader range of agricultural issues from 1935. The Great Depression in the 1930s, poor commodity prices and serious land degradation led to government support for debt reconstruction and the introduction of soil conservation services. Realising the need for innovation to successfully compete on world markets, farmers, led by cereal growers, petitioned for the establishment of statutory research programs with joint grower/government funding from the 1950s. These have been remarkably successful, with the uptake of new technologies contributing to an average multifactor productivity growth of Australian grain farms by 3.3% per year between 1977-78 and 2001-02.
   With community and policy recognition of the need to conserve natural resources, the Commonwealth Government is playing an increasing role in this area. Farmers are required to meet standards for the use of agricultural chemicals and for occupational safety, welfare and environmental protection. The states have taken a conservative stand against the growing of genetically modified food crops in the name of protecting overseas markets. New water management regimes are coming into place with the separation of water titles from land. Market-based instruments are being introduced to encourage more sustainable production systems and saleable ecosystem services. Research and innovation along with complementary policy initiatives will continue to underpin farmers' adaptive management skills to ensure dryland crop producers have sustainable production systems while remaining competitive in world markets.

AB An experimental wild harvest of Cycas arnhemica K. D. Hill, an understorey plant in tropical eucalypt savannas, was conducted in central Arnhem Land, Australia. Replicated harvest treatments were monitored over 2 years with tagged individuals. A range of a priori candidate statistical models were compared to determine the effect of wild harvest and environmental factors such as. re frequency and disturbance from feral animals on survival, recruitment and stem growth. The mean density of C. arnhemica was 1630 ha(-1) and ranged from 550 to 2250 ha(-1). Harvesting intensity in the 0.04- ha quadrats varied between 10 and 32% of all cycad stems ( excluding seedlings). There was no clear effect of harvest treatment on stem survival, seedling abundance and stem growth on the remaining C. arnhemica 2 years after the harvest treatments were applied. Survival of woody stems was higher than that of seedlings but there was considerable overlap among the larger size classes. Seedling abundance was generally low and variable across the three sites, and seedlings were entirely absent from quadrats burnt twice during the study period. Stem growth varied considerably across the three sites and was similar between small and large stems. We suggest that the wild harvest of this abundant Cycas species in a remote region of northern Australia will have minimal impact on wild populations if focused on juvenile stems and return time is extended to 15 - 40 years at harvested locations. Future harvest management of this and other Cycas species in northern Australia will benefit from further research on stochastic population models to determine the most suitable harvest strategies, particularly for smaller Cycas populations.

ID TREE GROWTH; SAVANNAS
AB Ironwood, Erythrophleum chlorostachys ( F. Muell.) Baill., is harvested for timber in the Northern Territory. Available data on ironwood growth rates and stand structures were collated to help inform sustainable management. In 32 plots (0.1 ha each) within 300 km(2) of a widespread savanna vegetation type in the Northern Territory, ironwood trees represent similar to 11% of the total basal area of all trees and 12% of all individual trees > 3m high. Nevertheless, the density of potentially harvestable trees with a diameter at breast height > 35 cm is low at 150 km(-2), whereas the density of trees in the preferred size of > 40 cm is only 30 km(-2). The slow growth rate means that the sustainable harvest is only 1.8 trees km(-2) year(-1). This represents a maximum estimate that does not account for the high rate of poorly formed boles and the lower density of ironwood throughout most of its range. Limited data on tree growth rates of isolated seedlings and coppice indicate that trees could reach harvestable sizes in decades instead of centuries if competition with other species is reduced; however, there has been no assessment of the relative wood quality of fast- and slow-growing ironwoods.

ID MANAGEMENT
AB Insecticide resistance monitoring using a Potter precision spray tower with discriminating concentration and log dose probability techniques underpins the Australian insecticide management strategy for Frankliniella occidentalis Pergande. Abamectin, acephate, chlorpyrifos, dichlorvos, dimethoate, endosulfan, fipronil, malathion, methamidophos methidathion, methiocarb, methomyl, pyrazophos and spinosad are recommended for use against F. occidentalis but abamectin, methiocarb and pyrazophos are the only chemicals where insecticide resistance has not been detected. Although not registered, chlorfenapyr was effective against F. occidentalis and should be pursued for that purpose. In contrast, chlorpyrifos, dichlorvos and malathion resistance were detected at low to moderate levels throughout the study period putting their sustainable use for F. occidentalis control in doubt. Although it appears that acephate, dimethoate, endosulfan, fipronil, methamidophos, methidathion and spinosad remain effective, some populations contained a small percentage of thrips that survived exposure to a concentration that killed 100% of the susceptible strain. Subsequent laboratory selection of one such population separately with fipronil and spinosad caused an increase in resistance to these insecticides. These products must now be considered at risk. This is the first report of fipronil or spinosad resistance in populations of F. occidentalis.

TI Persistence of Phalaris aquatica in grazed pastures - 1. Plant and
   tiller population characteristics

AB Phalaris tiller and plant population characteristics were monitored in sown Australian phalaris-subterranean clover pastures over 3 seasons (1999-2001) to determine the impact of fertiliser and grazing method on phalaris persistence in south-western Victoria. Four grazing systems were tested: set-stocked, low phosphorus ( P) fertiliser input ( SS low P); set-stocked, high P fertiliser input ( SS high P); simple rotation, high P (RG 4 paddock); and intensive rotation, high P ( RG intensive). Within each year there was no significant difference in tiller density (tillers/m(2)) between the grazing systems. Phalaris tiller density declined (P<0.05) on all treatments from June 1999 to June 2001. There was a significant effect of grazing method on tiller size (mg/tiller); tillers growing under rotational grazing systems were much larger than those in set-stocked systems. There was some evidence of tiller size density compensation across the grazing management treatments; however, the slope of the trade-off between tiller size and density was not as steep as those reported for other species. In general, the phalaris tiller populations under rotationally grazed treatments were characterised by lower density per m(2) of phalaris clump and larger size, compared with the set-stocked treatments. Both the phalaris tiller and clump density declined at a similar rate on all treatments during this experiment, suggesting that there was some limitation to phalaris persistence irrespective of grazing system. Measured leaf appearance intervals (days/leaf) indicated that a lack of tillering sites was not a contributing factor in the observed tiller density decline. It is likely that the combination of high grazing pressure, below average rainfall and subsoil acidity contributed to the observed phalaris population decline.

AB Declining grassland productivity is a major concern in southern temperate Australia. Continuous grazing is thought to be a primary contributor to this decline, which is associated with the loss of perennial grasses. Landholders are evaluating grazing management strategies that might curb the loss of perennials and increase long-termproductivity. This study reports on a comparison between continuous grazing and time-control grazing with sheep and cattle using a paired-paddock design at 5 locations in south-eastern Australia (lat. 30 - 42 degrees S) over 6 years ( 1994 - 99). Pasture herbage mass, grassland species composition and basal cover of perennial grasses were assessed at 6-monthly intervals. Species abundance data were analysed by ANOVA, ordination (multi-dimensional scaling) and splining procedures to assess comparative trends between the 2 management treatments at each site. Species were categorised into major functional groups for analysis. Over all 5 sites there were few consistent differences between management treatments ( continuous grazing v. time-control grazing). Basal cover was greater on the time-control grazing management compared with continuous grazing for most of the experimental period at 3 sites, but the initial values were also greater, resulting in a non-significant management x time interaction. Based on this study, we conclude that there was no apparent medium-term benefit of a multi-paddock rotational ( time-control grazing) grazing system over continuous grazing for encouraging and maintaining a favourable botanical composition. The benefits for land managers from employing systems such as time-control grazing may accrue through other mechanisms. The study also highlights some of the difficulties with conducting on-farm paired-paddock research.

AB Long-run rotational gross margins were calculated with yields derived from biophysical simulations in a crop simulation model over a period of 100 years and prices simulated in @Risk based on subjective triangular price distributions elicited from the Jimbour Plain farmer group. Rotations included chickpeas, cotton, lucerne, sorghum, wheat and different lengths of fallow. The aim was to assess the profitability of rotations with and without lucerne. Output presented to the farmers included mean annual gross margins and distributions of gross margins with box and whisker plots found to be suitable. Mean-standard deviation and first- and second-degree stochastic dominance efficiency measures were also calculated. The paper outlines a method for combining biophysical and price simulations that can be understood by farmers. Including lucerne in the rotations improved some sustainability indicators but reduced profitability.

AB Natural resource management practices were surveyed on 375 northern Australian beef properties in 8 regions during 1996-97. These producers represented a broad cross section of the beef industry in terms of geographical location, size of enterprise, and herd and ownership structures.
   More than 48% of producers reported land degradation (erosion, salinity, weeds, etc.) and >68% reported woody weeds on their properties. Eucalypt (Eucalyptus and Corymbia spp.) and wattle (Acacia spp.) regrowth were universally common native woody weeds. Parkinsonia (Parkinsonia aculeata) was widespread across all survey regions occurring with the greatest frequency in northern regions. A range of native and exotic woody weed species were regionally significant. Brigalow (Acacia harpophylla) regrowth was mainly reported in the central Queensland and Maranoa South West regions. Prickly acacia (Acacia nilotica) was mainly reported in central and north-west Queensland. Rubber vine (Cryptostegia grandiflora) was mainly reported in northern Queensland with a significant presence in central coastal and north-west Queensland. Infestations with multiple weed species were common. Although many producers reported the presence of problem woody weeds, only 3-29% indicated that weed management was practised.
   Most producers (67-100%) used fire. The intended purpose of fire varied across survey regions but fire was commonly used to reduce rank material, reduce fire risk, control woody weeds and for grazing management. Seasonal conditions and variability restricted fire use.
   Assessment by visual observation was a commonly used practice for determining stocking rate. Between 4-20% of producers were using visual observation combined with some form of calculation of stocking rate at the end of the growing season to determine stocking rate. A majority (>67%) of producers used some form of paddock spelling or regeneration practice. Many producers (47-89%) considered that they used conservative stocking rates. Carrying sufficient stock to meet income requirements was significantly (P < 0.05) correlated with the percentage of producers reporting woody weeds as a problem on their property.
   In the 5 years preceding the survey, >66% of producers had increased the number of stock watering points, and more than 85% of producers had erected fencing. Most fencing was for new paddocks and laneways, or to replace old fences, and was not associated with new stock watering points. However, the installation of new stock watering points was associated with the creation of new paddocks. Planned future fencing focused on creating new paddocks or laneways or replacing old fences.
   The results are discussed in relation to contemporary natural resource management issues and the future approaches to and challenges of implementing sustainable rangeland management.

TI Social and cultural dimensions of commercial kangaroo harvest in South
   Australia
SO AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL AGRICULTURE
LA English
DT Article
AB Kangaroo management is important to the sustainability of Australia's rangeland landscapes. The commercial harvest of kangaroos assists in reduction of total grazing pressure in the rangelands and provides the potential for supplementary income to pastoralists. Indeed, the commercial kangaroo industry is considered by natural resource scientists as one of the few rural industry development options with potential to provide economic return with minimal environmental impact. While the biology and population ecology of harvested kangaroo species in Australia is the subject of past and present research, the social, institutional and economic issues pertinent to the commercial kangaroo industry are not well understood. Our research is addressing the lack of understanding of social issues around kangaroo management, which are emerging as constraints on industry development.
   The non-indigenous stakeholders in kangaroo harvest are landholders, regional management authorities, government conservation and primary production agencies, meat processors, marketers and field processors (shooters) and these industry players generally have little understanding of what issues the commercial harvest of kangaroos presents to Aboriginal people. Consequently, the perspectives and aspirations of Aboriginal people regarding the commercial harvest of kangaroos are not well considered in management, industry development and planning. For Aboriginal people, kangaroos have subsistence, economic and cultural values and while these values and perspectives vary between language groups and individuals, there is potential to address indigenous issues by including Aboriginal people in various aspects of kangaroo management. This research also examines the Aboriginal interface with commercial kangaroo harvest, and by working with Aboriginal people and groups is exploring several options for greater industry involvement. The promotion of better understandings between indigenous and non-indigenous people with interests in kangaroo management could promote industry development through the marketing of kangaroo as not only clean and green, but also as a socially just product.

   ISLANDS; POPULATIONS; DISPERSAL; AUSTRALIA; OKINAWA
AB We examine procedures for declaring an area free of pest fruit flies following an eradication campaign. To date, the acceptable period of trapping zero flies has been calculated without an estimate of the probability of being wrong. The zero trapping periods are usually shorter when declaring local 'area freedom' from an endemic fly, than when claiming eradication of an exotic species. We use a model to calculate the probability of zero trap captures and therefore the probability of trapping further flies. The latter probability is always finite. A zero trapping result does not indicate the absence of flies. There must also be evidence of what constitutes a non-viable density, as indicated by the trapping rate. The non-viable densities of certain pest fruit fly species are known from decades of managing small incursions in fly-free zones. There is no need for implementation of eradication procedures if the trapping rate is sufficiently low, in these areas. For a given density of flies (defined in terms of expected mean catch per trap per week), the probability of zero trap captures reduces with time and the number of traps employed. If the model calculations use a non-sustainable density (inferred from trapping rate) then we may declare the actual density of flies to be less if the trapping result is zero for a given number of weeks with a given number of traps when the model predicts the probability of such a result to be sufficiently low, according to a criterion that is selected at a level suited to the purpose of the declaration.

AB Australia's traditional approach to salinity abatement has been to focus primarily on the control of recharge in land not at risk of salinity by incorporating deep-rooted perennial plants ( e. g. lucerne, oil mallees and farm trees) into farming systems throughout the landscape. However, in the broad valley floors and sedimentary plains of Australia's cropping regions ( the areas most at risk of salinity), recharge is mainly a 1-dimensional process. Thus, offsite recharge management may have little or no impact on salinity outcomes for the areas at risk. The future of the broad valley floors will be most influenced by the management decisions of landholders in the valley floors.
   To be sustainable and profitable, farming systems on valley floors need to (i) target perennial plants to the valley floors and improve soil management to dry the root-zone, decrease recharge and minimise capillary rise, (ii) increase the discharge of groundwater from valley floors using deep drains and stands of perennial plants, (iii) improve surface water management to ameliorate waterlogging, inundation and flooding, and (iv) incorporate better plants and better agronomic methods in the growth of profitable salt tolerant crops and fodder plants.
   This paper will illustrate the convergence of new research and development that offers real prospects of low risk, high return farming systems for Australia's threatened valley floors. We argue that there needs to be a major refocus by farmers, researchers and their funders in the development of profitable sustainable farming systems for valley floors.

DE dryland salinity; landscape futures; perennial pasture adoption
ID RECOMPOSITION
AB Rural areas of Australia are undergoing rapid social and economic transformations, creating a divergence between those rural landscapes that are depopulating and those that are repopulating. In the depopulating landscape of the cropping zones at risk to salinity, the new paradigm of salinity management based on the development of new plant production systems may be the best strategy available. We suspect this strategy will be less suited to the repopulating rural areas, where amenity is a major factor in population growth. In these landscapes, investment in recharge control based upon commercial pasture production or plantation forest industries is unlikely to be socially compatible with the aspirations of future residents. Strategies aimed at low-cost re-establishment of native vegetation may be more appropriate, but will still be limited in their application. Any discussion of the sustainability of plant-based management systems for dryland salinity needs to include not only biological or agronomic persistence, but also social persistence.

TI Grazing studies of a Hyparrhenia hirta (Coolatai grass) pasture in

AB Hyparrhenia hirta ( L.) Stapf (Coolatai grass) has invaded large areas of grazed native grasslands on the North-West Slopes of New South Wales ( NSW) and is widespread along roadsides and travelling stock routes. It is commonly regarded as an invasive, weedy species with low forage value when it is tall and rank, but may be more palatable when kept short, green and leafy.
   A study ( 1990 - 2001) of a naturalised stand of Coolatai grass in the Manilla district of northern NSW examined its herbage mass ( kg DM/ha), persistence ( basal cover %), and grazing value under 2 contrasting grazing treatments: pastures that had either large amounts of dry, unpalatable herbage [ light grazing at 5 dry sheep equivalents (DSE)/ha] or were short, green and leafy ( strategic heavy grazing at a stocking rate of 37 DSE/ha). Effects of pre-grazing treatments ( slashing, burning, and no defoliation) were also examined and data ( litter mass, plant basal area, ground cover, and soil and litter microbial carbon and nitrogen) collected to assess the long term sustainability of these grazing systems.
   Sheep grazed the light grazing treatment for about 34% of the experimental period, with the strategic heavy grazing treatment being grazed for about 7% of the time. Over the experimental period this equated to 6752 DSE grazing days/ha for the light grazing treatment compared with 10120 DSE for the heavy grazing treatment. Herbage mass in the heavy grazing treatment declined to < 1000 kg DM/ha within 6 months of the start of grazing and remained below this level until December 1998 when stocking rates were switched (i.e. plots previously grazed at low stocking rate were subjected to the heavier rate and vice versa). In contrast, mean herbage mass in the light grazing treatment was generally > 3000 kg DM/ha from November 1990 - 98, but a high proportion of this was dead standing material that carried over from season to season. Mean Coolatai grass basal cover was 9.5% in November 1990, increasing over time to about 25% in both grazing treatments by December 2000.
   Coolatai grass herbage accumulation was highly seasonal, ranging from as high as 70 kg DM/ha. day in summer to 0 in winter. In both grazing treatments, forage quality was low for both green and dead material, with mean crude protein being 6.0 ( green) and 3.4% ( dead). Digestible dry matter values ranged from 41 to 62% ( green) and 32 to 51% ( dead) and mean metabolisable energy values were 7 ( green) and 5.3 MJ/kg DM (dead). After 8 years, the heavy grazing treatment had lower (P< 0.05) litter mass, ground cover, plant basal area and soil microbial C and N levels than the light grazing treatment, but switching of the stocking rates restored most indicators, except the soil microbial values.

AB Mulga (Acacia aneura) dominated vegetation originally occupied 11.2 Mha in Queensland, of which 12% has been cleared, mostly for pasture production, but some areas are also used for cereal cropping. Since mulga communities generally occupy fragile soils, mostly Kandosols and Tenosols, in semi-arid environments, clearing of mulga, which continues at a rate of at least 35 000 ha/year in Queensland, has considerable impact on soil organic carbon (C), and may also have implications for the greenhouse gas emissions associated with land use change in Australia. We report here the changes in soil C and labile C pools following mulga clearing to buffel pasture (Cenchrus ciliaris) and cereal (mostly wheat) cropping for 20 years in a study using paired sites.
   Soil organic C in the top 0.05 m of soil declined by 31 % and 35% under buffel pasture and cropping, respectively. Land use change from mulga to buffel and cropping led to declines in soil organic C of 2.4 and 4.7 t/ha, respectively, from the top 0.3 m of soil. Using changes in the delta(13)C values of soil organic C as an approximate representation of C derived from C-3 and C-4 vegetation from mulga and buffel, respectively, up to 31% of soil C was C-4-derived after 20 years of buffel pasture. The turnover rates of mulga-derived soil C ranged from 0.035/year in the 0-0.05 m depth to 0.008/year in the 0.6-1 m depths, with respective turnover times of 29 and 133 years. Soil organic matter quality, as measured by the proportion/amount of labile fraction C (light fraction, <1.6 t/m(3)) declined by 55% throughout the soil profile (0-1 m depth) under both pasture and cropping.
   There is immediate concern for the long-term sustainable use of land where mulga has been cleared for pasture and/or cropping with a continuing decline in soil organic matter quality and, hence, soil fertility and biomass productivity. In addition, the removal of mulga forest over a 20-year period in Queensland for pasture and cropping may have contributed to the atmosphere at least 12 Mt CO2-equivalents.

AB Mulga ( Acacia aneura) woodlands and open forests occupy about 150 Mha in Australia, and originally occupied 11.2 Mha in Queensland. Substantial areas (1.3 Mha) of the mulga vegetation have been cleared in Queensland, mostly for pasture production, but some areas are also used for cereal cropping. Twenty years after mulga clearing we found a significant loss of total soil organic C ( 28 - 35% from the 0 - 0.05 m depth) and light fraction C (> 50% from the 0 - 1 m depth) from soil under pasture and cropping at a site in southern Queensland. We report here the changes in soil N and labile N pools in a paired-site study following conversion of mulga to buffel pasture (Cenchrus ciliaris) and cereal ( mostly wheat) cropping for more than 20 years.
   Conversion from mulga forest to pasture and cultivation resulted in greater losses of soil N than organic C in the top 0.1 m depths. As a result, C/N ratios in soil under both pasture and cropping were higher than soil under mulga, indicating a decline in soil organic matter quality after mulga clearing. Although land-use change had no significant effect on N-15 natural abundance (delta(15)N) values of total soil N down to a depth of 1m, delta(15)N values of wheat tops and roots indicated that the primary source of N under cropping was soil organic N, while that of buffel pasture was a mixed source of soil N and decomposed litter and root N. Light fraction N (< 1.6 Mg/m(3)) declined by 60 - 70% throughout the 1 m soil pro. le under pasture and cropping, but it was N-15-enriched in these 2 land-use systems. The delta(15)N values of mulga phyllodes, twigs, and. ne roots, indicated an input of atmospheric fixed N-2 that was estimated to be about 25 kg N/ha. year. However, the source and magnitude of this N resource needs to be confirmed.
   Soil N losses were estimated to be 12 kg N/ha. year under pasture and 17 kg N/ha. year under cropping over a 20-year period. These findings raise the issue of the long-term sustainable use of cleared mulga areas for pasture and/or cropping. The labile C and N pools and N mineralised also declined, which would have an immediate adverse effect on soil fertility and plant productivity of cleared Mulga Lands, as well as reducing their potential as a soil sink for greenhouse gases.

AB Fire is commonly used to establish and maintain pastures in the Amazon. Fire is also known to induce soil water repellency but few published data exist for the humid tropics. The objectives of this study were to characterise the intensity and spatial variability of water repellency on previously burned pasture soils in the Amazon, and its effect on the nutrient status of the forage grass Brachiaria brizantha (Hochst.) Stapf. Surface soils of pastures and forests in north-western Mato Grosso, Brazil, were found to exhibit soil water repellency using MED and WDPT tests. Soil water repellency was found only within 0 - 0.01 m of the mineral soil surface, with soil below 0.01 m found to be hydrophilic in all cases.
   Spatial variability of repellency was high for both pasture and forest soils. For pasture soils, soil water repellency was strongest on recently burned pastures, which exhibited some extremely high values ( MED > 8M). Repellency decreased rapidly with time following burning. Increasing soil water repellency was associated with decreasing N: P ratios of B. brizantha above-ground biomass (r(2) = 0.66, P= 0.004). These findings indicate that soil water repellency and pasture productivity are inversely related. Since pasture abandonment fuels continued deforestation, disrupting the processes causing pasture degradation may lead to more sustainable land use in the Amazon.

AB Australia is a water-stressed nation and demand on potable water supply is increasing. Consequently water conservation and reuse are increasingly becoming important. Irrigation of recycled wastewater on water repellent soils is a technology that is being trialled as a means of improving crop production and conserving potable supply. However, recycled water contains potentially harmful heavy metals. This paper reports the competitive sorption and desorption of several common heavy metals found in soils collected from a farm located in the southeast of South Australia. The soil from this location is severely water repellent, but some sites were amended with kaolinite clay (Si4Al4O10(OH)(8)) about 7 and 15 years ago. The metals studied were Cu, Pb, Cd, Cr, Ni, and Zn. Competitive sorption of the metals was distinctly observed. For all heavy metals, the quantity of metal sorbed was higher in amended soil, and there was a strong correlation between the specific sorption to total sorption ratio and the amount of clay in the soil. The sorption intensities varied with metal, Cr, Pb, and Cu having a high sorption tendencies and Zn, Cd, and Ni having comparatively low sorption tendencies. The total sorption capacity for all metals increased in clay-treated soils compared with non-treated soils. On average, clay-amended water repellent soils had a 20 - 40% increased capacity to adsorb total metals; however, this increase was largely caused by the increased capacities to adsorb Zn, Cd, and Ni. The effect of clay treatment largely enhanced the sorption capacity of relatively weakly adsorbing heavy metals. The implications for using recycled wastewater on the long-term sustainable agro-environmental management of these soils are discussed.

AB Copper is an important micronutrient and trace amounts are essential for crop growth. However, high concentrations of copper will produce toxic effects. Australia is increasingly developing production of crops in water repellent soils. Clay amendment, a common amelioration techniques used in Australia, has demonstrated agronomic benefits in increased crop or pasture production. The sorption and desorption of copper and the effect of clay treatment on copper behaviour in a water repellent soil collected from an experimental farm in South Australia is studied. We found that the water repellent soils amended with clay have an increased adsorption capacity of copper. Also the clay-amended soils had an increased ratio of specific sorption to total sorption of copper. The implications of this study to the sustainable agro-environmental management of water repellent soils is discussed.

AB With increasing salinity in irrigation areas, the option of tree planting in areas with shallow groundwater is seen as an 'environmentally friendly' alternative for controlling salinity. This study uses simulation modelling to investigate the long-term effects of planting Eucalyptus grandis in irrigated areas with shallow and saline watertables in the Riverine Plains where concerns exist about salinity effects on irrigated agriculture. APSIM, a 1-dimensional model of the soil-water-plant system, was modified to describe the interaction between the watertable within the plantation with the, normally shallower, watertable in the surrounding irrigated pasture. The model was tested against measured data and then used to simulate a range of different environmental conditions (depth and salinity of the groundwater, soil) and management options (irrigation with different amounts and salinity). The results of a total of 702 simulation runs helped to identify conditions in which irrigated plantations may be viable and how the irrigation of these plantations may be managed to decrease the impact of salinity on tree growth. The results indicated that if irrigation is to improve productivity, it must be in large amounts (1000 mm or more) and of good quality to have a significant effect on tree production. Irrigation with low salinity water (EC < 2 dS/m) can only be used to reliably increase production in conditions where there are deeper watertables (4 m or deeper) on fast-draining soils. In these cases, flexible irrigation practices (scheduled irrigation) need to be employed in order to manage the salt levels within the tree root-zones. The viability of plantations is likely to decrease with increasing irrigation water salinity as salt accumulation in the pro. le reduces the ability of the trees to act as natural sinks. Depending on the irrigation and groundwater salinity, trees might be effective only up to a few years (as little as 9 years). Optimum response of trees to irrigation is only predicted with fresh water and scheduled irrigation (up to 1700 mm/year). However, if ample fresh water was available, other higher value cropping options are likely to be sought by land managers. Furthermore, the large amounts of water added to the plantation will have negative effects (water and salt export from the plantation) on the surrounding land, which will need further intervention to be sustainable.

AB New dating techniques are available for soil scientists to test fundamental pedogenic ideas. Recent developments in applications of terrestrial in situ cosmogenic nuclides (TCN) from bedrock and saprolite allow the derivation of soil production rates, at scales ranging from local (sub-hillslope) to catchment wide, generally averaged over timescales of 104-105 years. Where soil depths are relatively constant over time, soil production rates equal transport rates and are thus essential to establishing sustainable erosion rates. TCN also allow the form of the soil production function to be compared to theoretical models - a difficult task previously. Furthermore, parameterised soil production functions can now be incorporated into numerical surface process models to test landscape evolution ideas.
   Bedrock and saprolite conversion to soil is demonstrably dependent on the overlying soil depth, and there is general agreement that weathering declines exponentially beyond maximum soil production, consistent with theory. Whether maximum soil production occurs under a finite or non-existent soil cover at particular sites remains unresolved. We suggest that, in general, soil production from saprolite declines exponentially with increasing depth, while production from bedrock follows a humped function.
   Estimates of the role of. ora, fauna and processes such as freeze - thaw that mix soil mantles to depth, have been limited prior to optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating techniques. Recently derived OSL mixing rates extend the magnitude of previous partial, short-term bioturbation rates. In fact, bioturbation appears to be the most active pedogenic process operating in many soils, with freeze - thaw environments a noted exception. Although bioturbation far outweighs soil production, it does not always lead to homogenisation as is often reported. We maintain that the above-ground component of bioturbation, i.e. mounding, may alone, or particularly when combined with particle sorting via rainwash processes, lead to horizonisation and texture contrast soils in those materials that can be sorted such as mixtures of sand and clay. Together, TCN- and OSL-based estimates of hillslope soil transport and bioturbation, suggest significant rates of downslope soil mantle movement coupled with rapid mixing, contrary to in situ soil development models.

AB Rapid vehicle growth in developing nations makes it necessary for these nations to address the transportation and environmental impacts of on-road mobile sources. To estimate the air quality impact of their fleets, many nations have adopted modified versions of U.S. or European emissions models or factors. In most cases, these models can lead to significant errors in emissions estimates. To address this problem, a new on-road mobile source emissions model, called the international vehicle emissions (IVE) model, designed for use in developing countries has been developed. The IVE model was developed jointly by researchers at the International Sustainable Systems Research Center and the University of California at Riverside. The IVE model uses local vehicle technology distributions, power-based driving factors, vehicle soak distributions, and meteorological factors to tailor the model to the local situation. In addition, an intensive 2-week field study was designed to collect the necessary fleet and activity data to populate the model with critical local information. The IVE model, along with the field study process, has proved highly effective in providing an improved estimate of mobile source emissions in an urban area and allows the effective analysis of local policy options. The studies have served to transfer tools and knowledge on the process of creating and improving mobile source inventories in an efficient manner. The rationale behind the development of the model, the development and application of the field studies, an overview of the results obtained to date, and planned next steps are described in this paper.

AB Human DCs (dendritic cells) express surface CD83 upon activation. Comparing the surface induction of CD83 with the upregulation of CD40, CD80 and CD86 during LPS (lipopolysaccharide)-induced DC maturation showed that CD83 induction occurred more rapidly. Despite the lack of CD83 on immature DCs, it was detected in these cells by Western blotting and flow cytometry. Indirect immunofluorescence revealed CD83 inside immature DCs in perinuclear regions. CD83 was absent on monocytes and macrophages, but it was detected inside these cells and found to be rapidly surface-expressed upon LPS-induced activation. Whereas CD83 expression on activated DCs was sustainable, its expression on monocytes and macrophages was transient. Optimal interleukin-4 co-stimulation during DC generation from monocytes was found to be essential for stable CD83 surface expression. CD83 was detected as 37 and 50 kDa forms in transfected 293T cells. Macrophages and immature DCs expressed the 37 kDa form, whereas mature DCs predominantly expressed the 50 kDa form. In monocytes, CD83 was detected as a 22 kDa detergent-insoluble form. The rapid CD83 surface induction on DCs and macrophages was blocked by brefeldin A, but not by cycloheximide, showing that fresh CD83 synthesis was not essential. Tunicamycin inhibited the expression of the 50 and 37 kDa CD83 forms, and also blocked CD83 surface expression on DCs and macrophages. PNGase F (peptide N-glycosidase F) digestion reduced the 37 and 50 kDa CD83 forms to 28 kDa. In summary, monocytes, macrophages and immature DCs contain preformed intracellular CD83, and its rapid surface expression upon activation is post-translationally regulated in a process involving glycosylation.

AB Adult caddisflies were collected at 12 sites along a 5 km stretch of a forested headwater stream in southeastern Ghana in March and November 1993 and the catches are related to environmental variables. Some 34,000 specimens, belonging to 178 morphospecies in 43 genera and 11 families, were caught with Malaise traps and light traps. Many species demonstrate differences between sampling method, seasonal occurrence, and sex-ratios, with the light trap in the second wet sunny season (November) being most efficient with respect to the diversity of the catches. A Moran index analysis for global structures indicates a major transition in the fauna from the ravine with waterfalls to the forest, and secondly, a gradient through the forest. A Geary index analysis for local structures indicates further faunal turnovers in the lower reaches of the stream. Species-environment relationships were analyzed through correspondence analysis and co-inertia analysis, allowing ordination of both species and the environment into three zones. The first co-inertia axis reveals a transition between the waterfalls in the open ravine (sites 1-3), and the stream through the riverine forest (sites 4-12), while the second co-inertia axis reveals a gradient from the lotic stream in the moist semi-deciduous forest (sites 4-8) to more lentic stretches of the stream in a gradually more depleted forest (sites 9-12). The most important environmental factors related to the species transition are: riparian moss growth (r = 0.94), leaves in the stream substratum (r = 0.91), forest type (r = 0.90), hygropetric surfaces (r = 0.88), bedrock (r = 0.87), lotic [riffle] (r = 0.85) and lentic [pool] (r = 0.85) stretches. The most important environmental factors related to the species gradient are: lotic [riffle] stretches (r = 0.92), gravel (r = 0.88) and leaves (r = 0.85) in the stream substratum, forest type (r = 0.81), and agricultural use (r = 0.76). Three clusters representing three major environmental zones (zone I, II and III) along the stream are identified by projecting the average species positions on the co-inertia plane. By analyzing the Malaise trap samples significant indicator values are found for 29 species in zone 1, 16 species in zone H, and 18 species in zone Ill. By analyzing the light trap samples significant indicator values are found for 17 species in zone 1, 57 species in zone H, and 38 species in zone Ill. The high diversity of caddisflies in the sanctuary might be reflected both in the geological and climatological history of West Africa, as well as in the recognition of three major environmental zones, and the clean water with high diversity of stream microhabitats favorable for Trichoptera larvae. The closed forest seems to play an important role for the Trichoptera community, and the study demonstrates the importance of protecting forested headwater streams in order to maintain a sustainable aquatic biodiversity in tropical Africa.

AB Much emphasis is currently given to the question of how available scientific information should be used to inform and support the development of public policy. The interface between the scientific community and policy-makers poses several challenges. In order to overcome the difficulties due to differences of values, language, and purposes, it is important to formulate workable questions and achievable objectives. Effective and ethical use of scientific evidence is desirable, but the complex social and cultural context where decisions are made in modem society must be taken into consideration. A marked trend in European policy-making in environment and health has taken place in the last two decades: besides specific hazardous agents and exposures, the health implications of broad, upstream determinants such as sectoral policies are attracting growing attention. Consequently, essential tools to support rational decision-making, such as risk assessment, need to be supplemented by tools capable of dealing with the additional complexity and uncertainty. Indications and guidance on how to take forward the agenda for action in environment and health in Europe have been made by the series of Ministerial Conferences on Environment and Health, where the 52 Member States of the Regional Office for Europe of the World Health Organization set the priorities and identify common grounds to improve human health and pursue sustainability.

AB A representative group of 100 common bean (Phoseolus vulgaris L.) landraces from different areas of bean production in Spain and six elite cultivars were evaluated for agronomic and quality traits in three environments. The objective was to assess the potential for dual culinary uses (DCU) of common bean landraces for vegetable and grain products. Most landraces studied had aptitude to be used primarily as dry beans although landraces showed wide variation in some attributes related to seed and pod quality. Principal component analysis permitted ordination of the landraces according to variation in seed and pod traits. Two snap bean groups arose from the analysis, named as Group I and Group 2. Seven bean accessions recognized previously as dry bean types were assigned to Group 1B, within Group 1. They displayed adequate scores for pod traits (pod fibre, pod length) to be used as snap beans. This fact indicates the presence of landraces with DCU potential in particular areas of production in the Northwest of Spain. This finding is relevant for breeding and common bean production since farmers could have two different products from the same crop using traditional cultivars. Potential dispersion of these cultivars to areas where sustainable farming is desired should merit further research effort. From the point of view of breeding, DCU landraces should be useful as a starting point since this germplasm is adapted and possesses valuable characteristics for pod and seed quality.

AB Relative abundance and density estimates of Asian houbara were assessed during the breeding season in two breeding grounds of migrant populations (China and south Kazakhstan) and in one breeding ground of a resident population (Oman), between 1998 and 2002. For the study period, the relative abundance was from 0.004 to 0.06 individual per km driven and density estimates varied from 0.01 to 0.2 houbara per km(2). Relative abundance and density of houbara declined by 63% and 69%, respectively in China, by 60% and 49%, respectively in Kazakhstan and by 50% and 75%, respectively in Oman. Overall, an average of 27-30% annual decline in both relative abundance and density was observed for the three regions. Despite being legally a strictly protected species in China, Kazakhstan and Oman, houbara are heavily hunted and poached on all their migration routes and wintering grounds. The current levels of hunting and poaching are not sustainable and without the immediate agreement and implementation of international conservation measures, the Asian houbara may face extinction in the wild in the foreseeable future.

AB In tropical areas, where crop production is limited by low soil quality, the development of techniques improving soil fertility without damage to the environment is a priority. In French Guiana, we used subsistence fanner plots on poor acidic soils to test the effect of different organic amendments, bitter manioc peel (M), sawdust (Sw) and charcoal (Ch), on soil nutrient content, earthworm abundance and yard-long bean (Vigna unguiculata sesquipedalis) production. The peregrine Pontoscolex corethrurus was the only earthworm species found. Pod production and plant growth were lowest in unamended soil. The application of a mixture of manioc peel and charcoal (M + Ch) improved legume production compared with other organic mixtures. It combined the favourable effects of manioc peel and charcoal. Manioc peel improved soil fertility through its low C:N ratio and its high P content, while charcoal decreased soil acidity and exchangeable Al and increased Ca and Mg availability, thus alleviating the possible toxic effects of Al on plant growth. The M + Ch treatment was favourable to P corethrurus, the juvenile population of which reached a size comparable to that of the nearby uncultivated soil. The application of a mixture of manioc peel and charcoal, by improving crop production and soil fertility and enhancing earthworm activity, could be a potentially efficient organic manure for legume production in tropical areas where manioc is cultivated under slash-and-burn shifting agriculture.

AB There is potential for soil erosion and non-point source pollution during the establishment of short-rotation woody crops (SRWC) in northern climates as a limited amount of cover remains on soils from the time of site preparation until SRWC occupies the site early in the second growing season. To counteract these impacts, green manure crops may be established and turned under early in the growing season. The effects of a green manure crop, white clover (Trifolium repens L.), on growth rates, biomass allocation, and foliar nitrogen concentrations of two willow clones (Salix sachalinensis and S. discolor) were compared in a field experiment to nitrogen fertilizer and control treatments over a period of 4 months. Willows were grown in rooting envelopes and harvested four times during the growing season to assess differences in allometric growth. White clover was found to increase the foliar nitrogen concentration of willow without compromising aboveground biomass. Fertilizer induced a 24% increase in total biomass of willow relative to the control. The rate of biomass allocation aboveground was greater relative to belowground under all treatments, and allometric coefficients were greater than 1.0. The differences in nitrogen uptake patterns and nitrogen use efficiencies of willow corresponded to the differences in biomass and foliar nitrogen concentrations between clones.

ID ENERGY CROP CULTIVATION; COPPICE; SWEDEN
AB The economics of growing short rotation willow coppice as an energy crop are marginal and highly dependent on the support for the conventional crops or enterprises they replace and on the maintenance of high yield levels. Consequently any value which can be added to the crop by giving it a dual function will greatly enhance its economic sustainability. In this context the additional use of short rotation willow coppice as a vegetation filter for wastewater (bioremediation) presents such a value added opportunity. This paper calculates the added value in terms of avoided costs for the chemical and or physical treatment of the wastewater, and the avoided costs for fertilisation of the coppice and yield improvements due to the fertilisation and irrigation effects of the application of the wastewater.
   In the calculated situation, the wastewater is applied to the coppice during the growing season and treatment reverts to the conventional in the dormant season.
   Calculations show that saved costs in the conventional treatment of wastewater are higher (5.8- pound 14.83.5 pound kg N-1) than the saved costs for fertiliser and higher coppice yields (equivalent to 0.7 pound kg N-1). This added value that the bioremediation of wastewater confers on the energy produced from short rotation willow coppice has the potential to alter radically the economic sustainability of the crop even if, as is the likely case, not all of the avoided treatment costs will be passed on to the biomass producer.

AB This paper presents a synthesis of assessment of the energy potential of non-plantation biomass resources in five Asian countries-China, India, Philippines, Sri Lanka and Thailand, and is based on the detailed national-level studies carried out in these countries under the Asian Regional Research Programme in Energy, Environment and Climate (ARRPEEC). The national level studies were undertaken to estimate the energy potential of: (i) primary residues, (ii) secondary and processing residues (iii) animal manure, (iv) municipal solid wastes (MSW), (v) fuelwood released through efficiency improvement and substitution by other fuels. The sustainable potential of non-plantation biomass resources in 2010 in China, India, Philippines, Sri Lanka and Thailand is estimated to be about 8.90, 8.77, 0.97, 0.14 and 0.82 EJ, respectively; the potential is estimated to be about 17, 45, 34, 33, and 14% of the projected total energy consumption in 2010, respectively, in the countries.

AB In India, fuelwood, crop residues and animal manure are the dominant biomass fuels, which are mostly used in the rural areas, at very low efficiencies. Industrial and municipal (urban) residues such as wastewater, municipal solid wastes (MSW), and crop residues such as rice husk and bagasse can also be used for energy generation. In this paper, the potential of energy from crop residues, animal manure, MSW, industrial wastewater and biomass fuels that can be conserved for other applications through efficiency improvement is discussed. The total potential of energy from these sources in 1997 is estimated to be equivalent to 5.14 EJ, which amounts to a little more than a-third of the total fossil fuel use in India. The energy potential in 20 10 is estimated to be about 8.26 EJ. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study assesses the sustainable energy potential from non-plantation biomass resources in the Philippines. Biomass resources considered for energy potential were agricultural residues and animal manure; fuelwood and charcoal that can be potentially released due to efficiency improvements, and substitution by other fuels; municipal solid wastes; and black liquor. The results show that by year 2010, the largest portion of the country's total energy potential will come from agricultural residues amounting to 431 Petajoules (PJ) or 44% of the total potential, followed by substitution, 253 PJ or 26% and then from efficiency improvement at 232 PJ or 24%. With 1990 as base year, the total energy potential is expected to be 28% higher in 2000 at 727 PJ, 45% higher in 2005 at 824 PJ, and 71% higher in 20 10 at 969 PJ. (c) 2005 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB This paper discusses the importance of biomass as a source of energy in Sri Lanka and assesses the sustainable national non-plantation biomass resource potential. Different biomass sources, both direct and indirect, are considered in the analysis. The direct sources include agricultural and wood residues, animal manure, municipal solid waste and wastewater. The indirect sources include fuelwood conservation through efficiency improvements and fuelwood savings through fuel switching. The potential of each source is estimated for the base year 1997 as well as for the years 2005 and 2010. The total energy potential of these sources in 1997, 2005 and 2010 is 120 PJ, 133 PJ and 142 PJ, respectively. The corresponding electricity generation potentials are 8.34, 9.24 and 9.85 TWh, respectively for a conversion efficiency of 25%. The annual electricity demand in Sri Lanka 1997 was 4.20 TWh and the forecast values for the years 2005 and 2010 are 10.50 and 15.60 TWh respectively; this implies that the biomass sources could contribute significantly towards meeting the future electricity requirement.

   transportation system; energy-conversion technology
AB The feasibility of the utilization of woody biomass as energy resources in Japan is discussed based on its amount, availability, and energy-conversion technologies. The amount is currently estimated to be 31.7 Tg y(-1) on a dry-weight basis, corresponding to 2.8% of the national primary energy supply. An analysis of the current systems for the-harvest and transport of logging residues showed that improvements are needed for them to be sustainable/economic. The prospects for woody bioenergy utilization around the year 2010 and 2050 are also, discussed based on the present state-of-the-art energy-conversion technologies. Around the year 2010, both the "on-site" utilization and the "regional" utilization are expected to be feasible as a small-scale. and decentralized system.. On the other hand, the co-firing of woody biomass with coal at an existing coal-fired power plant is expected as a large-scale and centralized system. Around the year 2050, the "regional" utilization is expected to be the main energy utilization I for a small-scale and decentralized system. Biomass plantations in foreign countries will be needed for a large-scale and centralized system in Japan. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

   solutions; developing countries; cost-efficiency
AB This paper explores the potential of the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) of the Kyoto Protocol to promote modern bioenergy options in developing countries. The starting point is that developing countries need to be given a major role in the implementation of the Convention on Climate Change because of their increasing energy demands and the pressing need to mitigate climate change. The role of CDM is discussed in the context of sustainable development. formation of carbon markets, and promotion of bioenergy options. Besides contributing to mitigate climate change, CDM can be used to demonstrate and disseminate new technologies. reduce investment risks and enhance the cost-efficiency of projects, while also creating jobs and improving environmental conditions. In this context. bioenergy projects are attractive and CDM provides a complementary bridge for international cooperation towards sustainable development. However, since CDM is project-based, a broader policy framework is needed to integrate such projects in regional and global bioenergy systems solutions. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

DE biomass resource base; demand and supply analysis; woodfuels; residues
AB One of the many activities undertaken by the FAO-Regional Wood Energy Development Program has been to shed more light on the wood and, other biomass energy situation in its 16 member countries in Asia. Analyzing the demand for and supply of biomass energy is important if these sources of energy are to be used on a sustainable basis. One of the conclusions drawn, based on the results of these efforts, was that biomass played an important role as a source of energy in the region and this would remain so in the near future. In fact. although the importance of biomass was declining in relative terms, in absolute terms its use appears to be increasing.
   Another conclusion drawn is that reliable information on the demand for biomass energy is hard to come by and in some cases is non-existent. Much of the available data is aggregated with few time-series available: many uncertainties exist with regard to definitions used while many organizations active in the biomass energy field make use of each-others data. With regard to the biomass energy supply situation the picture is even more fuzzy-very little if any information. other than generalizations, is available on the source of the biomass used as a source of energy. In order to be able to determine the sustainability of biomass energy demand and supply, a resource base analysis was carried out. While this analysis showed that in most of the member countries the potential supply will be sufficient to sustain the demand for some time to come, for some countries the situation in the near future is expected to change to a potential deficit. However, much depends-on the underlying assumptions that were made and a more detailed analysis is needed, using demand and supply more attuned to the real situation on the ground.

AB The use of biomass derived from fast-growing trees grown on agricultural land is common practice in parts of Sweden, but not in most other European countries. In the first part of this paper the different conditions for economic use of fast growing trees are analysed in Germany and Sweden. Neither the legal framework nor the natural growing conditions are likely to limit the utilisation of the biomass potential in Germany. Rather, lack of a market for biomass products, poor awareness and little infrastructure for the management of woody biomass plantations are limitations in Germany. The second part offers a possible solution for supporting the market and reducing transaction costs during establishment of the market under German conditions. The proposed solution involves the establishment of 'ecological structures' based on fast-growing trees as a means to compensate for sealed land by roads and buildings. The proposed concept would not only extend the economic potential for producing energy from biomass, but also allow farmers to generate income. The concept can serve both economic and ecological goals. It can reduce municipal budget funding and support the agricultural industry in European countries which need to implement sustainable biomass concepts. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A 10-year US Department of Energy-sponsored research program designed to evaluate and develop switchgrass (Panicum virgatum), a native perennial warm-season grass, as a dedicated energy crop is reviewed. The programmatic objectives were to identify the best varieties and management practices to optimize productivity, while developing an understanding of the basis for long-term improvement of switchgrass through breeding and sustainable production in conventional agroecosysterns. This research has reduced the projected production cost of switchgrass by about 25% ($8-9 Mg-1) through yield increases of about 50% achieved through selection of the best regionally adapted varieties; through optimizing cutting frequency and timing; and by reducing the level (by about 40%) and timing of nitrogen fertilization. Breeding research has made further gains in productivity of switchgrass that exceed the historical rate of yield improvement of corn. Studies of soil carbon storage under switchgrass indicate significant carbon sequestration will occur in soils that will improve soil productivity and nutrient cycling and can substantially augment greenhouse gas reductions associated with substituting renewable energy for fossil energy. Collaborative research with industry has included fuel production and handling in power production, herbicide testing and licensing, release of new cultivars, and genetic modifications for chemical coproduct enhancement. Economically based life cycle analyses based on this research suggest that switchgrass produced for energy will compete favorably both as an agricultural crop and as fuel for industry.

AB This paper focuses on the benefits of an efficient use of animal waste from the standpoint of curbing the rise of anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere. An effective use of animal waste resources might provide a partial, but still important, contribution in reducing net CO2 emissions. In particular: the fulfilment of nutrient requirements of crop plants growing in non-limiting conditions and thus sequestering CO2 at their potential level; the chance of diminishing the use of fossil energy, and related CO2 emissions, required for manufacturing industrial fertilizers; the possibility of enhancing carbon sequestration in agricultural soils by the application of farmyard manure. The future success of agriculture in providing these ecosystem services can only be achieved with a changed social awareness of the links between sustainable land use and global environmental change.

AB According to the interpretation of the processes of change ill the Spanish tourism market in recent years, there is currently a more or less generalised perception that the Spanish tourism model is in a crisis and that its model is exhausted.
   The Plans for Tourism Promotion and Excellence (PTPE) are new tourism resources planning and management instruments sponsored by the Ministry of the Economy which are based on the principle of the 1990's through which attempts have were made to improve the quality of mature tourist destinations and stimulate emerging destinations. PTPEs are new models of intervention that assume the principles of institutional cooperation and subsidiarity in the search for solutions committed to sustainable development.
   Although interesting experiences do exist, in practice these theoretical approaches have been adulterated in some cases as a result of the aptitude of the administrations and groups involved, the scant correspondence between the objectives proposed and the initiatives developed, the final nature of investments and the inexistence of a global vision that allows environmental, social and economic aspects to be integrated.

AB Programme 21 is a document adopted in the 1992 Rio Summit which is committed to promoting sustainable development. It aims to identify a socially equitable, lasting, alternative model of development which respects the environment through the use of the concept of sustainability.
   In accordance with the spirit of the Rio Summit, Agenda 21 (A21) is defined as an action plan based on a new model of cooperation between public administrations and economic and social agents through which intervention strategies at the local level are designed after each city or municipality's problems have been identified (environmental auditing). The need to intervene in the environmental, economic and social spheres makes A21 a strategic plan.
   This paper analyses the implementation and development process of A21 in Spain, one of the European countries with the greatest number of initiatives of this kind, although it is true that there are important differences at the regional level. It considers case studies in Andalusia, Catalonia, the Balearic Islands and the Basque Country in depth on the basis of available information.

AB The investigation of bathymetric distribution of five snappers caught along the Brazilian Northeastern coast by artisanal fleets through the analysis of the catch composition and relative abundance (CPUE) showed that, on the overall, fished mean size increased along depth and that particular species dominated the catch according to the depth strata. Mutton snapper, L. analis, yellowtail snapper, L. chrysurus, and dog snapper, L. jocu were mainly caught at intermediate depth (20-80m) whereas lane snapper, L. synagris, and silk snapper, L. vivanus, inhabit respectively shallow (< 20m) and deep (> 80 m) waters. Each fleet category exploited preferentially a particular combination of species and their size range. The fleet dynamic of the Northeast Brazil is technologically heterogeneous and determines the catch composition. Geographical distribution of the fishery and technical interaction between fleets and gears should be considered by the management of these species in order to maintain the sustainability of the stock and to guarantee the continuance of the resource.

AB In Australia, cost-benefit analysis (CBA) is one of the conventional tools used widely by the public and the private sectors in the appraisal of projects. It measures and compares the total costs and benefits of projects that are competing for scarce resources in monetary terms. Growing concerns that the values of environmental goods and services are often ignored or underestimated in the CBA approach have led to the overuse and depletion of environmental assets. A model of a sustainability index as an evaluation tool that combines economic. social and environmental criteria into an indexing algorithm is presented and described. The sustainability index uses monetary and non-monetary approaches to rank projects and facilities on their contribution to sustainability. This process enables the principle of trade-off to occur in the decision-making process and thereby allows environmental values to be considered when selecting a development option. This makes it possible to optimize financial return. maximize resource consumption and minimize detrimental effects to the natural and man-made world. A case study is used to demonstrate the model.

ID CONSERVATION
AB Vast quantities of energy are consumed in heating and cooling to provide what are now regarded as acceptable standards of thermal comfort. In the UK as in a number of other countries, there is a real danger that responses in anticipation of global warming and climate change - including growing reliance on air-conditioning - will increase energy demand and CO2 emissions even further. This is an appropriate moment to reflect on the history and future of comfort, both as an idea and as a material reality. Based on interviews and discussions with UK policy makers and building practitioners involved in specifying and constructing what will become the indoor environments of the future, four possible scenarios are identified each with different implications for energy and resource consumption. By actively promoting debate about the indoor environment and associated ways of life, it may yet be possible to avoid becoming locked into social and technical trajectories that are ultimately unsustainable. The aim of this paper is to inspire and initiate just such a discussion through demonstrating that comfort is a highly negotiable socio-cultural construct.

ID BEQUEST
AB The European Union has made the development of a vibrant knowledge-based economy a key policy objective. and increasingly national and local governments worldwide are seeking to harness information and communication technologies to provide government services more effectively and for the benefit of their citizenry. The paper reports on the first phase of the ongoing European Union IntelCities integrated project that seeks to integrate electronic governance of cities and urban planning. The background to the project in terms of the e-Europe Action Plan is explored and the outcome of surveys of user needs and requirements carried out in the cities of Marseilles (France), Siena and Rome (Italy), Helsinki (Finland), Leicester and Manchester (UK), and Dresden and Bertin (Germany) are explained. The outcomes identify a range of implications for digital or electronic planning in terms of increasing the efficiency in e-urban planning and the need to develop digital methodologies for widening public participation. Thus. the importance of e-skills development in new forms of e-planning for planners, developers and citizens is highlighted and shown to be important for achieving a wider e-enabled sustainable knowledge society.

AB Since a long time, the European eel, (Anguilla anguilla, L.), is appeared as a common species and a major fish component in littoral (lagoons, estuaries and coastal marshes) and continental waters (catchments areas, ponds). The significative diminution of its continental abundance has been revealed by many scientific studies. This consciousness is appearing too either among the technical teams working within the different catchments either among the privileged witnesses that are fishermen. It comes to management actions performed at various spatial scales. This report places the context of the Eel Report Card of the Loire catchment, defined in 2000 under the shield of the COMMITTEE of MANAGEMENT MIGRATORY FISH of the Basin of Loire, Vendeans Coasters and Sevre Niortaise. It has been taking place in April 2002. Its objective in fine is to contribute to a management and a sustainable development of the species and habitats. This Eel Report Card organizes a regular and objective acquisition of data characterizing the evolution of the stock in place and of the available habitats. This project brings indicators permitting to fix alarm levels and to value impacts of various measures of management. To lead to well the Eel report Card, it is necessary to end at two indicators of state (quantitative and qualitative): (1) of the eels population to each phase of his biological cycle; (2) of the habitat accessibility for the species within the Loire catchment area. The concept, the working and applications of this Eel Report card are presented in this paper.

AB The European network CRAYNET "European crayfish as keystone species-linking science, management and economics with sustainable environmental quality" emphasises knowledge-based management strategies. The CRAYNET meetings concentrate on certain topics: monitoring in conservation and management of natives; interaction between natives and aliens; control of aliens; habitat restoration; reintroduction and restocking; legislation; education. The Irish meeting (Kilkenny, 2003) "The endangered native crayfish Austropotamobius pallipes: bioindicator and heritage species" initiated debates about (1) what is a bioindicator, a flagship species or a heritage species?; (2) the problem of species complexes and the need to clarify and resolve taxonomy before management; and (3) what is meant by biodiversity in the context of European crayfish? The Norwegian meeting (Halden, 2003) "European native, crayfish with a special focus on Astacus astacus: linking socioeconomics and conservation " involved roundtables about (1) threats to indigenous population of crayfish at a landscape level; (2) exploitation, conservation, legislation; (3) reintroduction of indigenous crayfish, habitat restoration and monitoring; and (4) the urgent need for joint research about pathology. The present meeting (Innsbruck, 2004) "European native crayfish in relation to land-use and habitat deterioration with a special focus on Austropotamobius torrentim" aims to identify the species protection programs, to examine if legislation is working well in protecting vulnerable species, the state of advances about conservation genetics and how to make progress in education of the public. A permanent connection between the 12 core members provides opportunities to check the needed lines of research, to prepare recommendations, and to gather information for an atlas on the distribution of crayfish species in Europe as well as to prepare leaflets for the public.

AB One of the goals of the European network CRAYNET - entitled "European crayfish as keystone species-linking science, management and economics with sustainable environmental quality" - is to identify current crayfish protection programmes carried out in individual countries. During this roundtable held at the CRAYNET meeting in Innsbruck 2004, we tried to evaluate the projects that aimed directly at crayfish conservation or at habitat improvement in order to protect crayfish environments. Different approaches and new skills were discussed in order to increase understanding of the advances and positive results obtained on the management of native populations (species status, habitat, population, control of aliens, diseases etc.).

AB The pathogenicity of Diplostomum cercariae shed from two different snail species (Lymnaea. stagnalis and Radix auricularia) to rainbow trout fry (5-6 cm body length) was investigated. Thus, 1000 cercariae per fish elicited 100% mortality within 24 h. Cercariae shed from L. stagnalis (Diplostomum pseudospathaceum) elicited higher mortality in rainbow trout compared to cercariae (Diplostomum paracaudum) from R. auricularia. Furthermore, cercariae from R. auricularia were more successful in terms of migrating and establishing as metacercariae in the lenses of rainbow trout. Alternative measures to prevent diplostomosis in fish farms were subsequently studied. Diplostomum cercariae could be eliminated by mechanical filtration methods. Filters with 32 micrometer mesh size eliminated 99% while 160 and 200 micrometer meshes removed approximately 50% of the cercariae. Treatment of water with sodium percarbonate (20 mg/L or higher) killed all infective larvae. Therefore, filtration and sodium percarbonate treatment of fishpond water are suggested as sustainable methods for control of eye-fluke populations in fish farms.

AB The deep water rose shrimp, Parapenaeus longirostris (Lucas, 1846), is one of the main target species of the Italian and Mediterranean demersal fisheries. In the Southern Tyrrhenian Sea, it represents one of the most valuable species for fishery markets. The exploitation pattern for this shrimp in the Southern Tyrrhenian area, however, has not been defined within a management plan; for example, according to the administrative autonomy of Sicily concerning fisheries regulations, fishermen have been allowed to mount a very fine diamond mesh size in the cod-end (31-36 mm stretched) in the past. Nowadays, Sicily is going to conform to the European Union legislation requirement of a minimum stretched mesh, size of 40 mm in the cod-end of the trawl net, but no study has been performed to assess the selectivity performance of the rose shrimp fishery in the investigated area. The aim of this paper is to contribute to the exploitation control of this important resource, by analysing the used trawl gear cod-end selectivity, an important tool for the management of the commercial demersal resources. A selectivity experiment, using the "covered cod-end technique", was carried out in the Southern Tyrrhenian Sea. Fifty-four hauls were carried out between 10 and 800 m of depth from a commercial vessel equipped with the "Italian Tartana" commonly used for both commercial fishery and experimental survey in this Mediterranean area. 36 and 20 mm diamond (stretched) mesh size were mounted in the cod-end and a cover respectively. On the basis of shrimp carapace length structure, observed both in cod-end and cover, a logistic model was used in order to estimate the retention length at 50%, the selection factor and the selection range. The selection process showed to be highly affected by the bottom location. in the shelf and in the slope. In any case, present selection performance seems to be inadequate for a sustainable and efficient exploitation of the resources. However, The selection parameters obtained were comparable to those found in other Mediterranean and Atlantic areas.

ID PLACE
AB There has been a dramatic shift in the capacity of indigenous and peasant movements to challenge prevailing hyperliberal models of development and present alternatives that foster ethnocultural diversity and social justice. Following a review of Latin America's agrarian question and of alternative perspectives on sustainable development, this paper advances the concept of sustainable rural communities as an appropriate contemporary paradigm for addressing development issues. Evidence from Bolivia suggests that those rural social movements that avail themselves of changes to the political opportunity structure, including constitutional reform and decentralization, may be successful in developing genuine political capacity that could improve the prospects for sustainable rural communities.

AB Arising out of a critique of needs-based approaches to development, asset-based community development (ABCD) offers a set of principles and practices to mobilize and sustain community economic development. This paper draws attention to the connections between these principles and practices and current interest in sustainable livelihoods as a conceptual framework, the concept of social capital, the social psychology of mobilization, the enhancement of capacity and agency to engage as citizens with the entitlements of citizenship, the role of multiple stakeholders, and the issue of control over the development process. Finally, the paper points to the challenges for NGOs employing an asset-based, community-driven approach given the needs-based, problem -solving paradigm in which they operate.

AB Aboriginal people all over the world have managed their resources within their own homelands since time immemorial. By applying traditional knowledge and resource management, Aboriginal people have ensured their cultural and environmental sustainability and survival as distinct peoples into the modern age. Today the traditional systems of Aboriginal people are under extreme pressure, and great effort is required to promote those traditions and their value for sustaining Aboriginal people within their homelands. This paper identifies impacts on the traditional resources and lands of the Dene people of Northern Saskatchewan. Issues arising are addressed through the use of afield research-based case study of the impacts of uranium mining on the Dene of the Athabasca basin. The paper will attempt to address the concept of traditional indigenous knowledge and its role in Dene society in the modern world.

AB Following the failure of numerous projects that had as a basis an induced modernization foundation, today's development projects (hopefully sustainable ones) are conceived as the bearers of interaction between local groups and external agents. This article compares two long-term development interventions aimed at the Nahuas and Populacas peoples of Eastern Mexico. The author proposes a distinction between three kinds of intervention with an emphasis on positions of power of external agents on one hand, and local actors on the other. This position of power can change during the development process. Analysis of these two projects shows the need to understand local cultures with enough precision so as to select actions that will align themselves with a culture's basic values and establish a dynamic relationship with a culturalized nature and facilitate a group's transformation within a globalized economic context.

AB CIDA policy papers design an extensive agenda for international cooperation projects in the field of urban environmental management. In real projects funded by the agency, this agenda is poorly implemented. The agenda copes relatively well with issues relevant to sustainable development (environment and economy) and to urban development. This is not the case with issues relevant to social development, good governance, and globalization of environmental service and infrastructure markets. The agency's agenda looks more suited to African contexts than to Asian ones.

DT Article
AB The concept of "environment" usually refers to the external nature of the human world. Nevertheless, the academic discourse on the modern environmental crisis considers and tends to treat human society as part of the environment. In this context, the concept of sustainable development (SD) includes the social, economic, and ecological. This article analyses the social dimension of sustainable development in its evolution as a concept. The paper concludes that the main approaches in this field subordinate the social to the ecological. The implications of this are analysed and assessed.

LA English
DT Article
AB While the present-day state in Chile operates far beyond the narrowest constraints of the '' neoliberal '' state as strictly defined, it is nonetheless fatally confined by the ideological limits imposed through the neoliberal vision of the state. Hence, Chile lacks a national development strategy and is now forced to operate within the parameters of a quasi-stagnationist structure, temporarily buoyed by 19(th)-century-style commodities booms. In a process that evokes Anibal Pinto's classic dissection of Chile's lost opportunities in the 19(th) century, Chile has once again failed to forge a sustainable '' export-investment nexus '' sufficient enough to shift away from reliance upon resource-based rentier activities.

TI Forest dependence and community well-being in rural Canada: variation by
   forest sector and region
SO CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH-REVUE CANADIENNE DE RECHERCHE
   FORESTIERE
LA English
DT Article
ID POVERTY; SUSTAINABILITY; AREAS
AB The forest products sector is a major employer in much of rural Canada, and it is often assumed by policy makers that increased timber harvest is a viable means of rural economic development. Despite burgeoning research in the United States, relatively little attention has focused on the relationship between forest dependence and well-being in rural Canada. Especially lacking are macrocomparisons of regions and of forest sectors. This note presents an overview of the relationship between forest dependence and well-being in Canada. Analysis of 1996 Statistics Canada data revealed a great deal of variation in the effect of forest dependence on indicators of well-being (e.g., human capital, unemployment, income): some sectors had fairly positive outcomes (e.g., pulp and paper); others had more negative outcomes (e.g., logging). These relationships, however, vary a great deal by region, suggesting the need for more midrange explanatory models that incorporate the particulars of place and sector.

AB Plants require adequate P from the very early stages of growth for optimum crop production. Phosphorus supply to the crop is affected by soil P, P fertilizer management and by soil and environmental conditions influencing P phytoavailability and root growth. Phosphorus uptake in many crops is improved by associations with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. Cropping system and long-term input of P through fertilizers and manures can influence the amount and phytoavailability of P in the system and the development of mycorrhizal associations. Optimum yield potential requires an adequate P supply to the crop from the soil or from P additions. Where early-season P supply is low, P fertilization may improve P nutrition and crop yield potential. Alternately, under low-P conditions, encouragement of arbuscular mycorrhizal associations may enhance P uptake by crops early in the growing season, improving crop yield potential and replacing starter fertilizer P applications. Soil P supply that exceeds P requirements of the crop may preclude mycorrhizal development. To encourage arbuscular mycorrhizal association, threshold levels of soil solution P that restrict mycorrhizal development must not be exceeded. Sustainable P management practices must be applied both in conventional and in alternative biologically based agricultural systems.

AB Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi colonize the roots of the majority of crop plants, forming a symbiosis that potentially enhances nutrient uptake, pest resistance, water relations, and soil aggregation. Inoculation with effective isolates of AM fungi is one way of ensuring the potential benefits of the symbiosis for plant production. Although inocula are available commercially, on-farm production of AM fungus inoculum would save farmers the associated processing and shipping costs. In addition, farmers could produce locally adapted isolates and generate a taxonomically diverse inoculum. On-farm inoculum production methods entail increasing inoculated isolates or indigenous AM fungi in fumigated or unfumigated field soil, respectively, or transplanting pre-colonized host plants into compost-based substrates. Subsequent delivery of the inoculum with seed to the planting hole in the field presents technological barriers that make these methods more viable in labor-intensive small farms. However, a readily available method for utilization of these inocula is mixing them into potting media for growth of vegetable seedlings for transplant to the field. Direct application of these inocula to the field and transplant of seedlings precolonized by these inocula have resulted in enhanced crop growth and yield.

AB Market globalization, demographic pressure, and environmental degradation have led us to reconsider many of our current agricultural systems. The heavy use of chemical inputs, including fertilizers and pesticides, has resulted in pollution, decreased biodiversity in intensively-farmed regions, degradation of fragile agro-ecosystems, and prohibitive costs for many farmers. Low input sustainable cropping systems should replace conventional agriculture, but this requires a more comprehensive understanding of the biological interactions within agro-ecosystems. Mycorrhizal fungi appear to be the most important telluric organisms to consider. Mycorrhizae, which result from a symbiosis between these fungi and plant roots, are directly involved in plant mineral nutrition, the control of plant pathogens, and drought tolerance. Most horticultural and crop plants are symbiotic with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. Mycorrhizal literature is abundant, showing that stimulation of plant growth can be mainly attributed to improved phosphorous nutrition. Although the mycorrhizal potential of its symbiosis to improve crop production is widely recognized, it is not implemented in agricultural systems. There is an urgent need to improve and widely apply analytical methods to evaluate characteristics such as, relative field mycorrhizal dependency, soil mycorrhizal infectivity, and mycorrhizal receptivity of soil. Decreased use of fertilizers, pesticides, and tillage will favour arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. However, shifting from one system to a more sustainable one is not easy since all components of the cropping system are closely linked. Different cases, from actual agricultural practices in different countries, are analyzed to highlight situations in which mycorrhizae might or might not play a role in developing more sustainable agriculture.

AB Assessment of the long-term impact of fertilizers and other management factors on crop production and environmental sustainability of cropping systems in the semi-arid Canadian prairies is needed. This paper discusses the long-term influence of N and P fertilizers on crop production, N uptake and water use of hard red spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), and the effect of the preceding crop type [flax (Linum usitatissimum L.) and fall rye (Secale cereale L.)] on wheat grown on a medium-textured, Orthic Brown Chernozem at Swift Current, Saskatchewan. We analysed 36 yr of results (1967-2002) from eight crop rotation-fertility treatments: viz., fallow-wheat receiving N and P (F-W, N + P), three F-W-W treatments fertilized with (i) N + P, (ii) P only, and (iii) N only; two other 3-yr mixed rotations with N + P (i) F-flax-W (F-Flx-W) and (ii) F-fall rye-W (F-Rye-W); and two continuous wheat rotations (Cont W), one receiving N + P and the other only P. Growing season weather conditions during the 36-yr period were near the long-term mean, but the first 22 yr were generally drier than normal while the last 14 yr (1989-2002) had average to above-average growing conditions. This was partly responsible for grain and N yield being greater in the latter period than in the first 22 yr. The 36-yr average response of wheat grown on fallow to P fertilizer was 339 kg ha(-1), while the response to N fertilizer over this period was only 123 kg ha(-1). The 36-yr average response of wheat grown on stubble to N was 344 kg ha(-1) for F-W-(W) and 393 kg ha(-1) for Cont W. Neither flax nor fall rye influenced the yield response of the following wheat crops. Annualized grain production for F-W (N + P), F-W-W (+ N) and F-W-W (+ P) rotations were similar (1130 kg ha(-1) yr(-1)); this was about 15% lower than for F-W-W (N + P), 40% lower than for Cont W (N + P), and 5% lower than for Cont W (+ P). Annualized aboveground N yield for Cont W (N + P) was 57% higher than for Cont W (+ P). Regressions were developed relating straw to grain yields for wheat, flax and fall rye. The amount of NO3-N left in the soil was directly related to amount of N applied and inversely to N removed in the crop. Thus, F-(W)-W (+ N) left about 28% more NO3-N in the rooting zone than F-(W)-W (N + P), while F-W-(W) (N + P) left 20% more than F-W-(W) (+ P), and Cont W (N + P) left 39% more than Cont W (+ P). F-Rye-W (N + P) left much less NO3-N in the soil than any other fallow-containing system and similar amounts to Cont W (N + P).

AB Background: Driven by accelerating transformation of land use in the Amazon, studies addressing the impacts of deforestation and mercury (Hg) leaching on the geophysical, biological, social, health, economic and political systems of Amazonian countries are crucial to evaluate the population health risks of these rapid changes.
   Methods: We used an ecosystem approach, integrating Hg measurements with socio-cultural and politico-economic elements, to provide an integral analysis and comprehensive solutions.
   Results: Our interdisciplinary research in the Ecuadorian Andean Amazon has shown that comestible fish and riparian communities which rely on fish as a major protein source have mercury levels that could potentially cause subtle but deleterious population health alterations. A parallel study identified deforestation and soil erosion as a significant source of mercury to the aquatic ecosystem.
   Interpretation: The analysis of these results in conjunction with the prevailing socio-cultural and politico-economic context allowed us to identify economic trends, and especially petroleum exploitation, as pivotal in the deforestation/mercury-exposure dynamic. In collaboration with public health authorities, we shared our results with local health stakeholders, including public health care staff, federal government agencies, researchers and local communities, in such a way as to promote sustainable land use practices and the nutritional benefits of fish eating while reducing toxic exposures.

AB Soil organic carbon (SOC) storage is an indicator of environmental quality for mineral soils because of the influence that organic matter has on key functional properties, such as fertility, soil structure and water relations. Historically, agricultural management has caused large losses of SOC relative to native ecosystems, leading to degradation. However, new technologies and conservation practices have been developed during the past few decades that can enhance SOC storage, and thus improve environmental quality. Our objective was to describe a national inventory procedure to estimate SOC storage for purposes of monitoring environmental quality. The major steps in this procedure include: (1) model selection/development, (2) model verification, (3) identification of model input data, (4) uncertainty assessment, (5) model implementation, and (6) validation of results. Applying this approach With a simple C accounting method, the upper 30 cm of US agricultural soils were estimated to have accumulated 10.8 Tg C yr(-1) between 1982 and 1997, with an uncertainty of +/- 40%. A simple index was developed to relate estimated SOC stocks to the potential amounts under native conditions and conventional agricultural management. An index value of 0% on the proposed scale would be equivalent to the SOC under conventional agricultural use, while an index value of 100% would be equivalent to native levels. With an estimated 1997 stock of 22400 Tg C, the index value for US agricultural soils was about 60%. Using this inventory procedure, environmental issues related to soil, water and air quality could be informed by SOC in combination with other key indicators, in addition to using the inventory for evaluating sustainability of agricultural lands for food and fiber production.

AB The potential for sustainable agricultural practices to sequester C is substantial. The economic feasibility and competitiveness of soil C sequestration depends on the opportunity cost per tonne of C stored. The key issue is whether the cost is competitive with alternative methods of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The high spatial variability in land productivity means that the soil characteristics are important when designing public policies to address this issue. Empirical evidence suggests that the opportunity cost per tonne of C stored can be as low as US$10 to US$25 t(-1) (Can$12-30), but that for the majority of temperate agriculture it exceeds US$50 t(-1) (Can$60). The final monetary value placed on a tonne reduction of C will emerge either from the establishment of a fully functioning market or from government payment schemes. Estimates of the value of stored C have ranged from US$100 t(-1) (Can$120) to a low of less than US$5 t(-1) (Can$6). Current evidence suggests a likely price in the lower region of this range.

AB There is a need to develop verifiable algorithms that can be easily applied to estimate carbon sequestration in soils. A simple process-based empirical model, driven primarily by soil texture and crop residue input, was developed to account for changes in soil organic carbon (SOC) in Chernozemic soils on the Canadian prairies. The model was used to estimate SOC change under no-till and continuous cropping compared with conventional tillage and rotations with fallow. Using this model, C sequestration due to continuous cropping compared with fallow-containing rotations was determined to be 0.09 Mg C ha(-1)yr(-1) for the Brown and Dark Brown, and 0.05 Mg C ha(-1)yr(-1) for the Black and Dark Gray/Gray soil zones. The rate of C sequestration as a result of continuous cropping was positively related to the frequency of fallow, which decreases on the prairies from the Brown, Dark Brown, and Black to the Dark Gray/Gray soil zones. Using this model average C sequestration when conventional tillage was converted to no-till, was 0.13, 0.23, 0.34, and 0.25 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1) for the same soil zones, respectively. Combined gains due to no-till and continuous cropping in comparison with conventional tillage and fallow-containing rotations were determined to be 0.22, 0.32, 0.39, and 0.30 MgC ha(-1) yr(-1) for the Brown, Dark Brown, Black and Dark Gray/Gray soil zones, respectively. Based on Agricultural Census of Canada data in 1996 and 2001, the amount of "C sequestered" due to the adoption of no-till was estimated to be 1.23 million Mg of C in 1996 and 1.72 million Mg of C in 2001; which is approximately 10% of the total greenhouse gas emissions from the agricultural sector in Canada. This simple process-based empirical model could serve as a useful tool for soil scientists to use in assessing soil sustainability and C sequestration in the Canadian prairies. It would also assist policy makers in understanding how various scenarios of improved management will influence future greenhouse gas emissions on agricultural soils.

AB This paper presents the first detailed description of plant communities in the south-eastern Gobi Altay, covering the terrain of the Gobi Gurvan Sayhan National Park and adjacent areas. Phytosociological classification of 549 releves yielded 4 community groups with 39 communities. The distribution of communities is largely controlled by water availability, which is generally higher in the mountains. The upper slopes are covered by scrub with Juniperus sabina and by various types of mountain steppes with Stipa krylovii, while S. gobica desert-steppes dominate the upper piedmont areas. With decreasing humidity, Stipa glareosa-Allium polyrrhizum desert steppes occur and merge with semi-desertic, very open dwarf-shrublands towards the inter-montane basins and salt pans. Anabasis brevifolia, Salsola passerina, Zygophyllum xanthoxylon, and Haloxylon ammodendron are the most characteristic woody constituents of these semi-deserts. Extra-zonal vegetation types of minor spatial extent concentrate in water-surplus habitats in both extremes of the humidity range: Betula microphylla forests, Helictotrichon schelliani meadow steppes, and Kobresia myosuroides mats are restricted to the moistest slopes in the mountains; they contrast with Nitraria scrub, takyr communities, salt meadows, and Phragmites reeds in saline habitats of the inter-montane basins. The steppes have been grazed by both, wild and domestic herbivores for millennia, so all occurring plant species are well adapted to the grazing pressure. No regional grazing indicators could be identified, and grazing appears to be sustainable on the current level. However, rare occurrences of trees (Populus laurifolia gallery forest in the mountains, Populus diversifolia woodlands, and Ulmus pumila stands in the piedmont zones) indicate a certain potential for tree growth at favourable sites in the study area.
