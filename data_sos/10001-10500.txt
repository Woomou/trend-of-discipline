AB We propose measuring vulnerability of selected outcome variables of concern (e.g. agricultural yield) to identified stressors (e.g. climate change) as a function of the state of the variables of concern relative to a threshold of damage, the sensitivity of the variables to the stressors, and the magnitude and frequency of the stressors to which the system is exposed. In addition, we provide a framework for assessing the extent adaptive capacity can reduce vulnerable conditions. We illustrate the utility of this approach by evaluating the vulnerability of wheat yields to climate change and market fluctuations in the Yaqui Valley, Mexico. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Triangulation of methods, sources, and investigators can lead to a multidimensional understanding of a particular issue. In this study, the combination of qualitative and quantitative data collection methods, and information from community and coalition members resulted in the development of a tailored community-specific intervention. Three components were triangulated after analyzing each separately. A household survey of community members between the ages of 25 and 64 years was conducted to identify knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors related to cardiovascular disease and to assess risk factor levels. Focus group discussions were conducted with community members to describe facilitators and barriers to healthy lifestyles, as well as possible interventions. Natural group discussions with coalition members analyzed the relevance, feasibility, affordability, acceptability, and sustainability of specific intervention activities. Results from the different components were compared and contrasted. Areas of added information, validation, and contradiction were analyzed and guided the development of intervention activities.

AB This article provides lessons learned on establishing effective community participation in two externally funded, NGO-implemented health projects working at district level in Cambodia. The first project was implemented in accordance with the Cambodian national guidelines on community participation. The second using lessons and experiences gained as a result of the first project - worked with Buddhist pagoda volunteers. Primary research was conducted in both settings to assess the effectiveness of the two participation strategies. The article concludes that the success of community participation in externally funded health projects with relatively short implementation timeframes requires engagement with existing community-based organizations and agencies. In Cambodia, where Theravada Buddhism is the dominant religion, pagodas and associated volunteers appear to represent such an organization. Community participation structured around pagoda volunteers - who are held in high esteem within their local communities - is more effective and sustainable than newly (and externally) established community structures with formally elected representatives. Pagodas and associated volunteers in rural Cambodia offer the advantages of effective leadership, local organization, resource mobilization and management. It is recommended that programmes and agencies wishing to adopt community participation strategies in health utilize participatory research to identify the most appropriate local organization to lead such initiatives.

AB Through a process of community diagnosis and participation, a non-governmental organization in rural Karnataka state in India selected and trained peer outreach workers to implement and sustain AIDS prevention education activities. This activity was part of a larger AIDS education project that aimed at creating awareness and promoting risk-reducing behaviours in the community. This paper describes efforts of the project to identify and train peer educators during its implementation phase and discusses strategies used to facilitate sustainability. We evaluate the impact of these efforts by conducting an analysis in the project area 2 years after the end of the project. The findings reveal generalized interest among rural communities in HIV prevention issues. The project originally conducted an extensive survey to understand community organization and composition, which helped to identify potential partners and peer educators. Training peer educators was a multi-step process, and one with high attrition. While individual peer educators were an excellent resource during the life of the project, peer educators affiliated with village level institutions had the interest, access to resources and willingness to sustain project efforts. However, the sustainability of their efforts was associated with the quality of interactions with the project implementation team, the strength and leadership of their own institutions, the perceived benefits of implementing AIDS education activities after project life and the gender of the outreach worker. Non-sustainers did not have an organizational structure to backstop their work, were often poor and unemployed persons who later found gainful employment, and overwhelmingly, were female. We present a conceptual model based on these findings to help future projects plan for and achieve sustainability.

AB This paper describes the development, implementation and evaluation of a school- and family-based intervention to prevent obesity in children aged 5-7 years. In addition, the efficacy of three different intervention programmes was compared. Children aged 5-7 years (n = 213) were recruited from three primary schools in Oxford and randomly allocated to a control group or one of three intervention groups: nutrition group, physical activity group, and combined nutrition and physical activity group. The setting for the interventions was lunchtime clubs, where an interactive and age-appropriate nutrition and/or physical activity curriculum was delivered. The intervention lasted for 20 weeks over four school terms (-14 months). Children's growth, nutrition knowledge, diet and physical activity were assessed at baseline and at the end of the intervention. Significant improvements in nutrition knowledge were seen in all children (p < 0.01) between baseline and post-intervention, and results were highly significant in the nutrition and combined group (p < 0.001). Overall, fruit and vegetable intake increased significantly (p < 0.01 and <0.05, respectively), with changes seen in fruit consumption in the nutrition group (p < 0.05) and the control group (p < 0.05) in particular. No significant changes in the rates of overweight and obesity were seen as a result of the intervention. Gender differences were not detected in the majority of assessments and there was no clear effect of programme type per se. This pilot study has demonstrated that school may be a suitable setting for the promotion of healthy lifestyles in children, but requires replication in other social settings. Future initiatives should be long-lasting, multi-faceted and sustainable, involving all children in a school, and should target the whole environment and be behaviourally focused. The ultimate goal of any such programme is to lead to positive behaviour change which will have a beneficial effect on long-term health. Successful targeting of the family remains a challenge to such interventions.

AB The sustainable harvest of aquatic vegetation is not accounted for in the national economy, in decision-making, and environmental policy in the Kizilirmak-Delta, a Ramsar wetland of international importance and a major agricultural area on the Black Sea coast of Turkey. This paper describes the harvesting and marketing of sharp-pointed rush (Juncus acutus) using information obtained from interviews with villagers who were harvesting rush, wholesalers and retailers, government officials, and NGOs. The gross market value of the harvested rush amounts up to U. S. $494,000 annually in 1998 prices, of which U.S. $217,000 is retained by villagers. The economic contribution of the harvest and especially its livelihood for the villagers must be accounted for in projects and policy-making. Encouragement and continuity of the conditions of economic, social, and ecological sustainability of the harvest is essential for the conservation of the delta and its biodiversity.

DE groundwater management; groundwater statistics; statistical modeling;

AB The use of groundwater as water supply has increased dramatically in Santiago, Chile, during the last decades, and there is a need for accurately estimating the actual groundwater supply capacity in the upper Santiago Valley aquifer. The behavior of this aquifer was studied in order to determine the availability of water and the long-range sustainable extraction rate.
   Water-table depths were simulated using a numerical model with information on recharge from the last 48 years under different extraction policies. With this series of groundwater level data, groundwater level probability distribution functions were determined and extraction statistics were estimated by fitting time series models and by using the crossing theory. With this information, it has been possible to calculate the risk of being unable to supply groundwater demand because the results verify that only 67% of the water rights granted are able to be extracted on a sustained basis with a 90% exceedance probability. Furthermore, the results obtained demonstrate that the method is adequate for determining exceedance probabilities of groundwater flow.

AB An experiment was conducted during 1998-2002 to study the effect of pruning for sustainability of fruit yield in mango (Mangifera indica L.) at Regional Fruit Research Station, Vengurle, Maharashtra. Light pruning (50 cm heading back of branch on entire tree or of alternate limb) or centre opening and thinning of branches carried during the rest period before the emergence of new growth (November 1998) Supplemented with application of paclobutrazol (0.75 g ai/m canopy diameter) caused uniform vegetative growth, profuse flowering and enhance fruiting in 'Alphonso' mango. Pruning (centre opening) caused more penetration of light (690 Lux) inside the tree canopy, inducing more number of shoots (54) inside the tree canopy, greater shoot dry weight (14.7 g) and also reduced hopper incidence (0-1/panicle) which finally resulting in profuse flowering (63.8%) and fruiting (172.6). Centre opening and thinning of branches resulted in the maximum fruit yield (43.3 kg/tree), followed by heading back of branches oil alternate limbs (43.2 kg/tree) and heading back of branches on entire tree (39.9 kg/tree) over the control ( 13.5 kg/tree).

AB During the late 1980s/early 1990s, voluntary forest certification emerged as a new market-based incentive mechanism and had an important influence on the way the world's forests are managed. To understand the mechanism of its diffusion, we employed a survey instrument and probit regression analysis to investigate certification of forest practices by Canadian companies. Specifically, we investigated the characteristics of firms that have considered certification and of firms that have formally manifested their intention to certify Three major forest certification schemes are considered: (1) ISO 14001, (2) the Canadian Standards Association, and (3) the Forest Stewardship Council. We find that a firm's type of tenure holdings, reliance on export markets, size, and the local community are important factors in explaining why forest companies consider certification.

AB This study obtained quantitative data on fruit and nut traits from two indigenous fruit trees in West Africa (Irvingia gabonensis and Dacryodes edulis), which have led to the identification of trees meeting ideotypes based on multiple morphological, quality and food property traits desirable in putative cultivars. The same data also indicates changes in population structure that provide pointers to the level of domestication already achieved by subsistence farmers. D. edulis represents 21-57% of all fruit trees in farmers' fields and plays an important part in the economy of rural communities. An investigation of the socio-economic and biophysical constraints to indigenous tree cultivation found that indigenous fruits could play an even greater role in the rural economy of West and Central Africa. The opportunity to build on this through further domestication of these species is considerable, especially as retailers recognise customer preferences for certain D. edulis fruit traits, although at present the wholesale market does not. This project was linked to a larger participatory tree domestication programme within ICRAF's' wider agroforestry programme with traditionally valuable indigenous trees. Together these projects provided insights into the value of domesticating indigenous fruit trees, which are of strategic importance to poverty alleviation and sustainable development worldwide.

DE Joint Forest Management (JFM); empowerment; forest policy; resolution
AB Joint Forest Management focuses on empowerment of forest dwelling communities both socially and economically The present study attempts to analyse the government policies, prograrnmes and legal provisions regarding JFM with emphasis on empowerment in the Madhya Pradesh context.
   One of the major thrusts of the empowerment is capacity development. The efforts made by the Forest Department in capacity development are not yet able to yield the desired results in the field. However, there has been a basic shift towards empowerment and a large number of people, at least feel, that they are politically, socially and personally empowered after being involved in JFM. The translation of the empowerment into actual practice is going to be a major challenge for the sustainability of the JFM in the future.

ID SECTOR
AB The exact application of sustainable development in the mining and minerals industry has precipitated considerable debate in recent years. Since the publication of the Brundtland Commission's Report, Our Common Future, numerous explanations have been put forth in an attempt to define sustainable development in the mining and minerals context. Specifically, the inability of the Brundtland Report to outline an effective sustainability framework, combined with its contention that no single blueprint for sustainable development exists, has prompted a number of academics and practitioners to provide personal viewpoints on the application of sustainable development in the mining and minerals industry. This paper focuses on one aspect of the mining and minerals-sustain able development debate: the corporate perspective. It first uses the burgeoning body of literature to define sustainable development in the corporate mining context. Second, it addresses, against the background of this interpretation, many, of the salient issues associated with developing a series of plausible Sustainable Development Indicators (SDIs) for use in the mining and minerals extraction industry. The paper clearly illustrates the difficulty in both arriving at a suitable working definition of sustainable development for an industry, and developing an acceptable set of universal standards for measuring environmental and socioeconomic performance.

ID ENVIRONMENT
AB A broadly defined scientific Capacity Building (CB) for Sustainable Development (SD) is needed all around the world, and the development of innovative capacities in the developing countries is a priority. For this, first we need to know how this concept is applied in some developing countries. In this paper we present some Mexican experiences in the field of capacity building for Sustainable development. The main problems are the monodisciplinary training of the specialists, the absence of a sound policy for promotion, career development and assessment of researchers, as well as of their projects when they are interdisciplinary and development-oriented. The main proposals to solve these problems are the creation of mechanisms that foster and legitimize interdisciplinary work; a decentralized planning process with the specific objective of establishing the needs and orientations on a regional basis; provide resources to long-term projects, and finally, consensus on asking international funding agencies for stronger support for public higher education institutions in developing countries in order to increase and strengthen their capacity for education and research in general, and in the field of SID in particular.

ID INDICATORS
AB Sustainable development, as a multi-dimensional concept, is difficult to measure. Some efforts using indicators and indices have appeared in recent years, but most were developed on a national scale. Use of sustainability indicators has proven valuable for attaining better management of the environment by minimizing information gaps and maximizing community capabilities in terms of economic, social, environmental, and institutional sustainability dimensions. However, at least in the case of developing countries, the potential exists that national sustainability measures, based on national-level indicators, may mask problems in sub-national zones with highly unsustainable conditions. This paper proposes a methodology to evaluate sustainable development at a local level, the use of which Could be helpful in comparing different regions within a country or even among different countries. National sustainability indicators should result from a combination (whether additive or proportional) of regional sustainability indicators, as developed in this paper.

AB The Raramuri who live in the Sierra Tarahumara of Chihuahua State, Mexico have developed local knowledge and harvesting strategies for edible wild plants that have the effect of conserving the biodiversity of their forest ecosystem. This paper presents the results of ethnobotanical research undertaken in the community of Basihuare in the Sierra Tarahuniara, to provide details on some practical aspects of the Raramuri worldview regarding interconnections between people and their environment. This traditional philosophy forms the basis for the use of edible wild plants and the harvesting strategies practiced in Basihuare, such as selective harvesting, environmental modification and domestication. These activities provide the opportunity for harvesters to monitor the landscape and the plant resources that occur on the land, as well as present a setting for the communication and exchange of traditional ecological knowledge. However, Raramuri harvesting practices are tinder stress because of increased external pressures from commercial timber extraction and other development. We discuss the state of traditional ecological knowledge and its transmission in the context of development activities in the region. The key to sustainability in the Sierra Tarahumara may be the maintenance of traditional management practices for edible wild plants, and other non-timber forest products, that lead to the conservation of biodiversity by creating patchiness and renewing the plant cover on the land.

TI Rainwater harvesting and poverty alleviation: A case study in Gansu,
   China
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WATER RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB China faces great challenges to alleviate poverty as it enters the new century. There are still 30 million people living below the absolute poverty line. They are concentrated in the mountainous areas of western China, of which the loess area of Gansu province is one of the driest and poorest. One of the root causes of poverty is water scarcity. Water is the key factor in changing the fundamental conditions for the existence and development of the poor areas. Due to the topographical nature of the area, a major water delivery project would be difficult to build and be economically unfeasible. The most easy-to-use water source with the highest potential is rainwater. Rainwater harvesting (RWH) has been carried out in previous decades and it has been shown that it can serve the poor by supplying water for domestic use and supplemental irrigation, thus ensuring both water and food security. It can create a pre-condition for the modification of agricultural structure, thus promoting income generation. RWH is also beneficial to the recovery of the ecosystem and environmental conservation in the semi-arid northwest region of China. Past experiences show that RWH is an innovative approach for the integrated and sustainable development of the poor areas. It is reasonable to mainstream RWH in integrated water resources management.

TI Quality governance for sustainable development: India's obligation to

SO INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF ADMINISTRATIVE SCIENCES
LA English
DT Article
AB Sustainable development and quality governance sound deceptively simple concepts. Any worthwhile development has to be sustained and sustainable over the long term. The major support for such sustenance in any modern organized society comes from the process of governing. This support may range from one extreme of state ownership and control of production and all socioeconomic activity to the other end of merely providing legal regulation and material infrastructure. Research into this relationship can either take the empirical route comparing two or more actual systems of relations or a theoretical stance to work out the result of different sets of relations. This article does not take either of these academic routes for the obvious reason that the current provocation to define and explore this relation is the specific result of a series of identifiable developments in the last 50 years.

TI Governance and diversity within the public service in Canada: towards a
   viable and sustainable representation of designated groups (employment
   equity)
SO INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF ADMINISTRATIVE SCIENCES
LA English
DT Article
AB The Canadian Government is constantly seeking to set up thorough-going, responsible administrative practices. Representation is one of the main bases on which the mandate of the federal public service stands. Without this operating principle, a government agency cannot fully and faithfully reflect the concerns of the people it is called to serve. In order to be fair and inclusive, political action must manage diversity on a vast scale, embracing such differences as race, gender, age, language, ethnic origin, religion and disability. Canada's population is one of the most diversified in the world. Aboriginal peoples and highly varied sustained immigration are just two factors contributing to its diversity and attributes.
   The political authorities have been totally committed to the question of diversity for several decades. As a consequence, a vast legislative framework has been set up including the 1982 Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The aim of this article is to introduce the Canadian example with reference to the management of diversity in the public service and, more particularly, the efforts made to achieve fairness in matters of employment. The approach consists first of reviewing the development of the issues of diversity from a general historical and political viewpoint, with special focus on employment equity (EE), and, second, of describing and examining the latest results obtained in terms of representation and its characteristics within the Canadian federal machine. Finally, the importance of identifying challenges for the public service, with a view to responsible governance, is examined within a global discussion of the obstacles identified, the programmes in place and the new approach to be developed.

TI Values for public service: lessons learned from recent trends and the
   Millennium Summit
SO INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF ADMINISTRATIVE SCIENCES
LA English
DT Article
ID MANAGEMENT
AB This article was originally prepared for circulation at the Second Specialized International Conference of the HAS, which took place in New Delhi from 5 to 9 November 2002. It was presented orally, in a much abridged form, in the context of the Workshop on Relations between International Organizations and National Administrations in Sustainable Development Policies. As the title suggests, the article's point of departure is the Millennium Summit (September 2000) and the sequence of events which have followed and are still unfolding. The Millennium Declaration and the logic of the events of the past two years bring into sharp relief the salience of good governance and of public service values, in this context. They also, one could argue, cast doubt on the validity of managerial doctrines which held sway in the 1980s and 1990s and undermined these values. The market model of government assiduously pursued the shrinkage of the state and the devaluation of public service. It questioned the identity of public administration and promoted the idea that governments should follow and adopt not only the methods and practices but also the values of business. Efficiency and effectiveness ranked at the top of those values. Regulations and rules were discounted. 'Results' were enjoined over 'process'.
   In retrospect, the outcomes of this approach have proved very uneven and mixed. Experience demonstrates the need for some degree of separation between the world of business and that of government, between the private sector and the public sphere. Some boundaries are necessary in order to emphasize their separate identities, enhance public service professionalism, reinforce a public service ethic and restore public trust in government. More than anything else, a degree of separation is needed to preserve and to sustain integrity, commitment, objectivity and independence, which must be seen as the marks of the true professional.

TI Traditional knowledge and areas of biodiversity in Brazilian Amazonia
SO INTERNATIONAL SOCIAL SCIENCE JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
AB The loss of biodiversity, one of the environmental problems with an acknowledged planet-wide impact, has been addressed by a convention which highlights the need to take into account the "knowledge, innovations and practices of indigenous and local communities" in a context of sustainable development. This rehabilitation of the traditional practices and knowledge of communities undermined by several decades of development raises a number of problems as to its relevance, forms, and procedures. The multidisciplinary research we have carried out in Brazilian Amazonia on the management of the varietal diversity of cassava by various local groups provides a good illustration of this. After presenting the Amazonian context in which cassava is cultivated, we look at the institutional and organizational environments in which the communities concerned live before taking up the question of emerging political configurations involved in preserving local knowledge. Non-governmental organisations play a significant role politically, as intermediaries between the local level and the state's political and administrative institutions. The dynamics observed testify to a far-reaching change in the way "indigenous commuinities" relate to the society around them.

TI NGOs and the process of prior informed consent in bioprospecting
   research: the Maya ICBG project in Chiapas, Mexico
SO INTERNATIONAL SOCIAL SCIENCE JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
AB In 1998, a 5-year bioprospecting project that came to be known as the Maya ICBG was initiated among the Maya communities of the Highlands of Chiapas, Mexico. The project was funded by agencies of the US government - the National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation, and the US Department of Agriculture. Project personnel were drawn from a major US university, a federal Mexican research institution, a small British pharmaceutical company, and numerous Maya collaborators. The major aims of the research included drug discovery and pharmaceutical development, medical ethnobiology and floristic inventory, and conservation, sustained harvest, and economic growth. In spite of strong support from local Maya communities and Mexican federal agencies, the project was terminated in its second year due to the actions of local, national, and international non-governmental organisations, which characterised the project as biopiracy. Major themes in the acrimonious debate that developed concerned the definition of prior informed consent (PIC), local communities' rights to grant PIC, and who should judge whether PIC had been obtained. In this paper, we describe the events leading to the termination of the Maya ICBG and question the motives and methods of certain NGOs in usurping the rights of local communities to act on their own behalf concerning the sustainable use of their own biological resources.

AB The rapid development of industry and urban areas, population growth and rising living standards have all resulted in an increased water demand for non-agricultural uses in the North China Plain, therefore decreasing the water availability for irrigation. Technologies that favour a reduced demand and water-saving practices in irrigation are required to assure the sustainability of water use in agricultural production. This paper presents main research results relative to the integration of water and soil management technologies which may contribute to improving the use of water and land in agricultural production, reducing demand for irrigation, and more efficient use of groundwater. Improved estimates of crop irrigation requirements, better irrigation scheduling for the winter wheat crop and improved surface irrigation systems, result in water saving corresponding to about 100 mm in very dry years and up to 250 mm in average years with a small yield increase. These savings represent 16-33% of water use during the wheat crop season. Improvements in soil management lead to improved soil fertility and physical properties (including hydraulic conductivity). These improvements produce potential increases in summer maize yields of between 10 and 20%. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

AB The occurrence of wet and dry spells is a phenomenon most often used to identify the and and semi-arid lands (ASAL) in Kenya. The use of first-order Markov processes that are embedded into a computer model to determine the critical climate extremes is presented. The model uses the concepts of conditional probability, Poisson probability distribution function and chi-square testing to predict the critical spells. The daily rainfall data (198 1 2000) for two weather stations in the Kano Plains (Kenya) have been used to illustrate model application. For example, based upon the bimodal rainfall pattern in the study area, the model revealed the length of the critical dry spell to be 14 days in the long rainy season and 12 days in the short rainy season, while the critical wet spell was found to be 12 and 8 days, for the long and short rains respectively for Ahero Irrigation Scheme. It is recommended that a climate and environmental audit in the Kano Plains for the determination of land and water management strategies include critical dry and wet spell determination. This will enhance more sustainable planning and utilization of the crucial water and land resources in the region and in other tropical rangelands. There are possibilities of integrating the model with other agro-ecosystems models and other natural resource management decision support systems. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

AB Since 1999, Chinese leaders have been according a much higher priority to the development of the western region. Falling in the ranks of the last third of China's provincial units in terms of overall development, the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region is still blessed with a relatively well-educated population. To strengthen competitiveness, the region now emphasizes industrialization and related structural adjustment. Recently, the tourism industry has also become all important growth point. Southern Ningxia, a poor mountainous area, is now initiating a regional afforestation program in areas where people are living on semi-arid land Ningxia has been relatively successful in securing funding for its projects in infrastructure and heavy industry; construction of roads and railways is in particular assuming increasing significance. Sustainable long-term growth, however, will have to depend on an improvement in the investment environment, leading to the expansion of both the service and nonpublic sectors, as well as an increase in small and medium-sized enterprises.

AB Cross-disciplinary studies carried out lately by Russian scholars discovered a causal relationship between the three variables: technological potential, cultural regulation quality, and social sustainability, The patterns called techno-humanitarian balance law, states that the higher production and war technologies' power, the more refined the behavior-regulation means (consolidated values and norms, etc.) that are required for self-preservation of the society.
   The article shows that the law has controlled social selection for all of human history and prehistory, discarding unbalanced social organisms, as far as they could not cope with ecological and (or) geopolitical crises, which had been caused by their own activities. It also shows how successive growth of instrumental opportunities in long-term retrospection has dramatically led to the consecutive perfection of cultural and psychological regulation mechanisms.
   Relevant calculations, comparative-anthropological evidence, and historical illustrations are provided. Regularities in mental processes are described that precede and accompany crisis-causing behavior, to certain extent regardless of population's historical and cultural peculiarities.

AB A field study evaluated the residual effect of a cropping system in two minor (dry) seasons on the productivity pattern and nitrogen utilization of a maize crop grown in the subsequent major (wet) seasons. The cropping systems established in the minor seasons, where evaporation exceeds rainfall, were either monocultures of maize (Zea mays L), or maize intercropped with either common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L) or sunhemp (Crotolaria juncea L). In addition, monocultures of two green manures, namely sunhemp (Crotolaria juncea) or Tithonia (Tithonia diversifolia), were established. The residues of maize and beans and the green manures were incorporated at the end of the minor season; at the onset of rains in the major season, maize crops were established on the same plots. Germination of maize was not affected by the previous cropping system. In contrast, crop growth and yields of maize and nitrogen utilization were affected by the previous cropping system. Optimum growth and highest yields were procured in maize that was grown after a green manure crop. Similarly, although the yields were high, the planting of a green manure crop reduced nitrogen utilization by maize in the major season, thereby indicating its potential contribution to sustainability, due to its lower mining of soil nitrogen. On the basis of the results of this two-year study, the impact of cropping systems in minor seasons on the productivity of maize, a very important highland cereal in the tropics, grown under rain-fed conditions in a major season, is presented.

AB There is considerable evidence that peripheral nerves have the potential to regenerate in an appropriate microenvironment. We have developed a novel artificial nerve guide composed of poly 3-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) filled with glial growth factor (GGF) suspended in alginate hydrogel. Gaps of 2-4 cm in rabbit common peroneal nerve were bridged using a PHB conduit containing either GGF in alginate hydrogel (GGF) or alginate alone (Alginate), or with an empty PHB conduit (Empty). Tissues were harvested 21, 42 and 63 days post-operatively. Schwann cell and axonal regeneration were assessed using quantitative immunohistochemistry. At 21 days, addition of GGF increased significantly the distance of axonal and Schwann cells regeneration in comparison with that observed in Alginate and Empty conduits for both gap lengths. The axons bridged the 2-cm GGF conduits gap by 63 days, with a comparable rate of regeneration seen in 4-cm conduits. Schwann cells and axonal regeneration quantity was similar for both gap lengths in each group. However, at all time points the quantity of axonal and Schwann cells regeneration in GGF grafts was significantly greater than in both Alginate and Empty conduits, the latter showing better regeneration than Alginate conduits. The results indicate an inhibitory effect of alginate on regeneration, which is partially reversed by the addition of GGF to the conduits. In conclusion, GGF stimulates a progressive and sustainable regeneration increase in long nerve gap conduits.

AB Our objectives were to evaluate strategies to improve productivity and economic returns from beef and dual-purpose cattle systems based on data collected on one dual-purpose (Bos taurus x Bos indicus) and two beef (Nellore) cattle farms in the western Amazon region of Brazil. Forage chemical composition and digestion rates of carbohydrate fractions of grazed Brachiaria decumbens and Brachiaria brizantha cv. Marandu grasses and Pueraria phaseoloides (tropical kudzu) legume were measured monthly during a 9-mo period from the end of one dry season to the end of the subsequent rainy season. Measurements of milk and growth responses to grazing these forages were used to predict animal productivity responses to dietary nutrient availability throughout an annual cycle. The ME available for gain in our simulations was always more limiting than metabolizable protein. The predicted ME available for gain was 0.50 kg/d for steers grazing B. brizantha and 0.40 kg/d for finishing steers grazing B. decumbens. Grasses contained more NDF and neutral detergent insoluble protein and less ME (P < 0.05) in the rainiest months than in the less rainy season, which resulted in 20% less predicted weight gain by growing steers (P < 0.05). Supplementation with sorghum grain was required to increase milk production and growth by 25 or 50% per animal, respectively, but this strategy was less profitable than current forage-only diets. Greater productivity of land and labor from higher stocking indicated greater net margins for beef production, but not for milk. This study suggested that more intensive beef production by judicious fertilization of grass-legume pastures and greater stocking density is the preferable strategy for owners of these cattle systems to improve economic returns under current conditions. It also might help decrease the motivation for additional forest clearing.

AB This paper attempts to bridge business ethics to corporate social responsibility including the social and environmental dimensions. The objective of the paper is to suggest a conceptual methodology with which ethics of corporate environmental management tools can be considered. The method includes two stages that are required for a shift away from the current dominant unsustainable paradigm and toward a more sustainable paradigm. The first stage is paradigmatic, metaphoric and normative. The second stage is a practical stage, which in turn, is analytic, descriptive and positive. The method is applied to common industrial metabolism tools of ecological footprints (EF), environmental life cycle assessment (LCA) and industrial ecology (IE). The application shows that all three tools can be used in business ethics, in particular, when the first stage of the method is applied to their use.

AB In today's marketplace, change is a given, and learning is a critical component to the success of change initiatives. In recent years, marketing scholars have proposed that learning is a key to creating a sustainable competitive advantage and enhancing business performance. This article addresses the issue of learning and attempts to establish learning as a legitimate variable for study as it relates to sales force management. To that end, the authors have endeavored to provide, through the positing of propositions, a research agenda for the examination of learning in a sales force context. The authors provide a review of the pertinent literature on individual and organizational learning. Included in the presentation is a discussion of change success measures that go beyond the traditional measure of sales force success-sales volume. In the article, propositions relating various organizational and individual variables to organizational and individual salesperson learning are presented. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Inc.

AB Conservationists in the recent years view local peoples' support for protected areas management as an important element of biodiversity conservation. This is often linked to the direct benefits, which local communities get from the protected areas. These benefits could be in the form of biomass resources, park funds diverted to local villages by state agencies and revenue from wildlife tourism. There are a very few studies which have attempted to study the direct relationship between benefits from wildlife tourism and local support for conservation. In India, wildlife tourism is restricted, and mostly controlled by state and private agencies. Wildlife conservation policy does not view tourism in protected areas as a source of revenue for the local communities. The present study examines the local people's attitudes towards wildlife tourism and the impact of benefits from tourism on the local support for Sariska Tiger Reserve (STR), India. STR is a flagship for tourism where protected areas are increasingly being visited and where local support for wildlife tourism has not been studied adequately. Results indicate that two-thirds of the respondents were positive towards tourism and support for conservation. The respondents were aware that more tourism benefits are possible from a well-conserved protected area. There appears to be correlation between benefits obtained by local people from wildlife tourism and other sources, and support for protected area existence, suggesting that benefits impact people's attitudes towards conservation. Some of the main problems are the unequal distribution of tourism benefits, lack of locals' involvement in tourism and development. There is a need to clearly address these issues, so that protected areas may get the support of local people, which may lead to sustainable development., (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Wetlands constitute a significant source of life since they incorporate unique habitats with endemic and migrant species. They also contribute to the preservation of high global biodiversity and they are under protection according to EU legislation. Nevertheless, during the last century, significant degradation has been observed in wetlands, mainly due to intensification of agriculture and poor water management practices.
   Calcareous fens habitat with the endangered species Cladium mariscus and Carex spp. is an ecologically significant wetland that undergoes great ecological stresses globally, due to the irrational use of water resources. In Trichonis lake, Western Greece, this habitat has been under deterioration during the last 50 years due to the lack of a sustainable water management plan that has caused destabilization of the hydrologic balance and high water level fluctuations. This human induced hydrologic regime has led to seasonal shifting between drought and flooding which constitute unfavorable conditions for this fen habitat and as a result significant elimination of this ecosystem extent has occurred. This study has adopted technologically advanced scientific methods such as GIS applications and remote sensing techniques to quantify the existing water resources and formulate a sustainable management scheme by considering both anthropogenic water uses and environmental protection.

DE public forests; sustainability
AB Three state public forest management agencies, a federal historic area, and two universities with extensive research forests participated in a study to test the applicability of the two major forest management certification programs to their forestlands.Two.separate field-based assessments were performed on the same lands at approximately the same time. The agencies then participated in a "reverse evaluation," in which they judged the relevance of independent, third-party certification to their mission and goals, and the degree to which each certification process facilitated improvements in the conservation and sustainable management of their forests. Among other differences between the certification programs, agency personnel found that SFI auditors were more rigorous in their expectations for continuous improvement, and FSC was more thorough in its coverage of biological, ecological, and social issues.

DE sustainability; third-party auditing
AB North Carolina State University, Duke University, and the North Carolina Division of Forest Resources (DFR) recently received both Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) and Sustainable Forestry Initiative (SFI) certification for their forests. Meeting SFI standards required better environmental management systems, improved use of best management practices, and better recordkeeping but few-Subsequent forest management changes. FSC required about the same environmental system changes but more forest management changes to favor future natural-stand management and biodiversity protection. Costs included changes in forest management and recordkeeping to achieve forest certification, inspection expenses, prescribed changes in forest management, forgone timber revenues, and more stakeholder consultation. Benefits can include an improved professional reputation, better worker safety and training, better records and processes, more active public involvement, enhanced knowledge for outreach, better environmental management systems, more holistic management, and perhaps higher timber prices or greater market access.

AB Forest Stewardship Council certification emerged nearly a decade-ago, and its growth has been both applauded and criticized. To learn more about the impacts of certification, in 2002 we concluded a survey of FSC-certified forest management organizations in North America, focusing on forest managers' goals for seeking certification, the land management impacts of certification, and the overall benefits and costs of certification. Results indicate FSC certification seems to be representing the interests of those who call for greater forest management accountability, but it addresses the interests of the forest managers themselves less well.

TI WTO disciplines on fisheries subsidies: A historic step towards
   sustainability?
SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC LAW
LA English
DT Article
AB The Doha Ministerial Declaration mandates the WTO Negotiating Group on Rules to 'clarify and improve WTO Disciplines on fisheries subsidies'. Under this mandate, the so-called 'Friends of Fish' currently propose to adopt special sectoral disciplines on fisheries subsidies that directly and primarily aim at preserving fish resources. Ibis paper examines whether and to what extent proposals by Friends of Fish can be justified, as a matter of law and policy. This paper first demonstrates that: (i) the current SCM Agreement may resolve fisheries subsidies issues to a considerable extent through dispute settlement; (ii) some limits of the SCM Agreement originate mostly from the generic imperfectness of the current SCM rules that apply equally to other sectors, rather than from unique features of the fisheries sector. Therefore, WTO Members may preferably move forwards negotiating on special disciplines only for residual matters that dispute settlement or cross-sectoral negotiations on SCM rules cannot effectively address. The Doha mandate cannot be construed as legally authorizing WTO Members to adopt special disciplines on fisheries subsidies as proposed by Friends of Fish, which would be a significant step beyond the trade-oriented WTO mission. As a matter of policy, such a move by the WTO towards sustainability would be an historic step for the WTO, but it would be justified only when proposed disciplines are accompanied by appropriate means to avoid or at least minimize an institutional systemic risk for the WTO. Current proposals by Friends of Fish seem to lack such a safety net. This paper concludes with several recommendations for WTO Members in dealing with fisheries subsidies issues so as to maintain a systemic balance and minimize an institutional risk for the WTO as a multilateral trading system.

AB This paper examines the effects of private financial (non-FDI) capital inflows in Thailand in the pre-crisis period (1980:I-1996:IV). Private capital inflows are found to be associated with higher asset prices, lower lending rates, surges in bank lending and domestic spending driven by higher investment, higher output, modest inflation, and modest real exchange rate appreciation. Inflows are also associated with a greater vulnerability to a liquidity crisis, but not with greater external solvency risk. Current account deficits are temporary, thus sustainable, as exports catch up with higher imports within two years. Consequently, the Thai crisis appears to be more of a liquidity crisis than an external solvency crisis. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB We have remodeled canola seeds to accumulate the omega-3 fatty acid, stearidonic acid (SDA). In doing so, we have demonstrated the feasibility of developing a land-based source of functional omega-3 fatty acids on a large scale. Land-based omega-3 fatty acids represent a sustainable source of omega-3 fatty acids that can be produced on large acreages and delivered to consumers in a wide variety of functional foods. And unlike a-linolenic acid, SDA can provide eicosapentaenoic acid equivalence at moderate intakes. Widely applied, SDA-enriched foods could become a valuable tool for delivering recommended levels of omega-3 fatty acids to large portions of the population. By obviating the need for dietary changes, SDA-enriched foods may facilitate increased compliance with recommendations for daily omega-3 intakes.

AB The aim of this study was to develop a method to kill or expel the gill-dwelling crustacean parasite Paraergasilus rylovi from a common freshwater clam, Anodonta piscinalis. Naturally infected clams were exposed to different water-quality treatments and monitoring in the laboratory. In a high-temperature treatment (26 C vs. control 18 C, the mean abundance of the parasite decreased to near zero in 7 days. Because only 2 clams of 72 died in this treatment during the 14-day experiment, the survival of the host was not seriously at risk at the high temperature. 'Low oxygen, no water change' (18 C) was the second most effective treatment, followed by a 'low-oxygen, water-flow' (18 C) treatment. At the end of the experiment, the mean parasite abundance was significantly lower in all the treatments than in the control clams (18 C). A few P. rylovi individuals abandoned the host at 26 C but died in a couple of days outside the host. However, the parasites lived on average (+/-SE) 12.7 +/- 0.9 days outside the clam, and were also shown to be capable of infecting another uninfected host individual, at 18 C. The results of the present study suggest that high temperature provides an effective, ecologically sustainable method to manipulate the intensity of P. rylovi infection.

AB Environmental concerns have been framed in the planning profession as manifestations of resource scarcity, and hence a contributing factor in community conflicts. While mismanaged environmental scarcity can certainly lead to conflict, there is also considerable potential to stimulate cooperation on the basis of environmental scarcity itself. In the language of game theory, the latter outcome can be obtained by converting "dilemmas of common competing interests" to "dilemmas of common aversion." The cooperation which Would result from the use of environmental concerns as a binding element in conflicts among parties, is likely to catalyze a more "sustainable consensus"-a robust contract between erstwhile adversaries. Planners are in a unique position to glean the positive attributes of environmental indicators since they can bridge technical knowledge of environmental impact with air understanding of sociopolitical context at community consultation forums. This paper attempts to provide the theoretical basis for this approach and develop examples of how, such a strategy for conflict resolution may be implemented.

AB This article examines the gradual emergence of an integrated technological and behavioral approach to mobile source emissions control in the United States. Confronted with the Persistence Of Urban air quality problems in regions experiencing rapid population growth and decentralization, the Environmental Protection Agency recently developed a set of guidelines to permit metropolitan regions to receive air quality "credit" for the adoption of-smart growth" land Use practices. Following an examination of the predominant emissions control philosophy that has guided federal air quality management for more than thirty years, the author outlines three stages in the existing air quality planning process through which metropolitan planning organizations may receive credit for land use-based control strategies and recommends a set Of institutional changes needed to foster the development of an integrated land use, transportation, and air quality management framework.

AB The identification of quantitative fertility indicators for evaluating the sustainability of cropping and farming systems has become a major issue. This question has been extensively studied by the German agronomist Albrecht Daniel Thaer at the beginning of the 19(th) century. In this paper Thaer's work is set in its historical background, from the end of the 16(th) century (Palissy, 1580) to the middle of the 19(th) century (Liebig, 1840). Then the paper focuses on Thaer's quantitative and complex fertility scale (expressed in "fertility degrees"), which was based on soil properties, on the requirement of nutrients by plants, and on the cropping system (including crop rotation). Thaer expressed soil fertility and economic results as a function of rye production in "scheffel of rye per journal" (ca. 200 kg per hectare). He also proposed a scale to describe the intrinsic fertility of soil. Thaer used this approach to assess the effect of major German cropping systems on soil fertility. He applied it to eight theoretical systems and nine existing systems in a true modeling approach. Thaer completed the fertility evaluation for the nine existing systems with a detailed economical analysis commenting the limits and potentialities of each system. Thaer's approach was used with success during half a century as it combined numerous empirical findings on soils and fertilization with organic substances in a sophisticated model. Unfortunately and despite effective practical applications, the scientific foundations of Thaer's "Humus Theory" proved definitively false as soon as 1840 when Sprengel and Liebig published on mineral nutrition of plants. Thaer's work deserves to be rediscovered since it approaches the modern issue of the sustainability of cropping and farming systems.

TI The non-indigenous mussel Musculista senhousia in an Adriatic lagoon:
   effects on benthic community over a ten year period
SO JOURNAL OF THE MARINE BIOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION OF THE UNITED KINGDOM
LA English
DT Article
AB The Asian date mussel, Musculista senhousia (Mytilidae), is a good example of a species that has dispersed outwards from its native area through human-mediated transport, establishing sustainable populations in distant parts of the world. The date mussel, which is endemic in the Western Pacific region, appeared and became very abundant in the Sacca di Goro, a brackish lagoon in the Po River Delta (northern Adriatic Sea, Italy) in the early 1990s. Effects of M. senhousia on macrobenthic biodiversity were assessed over a ten year time period. At the study site, the increase in abundance and spread of M. senhousia resulted in an alteration of the pre-established macrobenthic community. Changes in benthic dynamics seemed apparent, through the inhibition of epifaunal, suspension-feeding taxa (Ficopomatus enigmaticus, Mytilaster minimus), and the enhancement of detritivores (Neanthes succinea, Streblospio shrubsolii, Microdeutopus gryllotalpa). It is hypothesized that the Asian date mussel was initially successful because it exploited a naturally disturbed, sparsely occupied environment, rather than interjecting itself among and displacing existing species. Musculista senhousia acted, at least initially, as a colonizer rather than an invader.

AB This retrospective study of impairments in a decentralized and integrated, routine Hansen's disease (HD) programme was done on a cohort of all new patients detected in Rondonia state from 1996 to 1999. It shows that the dynamics of impairments during treatment in Rondonia are similar to what has been published in other recent studies from Africa and Asia. Data about impairments at detection and at release from treatment (cure), the prescription of steroids, and epidemiological information are provided. Of the original 5350 new patients, 4230 patients (80%) completed multidrug therapy (MDT) and had complete data about their impairment status. At the start of treatment, 9% of the paucibacillary (PB) and 26% of the multibacillary (MB) patients had WHO grade 1 impairment. Three percent of the PB and 11% of the MB patients had visible deformities (WHO grade 2 impairment). Of the patients without impairments (grade 0) at the start of treatment, 5% of the PB and 20% of the MB patients developed impairments during treatment. Of the PB patients with a WHO impairment grade 1 at start of treatment, 34% improved and 6% got worse. Of the MB patients 34% improved and 12% became worse. In a separate study of patients from the 1997 intake, 17% of the PB and 58% of the MB patients were treated at least once with a course of steroids or thalidomide during MDT treatment. It is noted in the literature that the percentage of persons with recent nerve function impairment (NFI), nerve pain or tenderness and/or reaction reactions differs between projects. This may reflect real differences or may be caused by differences in routine monitoring and/or criteria and methods of treatment. The use of the WHO maximum score, particularly for the patients with grade 2, is not as sensitive to change as utilizing the summary of Eye, Hand and Foot (EHF) scores. If overall impairment figures are given, the proportions of MB patients may define the differences between projects, therefore it is important to analysis and present the results of PB and MB patients separately. The most simple (outcome) indicator to estimate the effectiveness of patient management would be the proportions of patients with impairment grade 0 at start of treatment who develop either grade 1 or 2 impairments during treatment. An additional (outcome) indicator could be the proportion of patients with impairment grade 1 at start of treatment who develop grade 2 impairments during treatment. Currently, no operational targets or acceptable level of performance for patient management have been set. This would be important to enable programme managers to determine if adequate patient education, treatment and follow up have been provided after the disease detection to prevent and/or minimize problems associated with the disease. The available evidence strongly suggests that reactions and impairments related to HD will continue to occur in large numbers, requiring the development of adequate infrastructures and sustainable services to detect and to manage problems associated with HD during and after MDT treatment.

AB Secondary production of a macrobenthic community at an intertidal mudflat was estimated for 33 successive months. Sampling was carried out along a eutrophication gradient, including non-eutrophied Zostera meadows, an intermediate muddy area, and a strongly eutrophied sand-muddy flat, where macroalgal blooms of Enteromorpha spp. usually occur. The Zostera meadows were always the most productive habitat (145-225 g ash-free dry weight m(-2) year(-1)). In the short term, the macroalgal bloom benefited the total estuarine production by enhancing the annual production in the eutrophied area. Nevertheless, our results show that this increase was short lived and in no way sufficient to match the production in the Zostera meadows. In the long term, the present study provides evidence that the disappearance of macrophyte beds, as a result of ongoing eutrophication, constitutes a major threat to the sustainability of the estuarine ecosystem.

TI Environmentally-friendly mortars: a way to improve bond between mortar
   and brick
SO MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES
LA English
DT Article
AB In order to find new application fields for either fine materials coming from building demolition or industrial by-products, some mortars, in which fine recycled materials, obtained from a plant where rubble from building demolition are ground, are substituted to natural sand, were tested.
   Moreover, mortars containing either fly ash or ground brick powder as partial cement replacement were studied.
   Based on characterization results and performance evaluations, recycled-aggregate mortar seems to be superior in terms of mortar-brick bond strength, mainly because of its rheological properties.
   In addition, the use of fine recycled aggregate instead of natural sand is in accordance with the sustainable development concept, with recycling and reuse of building rubble playing a key role in meeting the need to complete the building life cycle.

AB Home gardens are a pervasive component of Andean agricultural systems, but have been ignored in anthropological and agronomic research. Recent research in the indigenous community of Saraguro, Ecuador, employed a combination of in-depth interviews, free-listing, videotaped walk-throughs, and mapping to explore the role of home gardens, which are established and controlled by women. Findings reveal that, although gardens offer multiple benefits, they are overwhelmingly devoted to the cultivation of medicinal plants, operating as de facto medicine cabinets that supply women with most of the resources they need to treat family illnesses. Results also suggest that the natural history of home gardens mirrors transformations within the family, and that Saraguro women study the contents of their neighbors' gardens, using this knowledge as a foundation for deciphering the owners' economic and health status. New threats to the sustainability of home gardens threaten the foundation of Saraguro's ethnomedical system and women's authority in the home and community.

AB Sustainability is a key requirement for partnership success and a major challenge for such organizations. Despite the critical importance of sustainability to the success of community health partnerships and the many threats to sustainability, there is little evidence that would provide partnerships with clear guidance on long-term viability. This article attempts to (1) develop a conceptual model of sustainability in community health partnerships and (2) identify potential determinants of sustainability using comparative qualitative data from four partnerships from the Community Care Network (CCN) Demonstration Program. Based on a grounded theory examination of qualitative data from the CCN evaluation, the authors hypothesize that there are five primary attributes/activities of partnerships leading to consequential value and eventually to sustainability of collaborative capacity. They include outcomes-based advocacy, vision-focus balance, Systems orientation, infrastructure development, and community linkages. The context in which the partnership operates provides the conditions for determining the appropriateness and relative impact of each of the factors related to creating consequential value in the partnership.

AB The water budget of New Mexico's Middle Rio Grande region incurs annually a deficit of 55,000 acre-feet through groundwater mining. To address this unsustainable condition, a State-mandated regional water planning effort involving significant public participation is underway to produce a regional water plan. The action arena where this process is taking place may not be appropriately constituted to enable stakeholders to agree on and implement a comprehensive plan to "balance all desired and required uses with sustainable supply." The heterogeneity of the actors and their interests and the complexity of the decision situations they face contribute to a high level of uncertainty about the outcome. Changing the rules of the game to encourage interested actors to negotiate partial solutions to the problem may increase incentives for participation and cooperation and allow more productive institutional arrangements to emerge.

AB The health system is part of the social system and is conditioned by health, political, educational and economical factors. In the European Union, the health assistance is in good situation, covering the disease-disability risk. Solidarity, equity and universality are the principles that govern the European health systems; public financing is of high relevance. The organization of these systems is ruled by each country; nevertheless, the countries of the European Union are carrying out sanitary reforms that follow common directives. In the medical assistance, the state members have decided to reach accessibility for all, quality and financial sustainability, without forgetting the demographic aging, the appearance of new technologies and therapies, or the improvement of the well-being and standard of life.
   The organization of the Spanish National Health System is based on policies of the community, fitting the normative frame to the communitarian laws and the present needs on health.

AB This case study examines the effects of 6 years of farm dairy effluent (FDE) irrigation on the upper 40 cm of a Greytown silt loam, Wairarapa, New Zealand. Physical and chemical soil properties were measured, i.e., particle size distribution, porosity, dry bulk density, field-saturated hydraulic conductivity, total carbon, total Kjeldahl nitrogen, pH, total and Olsen phosphorus, cation exchange capacity, and concentrations of exchangeable cations (K+, Na+, Ca2+, Mg2+). While the concentrations of total carbon and total Kjeldahl nitrogen were generally low at all depths, the application of effluent has caused a significant increase in their concentrations in the upper 10 cm of the profile. The concentration of exchangeable cations has been similarly increased in the upper 10 cm of the profile. The soil has very low phosphorus retention, however effluent application has increased both total and Olsen phosphorus to 40 cm depth. Most of the changes in soil properties have led us to believe that current application rates and pasture production can be maintained and that FDE application has improved the soil's long-term fertility or "soil quality", especially in the upper 10 cm of the profile. However, there is no evidence to suggest that current application rates are sustainable in terms of other environmental effects (e.g., nitrate leaching).

AB Students today face many significant challenges as they grow up in a world being transformed by tremendous social change and resulting problems such as HIV/AIDS, violence, crime, and substance abuse. Schools in South Africa and around the world have the opportunity to help children cope with and adapt to these issues so that they increase their chances of being successful in school and in life. This article provides an overview of current social and emotional learning (SEL) interventions in schools. The definition and essential elements of such instruction are presented, its conceptual links to school and life success are explicated, outcomes are reviewed and examples of effective programming are provided. The article concludes with a discussion of key future issues that the field must address, including assessment and outcome evaluation, professional preparation and networking, and sustainability. Based on the examination of the field, it is clear that there are consistent research findings on the effectiveness of such efforts, thereby supporting the scaling up of such interventions in schools.

SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
LA English
DT Article
ID ELECTROMAGNETIC PULSES; LASER-PULSES; DYNAMICS; FORCE
AB Subjecting polar linear molecules to appropriately designed half-cycle electromagnetic pulses induces strong orientation of the molecules. This is deduced by inspecting the quantum dynamics within a simplified model which yields analytical conditions for the parameters of the pulses that lead to strong molecular orientation sustainable for hundreds of picoseconds. These analytical predictions are largely confirmed by a full numerical time-dependent study of the orientation process for NaI molecules. Further strategies for increasing and maintaining the molecular orientation are proposed and numerically illustrated. Our finite-temperature calculations demonstrate that the molecular orientation persists at considerable temperatures.

TI Public policy and legitimacy: A historical policy analysis of the
   interplay of public policy and legitimacy
SO POLICY SCIENCES
LA English
DT Article
ID PERSPECTIVE; KNOWLEDGE
AB This article explores the interplay of local government policy and legitimacy from a broad postpositivist perspective where historical accounts and narratives are used in a complementary fashion. The basic assumption is that legitimacy is the product of satisfying felt needs and solving perceived problems. Health and social malaise problems and related policies of the past 120 years are analyzed in 50 Swedish municipalities. The analysis indicates that municipality policies respond to local problems only partly. Generally, local government policies responded dynamically to 'objective' and perceived problems before the 1970s, but did not resolve the problems. Today's legitimacy crisis could, to some extent, be explained by the discrepancy between high expectations created in the policy discourse and the central and local government's incapacity to offer sustainable solutions to ongoing problems. It is suggested that if history is considered more seriously in public policy making it could help policy makers and citizens readjust expectations, illuminate the limits and prospects for public policy, and identify ways to restore legitimacy. Moreover, legitimacy could be restored if more realistic policies are worked out and if a new division of power between the levels of government is introduced.

ID GROWTH
AB This study presents an internally consistent macroeconomic framework that could be used as a first step toward a more comprehensive quantitative and qualitative assessment of the adjustment alternatives facing Uzbekistan. The three-gap framework focuses on the major imbalances of the economy for evaluating policy choices facing Uzbekistan. It lays emphasis on both domestic and external factors that determine economic outcomes and welfare. An attempt is made to quantify two policy scenarios (gradual as against an accelerated policy implementation strategy). It turns out that an aggressive adjustment policy would indeed improve most performance and welfare indicators. Two major ingredients of such an aggressive adjustment strategy are the unification of the exchange rate and implementation of current account convertibility in the balance of payments. The study also draws attention to the relative importance of external financing and the sustainability of the balance of payments under alternative structural adjustment paths facing Uzbekistan.

ID ONTOLOGIES
AB The development of realistic computer-generated synthetic environments, also called distributed virtual environments, relies heavily upon computer-generated actors (CGAs) to provide accurate behaviors at reasonable cost so that the synthetic environments are useful, affordable, complex, and high fidelity. Unfortunately, the pace of synthetic environment development and the level of desired CGA performance continue to rise at a much faster rate than CGA capability improvements. This insatiable demand for realism in CGAs for synthetic environments arises from the growing understanding of the. significant role that modeling and simulation can play in a variety of uses. These uses include training, analysis, procurement decisions, mission rehearsal, doctrine development, force-level and task-level training, information assurance, cyberwarfare, force structure analysis, sustainability analysis, life cycle costs analysis, material management, infrastructure analysis, and many other uses. In these and other uses of military synthetic environments, CGAs play a central role because they have the potential to increase the realism of the environment while also reducing the cost of operating the environment. The progress made in addressing the technical challenges that must be overcome to realize effective and realistic CGAs for military simulation environments and the technical areas that should be the focus of future work are the subject of this paper, which surveys the technologies and progress made in the construction and use of CGAs. In this, the third installment in the series of papers discussing CGAs, we conclude our discussion of CGA technologies by concluding the discussion of human behavior modeling for CGAs, and we present some suggested future research directions for CGA technologies.

DE transport management; transport planning
AB The rapidly increasing level of car ownership and usage in Ireland is resulting in progressively more traffic congestion throughout the country. Traffic management teams are examining ways of reducing traffic density as part of a broader transportation policy. However, there are currently very limited statistics on travel patterns in Ireland. Secondary school children travel to and from school at peak traffic flow periods, adding significantly to local traffic congestion and pollution. In order to explore ways of minimising vehicle density around and on the approach roads to schools, the travel patterns of secondary school children in Ireland were investigated by means of a classroom-based survey. Two schools were studied: one in a rural location in County Leitrim and the other in Dublin. There was no difference between the three age groups studied, although significant differences in travel patterns were observed between the schools. Recommendations as to how school travel in Ireland could be made more sustainable are presented. The benefits gained from the inclusion of travel plans into the existing green schools programme are considerable both in terms of reducing accident rates and reducing car usage, which in turn have positive environmental and social impacts.

DE hydrology & water resource; water supply
AB Domestic and industrial water demands have been the dominant factors in the management of the waiter resources in Trinidad, and its irrigation demand has been masked by the virtual water embedded in grain imports, made possible by a vibrant economy underpinned by oil and gas. This has led to an illusion of food security. Moreover, considering the island's ample land and water resources, its dependence on imported grain is unfortunate, since rice and corn can be grown locally. This neglect of agriculture, which has historical roots, is evident by about 37% of the arable land being unused and less than 2% of arable land being under irrigation. Against this background, the island's oil and gas reserves are expected to be depleted, at current rates of production, in about 10 and 60 years respectively. These possibilities raise concerns about the sustainability of grain imports and food security on the island. This technical note briefly examines these issues and shows that it should be possible for the island to achieve a large measure of food sufficiency, provided the issue of virtual water is addressed in the island's water resources planning.

DE Type I-III industrial ecology; Regional energy system; Metaphor;
   Practical model
AB Within the emerging concept of industrial ecology (IE) that belongs to the research and practical field of sustainable development (SD), the natural ecosystem evolution over time has been described as a metaphor that presents systems of type I, type II and type III ecology. Type I describes a situation when there was little life on earth and plenty of resources. In type II, the ecosystem starts to develop material cycles and energy cascades between organisms and species due to increasing amount of life and emerging scarcity of resources. In type III, the mature ecosystem stage, the system actors have developed nearly completely cyclic flows of matter, energy cascades and diverse interdependencies between them. This paper uses the metaphor in the three systems to develop practical models of type I, II and III industrial ecosystems for an economic system of heating energy and its evolution over time. First, the physical flows of matter and energy are described by using two contrasting case system characteristics, 'throughput' and 'roundput'. Throughput means linear material and energy flows. Roundput means material cycles, energy cascades and sustainable use of renewables, i.e., ecosystem type III. Second, the more structural and organisational features are considered with the characteristic of 'diversity' meaning diversity in resources, human involvement and economic actors and technology used. The case system development over time shown with our practical model of type I-III is radically different from the ecosystem evolution as described in the literature on the industrial ecosystem metaphor of type I-III. This conclusion as a research result, however, is tentative, because of the fuzzy and vague meaning assigned to a metaphor and its confusion with a practical model of industrial development in the industrial ecology literature.

TI Local vulnerability as an advantage: mangrove forest management in Para

SO REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE

   Environmental conservation; Illegal logging
AB When ecosystems are threatened or scientific knowledge of the effects of human action is uncertain, legislative prohibition is often adopted. This paper examines how the criminalization of mangrove tree use affects ecosystem management outcomes. We explore the biological, economic and social sustainability effects of the legal ban on mangrove use on the coast of Braganc, a, Para, north Brazil. There are two main categories of mangrove users in this area: firstly, local subsistence users who also derive some financial incomes from mangrove sale. Their mangrove use is intertwined with household livelihood strategies and they display self-initiated planning and action towards sustainable management; secondly, more "mobile", purely commercial users who are responsible for most commercial mangrove exploitation and who employ regionally sequential, predatory resource exploitation strategies. These users are typically based at some distance from the exploited areas and share neither local livelihood strategies nor sustainability agendas. The current outright ban on any utilization of mangrove flora seems to undermine biological sustainability, is economically inefficient and generates normative insecurity, conflict and social polarization. The ineffectiveness of the outright legal prohibition of mangrove tree use in terms of sustainable coastal management leads us to investigate alternative management options. We suggest that the legalization of local mangrove utilization and the strengthening of local users' rights and responsibilities to control outsiders in a co-management framework, as proposed in the Brazilian extractive reserves (RESEX) approach, is most likely to advance ecologically, economically and socially sustainable mangrove management. It is demonstrated that a legal recognition of local entitlements to mangrove trees would reduce social vulnerability and therefore move forest management outcomes into more desirable directions.

AB To meet Turkey's growing energy demand, the installed electric power capacity of 27.8 GW in 2001 has to be doubled by 2010 and increased fourfold by 2020. The difference between Turkey's total primary energy supply (TPES) of from its own sources and total final consumption (TFC) is projected grow from 1 quad (1.06-2.06) in 1999 to 5.71 quads (2.79-8.5) in 2020 (1 quad = 293.071 TWh). Turkey's limited amount of fossil fuels has a present average ratio of proved reserves of 97.38 quads to production rate of 3.2 quads yr(-1) of about 30 years. Turkey's reliance on fossil fuel-based energy systems to meet the growing demand is most likely to exacerbate the issues of energy insecurity, national environmental degradation, and global climate change in increasing proportions. Economically-feasible renewable energy potential in Turkey is estimated at a total of ca. 1.69 quads yr(-1) (495.4 TWh yr(-1)) with the potential for 0.67 quads yr(-1) (196.7 TWh yr(-1)) of biomass energy, 0.42 quads yr(-1) (124 TWh yr(-1)) of hydropower, 0.35 quads yr(-1) (102.3 TWh yr(-1)) of solar energy, 0.17 quads yr(-1) (50 TWh yr(-1)) of wind energy, and 0.08 quads yr(-1) (22.4 TWh yr(-1)) of geothermal energy. Pursuit and implementation of sustainability-based energy policy could provide about 90 and 35% of Turkey's total energy supply and consumption projected in 2010, respectively. Utilization of renewable energy technologies for electricity generation would necessitate about 23.2 Mha (29.8%) of Turkey's land resources. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In Greece, the construction industry has been developing rapidly over the past decades and the Olympic Games that, will be held in Athens in 2004 have made this development even more intense. The stream of construction and demolition (C&D) waste must be dealt with special attention because of the shortage of landfill space for disposal and the various dangerous substances contained in it, which, can potentially affect the environment and human life if not managed properly. The working group of the NTUA was provided with a grant by Eurostat in order to collect data and illustrate the current status in the country in regards to C&D waste. This paper presents the results of the study and analyses the generation sources, the estimated quantities of C&D waste as well as the current waste management practices in Greece. Recommendations are made in order to deal with this problem effectively and promote sustainable waste management solutions such as reuse and recycling. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.

ID PONDEROSA PINE; ECOSYSTEMS; NITROGEN; FIRE
AB Effects of a wildfire on soil chemical and physical properties in a Nothofagus glauca (Phil.) Krasser forest in the Coastal Mountain Range of south-central Chile were investigated. Response of the soil during the first two years following a wildfire was examined, where data from soil in a burned forest were compared to that in an adjacent, unburned stand. The effects that wildfire have on soil properties in this highly fragmented ecosystem are not well understood, but results from this study suggest similar responses to those found in other mediterranean forest systems. Both physical (bulk density, percent soil moisture, and soil organic matter content) and chemical properties (exchangeable inorganic nitrogen, extractable phosphorus, exchangeable potassium, and soil pH) were examined, and data presented here suggest that soil properties vary in their initial response to fire in this ecosystem. Soil organic matter content and soil moisture decreased following fire and remained lower than values from unburned plots for the duration of the study. Exchangeable potassium increased initially after burning, but values in burned plots decreased with time and by the end of two years were significantly lower than in unburned soil. In turn, extractable phosphorus and soil pH both increased immediately following wildfire and values in burned plots remained significantly higher than unburned plots for the entire measurement period. Exchangeable inorganic nitrogen reached higher levels in soil of burned plots for the autumn measurements (April 1997 and 1998) and lower values in burned plots for the spring measurements (November 1997 and 1998). Soil bulk density remained unchanged following fire. In general, changes in soil properties following fire were greatest at the 0-5 cm layer and more modest at the 510 cm sampling depth. These changes were related primarily to oxidation of the detrital layer during fire and concurrent changes in the soil environment following fire (e.g., a reduction in organic matter content of the soil, decreased soil moisture, and increased soil pH). The results of this study have implications for the productivity and sustainable management of the native forest remnants in this region.

AB This paper discusses past and present approaches to managing tsetse-transmitted animal trypanosomosis in Africa and describes the three, main weaknesses of these approaches, i.e., inappropriate objectives, inadequate links between research and policy-making and a lack of recognition that trypanosomosis should be high up on the social science research agenda. Making progress in managing trypanosomosis has been difficult and the authors argue that the weaknesses of the approaches must be corrected if Africa is to benefit from the few advances made so far, and for the continent to make further sustained efforts to combat the disease. The authors explain that this can be achieved by replacing the current widespread preoccupation among researchers and policymakers with controlling (or eradicating) trypanosomosis with a focus on managing (or coping with) the disease. In addition, ways of achieving greater coherence between research and policy-making must be explored. Finally, the social science issues raised by the question of which practical steps need to be taken to manage trypanosomosis in Africa should be placed at the forefront of research efforts.

AB Sustainability aims to harmonise life on Earth without compromising the essential natural resources that should be the birthright of future generations. 'Sustainable medicine' (SM) is just one component of the wide range of possible sustainable approaches to peaceful co-existence. Sustainable medicine envisions an uncomplicated system of maintaining the health of people and animals, both now and for many years to come. This type of medicine is based on ancient wisdom, knowledge and healing arts, combined with the advantages and technical achievements of modern science and other areas of medicine; it is an integrated approach to preventive, safe and affordable healing.
   The term sustainable medicine also implies that the main therapeutic materials used in the course of practising this type of medicine can be replaced or replenished with minimal environmental damage after harvesting. The aim of sustainable medicine is to maintain the balance of nature, allowing an estimated 7 to 100 million species of life forms to co-exist and reproduce, and to sustain the long-term future of this planet.
   The world is in the midst of an environmental crisis: anthropogenic environmental damage in the last century was greater than in any previous century. One of the major concerns is the misuse of medicines, and the resulting immune depletion in people and animals. Many traditional medical systems have taught that appropriate adaptation by, and of, an effective defence system is the key to health and survival. This is only possible if priority is given to a preventive rather than a curative approach to health care; the very same approach that is advocated by proponents of SM: an approach based on proper diagnosis and the use of personalised, tailor-made medicine.
   The authors propose SM (the combination of the advantages of modern, traditional and complementary medical systems) as the best approach to providing better health care services for people and animals. The article presents a brief history of traditional medicines and outlines strategies for developing SM. The authors highlight some important factors in the development of SM in animal health care and attempt to encourage veterinarians to adopt a sustainable approach to treating animals.

AB Concerns about biodiversity and sustainability extend to many ecological systems, including large river systems that are highly modified by human activities. The Mississippi River is one such system that is currently regulated for navigational and flood control purposes, bears a large agricultural nutrient load, and has experienced rapid spread of the exotic zebra mussel, Dreissena polymorpha, since 1991. Human development of the extensive watershed system of the Mississippi River is ongoing and is expected to lead to further changes in river ecology. This study tested whether stable isotope compositions of the zebra mussel could help identify watershed and tributary loading of carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and sulphur (S) to the mainstem river. Zebra mussels were collected seasonally in the lower Mississippi River at Baton Rouge in 1997, and along most of the length of the river in a north-south transect from Minnesota to Louisiana during August 1998. Results showed substantial seasonal variations in C, N and S isotopic compositions of 2parts per thousand or greater, but also that seasonal changes appeared regular and linked to changing watershed inputs and chemistry of the river water. Nitrate was the dominant N nutrient in the Mississippi River, but isotope analyses showed that food webs based on ammonium rather than nitrate were likely important for the zebra mussel. Results from the north-south transect followed expectations based on mixing of mainstem river water with tributaries that had different chemistries, so that local zones of influence were detectable in the combined CNS zebra mussel isotopes downstream of major tributary confluences for the Illinois, Missouri and Ohio Rivers. Overall, the study supports use of stable isotopes to help monitor watershed development and downstream effects on aquatic food webs. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

AB Sustainability in the development and manufacture of new products is a strategy that is widely accepted in principle, although not yet widely practiced. The integration of environmental requirements throughout the entire lifetime of a product needs a new way of thinking and new decision tools to be applied. This paper describes the concept of an approach to product development, based on a paradigm for sustainable manufacturing. Four examples of methodologies and decision tools are discussed, representing the most important sources of environmental impacts of a product. The emphasis lies on the integrating concept rather than on the details of the methodologies. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) is a chronic pain condition of the musculoskeletal system defined by criteria of the American College of Rheumatology in 1990. Despite this definition, etiology and pathogenesis of FMS are still unknown, and consequently the therapy aims mainly at relieving symptoms. The favourite hypothesis is a multietiological concept including genetic, central nervous, muscular, and psychological issues. This article focuses on current psychological aspects as to etiology, process of chronification, and therapy of FMS. Regarding etiology there are diverging hypotheses rather than a general agreement, e.g. specific personality traits, traumatic events, psychodynamic explanations on the basis of a depressive conflict, or the subsumption under somatoform disorders. However, psychological aspects are evident to influence the course and treatment of FMS. In the chronification process behavioural aspects like avoidance behaviour with subsequent physical impairment, attitudes towards subjective theories of illness and therapeutic options, social factors like effects on work, interpersonal conditioning, and coping strategies play an important role. Therapeutic options of FMS comprise exercise,drugs,and psychotherapy. An integrated approach combining these options,a sustainable doctor-patient relationship, and a continuous support of the patient seem to be beneficial.

DE Sichuan; degree of disturbance; soil and water loss; system innovation
AB Ten major factors have been selected to judge the degree of disturbance from human activity and the corresponding relationship of the impact on soil and water loss in Sichuan Province. Correlation analysis has demonstrated that stock-carrying capacity, percentage of land reclamation, population density, GDP per capita, mineral modulus and percentage of forest coverage are the 6 most relevant human activity factors. The analysis on the degree of disturbance has shown that population pressure, excessive or unreasonable activities in development of resources and destructive behavior of humans are the main causes of soil and water loss. Consequently, solving the various problems in the negative activity of humans and regulating human behavior are the first tasks that should be tackled in the conservation of water and soil. In the new era, the prevention and rectification of soil and water loss are measures based on the foundation of the ecosystem, which is a kind of management strategy for sustainable development. The foundation of this method is made up of the system innovations and breakthroughs in terms of aims, philosophy, measures, and aspects of the prevention and rectification of soil and water loss, simultaneous advance from the conceptual, policy, spatial, technical and mode levels and system integration on the treatment strategies.

AB This paper describes a mean field approach to defining and implementing policy-based system administration. The concepts of regulation and optimization are used to define the notion of maintenance. These are then used to evaluate stable equilibria of system configuration, that are associated with sustainable policies for system management. Stable policies are thus associated with fixed points of a mapping that describes the evolution of the system. In general, such fixed points are the solutions of strategic games. A consistent system policy is not sufficient to guarantee compliance; the policy must also be implementable and maintainable. The paper proposes two types of model to understand policy driven management of Human-Computer systems: (i) average dynamical descriptions of computer system variables which provide a quantitative basis for decision, and (ii) competitive game theoretical descriptions that select optimal courses of action by generalizing the notion of configuration equilibria. It is shown how models can be formulated and simple examples are given. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Since independence in 1922, the Irish economy has gone from being one of the poorest in Europe in the 1980s to double-figure growth rates in the 1990s, prompting comparisons with the "tiger" economies of the Pacific Rim. Opinions vary about the extent to which this growth is sustainable and whether it has alleviated poverty increased inequality, or indeed done both. This article argues that the "Celtic tiger" in modern Ireland offers rich opportunities for multidisciplinary study of the construction of the postcolonial image of "nation."

TI Colombia's democratic security agenda: Public order in the security
   tripod
SO SECURITY DIALOGUE
LA English
DT Article
AB Colombia's current democratic security policy aims to re-establish internal order and to protect the civilian population from the depredations of illegal, armed organizations, within a framework of rights and protections related to the rule of law. Although the government distinguishes its 'get tough' strategy, which has been developed within institutional parameters, from previous national security approaches, in which unchecked powers led to abuses against society, the actual policy content continues to privilege a conventional military approach to security problems. Given the critical levels of violence and instability in Colombia, however, I suggest that the overall strategic orientation that emphasizes law, order, and state authority over institutional strengthening is appropriate in the short run. A comprehensive, viable security model must incorporate the three dimensions of physical safety for society and state, institutional guarantees, and socioeconomic development, yet complex security emergencies such as Colombia's warrant prioritizing the public order component of the security tripod. The challenge for the Colombian government will be to move forward quickly with second-order institutional reforms and social development programs so as to legitimate its security policies and make them sustainable in the mid and long term.

AB Organizations in the peacebuilding field face the imperative of taking a holistic, integrated approach to peacebuilding that combines traditionally distinct disciplines such as human rights, humanitarian assistance, sustainable development, environment, conflict resolution, security, and the rule of law in order to be effective in today's complex conflicts. The concept of a Network of Effective Action is proposed as a set of practices for collaboration that is capable of facilitating integrated approaches to peacebuilding both on the ground and in terms of the theoretical development of the field.

AB Knowledge Management (KM) is becoming a growing concern in management research and practice because of its role in determining firm innovation capability and in enhancing working life quality of knowledge workers. This requires, even for Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) the creation of a sustainable work organization in terms of configuration of organizational and Information and Communication Technology (ICT) tools. With a particular emphasis in the area of Product Innovation (PI) and on the basis of a survey on 127 Italian SMEs, this paper aims at analysing the emergent technological and organizational approaches to managing knowledge in the PI process. Three different KM Configurations emerge: the 'technical', the 'relational' and the 'advanced' approach.

TI The burden of traditional practices, ebino and tea-tea, on child health
   in Northern Uganda
SO SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
DE ebino; tea-tea; hospital; Africa
ID FALSE-TEETH; MORTALITY; DISEASE; BELIEFS
AB Traditional medical practices persist today in Northern Uganda; for example, the operations of ebino and tea-tea are frequently performed in childhood. Ebino, or "false teeth", refers to gingival swellings during the eruption of the primary canine teeth in infants, and consists of the extraction of deciduous canine tooth buds. Tea-tea consists of systematic cuts made on the chest wall when the child has difficulty in breathing. The objectives Of this Study are to describe the morbidity and mortality related to complications arising from the ebino and tea-tea procedures among children admitted to the paediatric ward of St. Mary's Hospital Lacor in 1999, and to estimate the prevalence of ebino and tea-tea among children aged 0-4 years attending, for any cause, the child welfare department (CWD) of the hospital. The prevalence survey consisted of the examination of 1,995 children attending CWD during a four-week period in 1999 to look for missing primary canine teeth (ebino), and for "therapeutic" cuts on the chest wall (tea-tea). I it the difficult context of war and social disruption prevailing in Northern Uganda, Sustainable methods of data collection and analysis should be utilised to support evidence-based decision-making.

TI Changing local modes of economic and environmental governance in
   England: A tale of two areas
SO SOCIAL SCIENCE QUARTERLY
LA English
DT Article
ID URBAN REGIMES; AGENDA; POLICY
AB Objectives. Using an urban regime theory approach, the article aims to investigate the degree to which environmental policy in England is devolved to the local level of the state and integrates with local economic governance. Methods. Intensive case study research was undertaken in two local areas of the eastern region of England having divergent economic growth trajectories. Methods included analysis of local media and documentation from local and regional organizations, and 30 primary interviews with strategic local actors. Results. The Cambridge Subregion area is experiencing pressures of economic development, creating conflict around the Green Belt and contested meanings of sustainable development. In Waveney-a declining area in search of growth-local groups have struggled to manage local economic regeneration in an environmentally sustainable manner. Both areas have witnessed new territorial-institutional developments in relation to environmental policy making, with limited evidence of policy integration at the subregional scale. Conclusion. Despite the emphasis on local policy integration through sustainable development, the relationship between the economy and the environment in England is a focus of conflict and new territorial-institutional developments. Urban regime theory needs to broaden its focus to include the full variety of interests in local environmental policy and the mechanisms producing new territorial scales of economic and environmental governance.

AB The rate of development of topsoil is an important characteristic for soil resilience and sustainable use. We located a chronosequence (1-59 yr) of recovering landslip scars in erodible siltstone hill country under permanent pasture for sheep farming in New Zealand. We measured the rates of recovery in microbial C, respiration, catabolic diversity, phosphatase, sulphatase and invertase activities, pH, total C, total N, C/N ratio, potentially mineralizable N, total P, Olsen P, cation-exchange capacity, bulk density, particle density, porosity, available water and aggregate stability (0-10 cm depth). A subset of the same sites was sampled again after a 14-yr interval, enabling us to test whether rates of change estimated by resampling the same sites were the same as those estimated from a single time sample from the chronosequence (the space-for-time hypothesis).
   Most topsoil characteristics had recovered to 71-85% of those in the non-slipped sites after 59 yr. Exceptions were soil respiration, invertase and sulphatase activities, and bulk density, which recovered to 94-110% of the values of the non-slipped sites. There was little change in soil pH, total P, Olsen P, exchangeable cations and water storage along the chronosequence. An asymptote model fitted the patterns of recovery in biochemical characteristics, organic matter, bulk density and particle density. Recovery (to 90% of the asymptote value) was most rapid for the C/N ratio (5 yr) and longest for particle density (79 yr); most other characteristics fell in an 18-50 yr range. Overall, a single sampling of a chronosequence of matched landslip scars was as reliable to estimate rates of recovery as was resampling individual sites through time. Total C and N were as effective as more complicated biochemical measures to monitor the recovery of topsoil. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Soil management practices affect soil microbial communities, which in turn influence soil ecosystem processes. In this study, the effects of conventional- (fall disking, chiseling and spring disking, field cultivation) and no-tillage practices on soil microbial communities were examined under long-term continuous cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) systems on a Decatur silt loam soil. Soil samples were taken in February, May, and October of 2000 at depths of 0-3, 3-6, 6-12, and 12-24 cm. Compared to the conventional -till treatment, the no-till treatment increased soil organic carbon and total nitrogen contents in the surface layer by 130 and 70%, respectively. Microbial biomass C content under no-till treatment was 60, 140, and 75% greater than under conventional -till treatment in February, May, and October, respectively. Principal components analysis of phospholipid ester-linked fatty acid (PLFA) profile indicated soil microbial communities shifted over time and with soil depth. This change appeared to be driven primarily by soil bacterial populations as indicated by the major PLFA contributors (i.e. fatty acids 16:0, 10Me16:0, cy19:0, 16:1 20H, and i15:0) to the first two principal components. Tillage treatment differences were revealed by analysis of variance on the first principal components (PC 1), which accounted for 62% of the total sample variance, and by the relative abundance of selected PLFAs and PLFA ratios. The impact of tillage practices was significant in February and May, but not in October. During the growing season, changes in the microbial community may be primarily determined by soil conditions responding to cotton growth and environmental variables such as moisture and temperature; during fallow or prior to cotton establishment, community changes associated with tillage practices become more pronounced. These findings have implications for understanding how conservation tillage practices improve soil quality and sustainability in a cotton cropping system. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Vadose zone hydrology in the eastern Palouse Basin of northern Idaho is poorly understood because loess deposits often contain multiple hydraulically restrictive horizons that impede water flow. Valley soilscapes are of particular interest from a hydrologic perspective, because during the winter months, most of the precipitation is redistributed as runoff and throughflow into these landscape positions. Understanding the relationship between near-surface perched water table dynamics and vadose zone hydraulic processes in valley soilscapes is necessary to assess the sustainability of the groundwater resource. We implemented a combined approach to assess hydrologic processes in valley positions using hydrometric measurements, natural tracers, and stratigraphic observations. Hydrographs of near-surface monitoring wells indicate that valley positions maintain a thicker zone of saturation for longer duration compared with adjacent upland positions. Deep tensiometers demonstrate that multiple zones of seasonal saturation develop within the vadose zone of valley soilscapes in response to paleosol fragipan horizons and sediments of contrasting hydraulic conductivity. In some instances, the saturated thickness of vadose zone water tables was greater than 2.0 m and, because they are confined, displayed a positive pressure head. On adjacent uplands, seasonal saturation occurs only above the uppermost fragipan. Eluvial horizons having low Mud correspond to zones of saturation, whereas aquitards reflect Mn-d maxima. The recharge rate calculated using natural Cl- mass balance was 2.4 mm y(-1) and did not correspond to measurements of saturated thickness by tensiometers. In addition, natural chloride profiles of other valley soilscapes display differences in recharge rates according to regional patterns in soil development. Together, deep tensiometer readings, secondary Mn distributions, and Cl- profiles suggest that groundwater recharge does not occur via piston flow. Detailed stratigraphic analysis illustrates that preferential flow is a possible recharge mechanism. Results suggest that valley soilscapes play an important role in both surficial and deep regolith hydrological processes in the Palouse Basin.

AB To determine the effects of low-input agriculture on soil properties, we compared several forms of arable land management in a rotation experiment lasting 8 years on a Cambisol in Lithuania. Conventional arable cropping with applications of inorganic fertilizers increased the potassium (K) status of the soil, but resulted in losses of nitrogen (N) from the soil by mineralization and leaching. With ley-arable integrated cropping, a similar fertilizer regime based on farmyard manure (FYM) augmented with inorganic fertilizers increased the phosphorus (P), K, organic matter and N in the soil, as well as increasing N loss by leaching. These two high-input regimes were compared to three systems with less or no input. A reference treatment with no input, which produced small crop yields, maintained its nutrient status and organic matter. An organic regime receiving FYM and green manure lost only P, but maintained its K and N status, while a second organic regime in which the FYM was replaced by composted sewage maintained its fertility. The microbial activity varied somewhat from treatment to treatment, with the largest numbers of almost all groups of microorganisms in the reference treatment. All treatments led to decreases in fulvic acid, and the soil managed conventionally lost humic acid, too. The content of humic acid increased in the treatments where FYM was applied and in the reference soil, and the fraction bound to calcium increased in the integrated and the first organic treatments. The soil structures under the integrated cropping and second organic regime were the most stable. Of the low-input systems, the second organic regime seemed the most sustainable.

The difference between amounts of nutrients leached by percolation and those supplied by irrigation indicated that 25-130 kg ha(-1) Ca, 8-24 kg ha(-1) Mg, from -1 to 9 kg ha(-1) K, and 8-17 kg ha(-1) Fe, respectively, were lost each year from the 0-40 cm soil layer during rice cultivation, when the supply from fertilization and rainfall and the loss in grain harvest were not accounted for. When the supply of K from rainfall and the loss in grain harvest were taken into account, a total K loss of about 10 kg ha(-1) was estimated. The electrical neutrality of inorganic ions in the percolating water was always maintained. From these results we estimate that the amounts of exchangeable Ca and Mg in the soil to a depth of 40 cm would decrease by 50% within 50-260 and 30-100 years, respectively, if similar management were continued without fertilization. The total amount of carbon dioxide (SigmaCO(2)) leached in percolating water during the period of rice cultivation was 120-325 kg C ha(-1), which corresponded to 0.47-0.94% of the soil organic carbon to 40 cm depth.

ID SUSTAINABLE LAND MANAGEMENT
AB Hierarchical crop growth models can contribute significantly to land quality research because the yield gap between the estimated optimum and the actual crop production has been identified as a major land quality indicator. This study describes a three-level, hierarchical crop production model, simulating radiation-thermal, water-limited and natural production potentials of annual crops. Input requirements have been kept low to ensure its applicability to developing regions, which often have access only to limited data. The simplicity of this model also has disadvantages: inconsistencies have been reported when applying this model in semiarid regions, which are characterized by very irregular rainfall patterns. Revision of the water balance, which simulates the availability of water, was required. The modified model was validated using the experimental yields of maize and sunflower in Guquka, a semiarid region of South Africa. Yields were estimated very well, possible improvements to crop production were identified and implications for land-use planning highlighted. Yield gap analysis revealed that radiation, sunshine and temperature are favourable for crop production, but the heavy dependence on rainfall makes the region very vulnerable to drought, with devastating impact on yields. The generally low chemical soil fertility further reduces crop performance.

AB Study design: Description of a clinical service, evaluation of pressure relief practices.
   Objectives: To describe a specialist seating assessment clinic and a change in clinical practice arising from its work.
   Setting: National Spinal Injuries Centre, Stoke Mandeville Hospital, UK.
   Methods: Retrospective review of the ischial transcutaneous oxygen measurements of 50 newly injured and chronic spinal cord-injured (SCI) individuals seen in a specialist seating assessment clinic. Tissue oxygenation was measured in the sitting position (loaded) and during pressure relief (unloaded).
   Results: Mean duration of pressure relief required to raise tissue oxygen to unloaded levels was 1 min 51 s (range 42 s-3 min 30 s).
   Conclusion: These results confirmed the clinical perception that brief pressure lifts of 15-30 s are ineffective in raising transcutaneous oxygen tension (TcPO2) to the unloaded level for most individuals. Sustaining the traditional pressure relief by lifting up from the seat for the necessary extended duration is neither practical nor desirable for the majority of clients. It was found that alternative methods of pressure relief were more easily sustainable and very efficient.

AB In the new millennium, and in its global economy, everybody will have to be very competitive and hence innovative. For this reason most humans, economies, and businesses must innovate our understanding of economics in all areas and levels of human activity. The new challenges require a thorough innovation of work, including a requisitely(3) holistic consideration of sustainable development (SD). In our contribution we would like to shift attention from a principle-based moralizing about relations between the sustainable development and enterprises to a very practical issue: how to support a more requisitely holistic understanding of SD from business viewpoints. The most important or most frequent issues of a new understanding and implementation of SD include the following: SD requires holism, hence professional and political aspects in synergy, hence systems thinking; SD requires linking of different approaches to problem solving; businesses should no longer forget about SD; ISO, etc., standards are not holistic enough concepts to solve all SD problems; A more requisitely holistic methodology is needed for implementation of SD in business. We offer some new suggestions.

TI Effects of ISO 9000 certification on firms' performance: a vision from
   the market
SO TOTAL QUALITY MANAGEMENT & BUSINESS EXCELLENCE

ID TOTAL QUALITY MANAGEMENT; PRICE PERFORMANCE; INDUSTRIES; IMPACT; AWARDS
AB As the number of ISO 9000-registered companies increases over time, it seems that the certification constitutes a prerequisite for success in business. Companies could interpret the registration as the way to obtain sustainable competitive advantages, but is it true? How is the registration interpreted by the market? Do markets assume that certified companies will get more benefits than non-certified? Some papers have tried to answer these questions by studying the pros and cons of the registration and by analysing the impact the certification has had over some financial results. However, few works have tried to analyse the effects from the point of view of the market. If investors think the ISO 9000 series will allow the company to get more benefits, then assuming the market is efficient, at the date that the company gets the certification, the information will be rapidly expanded and incorporated into the price of its stocks, which will presumably rise. This paper documents the stock price performance of a sample of Spanish companies certified by AENOR. The methodology of Event studies is applied to investigate whether the market interprets the registration of a company as a signal of its better future performance. After applying parametric and non-parametric tests, we do not find clear evidence to affirm that the market values positively ISO 9000 registration.

ID DOMESTIC DOGS; IDENTITY; DIMENSIONS
AB Images on brochures, web pages and postcards lead to an expectation by tourists and visitors that interaction with Dingoes (Canis lupus Dingo) will be part of their Fraser Island experience. Yet, as the number of tourists to the island increase, so do the reports of Dingo attacks. The first recorded death from such an attack on Fraser Island occurred in April 2001, and was immediately followed by a government-ordered cull of Dingoes. This paper explores issues surrounding both this decision and the management strategies implemented afterwards. Based on interviews with a variety of stakeholders, many conflicting perspectives on human-wildlife interaction as a component of tourism are identified. The conclusion is drawn that while strategies for managing Dingoes are essential, if such attacks are a consequence of humans feeding wildlife and resultant wildlife habituation, then strategies for managing people are also necessary for this example of wildlife tourism to be both successful and sustainable.

AB Many decisions taken by mankind are rational only to a limited extent. This holds for individual travel behaviour, but also for long-range strategic decisions on transport systems or transport technology. In any decision problem, coping with uncertainty is the most critical element. The introduction of new transport technology is surrounded by uncertainty. For example, there is uncertainty about the pace and extent of adoption of new technology and there is uncertainty about the impact of new technology in terms of increased sustainability or increased efficiency. This article maps uncertainty surrounding new transport technology and identifies ways in which to deal with uncertainty in policy making. The findings will be illustrated with electric vehicles, particularly with two specific strategies to deal with uncertainty: interactive technology watching and experimentation in a market niche. The paper concludes with a discussion of success factors that influence the outcomes of such strategies.

AB Foot and mouth disease (FMD) is a highly contagious viral disease of even-toed ungulates and is endemic in most of the tropics. A cross-sectional study using a stratified, two-stage random sample design was undertaken in the Adamawa Province of Cameroon. The objectives were to measure the reported herd-level prevalence of FMD and a range of husbandry practices important for its transmission. The owner-reported prevalence for the previous 12 months was 57.9% (50.4-65.4%), although there was a significant variation across the Province. During the previous dry season, 46.5% (38.6-54.4%) of herds had gone on transhumance. Herds had high numbers of contacts with other herds while on transhumance (98.6%), at pasture (95.8%) and at night (74.4%), with medians of 7-10, 4-6 and 1-3 daily contacts, respectively. The high level of endemic FMD and potential for disease spread presents a significant challenge for control and eradication. Locally sustainable methods need to be developed upon which larger regional control programmes could be built in the future.

AB The study was conducted to examine the fertility status of crossbred dairy cows in mixed crop-livestock production (MCLP), market-oriented specialized dairy production (MSDP) and urban dairy production (UDP) systems, including the Holetta Agricultural Research Center (HARC). Data on general farm management variables and reproductive histories were collected from study farms by questionnaire and from individual cow records. Age at first service and age at first calving were 29.58 months (n = 424) and 40.6 months (n = 348), respectively. Cows managed under UDP were younger at first service and at first calving (p<0.05). The mean intervals from calving to first service and to conception were 141.98 days (n = 284) and 185.02 days (n = 219), respectively. The mean calving interval for cows was 551.82 days (n = 258). Cows in MCLP had longer intervals from calving to first service and to conception and longer calving intervals than those managed under MSDP, UDP and HARC. First service conception rate (43.42%), number of services per conception (1.75) and pregnancy rate (79.29%) did not differ significantly between production systems. Reproductive performance was best in UDP followed by HARC and MSDP. The difference between MCLP and the rest points to particular difficulties in that system. To improve reproductive performance and economic benefit, there should be conservative stocking rate, sensible year-round feeding, a herd health plan, and sustainable extension service.

AB Improved forages play an important role in sustaining the livelihoods of small- and medium-scale farmers in the tropics, mainly as a result of their positive effects on livestock production and contribution to economic and environmental sustainability. However, in many regions of the tropics, the potential of forages for sustainable development is largely untapped and adoption of forage legumes in particular has so far been limited. In general, compared with forage legumes, grasses are often better known as cultivated species by farmers, are more resilient and have broad environmental adaptation. Currently, farmers have limited understanding of the benefits of leguminous species that can be used on their farms.
   This paper explores reasons for the lack of wider adoption of improved forages and suggests pathways and strategies to meet the needs , of smallholder farmers more effectively. Close linkages between farmers, researchers and extension workers are essential for both the development and diffusion of improved multipurpose grass and legume species. In this context, the importance of developing functional seed-delivery systems is emphasised. However, continuous development of forage germplasm to respond to existing and evolving constraints and changing demands and opportunities is mandatory to ensure wide adoption of improved forages by smallholder farmers.

AB Successful adoption of forage technology is frequently associated with a need to increase production and income generation. Farmers might be expected to 'demand' new forages only when they can see a financial benefit in the short-medium term. Opportunities for farmers to generate income from livestock production are increasing dramatically as demand for animal products increases across Asia and Africa. Most of this increased demand will be met from mixed cropping-livestock enterprises, in which the majority of tropical livestock are currently raised and where production is usually dependent on low-quality crop residues. Forage research in the future will Deed to provide farmers with the means to meet the increased demand for livestock products. The challenge will be to develop research strategies that identify well adapted forages that can improve livestock production and can be grown within the spatial and temporal constraints of complex and resource-limited mixed cropping-livestock farming systems; in addition, it will be necessary to provide appropriate information on the management and economic benefits of these forages. This paper presents 2 possible approaches.
   In a participatory action research program on the use of forage legumes in cropping systems in Zimbabwe, the keys to successful forage adoption in rural communities are seen as: the emerging market for livestock products; a motivated and educated extension service working with a range of research specialists; and the opportunities for beneficial synergies to be exploited from a mixed livestock-maize production system. Focused benchmarking of the communities identified farmers with sufficient resources and appropriate livestock systems to benefit from improved forage.
   In a rice-based Indonesian farming system, simulation of forage growth and livestock production is being used to examine the possible whole-of-farm. impacts of using planted forages prior to commencement of on-farm research. Identifying the most likely spatial and temporal opportunities for growing forages and incorporating them into the feed calendar can potentially avoid costly on-farm research on practices that have doubtful economic impact; moreover, this approach enables a wide range of options to be compared rapidly.
   To avoid the mistakes of the past, researchers need to provide supporting evidence that investment in new forages makes a difference not only to livestock production but also to household income. They will need to focus on farming systems such as mixed crop-livestock systems where farmers have total control over the forage they produce and where adoption can be shown to be economically sustainable. They also need to identify and target those farmers within rural communities with the resource capacity to invest in new farming practices.

AB In Malawi, the sustainability of ruminant livestock in the smallholder farming systems setting is based on natural and planted forage. In the past, the government and commercial seed companies have attempted to produce forage seed to satisfy the demand for forage by smallholder livestock keepers. However, over time, commercial seed companies realised that it was financially unviable to produce forage seed and the supply of forage seed subsequently declined. In recent times, due to changes in livestock production systems, livestock have become a vital subsector of the agricultural sector in Malawi. This has stimulated the demand for forage by smallholder livestock keepers.
   While forage technologies are available for utilisation of pastures/forages in livestock production systems, there are constraints to adoption of these technologies by livestock keepers in Malawi. These include the scarcity and high cost of forage seed, difficulties associated with forage establishment and maintenance, inaccessibility of forage research results by the end users and lack of appreciation of the value of forage by farmers. This paper outlines the constraints and proposes possible strategies to redress the situation.

ID SOIL CONSERVATION
AB Livestock, especially ruminant, production is an important component of farming systems in upland areas of the Philippines. Moreover, since upland agriculture is becoming unsustainable because of soil erosion and productivity of crops is limited by poor soils, livestock production is a particularly valuable source of income to complement crop production. Farmers rely heavily on livestock to provide a source of savings, cash income, draft power and nutritious food. Nevertheless, scarcity and poor quality of feed are major constraints to improved livestock productivity in upland areas. Introduction of planted forages in these systems has the potential to increase substantially the quality and quantity of available forages, thus providing fodder to supplement low-quality naturally occurring forages and crop residues; concurrently, forage plants promote sustainability by improving soil quality and reducing soil erosion.
   Adoption of forages by smallholder farmers in the rainfed upland areas of the Philippines is conditioned by the dual-purpose role of forage plants. A number of forage species have been used as contour hedgerow species for the reduction of soil erosion. These include Gliricidia sepium, Leucaena leucocephala, Setaria spp., napier grass (Pennisetum purpureum) and vetiver grass (Vetiveria zizanioides). These species were chosen as hedgerow species because of their value as fodder for livestock, in addition to their roles in reducing soil erosion, controlling weed growth, and improving and stabilising fallow areas.
   A number of constraints affect the widespread adoption of forages for use as hedgerow species by smallholder farmers in the Philippine uplands. These factors include: the limited availability of seed; high mortality amongst the forage species planted; a lack of collective action; and the high initial cost of investment. Insufficient attention has been given to policy and socio-economic factors affecting adoption of forages. For example, the effects of socio-economic factors such as human capital (education, age), income and access to institutions (e.g. credit and extension) have not been studied in association with the adoption of forage species. Therefore, policy and technology options to address these issues are warranted.
   This paper uses an econometric approach (i.e. probit) to identify the factors affecting adoption of forages by smallholder fanners in the upland areas of the Philippines, using data from a survey conducted in 1996 by the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI). The survey examined farmers who had adopted contour hedgerow technology at 2 upland sites, Cebu, Visayas and Claveria, Mindanao, the Philippines.

AB This paper evaluates the influence of socioeconomic variables on participating in marketing cooperatives on the financial performance of small holder irrigation systems in Zimbabwe: use of credit, participation in labor groups, master farmer training, literacy, keeping of farm records, participation in savings clubs, and the gender of the plot holder Three smallholder irrigation management systems namely the government managed Agritex, the farmer managed community, and the informal bani (dambo) are compared. In the Agritex schemes, participating in labor groups is the only variable influencing financial performance. None of the variables studied are important on the community schemes, perhaps because unlike on Agritex schemes, where the government makes production decisions, community scheme farmers make their own decisions. In the bani schemes, marketing cooperatives, credit use, literacy, record keeping, and the gender of the plot holder are significant. The government should consider extending credit, developing sustainable production recommendations, and developing training programs directly applicable to the bani environment. The bani system achieves the most equitable income distribution and is more efficient than both the community and Agritex systems. The government policy of ignoring this system in development efforts directly contradicts the concepts of equity and efficiency.

AB The rural water supply sector in India experienced significant changes over the last three decades. Emergence of modern technologies, such as bore wells and deep tube wells, accelerated the coverage of rural areas with safe drinking water Traditional water harvesting systems were gradually neglected and centralized water management was systematically promoted. The control and ownership shifted from people to government, reducing the communities as mere end-users. Central and state governments funded entire costs of water supply without any cost recovery from community. The impacts of modernization are being felt now The supply-driven approach of water supply departments and inefficient management of key resources are resulting in poor service delivery. Over-exploitation of groundwater is resulting in the re-emergence of water-scarce villages. This situation necessitated reforms in the sector that promotes people ownership and management of resources. Studies indicate that the performance of sector reform pilot projects being implemented in 63 districts of India is not very impressive. A national increase in reforms will be successful when micro-level diversity and innovations are preserved while introducing uniformity at the macro-level. The two case studies on successful micro-level models of NGOs offer valuable lessons for a nation-wide scale-up of reforms. Re-emergence of water scarce habitations, a supply-driven approach in service delivery, the absence of community participation and cost recovery, and problems in scaling-up reforms are the primary issues identified. The three essential strategies for long-term success of the reforms and sustainability of water supply systems are: a holistic approach to water management, direct community participation in resource management, and appropriate community institutional structures.

AB Water has been identified as a crucial resource for all life, production, and development, while a lack of access to water has been linked to poverty. Governments and donors have declared a desire to use water in more efficient, equitable, and environmentally sustainable ways. These different links and objectives touch upon many disciplines and people working in and/or dependent on water: economists, sociologists, engineers, politicians, decision-makers, and other stakeholders. There exist tools to describe how water is used in a physical sense and where it is available. There are also methods to examine the multidimensional aspects of poverty. However until now there has been no tool to effectively examine the availability of water and its use toward matching social and economic goals to physical goals. This paper offers a framework for such an analysis. The Water-Poverty Accounting Framework presented here allows an analyst to effectively see how water is being used to meet different social goals such as hygiene, sanitation, irrigated production for poor farmers, and environmental demands. More importantly, this framework demonstrates the implications for (re)allocations of water when meeting social goals is deemed desirable.

   Process; water productivity
AB Multiple variables associated with agricultural sector including crop water consumption, salinity tolerance, marketing, evapotranspiration and other factors related to industrial sector, were incorporated into a multi-criteria analysis (MCA). The MCA utilized Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) which resulted in the prioritization of water use for management in the Jordan Valley. The inputs to the MCA were generated through metrological variables for the Jordan Valley for the period 1980 to 1999. Soil data and crop data were evaluated using the EVAPOT program, the KCISA program, and the ISAREG model to estimate reference evapotranspiration, crop coefficiency, crop water requirement, and calculations of water productivity for agricultural and industrial sectors. The results of the MCA make recommendations for enhancing long-term sustainability of water resources in the Jordan Valley, while allowing for water utilization and economic growth. The MCA ranked the date palm as the highest priority crop with respect to the goal of sustainable agricultural use of water Apparel manufacturing was the most sustainable industry. Overall, the industrial sector seems to perform better with regards to water productivity than the agricultural sector It can be concluded that the MCA tool and ISAREG model are potentially positive contributions to the process of decision-making for selection and ranking of alternatives for help in solving problems that include conflicting criteria.

ID BENEFIT-COST-ANALYSIS; CONTINGENT VALUATION
AB A major difficulty of conventional cost benefit analysis is that it will allow choosing an alternative among others only on the criterion of economic efficiency: that the selected project or activity has been proven to produce economic benefits over costs for the period of the project. An analysis of this kind generally does not create a problem if the costs and benefits series are easy to quantify and clearly identifiable. However, almost all projects linked with the environment are clear exceptions to this category. Many environmental projects are facing a difficulty of evaluating the success based on economic efficiency due to two reasons: ( a) environmental benefits are difficult to quantify and (b) environmental interactions that will cause severe externalities are difficult to predict. The main objective of this paper is to suggest a new method that can be used to overcome such difficulties in environmental projects. Data used in this analysis will demonstrate a practical approach to evaluate environmental projects. The evaluation proposed is different to traditional analysis in that it has been based on a large programme of primary research and has included efforts to achieve a consensus of all stakeholders, including those directly involved in project implementation.

ID HERBICIDE RESISTANCE; INHERITANCE
AB Glyphosate is a key component of weed control strategies in Australia and worldwide. Despite widespread and frequent use, evolved resistance to glyphosate is rare. A herbicide resistance model, parameterized for Lolium rigidum has been used to perform a number of simulations to compare predicted rates of evolution of glyphosate resistance under past, present and projected future use strategies. In a 30-year wheat, lupin, wheat, oilseed rape crop rotation with minimum tillage (100% shallow depth soil disturbance at sowing) and annual use of glyphosate pre-sowing, L. rigidum control was sustainable with no predicted glyphosate resistance. When the crop establishment system was changed to annual no-tillage (15% soil disturbance at sowing), glyphosate resistance was predicted in 90% of populations, with resistance becoming apparent after between 10 and 18 years when sowing was delayed. Resistance was predicted in 20% of populations after 25-30 years with early sowing. Risks of glyphosate resistance could be reduced by rotating between no-tillage and minimum-tillage establishment systems, or by rotating between glyphosate and paraquat for pre-sowing weed control. The double knockdown strategy (sequential full rate applications of glyphosate and paraquat) reduced risks of glyphosate and paraquat resistance to <2%. Introduction of glyphosate-resistant oilseed rape significantly increased predicted risks of glyphosate resistance in no-tillage systems even when the double knockdown was practised. These increased risks could be offset by high crop sowing rates and weed seed collection at harvest. When no selective herbicides were available in wheat crops, the introduction of glyphosate-resistant oilseed rape necessitated a return to a minimum-tillage crop establishment system.

AB Wetlands around the globe have been altered, degraded or lost through a wide range of human activities. A variety of conservation action have been undertaken in response to these changes, and much of this work aims to ensure: (a) the wise and sustainable use of wetland resources, (b) the maintenance of ecological character at wetland sites, and (c) that there is 'no-net-loss' of wetlands at local, national and international scales. These aims have a number of underlying assumptions about information available to underpin associated conservation action. This paper reviews a number of these assumptions and the associated research needs.

ID PERCEPTIONS
AB Many people involved in wildlife management believe that attitudes toward wildlife have recently become more "protectionist" or less "utilitarian." However, very few researchers have had the opportunity to examine data that allow analysis of such trends. The Human Dimensions Research Unit of Cornell University has archived surveys containing a standard scale to measure wildlife attitudes and values (WAVS) since 1984. This study combines data from 17 of these surveys conducted during the period 1984-1996, including responses from 7,589 stakeholders in New York State. Principal-components factor analysis indicated that attitudes about wildlife reflect 4 broad themes. The "social benefits" theme is characterized by responses to items about the appreciation and existence of wildlife. The "communication benefits" theme focuses on observing and talking about wildlife. The "problem tolerance" theme clusters around items concerning risks associated with human-wildlife interaction. The "traditional conservation" theme includes items involving management for sustainable use. A multivariate trend analysis indicated declining problem tolerance in New York, regardless of stakeholder group. Traditional conservation attitudes have gained proponents among men. Communication attitudes have been consistently high in New York, although there is evidence of a growing division of rural and nonrural residents' agreement that communication is important. Our research suggests the need for re-evaluation of the hypothesis that wildlife attitudes are evolving toward a more protectionist view.

AB Brood-parasitic cowbirds (Molothrus spp.) can severely impact host populations. Cowbird removal is the primary means of reducing parasitism. As an alternative to removal, we evaluated the reduction of cattle stocking rate as a tool to shift cowbird-breeding activity away from a breeding area of a sensitive host. Activity of radiotagged, female brown-headed cowbirds (M. ater) breeding on Fort Hood, Texas, a United States Army installation that contains a large population of federally endangered black-capped vireos (Vireo atricapilla), was monitored 2 years before and 2 years after a reduction in cattle stocking rate. We predicted that cowbirds would respond to the reduction by shifting both foraging and breeding activities toward more distant herds of cattle. Reduction in stocking rate did not have the desired effect of shifting cowbird breeding areas off the study area, though parasitism rates were lower following the reduction. Following the reduction, cowbirds eventually shifted foraging activity off the study area to sites where more cattle were present and tended to commute greater distances between breeding and foraging sites. Assuming that commute distance between breeding and foraging sites was energetically limiting, the cost of the increased commute may have reduced the number of eggs produced by female cowbirds over the breeding season, thus reducing parasitism. Effectiveness of our stocking rate reduction, even when applied at a large scale (9,622 ha), was reduced by the presence of alternative foraging sites within distances that cowbirds were willing to commute. Removal of cowbirds by trapping likely will remain the most effective means of maintaining a sustainable black-capped vireo population on Fort Hood.

TI Sea, land and fish: spatial relationships and the archaeology of South
   Island Maori fishing
SO WORLD ARCHAEOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
DE Maori seascape; restrictions; fish catch
ID NEW-ZEALAND; CHRONOLOGY
AB Customary Maori uses of the sea recognized ritual restrictions enforced by supernatural penalties and jurisdictions. In contrast, archaeological interpretations of Maori fishing behaviour emphasize extractive opportunism and, more recently, foraging theory. Archaeological fish catch data are considered from early and later period middens of Te Tau Ihu (northern South Island) to evaluate these seemingly contrastive views. The archaeological sequence is characterized by a highly focused inshore fishing strategy changing only in the identification of the dominant species. Over time the catch pattern shifts to target predictable, fast-growing cool-water species. This change can be interpreted to support explanations of ritually restrictive or low-risk extractive behaviour. These explanations are not mutually exclusive of necessity. Cultural restrictions and boundaries associated with the customary seascape ensured a sustainable and low-risk fish catch, while reinforcing the efficacy of ritual behaviour.

AB We contribute to the debate on the social implications of carbon forestry projects by showing that tradeoffs exist between social benefits of projects and their cost-effectiveness. Large-scale industrial plantations and strict forest protection are economically viable, but pose the highest social risks. Socially beneficial projects are less cost-effective because of their higher transaction costs. Enabling policies are also required for their success. Regulation of carbon markets will therefore be required to reduce social risks and enhance benefits. We propose a number of regulatory and proactive measures and justify them on the basis of market imperfections and concepts of sustainable development. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper applies Martinez-Alier's [Environ. Values 2 (1993) 97] "ecological debt" concept to the problem of debt relief, exploring the possibility of compensatory transfers from rich to poor countries based on existing ecological balances. I employ recent estimates on ecological footprints and ecosystem values to estimate the ecological debt to be distributed among eligible transfer recipients-all less-developed countries (LDCs). The results provide a policy criterion for transfers in the event that future circumstances make large-scale international debt relief compulsory. The study probably underestimates the appropriate transfer amounts because of conservative assumptions regarding the environmental values and the size of the north's ecological debt in physical terms.

ID HIRSCHSPRUNGS-DISEASE; DEFINITIVE OPERATION; RECURRENCE; MESOSIGMOPLASTY
AB Mesosigmoidoplasty is a nonresective procedure for nongangrenous sigmoid volvulus. It aims to correct the main pathogenetic factor of this condition, the narrow but long mesosigmoid. Although it had been demonstrated by intraoperative measurements that this has indeed achieved its purpose, recurrent volvulus has been reported after the procedure. This has raised the question of whether an operation on the mesosigmoid's peritoneal cover alone is sufficient to maintain the change in shape. The modification presented here aims at more sustainable shortening and widening of the mesosigmoid by including all its layers in the procedure. Of 31 consecutive patients with sigmoid volvulus operated on in Malawi in East Africa, 14 had the nongangrenous variety. Twelve of them underwent modified mesosigmoidoplasty without any major perioperative complications. There was one relaparotomy following misdiagnosis of cryptic Hirschsprung's disease and one true recurrence secondary to a technical error during the previous operation. During a follow-up of eight patients for 4 to 8 months, there were no complaints about abdominal discomfort or changed stool habits. Thus including all layers of the mesosigmoid in the plastic procedure did not increase short-term morbidity and in theory should be advantageous in respect to preventing recurrence. Applying it to a larger series with prolonged follow-up seems to be justified.

   assessment system
AB Sustainability in the 21st century is seen as basis for the use of natural resources. In European countries evaluation criteria for sustainable use are developed in various,sectors (e.g. agriculture, forestry, fishing, tourism). For wildlife management and hunting an unsatisfied need in defining sustainability existed. Therefore in the course of an interactive, particapatory stakeholder-process the authors developed an assessment framework that allows' hunters to evaluate the degree of sustainability of their own individual hunting practices. Based on international and national obligations and provisions (e.g. CBD MCPFE, IUCN), a transparent set of ecological, economic and socio-cultural principles (11), criteria (20), and subcriteria (39), with indicators and assigned values, has been defined. Main task of the assessment set is to function as a decision-supporting and awareness-raising instrument for managers of hunting grounds or hunting communities in order to identify sustainability gaps, to provide guidance in deducing measures for more sustainable future hunting practices and to measure progress in the implementation of sustainability requirements. The results are available for a broader range of users and for further sophistication via WorldWideWeb (www.biodiv.at/chm/jagd).
   In this paper the new method (procedural and organizational framework, architectural structure of assessment model) is presented. The participatory, interdisciplinary social bottom-up working process that involved a large number of interest groups and experts is seen as a crucial factor promoting acceptance. Strategic backgrounds of the study results, evaluation method, and interpretation basics are described. Major attributes in contents as well as possibilities for further development of the test system are outlined.

   hunting law; red deer; red deer zones
AB The compatibility of national hunting law in Germany with the Convention on Biological Diversity is investigated by using the methods of jurisprudence.
   Recognizing wildlife protection problems concerning red deer in Germany, the study gives answers to the following questions: Which legal provisions are in force to regulate the management of red deer and the demarcation of "red deer zones" in the federal state of Hesse? What is the relation between national hunting law and national nature protection law in Germany? Furthermore questions about the hierarchy of norms and the compatibility of identified hunting provisions with the Convention on Biological Diversity are discussed.
   In the federal state of Hesse most of the provisions relative to the management and demarcation of red deer zones are decrees and administrative provisions, but not part of the regional state hunting law ("Hessisches Jagdgesetz", HJG).
   The Implementation Act for the Convention on Biological Diversity on national level ("Vertragsgesetz zur Biodiversititskonvention") is of the same level as the Federal Hunting Act ("Bundesjagdgesetz", BJG) within the hierarchy of norms. In consequence of its quality as international law there is a commitment for the Federal State of Germany to get the national provisions in agreement to the international law.
   Red deer hunting in conjunction with the duty to care pursuant to S 1 BJG is the foundation of sustainable utilisation in accordance with the convention on biological diversity. The same applies to the designation of areas known as "red deer zones" in relationship to the in-situ conservation (Art. 8 CBD), the zones are considered as nature protection zones pursuant to Art. 8 lit. a) CBD. The protection zones are to be adapted to altered contexts. The ecosystem and habitat protection must weigh more than it weighs now in the context of red deer management. There are veterinary and legally founded imperatives for the modification of the habitat situation of red deer.
   Outside the red deer zones, in the "deer-free zones", deer migration behaviour must be respected and made possible. Therefore the order in the federal state hunting law of Hesse to eliminate all stags aged up to four years as defined in S 26 b Abs. 4 S. 3 HJG is not compatible with Art. 8 lit. c) CBD. The order is inconsistent with the protection and sustainable use of the species "red deer" and its hereditary factors as natural resources, regulated by the Implementation Act for the Convention on Biological Diversity. Considering the hierarchy of 'norms and pursuant to Art. 31 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Germany ("Grundgesetz", GG), the above mentioned, contradictory provision under "Under" law ceased to be operative. Therefore it is sensible to cancel S 26 b Abs. 4 S. 3 HJG.

AB Understanding of the characteristics of soil organic matter (SOM) and soil nutrients at the field and catchment scale is important for refining agricultural management practices and for improving sustainable land use. In order to analyze on SOM and nutrient differences among different land use types and their relationships between land use, landscape position and slope aspect, 94 sampling sites including 7 land uses were selected along 6 transects in the Danangou catchment with an area of 3.5 km(2) on the Loess Plateau of China. Significant differences in SOM, total N (TN), available N (AN) and available P (AP) among these land uses were found.. Higher values in SOM, TN and AN were measured in soils from woodland and grassland, but lower values in the soils from fallow land and cropland. Compare SOM and TN with cropland, intercropping land had high contents. The adjusted R-2 values of regression models for SOM and nutrients with land use, landscape position and slope aspect ranged from 0.501 (SOM) to 0.134 (AP). A comparison between average predicted and measured values for SOM and each soil nutrient revealed that the predicted values in TP and AN for each land use, in SOM and TN except for fallow land and in AP except for intercropping land, shrub land and woodland, fell with in a 95% confidence interval about the measured values. The simplified predicted models of soil nutrients combined with the key value of SOM for soil quality can serve to improve agricultural practices and to provide useful information on sustainable land use. Improvement in SOM and nutrients would be expected from more C inputs including manure and crop residues and alternative cultivation practices such as developing intercropping system, building terrace for soil and water conservation, return the cropland with SOM content less than a key value of 0.44% to the grassland and woodland on the hilly areas similar to the Loess Plateau of China. At the same time, it is recommended that nitrogen fertilization addition could be decreased in the foot slope and increased on the upper slope. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This article presents the results from soil surveys carried out within the framework of a soil conservation research project with several components: soil erosion modelling, land evaluation and participatory planning. The study area was a small catchment (3.5 km(2)), ranging in altitude between 1085 and 1370 in, in the vast Loess Plateau area in northern China. It is continuously affected by soil erosion by water, to a certain extent due to the unprotected slopes resulting from cultivation of subsistence food by the land users. The information on variability of soil properties in the study catchment was required as a basis for development of land use scenarios opting for ecological and economical sustainable production for the land users in the future. Soil profiles to I-m depth were described, using FAO guidelines, at 17 sites along two transects covering the different facets of the morphology: hilltop, hillslope, valley bottom. Samples were collected from each horizon in the soil profiles for laboratory determination of physical and chemical properties. It was found that the nutrient status of the soils was poor, with ranges in contents of: sand=6.5-30.0%, silt=53.5-74.5%, clay=11.1-29.0%, organic matter=0.11-1.32%, available P=0.1-11 ppm, available N=5-56 ppm. The extremely high pH values, ranging between 8.7 and 9.3, effectively restricted the availability of nutrients. The soils have a high available water storage capacity so that, during years with a good supply of rain water, fair yields of crops can be achieved if the soil is fertilised. However, during dry years, when the soil dries out, the soils are vulnerable to drought and the crops fail. A divide at approximately 1200 to 1225 in above sea level was found between stratified and unstratified loessial soils. Above this altitude, the soils were yellowish, homogeneous silt loams with no or few restrictions for tillage, root penetration or water percolation. Below this altitude, layers that were more reddish (due to soil processes during climatically wetter periods),. slightly cemented or higher in clay content, although still having a silt loam texture, were found in the soil profiles. These layers could cause problems at tillage, and could give rise to some restrictions to root penetration and water percolation, thereby increasing the erosion risk. A partitioning into characteristic soil types is proposed, to be used in the other parts of the project: erosion modelling, land evaluation and participatory planning. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB This article describes some of the results of a land evaluation within the framework of a research project carried out in a small catchment on the Loess Plateau in northern China, which has long been exposed to land degradation from erosion. The project aimed to identify an approach for land use planning, combining participatory (land users) planning, land evaluation and soil erosion modelling. The results from this study were intended to provide the biophysical properties of importance to be used together with results from participatory approach (PA) studies and soil erosion modelling to construct scenarios for a more sustainable use of land. Land properties, which were restricting for agricultural cropping, were defined and values of each property were matched with the requirements for cropping. By defining the spatial distribution of critical properties, they could be combined to achieve compound suitability classes in each land unit for the chosen land use. Information was gathered from measurements and data searches as well as from farmers, using PA methods. Properties for which data and other information were available and which were considered to be relevant for the study included climate, soil water content, slope aspect, soil water storage capacity, rooting environment, tillage constraints, slope gradient, infiltration capacity, soil nutrients and flooding hazard. Each of the properties were discussed in relation to their influence on land suitability, primarily for agricultural crops. Whatever management changes were carried out to improve the productivity and sustainability in the project catchment, restrictions for agricultural production were large. The major constraints were water availability, nutrient availability and erosion hazard. The properties chosen for further use in suitability evaluation and scenario analyses were those having a significant spatial variability in the catchment: soil type, slope gradient and slope aspect. The results from this study are applied in other articles this issue. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V All rights reserved.

AB The participatory approach is recognised world-wide as a desirable approach for the success of research and development projects in the field of land management and conservation. A participatory approach (PA) for soil and water conservation is presented in this paper. The approach was one important part of Integrated Participatory Conservation Planning (IPCP) and aimed at involving farmers as our research partners in the whole conservation planning process in order to define relevant alternatives for sustainable land use. The work was carried out in the small catchment of Danangou, situated in the heart of the Loess plateau of China, by a multidisciplinary and multinational team, during the period 1998-2000 as part of the EROChina project.
   Several participatory methods, including group and team dynamics methods, sampling methods, interviewing and dialogue methods and visualisation and diagramming methods, were used for different purposes through a three-step process of the PA. The PA process can be described as researchers learning about local conditions (Step 1), followed by analyses of land use carried out by local farmers (Step 2), and finishing with farmer-researcher two-way feedback on the different land use scenarios (LUS) and their potential effects on erosion and household economy (Step 3). A Participatory Household Economy Analysis (PHEA) was developed and shown to be a suitable method for analysing the current and the potential changes in the household economy due to different land use scenarios (Step 3). The three steps of PA integrated closely with the modelling and land evaluation tools of the IPCP.
   The PA developed involved interactive learning between professionals and farmers, seek multiple perspectives and make use of systematic and structured learning processes and give a highly effective participation. The approach is promising in improving farmers' awareness of environmental problems and solutions, as well as in linking local and scientific knowledge. The conditions for the successful use of the participatory methods in local conditions as well as of the teamwork are also discussed. (C) 2003 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Integration of farmers' knowledge and perception with researchers' knowledge is important for planning resource-conserving technologies. In many places in the world, fanner participation has been shown to be essential in the planning of sustainable land management. The findings of a participatory approach (PA) for integrated conservation planning in the Danangou catchment-a small catchment situated in the heart of Loess Plateau-are presented in this paper. The work was carried out by an interdisciplinary team during the period 1997-2000. The PA is an interactive learning process between local farmers and researchers. The process was facilitated by several visualisation and diagramming methods. This formed part of an integrated conservation planning approach, where three tools including PA, land evaluation and soil erosion modelling were combined within the entire conservation planning process.
   The Danangou catchment is characterised by its distribution of cropping systems on all degrees of slope to meet the food needs of the villagers. Farmers' criteria on land suitability, including slope aspect and soil workability, were evaluated. Farmers approved several biological and physical conservative measures, which provided one of the important bases for formulating different land use scenarios (LU scenarios). The factors influencing farmers in choosing different LU scenarios were analysed, including (1) current household economy in relation to production from the land; and (2) prediction of changes in the household economy due to different LU scenarios.
   The farmers' vision on implementation of the LU scenarios, i.e. gradually converting cropping land, conforms well with the plans of the local government. However, due to the poor living standard and lack of off-farm employment, any effort to improve land use towards more sustainable practices seemed to be difficult to implement without support from the government in terms of food, seedlings and also sources of employment for the villagers. The strategy for conversion work in connection with the central government policy on re-greening the Loess Plateau must focus first on areas where off-farm activities are available or potentially available. A diversity of conservation alternatives was found to meet the needs of different farmers' groups. It is recommended that alternatives be developed by an active collaboration between farmers, extensionists and researchers. (C) 2003 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB The Loess Plateau has been suffering from serious soil erosion for a long time, which originated in a population growth about 2000 years ago. After then, the rapid increase in human activity has led to more areas became used for grain production. Original vegetation has been destroyed and soil erosion has become more and more serious. Most research works indicate that the soil erosion on the Loess Plateau is mainly induced by irrational land use structure and low vegetation coverage. Controlling soil erosion is a significant factor in making a sustainable land use planning for the Loess Plateau. In this study, a procedure towards such a planning is presented, based on results from a research project in a small catchment on the Loess Plateau. A land suitability evaluation for rain-fed agriculture based on biophysical parameters, and a comparison between land suitability and current land use, were first carried out. Some potential land use scenarios, based on surveys on biophysical and socio-economic parameters in the catchment, and plans by the authorities, were proposed for further evaluation of their effects on soil erosion, economic feasibility and social acceptance. The scenarios were tested by (i) simulation modeling, to show the differences in erosion, and (ii) from studies on the influence of the scenarios on farmers' economy and their response. The results indicated that the following land use scenario was acceptable: all land with deep soil and slopes smaller than 15degrees is used for agriculture cropland, possibly combined with biological conservation measures, such as mulching combined with improved fallow, and all land with steeper slopes than 15degrees is used for other purposes (orchards and other cash trees, woodland, shrubland, grassland). A great reduction of on-farm income, however, would be induced on the short term by such a scenario. Local farmers will find it difficult to accept it unless financial support from external sources is available. On the long term, the scenario will be promising for both economic income improvement and soil erosion control since some production will be obtained from the conversion of cropland into orchards/cash trees (preferably on slopes 15-25degrees). Thus the land use modification should be carried out gradually. On the short term (5 year), it is suggested that cropland on steeper slopes than 25degrees is returned to woodland/shrubland/grassland while also fruit trees are planted on slopes 15-25degrees. Within 10 years, cropland with slopes steeper than 15degrees is suggested to be converted into orchard/woodland/shrubland/grassland. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID FOREST VEGETATION; RESTORATION
AB From the end of the 18th century, large areas of Central Europe were afforested with conifer monocultures following a long period of excessive forest use. Today, the conversion of these anthropogenous conifer forests into natural, mixed broad-leaved forests, serving manifold socio-economic and nature conservation purposes, is a major objective of sustainable forestry. The study presented here focuses on recent processes of natural regeneration on formerly degraded forest sites. Both the vegetation and land-use history and the present vegetation and vegetation dynamics are investigated. In the Menzer Heide (Brandenburg), selected as a representative area of the North-eastern German lowlands, anthropogenous Pinus sylvestris L. and natural Fagus sylvatica L. as well as mixed Quercus-Fagus forests of Qu. petraea Liebl. and Qu. robur L. are taken as examples. The methods applied are pollen and lake sediment analysis to reconstruct the historical vegetation and landscape development, phytosociology to differentiate the main forest communities, and population ecological and statistical methods to investigate vegetation dynamics and the spontaneous rejuvenation of trees within the forest stands. The sites investigated are oligotrophic and acid sandy soils far from ground water. The present-day forest communities reflect differences in soil nutrient supply, site history and forest management. Comparing a vegetation survey from the 1960s with a recent survey, soil regeneration processes can be revealed, indicating an increase of the nutrient availability in today's forests. The records of spontaneous tree rejuvenation show the major role played by beech and oak in the area investigated. From the results of the vegetation and land-use history analysis, the vegetation dynamics observed over the past decades, and the detailed analysis of the actual vegetation, scenarios for the future development towards natural forests are derived.

AB The indigenous vegetation surrounding the river oases on the southern rim of the Taklamakan Desert has drastically diminished due to overexploitation as a source of fodder, timber and fuel for the human population. The change in the spatial extent of landscape forms and vegetation types around the Qira oasis was analyzed by comparing SPOT satellite images from 1998 with aerial photographs from 1956. The analysis was supplemented by field surveys in 1999 and 2000. The study is part of a joint Chinese-European project with the aim of assessing the current state of the foreland vegetation, of gathering information on the regeneration potential and of suggesting procedures for a sustainable management.
   With 33 mm of annual precipitation, plants can only grow if they have access to groundwater, lakes or rivers. Most of the available water comes into the desert via rivers in the form of seasonal flooding events resulting from snow melt in the Kun Lun Mountains. This water is captured in canal systems and used for irrigation of arable fields. Among the eight herbaceous and woody vegetation types and the type of open sand without any plant life that were mapped in 2000 in the oasis foreland, only the latter, the oasis border between cultivated land and open Populus euphratica forests and Tamarix ramosissima-Phragmites australis riverbed vegetation could be clearly identified on the photographs from 1956.
   The comparison of the images revealed that the oasis increased in area between 1956 and 2000. Shifting sand was successfully combated near to the oasis borders but increased in extent at the outward border of the foreland vegetation. In contrast to expectations, the area covered with Populus trees was smaller in 1956 than today due to some new forests in the north of the oasis that have grown up since 1977. Subfossil wood and leaf remnants of Populus euphratica that were found in many places in the foreland must have originated from forests destroyed before 1956. In the last 50 years, the main Qira River has shifted its bed significantly northward and developed a new furcation with a large new bed in 1986. The natural river dynamics are not only an important factor in forming the oasis' landscape but also in providing the only possible regeneration sites for all occurring plant species.
   The conclusion of the study is that the oasis landscape has changed considerably in the last 50 years due to natural floodings and to vegetation degradation by human overexploitation. The trend towards decreasing width of the indigenous vegetation belt resulting from the advancing desert and the expansion of arable land is particularly alarming because a decrease in its protective function against shifting sand can be expected in the future.

AB OBJECTIVES We sought to determine whether oral potassium supplementation safely increases serum K+ and results in sustained improvement of repolarization parameters in long QT syndrome type 2 (LQT2) subjects.
   BACKGROUND Mutations in HERG (LQT2), the gene encoding the rapid delayed rectifier K+ current I-Kr, account for a significant proportion of congenital long QT syndrome (LQTS). The magnitude of I-Kr is paradoxically increased by an increase in extracellular K+. We tested the hypothesis that long-term oral potassium supplementation results in a mild, sustainable increase in serum K+ that improves repolarization abnormalities in subjects with LQT2.
   METHODS After an initial evaluation consisting of electrocardiography, electrolytes, blood urea nitrogen, and creatinine, escalating doses of potassium chloride (KCl) and spironolactone were administered to eight subjects with six distinct HERG mutations. Medications were continued for four weeks, at which time, the final evaluation was undertaken. Beta-adrenergic blocking therapy was maintained.
   RESULTS The subjects ranged in age from 11 to 52 years. The average daily KCl and spironolactone dose was 3.3 +/- 1.5 mEq/kg and 3.5 +/- 1.2 mg/kg, respectively, and this regimen resulted in an increase in serum K+ from 4.0 +/- 0.3 to 5.2 +/- 0.3 mEq/l. There were no serious complications associated with therapy. The increase in serum K+ resulted in a decrease in the corrected QT interval from 526 +/- 94 to 423 +/- 36 ms (mean +/- SD; lead V-2). Both QT dispersion and T-wave morphology improved in most subjects.
   CONCLUSIONS Long-term oral potassium administration increases serum K+ in patients with LQT2. This can be achieved safely and results in improvement in repolarization. Further studies are warranted to determine whether this will reduce the incidence of fife-threatening events in LQTS patients. (C) 2003 by the American College of Cardiology Foundation.

AB A forest nutrient cycling and biomass growth model was developed to simulate nutrient cycling and NPP based on site and monthly mean weather conditions. A modular design was used to partition northern forest ecosystems into separate modules that address the following ecological variables: (1) hydrologic processes and temperatures to estimate moisture, percolation and temperature in forest floor, soil and subsoil; (2) soil acidity to estimate the H-ion balance in the soil, in the context of atmospheric deposition, nutrient uptake, weathering, and soil-ion retention; (3) cycling of N, S, Ca, Mg, and K to estimate nutrient uptake, mineralization, nitrification, immobilization, mineral soil weathering, nutrient exchange between soil exchange sites and solution, and nutrient leaching associated with atmospheric deposition; and (4) biomass to estimate NPP and its allocation to foliage, wood, and root, as well as litterfall and decomposition. After the model calibration, verification and validation, the model can be applied (1) to predict the rate of sustainable nutrient harvesting based on nutrient geochemical balance; (2) to determine limiting nutrients for forest growth; (3) to evaluate the effects of atmospheric acidic deposition on soil chemistry and growth; and (4) to evaluate the effects of forest harvesting on environmental issues, such as stream water quality.

AB We summarize early research on land-cover, land-use, and biophysical properties of vegetation from the Large Scale Biosphere Atmosphere (LBA) experiment in Amazonia. LBA is an international research program developed to evaluate regional function and to determine how land-use and climate modify biological, chemical and physical processes there. Remote sensing has played a fundamental role in LBA in research planning, land-cover mapping and in long-term monitoring of changes in land-cover and land-use at multiple scales. This special issue includes 12 papers that cover a range in spatial scales from regional mapping to local scales that cover only a portion of a Landsat scene. Several themes dominate, including land-cover mapping with an emphasis on wetlands and second-growth forest, evaluation of pasture sustainability and forest degradation and the impact of land-cover change on stream chemistry. New techniques introduced include automated Monte Carlo unmixing (AutoMCU) and several new approaches for mapping land-cover. A diversity of sensors are utilized, including ETM+, IKONOS, SPOT-4, Airborne P-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR), and L-band SAR. Census data are fused with an existing land-cover map to generate spatially explicit estimates of land-use from historical data. Several papers include important, new field measures of species composition, forest structure and biomass in mature forest and secondary succession. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The artificial breeding of marine fish in China has been developed over a period of more than 50 years. Both species diversity and fry production have greatly increased since the 1980s. By the year 2000, at least 52 species belonging to 24 families of marine fish had been successfully bred. Large quantities of cultured fry can meet the needs of both sea cage culture and pond culture for most species. Fish fry production has entered a period of sustainable. development. The number of artificially produced fry of large yellow croaker (Pseudosciaena crocea) exceeded 1.3 billion in year 2000. The species for which more than 10 million fry is produced annually through aquaculture are: red drum (Sciaenops ocellatus), Japanese sea perch (Lateolabrax japonicus), redeye mullet (Liza haematocheila), cuneate drum (Nibea miichthioides), red seabream (Pagrosomus major), milkfish (Chanos chanos) and three-banded sweetlip (Plectorhynchus cinctus). Several millions of artificial fry are cultured annually for the following species: Japanese flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus), black porgy (Sparus macrocephalus), silver sea perch (Lates calcarifer), Russell's snapper (Lutjanus russelli), javelin grunt (Pomadasys hasta), miiuy croaker (Miichthys miiuy), Chinese black sleeper (Bostrichthys sinensis) and skewband grunt (Hapalogenys nitens). Fishes belonging to the family Sciaenidae are now the major species for artificial propagation. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The aquaculture of molluscs and crustaceans is an economical activity that is threatened by the repeated appearance of new diseases, non-infectious and infectious, which affect cultured species. Difficulties in controlling diseases in marine aquaculture come mainly from the differences in susceptibility of the animals according to their developmental stage (from larvae to adults) and from the diversity of pathogens that affect them. Among the causative agents encountered in marine aquaculture, viral and bacterial problems as well as fungal diseases dominate the larval production. Methods have been proposed for the control of disease in aquaculture, such as the use of probiotic bacteria, immunostimulants or the improvement of the larval quality via the nutrition, and zootechnical progress has been made. So far, antibiotics have been intensively used as preventive and curative measures, but such practices are now questioned because regular use of these chemical products has led to the appearance of drug-resistant bacteria and can also have harmful effects on the environment. In this context, alternative treatments as well as animal health monitoring have to be established as preventive measures. In the long term, the most effective way for sustainable aquaculture production will certainly rely upon the production of animals selected for increased resistance to disease, but until now, few papers can be found on this topic for marine invertebrates. Today, immune criteria as enhancement of non-specific defence responses are being considered.
   Investigation of the innate immune systems of molluscs and crustaceans may give new insights into the management and control of diseases in aquaculture. In particular, antimicrobial peptides present various application possibilities by their use as therapeutic agents, as tools for monitoring the health status of cultured animals, and by the use of encoding genes as selection markers for improving resistance to infections.

AB Reliable estimates of low flow are extremely important for the monsoonal mountainous areas of the Hindu Kush-Himalayan (HKH) region as people in this region are facing growing problems of water during dry periods in terms of both quality and quantity. Furthermore, increasing evidence of decrease in snow cover and retreat of glaciers due to global warming have been reported from various parts of the HKH, which has serious implications for low flow in the region. However, reliable methods for low flow are difficult to find and lack of hydrometeorological data have inhibited the development of such methods. This has posed serious problems for sustainable management of water resources systems in the region in view of the difficulties in low flow.
   This paper also discusses a method for low flow estimation in the mountainous regions of Nepal, which shares with other neighbouring areas the complexity in the nature of the terrain and climate, inadequate hydro-meteorological network and insufficient long-term reliable data on hydrometeorology. The method discussed is based on a method developed in the UK, for estimating the hydrological regime at ungauged sites. Regionalization of the flow has been developed applying multi-variate regression analysis of long-term hydro-meteorological data and catchment characteristics. A number of standardised flow duration type curves have been determined, and regression models of the flows and the topographical and geological characteristics of the catchments were established. The mean flow was estimated using the water balance principle where the long-term mean annual runoff is the difference between long-term average annual precipitation and long-term actual evapotranspiration. Regionalization has been carried out by developing grids of hydrological response. The grids allow the flow regime to be estimated at any point on any stream in the mountainous region of the country. This is the first regional method of this kind to be developed to estimate low flows from ungauged catchments in Nepal. Such a method is of great importance for Nepal as well as for the mountainous regions of other countries of the HKH region, as it allows assessment of water availability for the design of small hydropower, irrigation and water supply schemes, and contributes to the economic development and poverty alleviation.

TI Randomised controlled trial of clinical decision support tools to
   improve learning of evidence based medicine in medical students
SO BMJ-BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
AB Objective To assess the educational effectiveness on learning evidence based medicine of a handheld computer clinical decision support tool compared with a pocket card containing guidelines and a control.
   Design Randomised controlled trial.
   Setting University of Hong Kong, 2001.
   Participants 169 fourth year medical students.
   Main outcome measures Factor and individual item scores from a validated questionnaire on five key self reported measures: personal application and current use of evidence based medicine; future use of evidence based medicine; use of evidence during and after clerking patients; frequency of discussing the role of evidence during teaching rounds; and self perceived confidence in clinical decision making.
   Results The handheld computer improved participants' educational experience with evidence based medicine the most with significant improvements in all outcome scores. More modest improvements were found with the pocket card, whereas the control group showed no appreciable changes in any of the key outcomes. No significant deterioration was observed in the improvements even after withdrawal of the handheld computer during an eight week washout period, suggesting at least short term sustainability of effects.
   Conclusions Rapid and convenient access to valid and relevant evidence on a portable computing device can improve learning in evidence based medicine, increase current and future use of evidence, and boost students' confidence in clinical decision making.

AB A novel DNA vaccine against hepatitis B virus was administered intraepidermally by particle-mediated epidermal delivery (PMED) to 16 human subjects who demonstrated absent or non-sustainable responses to conventional hepatitis B vaccination. Eleven subjects received three doses of vaccine at 56-day intervals, and five subjects received only a single vaccination. Each dose of vaccine contained 4 mug of plasmid DNA encoding the hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). The vaccine was safe and well tolerated. Remarkably, the DNA vaccine elicited antibody responses in 12 of the 16 subjects after a licensed subunit vaccine failed to induce a lasting response after greater than or equal to3 vaccinations. This study provides evidence in humans for protective immunogenicity of a particle-mediated DNA vaccine in subjects who have responded suboptimally to conventional vaccination. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

DE Bahrain; brackish water RO plant; mining-principle management;
   stochastic modeling; risk assessment
AB The Rus-Umm Er Radhuma aquifer in Bahrain is a non-renewable source of brackish water (8-15 g/L), which forms a lens underlain everywhere with brines of over 100 g/L. Aquifer utilization has started in 1984 to feed a reverse osmosis (RO) desalination plant, with an economic life of 25 years (20 10). Future plant upgrade strategy is formulated around boosting the plant production, which will require increasing the wellfield abstraction, in addition to a possible future rehabilitation program to extend the plant life by another 15 years (2025). The limiting factor in expanding the RO plant and its rehabilitation is the future feed water salinity, which have to be assessed before any investments are made to expand the RO plant and commission additional abstraction wells and implement the rehabilitation program. The aquifer management is based on mining a one-time brackish water reserve stored in the aquifer, the main management objective is stated as to sustain the aquifer future availability in feeding the desalination plant with a specified salinity limit of 20 g/L over the economic life of the plant of 25 years (1985-2010). and also over the plant extension period by rehabilitation (2010-2025). The stochastic analysis methodology utilizing conditional simulation is applied to conduct a risk assessment of violating these two p e-specified sustainability constraints under the proposed abstraction increase, and provided a tool to aid the decision-making process in the development and management of the aquifer tinder large uncertainties. Simulation results indicated that the risk of having the salinity of the wellfield produced water to increase due to the proposed increase in the wellfield abstraction to reach 20 g/L over the economic life of the plant (2010) is very small and minimal. However, it is questionable that the feed water salinity will be maintained under the proposed rehabilitation program to extend the plant economic life by another 15 years (2011-2025). For this option. it is recommended that model post-auditing be performed, and new updated predictions should be made as more data of potentiometry, salinity, and hydraulic parameters become available.

AB Soybean (Glycine max [L.] Merr.) protein and oil qualities, with respect to monogastric nutrition, have been linked to the relative abundance of specific protein subunits and fatty acids, respectively. An analysis of field-grown soybean seeds by near-infrared spectroscopy revealed significant differences in their protein and oil contents as a function of nodal position. Seed proteins from the plant apex were high in protein and low in oil content, while those from the basal region exhibited an opposite pattern of accumulation. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of total seed proteins revealed that the P-subunit of beta-conglycinin content was 4-fold higher in seeds from the apical nodes than in seeds from basal nodes. The glycinin A3 polypeptide content gradually increased in successively lower nodes from the top of the plant. Its accumulation was drastically reduced when nitrogen was applied at specific growth stages. Exogenous nitrogen did not alter the pattern of beta-subunit accumulation, but accrual of the acidic and basic polypeptides of glycinin was diminished. The remaining seed storage protein components were not influenced by nodal position or nitrogen application. Gas chromatographic analysis of fatty acids indicated that only oleic (18:0) and linoleic (18:2) acids showed variability in accumulation at different nodes. Neither the abundance nor the distribution of the fatty acids was altered by nitrogen application.

AB The European Initiative for Agricultural Research for Development (EIARD) is concerned with maximizing the contribution of agricultural research to the improvement of the livelihoods of poor people in developing countries. A clear view on means of measuring and enhancing the effectiveness of agricultural research for development(2) is, therefore, of considerable importance to its work. For EIARD, impact assessments and evaluations have four main objectives: (a) to enhance the developmental impact of agricultural research investments for poor people; (b) to provide information on the returns to investments in agricultural research for development; (c) to derive strategic and programmatic lessons for future investments in agricultural research for development; and (d) to provide information for use in public awareness work. These objectives suggest three sets of issues. First, if the main objective of impact assessment and evaluation is to increase the developmental impact of research, it is important to recognize and address the complex social, economic and political dimensions of pro-poor innovation. Thus, impact assessments and evaluations should not be limited to directly measurable impacts; they should seek to capture the complexity and non-linear nature of agricultural innovation and sustainable development. Impact assessments and evaluations should also be integrated as far as possible into research programmes, to facilitate internal learning processes and changes that enhance the probability of impact. Second, the difficulty of attributing impact to specific research investments requires special attention. In agricultural research organizations, exhaustive analysis of specific innovation processes is rarely possible because it is extremely difficult, costly, and time consuming. In most cases, a more feasible goal is to establish plausible links between research investments and development impacts. Third, for impact assessments and evaluations to be useful for decision making, policy design, learning, and public awareness, stakeholder interests and intentions need to be assessed, and appropriate information needs to be prepared for different audiences. It is also important to integrate evaluation lessons with other forms of learning. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Cultivating better nutrition: Can the food pyramid help translate
   dietary recommendations into agricultural goals?

AB An explicit goal of agricultural production should be good human nutrition. Concurrent trends of chronic disease and obesity in the developed world and energy and micronutrient deficiency in the developing world reflect in part an inadequate correspondence between food production and food needs. Cropland allocation is one leverage point for changing the current system so that food supplies better reflect nutritional requirements. However, most methods for assessing the adequacy of food supplies or agricultural output tend to focus only on calories. Fortunately, recent research by the USDA Economic Research Service (ERS) suggests that the Food Pyramid can serve as a basis for estimating how cropland should be allocated to meet nutritional needs. While the Food Pyramid has been subjected to a flurry of criticism in both the academic and the popular press, the methods employed by ERS allow for a whole-diet approach to food supply assessment and are useful irrespective of any future changes in Food Guide recommendations. Moreover, the current critique of the Pyramid completely ignores agricultural sustainability and questions of what kind of diets are possible for the food system to produce in the long term. For this reason, agricultural scientists must become engaged in the discussion of human nutrition to ensure that agroecological concerns are included in determining how to allocate land resources to nutritious ends.

AB Short-term testing of perennial forages may not determine their long-term persistence and productivity. A study initiated in 1994 at New Mexico State University's Sustainable Agriculture Science Center at Alcalde was continued from 1998 to 2001, comparing irrigated monoculture tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.) and tall fescue in binary mixtures with each of alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.), birdsfoot trefoil (Lotus corniculatus L.), cicer milkvetch (Astragalus cicer L.), or kura clover (Trifolium ambiguum M.B.) in three randomized complete blocks. Percentage of harvested grass in mixtures declined in midseason, but grass dry matter (DM) yield increased across the season. Grass DM yield averaged 7.78 and 4.79 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1) for the monoculture and mixtures, respectively. Seasonal distribution of kura clover and combined (kura + fescue) DM yield differed from other treatments causing year X harvest X treatment interactions. Cicer milkvetch-tall fescue performed poorly compared with the other treatments (mean annual yield 5.2 Mg ha(-1)). Mean annual yield (12.7 Mg ha(-1)) of the alfalfa-tall fescue mixtures was enough to enhance its usefulness over monoculture grass through reduced fertilizer inputs. The birdsfoot trefoil-tall fescue mixture also provided the benefit of reduced fertilizer requirements, but mean annual yield (8.2 Mg ha(-1)) equaled fertilized monoculture tall fescue. Kura clover-tall fescue average annual yields (14.1 Mg ha(-1)) equaled alfalfa-tall fescue. Stand longevity, reduced fertilizer inputs, and high yield and quality enhance the usefulness of kura clover in the southern Rocky Mountains. But, irregular seasonal distribution of kura clover between years may make forage budgeting difficult.

AB This paper reports the initial results of a pilot study to evaluate the acceptability and effectiveness of a program to enhance health literacy in low-income HIV-infected Latino men and women receiving antiretroviral therapy. Participants rated the program highly on measures of satisfaction, providing evidence of its acceptability. The effectiveness of the program was assessed in comparisons of the intervention (n = 41) and standard care only (n = 40) groups at baseline and 6-week intervals. Program participants showed significant improvement over comparison group participants on measures of HIV/AIDS and treatment-related knowledge and recognition and understanding of HIV terms. Although there were no significant changes in adherence mastery and behaviors during the 6-week follow up period, there were significant changes in program participants' knowledge about medication adherence. Future steps to examine the sustainability of the program in the medical management of patients are planned in addition to determining its long-range relative impact.

TI Marine ecosystem appropriation in the Indo-Pacific: A case study of the
   live reef fish food trade
SO AMBIO
LA English
DT Article
ID CORAL; SERVICES
AB Our ecological footprint analyses of coral reef fish fisheries and, in particular, the live reef fish food trade (FT), indicate many countries' current consumption exceeds estimated sustainable per capita global, regional and local coral reef production levels. Hong Kong appropriates 25% of SE Asia's annual reef fish production of 135 260-286 560 tonnes (t) through its FT demand, exceeding regional biocapacity by 8.3 times; reef fish fisheries demand outpaces sustainable production in the Indo-Pacific and SE Asia by 2.5 and 6 times. In contrast, most Pacific islands live within their own reef fisheries means with local demand at < 20% of total capacity in Oceania. The FT annually requisitions up to 40% of SE Asia's estimated reef fish and virtually all of its estimated grouper yields. Our results underscore the unsustainable nature of the FT and the urgent need for regional management and conservation of coral reef fisheries in the Indo-Pacific.

AB Background: The long-term effect of most interventions has not been studied. Changes due to interventions to improve patient care may revert to baseline after the intervention stimulus ends. This analysis reports the 24-month follow-up of a practice-tailored intervention to increase preventive service delivery rates.
   Design: Group randomized clinical trial with 24-month follow-up of intervention sites.
   Setting/Participants: Seventy-seven community family practices in northeast Ohio.
   Intervention: Practice-individualized facilitation of implementation of tools and approaches.
   Main Outcome Measures: Summary scores of health habit counseling, screening, and immunization services recommended by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force that were up to date for consecutive patients during randomly selected chart review days.
   Results: Previously reported increases in global preventive service delivery rates, health habit counseling, and screening rates at 12 months were sustained after 24 months.
   Conclusions: A practice-individualized approach can result in sustainable increases in rates of preventive service delivery, even I year after the outside intervention stimulus ends. Tailoring of approaches to the unique characteristics of each practice may result in institutionalization of changes.

AB With the aim of reducing the degree of saturation and increasing the C18:1 cis fatty acid content of milk fat, the effects of feeding high levels of whole cracked rapeseed to dairy cows was investigated together with the effect of increasing dietary intake of vitamin E on the vitamin E content of milk. Using a 3 x 3 factorial design, 90 Holstein dairy cows were fed one of three levels of whole cracked rapeseed (0 (ZR), 134 (MR) and 270 g . kg(-1) diet dry matter (DM) (HR)) in combination with one of three intakes of supplementary vitamin E (0 (ZE), 2 (ME) and 4 g . cow(-1) . d(-1) (HE)). Supplementing with up to almost 2 kg . d(-1) of rapeseed oil (diet HR) significantly (P < 0.001) increased C18: 1cis in milk fat, from 181 (ZR) to over 400 g &BULL; kg(-1) (HR) of total milk fatty acids. Concentrations of C18: 0, C18: 2 and C18: 3 fatty acids were also increased ( P < 0.001) but by a much lesser degree, and the saturated fatty acids C4: 0 to C16: 0 decreased substantially. Vitamin E supplementation increased ( P < 0.01) milk vitamin E concentrations from 1.29 (ZE) to 1.68 mg &BULL; kg(-1) whole milk (HE). Thus substantial changes in milk fat composition with potentially beneficial effects on human health were achieved and without any adverse effects on milk taste. However, these improvements must be offset against the substantial reductions ( P < 0.001) observed in voluntary feed DM consumption (ZR, 20.6; HR, 15.2 kg DM . d(-1)), milk yield (ZR, 22.9; HR, 13.2 kg . d(-1)) and milk fat concentration (ZR, 42.1; HR, 33.4 g . kg(-1)) which would not be commercially sustainable unless a considerable premium was paid for this modified milk. It seems likely that the optimum dose of dietary rapeseed is lower than used in this study.

AB Animal welfare is of increasing significance for European consumers and citizens. Previously, agricultural production focused mainly on supply, price and competition but consumers now expect their food to be produced and processed with greater respect for the welfare of the animals. Food quality is therefore determined by the welfare status of the animals from which it was produced as well as the nature and safety of the end product. Thus, practical welfare improvement strategies and reliable on-farm monitoring systems for assessing the animals' welfare status and evaluating potential risks are urgently required to accommodate societal concerns and market demands. It is also of paramount importance to define the kind of information that consumers want about the final products and to develop effective strategies for communicating welfare standards to the public. Generating an intensified dialogue with all factions of society on welfare issues as well as appropriate labelling of animal products and farming systems that offer guarantees about welfare issues andproduction conditions will, in turn, proinote transparency and the societal sustainability of European agriculture. Welfare is multidimensional. It cannot be measured directly but only inferred from external parameters. Therefore, the integration of the most appropriate specialist expertise in Europe is essential to develop, refine, standardise and intercalibrate welfare monitoring systems and to identify and validate remedial measures. We must establish a European standard for welfare assessment systems in order to facilitate intra-European trade and marketing. Only then can we harmonise labelling that is informative and relevant to all European consumers.

ID JUSTICE
AB Two concepts that provide new directions for public policy, environmental justice and sustainability, are both highly contested. Each has tremendous potential to effect long-lasting change. Despite the historically different origins of these two concepts and their attendant movements, there exists an area of theoretical compatibility between them. This conceptual overlap is a critical nexus for a broad social movement to create livable, sustainable communities for all people in the future. The goal of this article is to illustrate the nexus in the United States. The authors do this by presenting a range of local or regionally based practical models in five areas of common concern to both environmental justice and sustainability: land use planning, solid waste, toxic chemical use, residential energy use, and transportation. These models address both environmental justice principles while working toward greater sustainability in urbanized areas.

ID CONSERVATION
AB Indigenous knowledge (IK), experienced in development, is a product of a set of institutions often external to where they are located. The results of the use of IK in sustainable development are another example of capitalism's capacity to configure development according to its own imperatives. Rather than being an instrument of sustainable development, IK has become a means through which the diversity of knowledge systems and the embedded cultures in which they exist are disciplined and managed according to capital's need to expand. The collaborative role played by the nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) in this process is obscured by their use of the seductive language of empowerment of marginalized social groups. NGOs' interventions run counter to the interests of the people they claim to serve. The challenge to work towards an alternative institutional environment that could liberate the use of IK from being determined by the ideology and institutions of capitalism.

ID THIRD-WORLD CITIES; NORTHEAST THAILAND; ENVIRONMENT; BANGKOK; POVERTY
AB This article examines the concept of urban sustainability within the context of two case studies from Thailand. The Thai state, under the auspices of its development planning agencies, identified the secondary cities of Chiang Mai and Khon Kaen as growth poles in the 1970s. As such, both cities were perceived as engines of regional development in their respective regions of North and Northeast Thailand. The authors critically examine how the strategies of decentralization of industrial growth and development of secondary urban centers, ostensibly to alleviate congestion and pollution in Bangkok, have been deployed in the context of urban primacy and uneven development in Thailand. They argue that these policies have helped induce some growth in the secondary cities in question but that in doing so, they have induced new problems of sustainability in the secondary cities and their surrounding rural areas without alleviating problems of sustainability in Bangkok.

AB This article describes the conflict between rural and urban development in the Pampa Ondulada (Rolling Pampas), the ecological region in which the city of Buenos Aires is located, which is one of the world's richest and most productive agricultural areas. It describes the ecological changes brought by urban growth in periurban and rural areas between 1869 and 1991. It also includes an analysis of the social and economical changes during the past decade (1991-2001) and their effect on ecological services. The article ends with a discussion of the lack of planning over the expansion process of the urban agglomeration, including the so-called suburbia settlements of the middle and upper classes and the speculative pricing of land in advance of its development.

AB Appalachia is considered one of the nation's poorest areas. Many communities live in isolation. The material use of the natural landscape has affected citizens' views of the viability of and potential for sustainable resource practices. In many resource dependent communities, land is externally owned and controlled. Despite living and working in areas with enormous natural resource wealth, residents have only limited access to these resources. Recognizing the inability of conventional practice to resolve many of the development problems confronting communities in distress, a series of new policy initiatives are focusing on building sustainable community capacity from the ground up. Can notions of sustainability be used as a means of redistributing power and access to natural resources, or does the peculiar fate of a region, tied to massive natural resource extraction, eliminate such potential?

AB A key element of sustainable development in cities is the implementation of more effective, less polluting, and equitable transportation policy. This article examines the role of activist organizations promoting transport alternatives in London, Britain's capital city and its largest metropolitan area. Major national, citywide, and local policy changes have permitted citizens' groups to work more actively with progressive elements in government planning, breaking down citizen-expert divides. In West London, the most congested sector of the metropolis, an environmentally based social network, the Ealing Cycling Campaign, promotes cycling as a sustainable transport alternative. Its strategies require active cooperation with the local state rather than radical opposition to it, raising questions about the oppositional stance more commonly found among urban social movements. Environmental citizenship needs to be founded on social realities and conduced in mainstream political systems if it is to be effective in complex urban environments.

DT Article
DE environmental agreements; growth; ideology; neoliberalism; WTO
AB Political pressures exerted by environmental movements have forced governments otherwise committed to neoliberal policies to find reconciliatory policy positions between two contradictory political imperatives-economic growth and environmental protection. This article explores some ideological means of reconciliation, as with notions of sustainable development, which appear to bridge the impassable divide, and some of the institutional means for dealing with contradiction, as with the displacement of political power upward, away from elected national governments and toward international agreements and nonelected global governance institution,. Through these two strategic maneuvers, the authors argue, environmental concern has been ideologically and institutionally incorporated into the global neoliberal hegemony of the late twentieth century. The global capitalist economy can grow, if not with clear environmental conscience, then with one effectively assuaged. This process of neoliberal deflection is illustrated using the case of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and the World Trade Organization.

AB This paper draws on ongoing qualitative research on a sericulture project in Bangladesh to explore the ways in which the concept of organizational culture-which is rarely considered within the analysis of development interventions-can help reveal the complex roots of sustainability problems within multiagency rural development projects. The approach focuses both on local organizational realities and on power in the relationships that link project actors and process with wider systems and structures. It was observed that many of the initial project meanings have gradually fragmented over time, despite the earlier coherence expressed through the formal project culture expressed through documents and other artifacts.

AB Drawing on research from Bangladesh, this article questions the dominance of a narrow view of sustainability that rests predominantly on financial considerations. The push for financial sustainability has produced ambiguous results and, more important, has also introduced a degree of uncertainty into the relationship nongovernmental organizations maintain with their members. This article will argue that in the context of Bangladesh, an accurate notion of sustainability rests more on social and political considerations than on economic ones. Fundamental tensions exist between social/political and economic considerations, and paradoxically, the relentless pursuit of one may undermine efforts to establish the other. The article therefore seeks to subject the logic and validity of efforts to promote sustainability among nongovernmental organizations in Bangladesh to theoretical and empirical scrutiny.

AB 1. The movement of organisms and dispersal of propagules is fundamental to the maintenance of populations over time. However, the existence of barriers, created through the spatial configuration of habitats, may significantly affect dispersal patterns and thus influence community dynamics and resource sustainability.
   2. Within marine environments unstructured or open habitats may form partial or complete ecological barriers due to elevated risk of predation or physical stresses associated with them. The existence and effects of such barriers may be of particular importance when considering the establishment of marine protected areas with a fisheries enhancement focus.
   3. In this paper, the spillover of post-settlement queen conch (Strombus gigas) from a protected area in the Turks and Caicos Islands is investigated. It is hypothesized that the reserve boundaries overlap with a series of shallow, sand habitats that effectively enclose the protected population, reducing the spillover of conch into the adjacent fished areas.
   4. To test this, density gradient maps for juvenile and adult conch populations were constructed using underwater visual survey data at 68 sites within and surrounding the protected area. These maps illustrate very low densities coinciding with poor, shallow sand habitats along the two marine boundaries of the reserve where spillover is expected to take place.
   5. These sand habitats are thought to create ecological barriers to a slow, sedentary gastropod largely due to their shallowness (physical stresses of solar exposure or anoxia) and lack of food reducing the tendency of individuals to move across these areas, despite the 10-times higher density of adult queen conch observed in the protected area compared with outside.

TI Potential of light water reactors for future nuclear power
SO ATW-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR NUCLEAR POWER
LA English
DT Article
AB Energy consumption worldwide is going to increase further in the next few decades. Reliable supplies of electricity can be achieved only by centralized power plant structures.
   In this scenario, nuclear power plants are going to play a leading role as reliable and competitive plants, also under deregulated market conditions. Today, light water reactors have achieved a leading position, both technically and economically, contributing 85% to worldwide electricity generation in nuclear plants. They will continue to be a proven technology in power generation. In many countries, activities therefore are concentrated on extending the service life of plants beyond a period of forty years.
   New nuclear generating capacities are expected to be created and added from the end of this decade onward. Most of this capacity will be in light water reactors. The concepts of third-generation reactors will meet all economic and technical safety requirements of the 21st century and will offer considerable potential for further development.
   Probably some thirty years from now, fourth-generation nuclear power plants will be ready for commercial application. These plants will penetrate especially new sectors of the energy markets.
   Public acceptance of new nuclear power plants is not a matter of reactor lines, provided that safety requirements are met. The important issue is the management of radioactive waste.
   The construction of new nuclear power plants in Western Europe and North America mainly hinges on the ability to explain to the public that there is a need for new plants and that nuclear power is fundamental to assuring sustainable development.

AB The World Nuclear University (WNU) was founded within the opening ceremony of the annual symposium of the World Nuclear Association (WNA) in early September this year.
   WNU marks the international endeavor to combine in one network scientific and educational institutions in the nuclear field. The activities of WNU will comprise all areas of nuclear applications, from nuclear fuel supply and isotope applications to nuclear power generation, the decommissioning of nuclear facilities, and waste management.
   National and international organizations and scientific institutions from 21 countries support WNU in the execution of its ideas and activities. The WNU network is to speed up the change towards the global exploitation of cleaner energies. Nuclear power, being an available, established and reliable resource, will play an increasingly more important role in this effort. Further applications of nuclear technologies in agriculture, medicine, engineering, environmental protection, and water management will contribute to promoting sustainable development.
   WNU activities are coordinated by a core faculty in London. Hans Blix, former Director General of IAEA, has been elected first Chancellor of WNU, Zack Pate, former WANO Chairman, is Chairman of the Board.

TI Population and environment in Australia: issues in the next half century
SO AUSTRALIAN GEOGRAPHER
LA English
DT Article
DE Australia; population futures; environment; sustainable development
AB This paper considers the likely future population in Australia to 2050 and is cast within the context of environmental limitations, to which Griffith Taylor alerted the nation in the 1920s and 1930s, and for which he was vilified in several quarters. While acknowledging the relative accuracy of his long-range forecasts, the arguments here depart from environmental determinism, although varying sets of environmental ethics and values are considered in relation to Australia's global responsibilities and international commitments. It is argued that an increase in population to 26 million by 2050 will not place severe stresses on the physical environment, provided environmental and resource management strategies are put firmly in place, and if consumption and resource use practices are significantly modified. An ideological linkage exists between a resurgent Australian nationalism and a number of environmental perspectives, but one which rejects growth and biological diversity among humans while embracing environmentalism. This inward-looking nationalism-environmentalism is seen as harmful both to Australia's moral integrity as a nation, and in local and world citizenship.

TI Issues and Opportunities in Planning and Managing Nature-Based Tourism
   in the Central Coast Region of Western Australia
SO AUSTRALIAN GEOGRAPHICAL STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
DE Tourism; planning; Western Australia
ID CONSERVATION PRIORITIES; BIODIVERSITY HOTSPOTS; MODEL; COLLABORATION;
   MANAGEMENT
AB Research reported here identified planning and management issues relating to integrated development of nature-based tourism in the Central Coast Region of Western Australia. Stakeholder views were gauged through a workshop involving 45 people and a series of interviews. The workshop was also designed to stimulate interest in the establishment of a regionally, integrated tourism group to address any issues identified. Participants included members of the tourism industry, the community, and representatives of government and non-government organisations. Seven individuals participated in interviews, including the chief executive officers of the local authorities and regional development commissions.
   The results indicate that the regional tourism industry is fragmented and uncoordinated, which is hindering regional development. Implementation of regional tourism planning is virtually non-existent in the Central Coast, due to the lack of a regional tourism policy. Management of tourism resources is restricted by limited coordination between industry and government, and especially by inadequate resource provision to local authorities and land management agencies.
   An outcome of the workshop was the formation of a regionally integrated tourism group, the Turquoise Coast Sustainable Development Steering Committee, to implement recommendations arising from the workshop. However, the group has met with limited successes to date, owing to a range of political and sectoral issues beyond the scope of tourism planning. The research highlights difficulties in implementing collaborative tourism planning initiatives at the regional scale.

AB Despite being a major site of recent population growth and, arguably, a key arena for sustainability concerns, the rural-urban fringe has received relatively little attention in the literature concerning Australian cities and urban policy. To address this shortcoming the authors review post-World War II efforts to plan the rural-urban fringes of Sydney and Adelaide and find a number of issues for contemporary policy-makers. First, the fringe is becoming increasingly complex due to multi-faceted demographic change, a broadening economic base and demands for better environmental management, all within the context of an evolving understanding of sustainability. Second, water resource management, partly under the auspices of integrated natural resource management, is assuming a much higher priority than in early fringe planning endeavours, which emphasised urban containment, agricultural land protection and landscape conservation. Third, and partly as a consequence of this shift of priorities, there is also evidence of changes to the nature and focus of policy tools used in the fringe, with land management concerns now cutting across traditional land use planning. Finally, and fundamentally, these observations raise questions about how future governance of the fringe should be organised. Together these four themes pose an enthralling series of challenges for policy-makers for which much more research and discussion are needed.

TI Gauging New Zealand's success at poverty reduction in the new millenium
SO AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF SOCIAL ISSUES
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper presents the results of the New Zealand Poverty Measurement Project analysis of the effects of the 1990s social reforms in New Zealand on the incidence and severity of poverty, and assesses the impact of five social and economic policies introduced by the Labour-led coalition governments since 1999: New Zealand superannuation, income-related rents on state houses, active labour market policies for an employment-rich economy, the Primary Health Care Strategy and the planned income support policy to reduce child poverty. Superannuation is assessed as both adequate and sustainable, rents for state houses are found to be affordable, and GDP growth and employment have increased incrementally as unemployment and benefit numbers have decreased. The Primary Health Care Strategy is an innovative initiative that will increase affordable access to general practitioners, but it and the proposed child assistance initiatives are too new to be adequately assessed. Of the challenges that remain, policy priorities should centre on housing alternatives, including home ownership for low-income households not in state houses; income support for poor households, particularly those with children; and multi-sector development of education and training aimed at lifting economic and social capacity.

AB The starting point for this paper is the identification of the four necessary and sufficient conditions which a building should exhibit to be judged to be sustainable; fitness-for-purpose, cost effectiveness, environmental friendliness, and cultural significance. The contribution which the current generation of CAD tools is making to the complex human activity of designing sustainable buildings is then discussed under the headings of widening the search for solutions, integrating the decision-making process, improving design insights, differentiating objective/subjective issues and photorealistic visualization. The paper then describes developments in the next generation of IT tools, based on virtual reality, which will allow multiple designers, working in distributed locations and on different computer platforms, to design from within the virtual world.

AB Management plans for threatened or recovering large vertebrate species that are increasing in population size and range focus on the establishment of viable populations within set temporal limits. New Zealand (Hookers) sea lions (Phocarctos hookeri) were declared a threatened species in 1997, and New Zealand legislation requires that threatened species of marine mammals must be managed to reduce human-induced mortality and achieve a non-threatened status within 20 years. The present breeding distribution of P. hookeri is highly localised, with over 95% of total annual pup production located at Auckland Islands and almost all of the remainder at Campbell Island. Breeding elsewhere has been ephemeral or restricted to < 10 adult females. The only recorded sustainable breeding at a new location has been at Otago, South Island, New Zealand. This breeding population consisted of a total of four breeding females in 2002 and is derived from one immigrant female that gave birth to her first pup in the 1993/1994 breeding season. The New Zealand Department of Conservation management plan specifies that to achieve a non-threatened status P. hookeri (1) at Otago must increase in the number of breeding females to greater than or equal to 10, and (2) must establish greater than or equal to two new breeding locations within the 20-year time frame, each with greater than or equal to 10 breeding females. This study 1) projects the population growth trends at a new location (Otago) to see if it will achieve greater than or equal to 10 breeding females within the legislated time frame, and (2) examines the likelihood that other breeding locations will establish elsewhere given the demographic information available for this species. We present 20 deterministic and three stochastic Leslie matrix model scenarios for female population growth for the initial years following the start of breeding at a new location. Our results indicate that (1) a new breeding population derived from one immigrant female is unlikely to reach 10 breeding females in 20 years; this duration is more likely to be 23-41 years (deterministic models) or 23-26 years (stochastic model), (2) the likelihood of two new sites establishing within 20 years is unquantifiable, but the probability is low, and (3) if the legislated outcome and time limit are not revised in the population management plan, the feasibility and effectiveness of re-locating young females could be investigated.

AB A gridshell is a structure that gains its strength and stiffness through its double curvature configuration. Its advantages are a minimum use of materials, structural efficiency and the creation of a large volume, as well as the potential for quick and cost-effective construction. However, few gridshells have been built due to a lack of knowledge and data. The process of creating the Downland Gridshell, as a specialist museum workshop completed in the spring of 2002, is a case study of successful collaboration and innovation in architecture, engineering and construction led by a multidisciplinary team of practitioners. This gridshell structure was composed of a double layer of mats comprising four layers of thin timber laths. These were harnessed together as a flat mat and then formed into a three-dimensional structure by a carefully orchestrated lowering of each supporting scaffolding prop, thereby harnessing gravity to pull the mat into shape. Many innovations are described in detail: team working, risk sharing, multidisciplinary design, structural modelling, the creation of new structural components, cladding, and construction processes including the sequence and techniques of gridshell forming. Advances made in this project have added to the knowledge of gridshell behaviour, construction and cost, thereby making the design and construction of future timber gridshells a more viable option.

AB The state of human resources in China's construction industry presents significant problems for the national economy and for the efficiency of the construction industry. This paper considers policy and practical questions for improving the quality and efficiency of the large rural workforce in construction. Labourers from rural areas form 90% of the national workforce, yet 90% of them lack any formal job training. The existing problems besetting labourers from rural areas include low-quality outputs, low wages, poor living and working conditions, and high mobility. The proposed remedy needs to include: training provisions for labourers from rural areas to improve their working skills and overall quality; creating organized labour to increase the stability of the workforce; creating a proper labour-cost system; and developing a more complete labour market. Some privately owned Chinese construction companies are setting an example of innovative leadership in improving training and working conditions for labourers from rural areas and consequently are benefiting from increased profits.

AB An integrated assessment is presented of the potential impacts of the cattle tick (Boophilus microplus Canestrini) on the Australian beef industry under climate change. The project was carried out as a case study to test an impact assessment approach that was designed to integrate biological, production and socio-economic impacts on managed and natural systems. A climate-driven, tick population model was run for European, zebu and crossbred cattle breeds having different levels of resistance to cattle ticks. A geographical information system (GIS) was used to organise spatial data on climate scenarios and industry statistics and to undertake regional analyses. A comparison was made of the two available approaches to conducting impact assessments, namely a bottom-up approach using sensitivity analysis and a top-down approach using climate change scenarios from a global circulation model (GCM) (CSIRO, 1996). The output, in terms of the abundance of tick populations and reductions in cattle productivity for each breed showed significant expansions in potential geographical impacts. In the absence of any adaptation measures, the results indicated changes in the losses in live weight gain of cattle tick ranging from 7780 tonnes per year by 2030 to 21637 tonnes per year by 2100, in comparison with estimates for current losses of 6594 tonnes per year. The principal adaptation options available to the beef industry are to switch to breeds that are more resistant to cattle ticks, or to increase the frequency of treatments with various tick control products. In this paper we focus on switching breeds as an adaptive measure when appropriate damage thresholds are triggered under the climate change scenarios. When adaptation measures were put in place, the losses ranged from 4962 tonnes in 2030 to 5619 tonnes in 2100 compared with 2636 tonnes at present if all producers adopted the optimal breed structure. Optimal breed structure was defined as one that would prevent tick numbers per animal exceeding 100 ticks per animal for European and 700 ticks per animal for crossbred breeds of cattle in any week of the year under a tick control strategy that was suitable for present climatic conditions. The lower threshold for European breeds reflects their vulnerability to explosive increases in numbers because of their low resistance to ticks. The results of the analyses using the GCM scenarios were used in an economic model to calculate costs of lost live-weight gain for 2030, 2070 and 2100. The greatest increases in costs were incurred in the southern parts of the current distribution in Queensland and potentially in northern New South Wales if the present quarantine barrier failed. Given the great uncertainty of the nature of possible regional changes in climate, analyses of the sensitivity of losses in live weight gain to changes in climatic variables were also undertaken. The analyses included a measure of likely impacts of cattle tick on the beef cattle industry, in the absence of adaptation measures, as a baseline measure of sensitivity. The likely impacts on crossbred cattle were insensitive to the climatic variables. When adaptive breed changes were allowed, the economic impacts on the industry were insensitive to the GCM scenarios. This suggests that, at least in this instance, reducing the uncertainties in climate change scenarios is not a priority if the adaptation strategies can be implemented in a cost-effective manner.
   Finally we made a qualitative assessment of the sustainability and robustness of alternative approaches to adaptation and assessed regional vulnerability to cattle tick under climate change. The conclusions were so strongly dependent on assumptions about the future of other global changes, in particular the ability to maintain quarantine barriers and to retain effective acaricides at comparable costs to the present, that we strongly recommend that risk assessments of climate change extend to all relevant variables in involved in global change where possible.

AB An observational study was performed involving 95 children with vertically transmitted human immunodeficiency virus type 1 infection to assess the sustainability of undetectable viral loads (VLs) and increased CD4(+) T lymphocyte percentages after 48 months of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). The median time to achieve a 10% increase in the CD4(+) T lymphocyte percentage was 11.01 months. The median time to achieve an undetectable VL was 6.4 months. At the end of the study, 64.2% of the children had achieved an undetectable VL. Of the patients with an initial VL of >3.6 log(10) copies/mL, 74.7% had a decrease in the VL of 1 log(10) copies/mL. By contrast, of the patients who presented with an initial VL of >4.6 log(10) copies/mL, 37.9% had a decrease of >2 log(10) copies/mL. Higher VL at baseline, antiretroviral therapy regimens received before HAART, and multiple drug switches while receiving antiretroviral therapy were all inversely associated with an undetectable VL. A CD4(+) T lymphocyte percentage of >25% was directly associated with undetectable VL during the follow-up period. In conclusion, first-line HAART induces beneficial virological and immunological outcome responses in children.

AB Phytobenthic communities can play an active role in modifying the environmental characteristics of the ecosystem in which they live so mediating the human impact on Coastal Zone habitats. Complicated feedbacks couple the establishment of phytobenthic communities with water quality and physical parameters in estuaries.
   Direct and indirect interactions between physical and biological attributes need to be considered in order to improve the management of these ecosystems to guarantee a sustainable use of coastal resources. Within the project F-ECTS ("Feedbacks of Estuarine Circulation and Transport of Sediments on phytobenthos") this issue was approached through a three-step strategy: (i) Monitoring: detailed fieldwork activities focusing on the measurement and evaluation of the main processes involving hydrodynamics, sediments, nutrients, light and phytobenthic biomass; (ii) Modeling: joint modeling of the suspended particulate matter erosion/transport/deposition and biological mediation of the hydrodynamics and (iii) GIS: development of GIS-based practical tools able to manage and exploit measured and modeled data on the basis of scientific investigation guidelines and procedures. The overall strategy is described by illustrating results of field measurements, providing details of model implementation and demonstrating the GIS-based tools. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Purpose: We propose a functional assessment approach for patients with alcoholic dependence of working age undergoing aerobic training. The background is the WHO indication (ICIDH-2) to use measurable 'activities' as a means to assess the individual 'participation' in social life which also implies work capacity. Defining sustainable energetic levels for the individual is an important issue for both the quantification of an effective training and the evaluation of possible improvements following training.
   Methods: Fifty-six 'alcohol dependent' patients, as defined by DSM IV (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders), admitted to our Unit in a 16 month-period participated in the study. Eighteen healthy subjects served as controls ( Group C). Out of all the 56 patients, 33 ( Group A) underwent an aerobic training and 23 subjects ( Group N) underwent the same pharmacological and psychological therapy but without aerobic training. Patients were assigned to the treatment ( A) or no treatment ( N) group according to a 'quasi-experimental' design (i.e. temporal selection criteria). The evaluation protocol consisted of submaximal symptom-limited tests. The tests consisted of bouts of 'basic' activities (walking, lifting, arm-work) to be performed at different intensities. We estimated the total energetic work (TW) performed in the tests by means of formulas available in the literature. The maximal energetic intensity (EI) reached during the tests was also estimated and expressed in MET ( multiple of the basal metabolism).
   Results: Significant differences in work capacity were observed between patients and healthy subjects at baseline. Group A significantly increased TW after rehabilitation, while Group N did not increment their performance at the re-test.
   Conclusions: The proposed approach could be useful in the functional assessment of deconditioned subjects with alcohol dependence in working age, and could monitor the changes in work capacity following training.

TI Agricultural policy in the republic of Croatia from agricultural toward
   sustainable rural development
SO DRUSTVENA ISTRAZIVANJA
LA Croatian
DT Article
AB In the paper we have started from the supposition that Croatian agricultural policy In its elements (policy objectives, measures and methods, stakeholders, results), has been transformed due to the impact of the world food market enlargement and economic globalization. Priorities, forms and dynamics of intervention have been changed, which was in the past decade enriched by a new dimension: the introduction of the concept of sustainable development of rural areas. The emphasis of the analysis is on the price and subsidy policy that makes up the skeleton of the agricultural policy during the entire analyzed period. By state intervention indicators the level of foreign trade protection and domestic support has been evaluated. Although the nominal indicators, point out a relatively highly protected agricultural sector, effective protection of domestic producers has been considerably lower, due to high costs of agricultural inputs and the influence of world prices. At the end of the analyzed period, a shift in Croatian agricultural policy has been noticed toward the model of non-price support. The key elements of sustainable development are identified, and introduced into agricultural research and also into the legislation background of the policy of agricultural and rural development. In the near future considerable reform of the agricultural policy strategic objectives and measures toward structural support and sustainable development are to be expected as well as toward the policy of direct income support for farmers.

ID SUSTAINABILITY
AB This study examines an alternative to market valuation for determining worth through a case study of the Oak Openings region in Northwest Ohio. USA. Emergy analysis methods are explained, illustrated and used to tabulate environmental, cultural and economic subsystems of the region. The emergy yield ratio for the region at 1.57 suggests sustainability but is less than the findings of other researchers looking at environment-dominated systems. Its loading ratio at 15.2 indicates very high levels of stress-undeveloped and developing areas in the US typically exhibit loading ratios of between 1 and 5. The region's emergy investment ratio at 2.3 is much more efficient than some urban areas with investment ratios as high as 26; but it still suggests less efficiency and geater reliance upon non-renewable resources than other studies of natural systems where investment ratios are less than one. The inclusion of cultural emergy analysis, which is still in its infancy, complicates the findings here reported. Questions regarding cultural emergy are considered. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

ID FEDERALISM
AB Drawing on the case of India, which since 1991 has been undergoing a far-reaching programme of market-oriented reform, this paper argues that the World Bank and other transnational development actors have been unable to adjust themselves -sufficiently to indigenous ideological traditions that affect the sustainability of economic liberalization. While markets are becoming increasingly embedded at the level of institutions, they are not achieving what might be termed 'ideological embeddedness'. The paper maps the ideological context facing market reformers in India by looking at the relationship between, on the one hand, the idea of swadeshi (an indigenous form of economic nationalism), and on the other, three competing forces in Indian politics. The paper concludes by arguing that it is the mutual antipathy among these political forces, rather than any fundamental incompatibility between swadeshi's precepts and the embedded-market framework, that prevents organizations like the World Bank from adapting swadeshi as an indigenous basis for framing its approach to market embeddedness.

AB In this paper a novel concept is introduced for the energetic evaluation of technical systems, based on the law of entropy. Our technical systems are considered as open systems interacting with their environment. Main attention is directed to waste energy as the source for the entropy export necessary to maintain a desired state of order within the system. The entropy export results from internal and external irreversibilities. A reduction of both irreversibilities, i.e. an approach towards a reversible process management, reduces pollution on the environment through entropy export and primary energy expenditure. With that, the strategy developed here and called entropy economy, contributes to a better optimization of technological processes and thus to sustainable development. The most important means for avoidance and reduction of irreversibilities are discussed in detail and applied to definite regional objectives. As examples reveal, from a thermodynamic perspective it turns out that in some cases a considerable amount of primary energy could be saved with the currently known technical methods. Additional expenditures for devices and technical equipment are not the only obstacles for realization: opposition from the realms of economic, social and legal requirements is likely to exert a negative influence on the development of optimally integrated 'cascading' cycles.

AB In recent years, thermodynamics has been applied in a number of new fields leading to a greater societal impact. This paper gives a survey of these new fields and the reasons why these applications are important. In addition, it is shown that the number of fields could be even greater in the future and could lead to savings in human effort, use of land and water and of energy and natural resources. Achieving these savings is a contribution to a sustainable society. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The potential energy that could be produced from solid wastes in Brazil tops 50 TWh. Equivalent to some 17% of the nation's total power consumption at costs that are competitive with more traditional options, this would also reduce greenhouse gases emissions. Moreover, managing wastes for energy generation purposes could well open up thousands of jobs for unskilled workers. Related to power generation and conservation, energy use requires discussions on the feasibility of each energy supply option, and comparison between alternatives available on the market. Power conservation is compared to projects implemented by the Federal Government, while power generation is rated against thermo-power plants fired by natural gas running on a combined cycle system. Although the operating costs of selective garbage collection for energy generation are higher than current levels, the net operating revenues of this scheme reach some US$ 4 billion/year. This underpins the feasibility of garbage management being underwritten by energy uses and avoided environmental costs. The suggested optimization of the technical, economic, social and environmental sustainability of the expansion of Brazil's power sector consists of compatibilizing the use of fossil and renewable fuels, which is particularly relevant for hybrid thermo-power plants with null account on greenhouse gases emissions.

AB The management of tropical protected areas is a contentious issue in resource management and often leads to an unproductive polarization of viewpoints supporting either "protectionist" or "sustainable development" paradigms. This paper argues for a context-driven approach whereby effective management requires inputs from both paradigms in different situations. A key element of context is understanding long-practiced resource tenures and their ability to meet future conservation and livelihood goals. Different types of tenure arrangements are often required for different resources. This approach is illustrated by analysis of Virachey National Park in NE Cambodia. This park encompasses part of the ancestral territory of ethnic Brao people, who rely upon swidden agriculture, fish, terrestrial wildlife, and various nontimber forest products (NTFPs) for their livelihoods. These people have developed a mix of resource tenure regimes to promote sustainable use and to maximize local benefits. In the face of contemporary pressures, some of these traditional approaches are effective, while others are not. The paper suggests avenues for building on long-established management practices of the Brao to achieve park management goals while enhancing the welfare of the Brao people. A mix of private ownership, common property management, and central government involvement may be required to maximize benefits to local people and ensure long-term protection of biodiversity.

AB This case study details the difficulties of landscape management, highlighting the challenges inherent in managing natural resources when multiple agencies are involved, when the land users have no incentive for conservation, and when government agencies have too few resources for effective management. Pumping of groundwater from the aquifer of La Costa de Hermosillo in the state of Sonora, Mexico, began in 1945 and developed so quickly that by the late 1950s salinity intrusion from the Gulf of California was occurring in the wells. In the 1970s, the irrigatable land in La Costa peaked at 132,516 ha and the extracted volume of water from the aquifer peaked at around 1. 14 billion cubic meters annually. By the 1980s, 105 wells of the total of 498 were contaminated with seawater and, therefore, identified for closure. At present La Costa de Hermosillo still represents 15% of the total harvested land, 16% of the total annual production, and 23% of the gross agricultural production of the state of Sonora. However, there are approximately 80,000 ha of abandoned fields due to salt water intension, lack of water and/or lack of credit available to individual farmers. This unstable situation resulted from the interplay of water management policies and practices, and farm-land policies and practices. While government agencies have been able to enforce better water use for agricultural production, there remains a significant area that requires restoration from its degraded state. For this piece of the ecosystem management puzzle, government agencies have thus far been unable to affect a solution.

AB The objective of our study was to assess the response of physical (aggregate stability and bulk density) and biological (enzyme activities and microbial biomass) soil quality indicators to the adoption of agroecological management practices, such as the planting of forage species (forage area) and the rotation of local crops (polycrop area), carried out in a representative tropical pasture on an integrated livestock-crop farm. The pasture system was used as control (pasture area). In all three areas, the values of water-soluble C were higher in the rainy season compared to the dry season. Pasture and forage areas had the highest percentage of stable aggregates in the rainy season, while polycrops developed soils with less stable aggregates. Soil bulk density was lower in the pasture and forage areas than in the polycrop area. In the pasture area, the microbial biomass C values, dehydrogenase, urease, protease-BAA, acid phosphatase, and beta-glucosidase activities were higher than in the forage and polycrop areas, particularly in the dry season. The highest increase in the microbial biomass C in the rainy season, with respect to the dry season, was recorded in the pasture area (about 1.2-fold). In conclusion, the planting of forage species can be considered an effective practice for carrying out sustainable, integrated livestock-crop systems, due to its general maintenance of soil quality, while the adoption of polycrop rotations appears to be less favorable because it decreases soil quality.

AB At the time of its introduction in the end of the 1980s, the concept of natural capital represented new, more ecologically aware thinking in economics. As a symbol of novel thinking, the metaphor of natural capital stimulated a debate between different disciplinary traditions on the definitions of the concept and research priorities and methods. The concept became a means to control the discourse of sustainable development. In this paper, I focus on the power/knowledge implications of the use of the concept, and I follow the career of the concept of natural capital in ecological economic publications between the years 1988 and 2000. The main interests are(1) in the use of the concept to affect the rules according to which claims concerning sustainable development can be made and (2) in the constitution of objects of environmental knowledge.

AB Professionals from minority world nations are increasingly consulting with majority world nations to develop intervention and educational training programs, yet minority world programs cannot be simply transferred to majority world countries. Participatory action research (PAR) provides a methodology that can be used to facilitate the development of programs that are useful for and sustainable by the majority world communities. This article describes the principles of PAR and gives examples of the ways that cultural values and behaviors may influence interactions between minority and majority world persons. An understanding of these cultural variations in values is essential for the successful implementation of PAR and will reduce miscommunication and incorrect interpretations of behaviors.

AB A growing number of national and international buyers are now specifying "certified" forest products in their procurement policies. In response, the Canadian Standards Association (CSA) has worked with a diverse range of stakeholders interested in Sustainable Forest Management in Canada to develop CSA's Sustainable Forest Management (SFM) Program. CSA's SFM Program consists of four distinct, yet inter-related components: CAN/CSA 2809, Canada's National Standard for Sustainable Forest Management; chain of custody for forest products; product marking with CSA International's SFM Mark; and, CSA International's Forest Products Group. When these components are combined they provide a comprehensive, credible, and affordable forest certification and product-marking program. The list of organizations accepting forest products certified through the CSA SFM Program is growing within Canada, the United States and abroad.

ID CLASSIFICATION; IMAGERY; DISCOVER; MAP
AB A priority of the Canadian Forest Service and Canadian Space Agency joint project, Earth Observation for Sustainable Development of Forests (EOSD), is the production of a land cover map of the forested area of Canada based upon Landsat data. The land cover will be produced through a partnership of federal, provincial and territorial governments, universities, and industry. The short-term goal of EOSD is to complete a land cover map representing year 2000 forested area conditions by early 2006. Over the longer term, EOSD will aim to produce land cover products to capture changes in forest conditions over time to support national and international reporting requirements. The forested area of Canada represents approximately half of Canada's landmass, requiring over 450 scenes for complete coverage (with overlap minimized). EOSD is working with provincial and territorial mapping agencies that have on-going land cover mapping programs to optimize production capacity. It is envisioned that the combined output of EOSD and provincial and territorial land cover mapping programs will be integrated with maps developed by other sectors and agencies (such as agriculture) to produce a complete representation of the land cover of Canada. Large-area land cover mapping using remote sensing is a relatively new phenomenon. Advances in data storage capabilities, computing power, and increases in the affordability of data have allowed for large-area projects to be undertaken in ways previously not possible. The manner in which a large-area mapping project is approached is related to a number of factors including the spatial extent of the area of interest, the spatial resolution of the selected sensor, and the products which are to be generated. In this communication we report on the strategy, methods, and status of the EOSD land cover mapping program of the forested area of Canada.

AB General Motors conducted two well-to-wheel studies for fundamental clarification on the question of which is the cleanest and most environmentally sustainable source of energy for the mobility of the future. In both studies the complete energy chains were analyzed from fuel production using primary energy to the actual consumption of the fuel in the car, i.e. from the well up to the wheels of the vehicle (well to wheel). The aim of the studies was to evaluate total energy consumption on the one hand and, on the other, the total greenhouse gas emissions arising between the production of a fuel and its final use to power an automobile. The results of the studies clearly show that fuel cell vehicles can greatly reduce greenhouse gas emissions from passenger cars or, if they run on hydrogen from renewable energy sources, they can eliminate them entirely. Regenerative fuels, however, will be more expensive than current products. With the fuel cell, because of its superior efficiency (35 - 45% less energy consumption well to wheel), it will be possible to keep individual mobility affordable in the future.

AB In view of the limited availability of fossil fuels and the necessity to reduce the output of emissions of greenhouse gases in the long term, the transport sector needs efficient, environmentally compatible drive solutions. Hydrogen, as a clean and sustainable fuel, offers a high implementation potential and can be used both in internal combustion engines and in fuel cells. In urban deployment the fuel cell drive has specific advantages and is suitable for use in city buses. Integration of high-power energy storage systems improves fuel consumption and can reduce the costs of the drive system. In May 2000 MAN presented its first fuel cell bus, which was successfully deployed in passenger transport in various cities. The next FC-bus, using hybrid fuel cell propulsion, is planned under the framework of the Bavarian hydrogen project at Munich Airport and will be tested from spring 2004 on. The first deployment of pre-series bus fleets with fuel cells using hydrogen as fuel can be expected from the end of this decade onwards.

TI Mobilizing grassroots' technological innovations and traditional
   knowledge, values and institutions: articulating social and ethical
   capital
SO FUTURES
LA English
DT Article
AB The Honey Bee Network has helped provide a sort of loose platform to converge creative, but uncoordinated individuals across not only Indian states having varying cultural, linguistic and social ethos, but also in 75 other countries around the world. What the Network is trying to do in a rather quiet manner may transform the way the resources-in which poor people are rich-are used in the future. These resources are their knowledge, innovations and sustainable practices.
   I first argue that the classical concept of social capital does not distinguish between the trust in society created for social good versus social `bad'. For instance, the trust among members of the mafia and other socially undesirable networks does not constitute social capital. I am also trying to emphasize that part of social trust which is guided by higher ethical values which may not have become social norms as yet. This is being characterized as ethical capital. Finally, I conclude that the Honey Bee Network has tried to articulate the social and the ethical capital of society at the grassroots to demonstrate how local individuals and communities are trying to solve local problems without any outside help.

   conservation policies
SO FUTURES
LA English
DT Article
ID EQUILIBRIUM
AB Sustainable development projects that were supposed to insure the future of the earth's biological inheritance are currently being criticized for compromising biodiversity. Drawing on sixteen months of fieldwork with one of Papua New Guinea's most remote societies, this paper argues that more productive conservation policies will emerge when indigenous activities are viewed as disturbance and not as vehicles for establishing equilibrium with the environment. This research demonstrates that although the Hewa play a significant role in shaping this environment, their traditions are not always compatible with biodiversity conservation. Finally, policy recommendations based on indigenous knowledge research are offered. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper presents empirical research from a study of trust and co-operation between chronic illness patients and their physicians, conducted in nutrition clinics. The paper details models of trust and co-operative behaviour designed to aid interpretive analysis. The paper then presents an interpretive discussion of 16 examples from interactions observed between patients and their consultants at the initial visit and revisit stage of the illness management process in consecutive clinics. This illustrates some of the ways interpersonal trust development between patients and their physicians may affect health care delivery. The paper finds physicians appear to make in-clinic opportunities for building resilient trust relations with patients based on common understanding and experience, engendering more rapid patient compliance. This is further promoted by a contemporaneous positive focus on key issues, such as patient-perceived importance and patient-perceived self-competence, serving to lower patient co- operation thresholds. In the best instances, the combined effect is significant patient empowerment, and thus improved health care delivery as a result of the compliance thereby achieved. In addition, it is suggested the speed of trust development during the interactions is not commensurate with long term relationship sustainability, and suggests this as an explanation for, amongst others, failure to attend rates.

AB Virtual communities have been identified as the "killer applications" on the Internet Information Superhighway. Their impact is increasingly pervasive, with activities ranging from the economic and marketing to the social and educational. Despite their popularity, little is understood as to what factors contribute to the sustainability of virtual communities. This study focuses on a specific type of virtual communities-the virtual learning communities. It employs an experiment to examine the impact of two critical issues in system design-information accessibility and community adaptivity-on the sustainability of virtual learning communities. Adopting an extended Technology Acceptance Model, the experiment exposed 69 subjects to six different virtual learning communities differentiated by two levels of information accessibility and three levels of community adaptivity, solicited their feelings and perceptions, and measured their intentions to use the virtual learning communities. Results indicate that both information accessibility and community adaptivity have significant effects on user perceptions and behavioural intention. Implications for theory and practice are drawn and discussed. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Land use/land cover change, particularly that of tropical deforestation and forest degradation, has been occurring at an unprecedented rate and scale in Southeast Asia. The rapid rate of economic development, demographics and poverty are believed to be the underlying forces responsible for the change. Accurate and up-to-date information to support the above statement is, however, not available. The available data, if any, are outdated and are not comparable for various technical reasons. Time series analysis of land cover change and the identification of the driving forces responsible for these changes are needed for the sustainable management of natural resources and also for projecting future land cover trajectories. We analysed the multi-temporal and multi-seasonal NOAA Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) satellite data of 1985/86 and 1992 to ( 1) prepare historical land cover maps and ( 2) to identify areas undergoing major land cover transformations ( called '`hot spots'). The identified 'hot spot' areas were investigated in detail using high-resolution satellite sensor data such as Landsat and SPOT supplemented by intensive field surveys. Shifting cultivation, intensification of agricultural activities and change of cropping patterns, and conversion of forest to agricultural land were found to be the principal reasons for land use/land cover change in the Oudomxay province of Lao PDR, the Mekong Delta of Vietnam and the Loei province of Thailand, respectively. Moreover, typical land use/land cover change patterns of the 'hot spot' areas were also examined. In addition, we developed an operational methodology for land use/land cover change analysis at the national level with the help of national remote sensing institutions.

AB The various drivers for change in the renewables energy sector are being enhanced by legislation and concordats at national, EU and world level. The UK presents a good example of an approach to improvement through the definition of an open and flexible system for achievement, which allows all players in the sector to play a full part. UK plans are reported as examples of the heat and power sector plus indicating the potential for sustainable liquid propellant fuels. In addition the wider issues of sustainability; land use and externalities are listed. Currently there is considerable interest in biodiesel, a product from vegetable oils that is well known, and bioethanol. This latter offers considerable potential to add value to the rural economy and utilise cellulosic wastes. Technology is developing and should be operational in about 5 years time. It may also offer the option to utilise cellulosic components from municipal wastes, presuming separation to be practicable.

AB The achievement of sustainable irrigation in arid regions requires greater attention to waterlogging, salinization, and degradation of ground and surface waters, which are among the problems that continue to threaten productivity and degrade environmental quality. We consider sustainability to be achieved when irrigation and drainage are conducted on-farm, and within irrigation districts, in a manner that does not degrade the quality of land, water, and other natural resources, either on-farm or throughout an irrigated region. Sustainability may also be described as maintaining the productive resources required for irrigation, so that future generations may have the same opportunity to use those resources as we do. Given the increasing importance of irrigated land for food production, the time has come when it is vital to intercept, reuse, and isolate drainage waters within the regions in which they are generated. Adoption of this strategy can be enhanced by policies that require farmers, and irrigation districts, to consider the off-farm impacts of irrigation and drainage. Such policies include linking water rights with salt rights to require the monitoring and management of both irrigation water and the salt loads in drainage waters. We review the knowledge gained since the early 1970s regarding the economic and agronomic aspects of irrigation and drainage, with a focus on drainage water reduction and sequential reuse of drainage water on salt-tolerant crops. Economic incentives that motivate farm-level and district-level improvements in water management are also reviewed. We conclude that adequate knowledge exists for implementing strategies that focus on water use and salt disposal within irrigated regions, and we recommend policies that will motivate improvements in productivity and enhance the likelihood of achieving sustainability.

AB The increased use of trickle or drip irrigation is seen as one way of helping to improve the sustainability of irrigation systems around the world. However, soil water and solute transport properties and soil profile characteristics are often not adequately incorporated in the design and management of trickle systems. In this paper, we describe results of a simulation study designed to highlight the impacts of soil properties on water and solute transport from buried trickle emitters. The analysis addresses the influence of soil hydraulic properties, soil layering, trickle discharge rate, irrigation frequency, and timing of nutrient application on wetting patterns and solute distribution. We show that (1) trickle irrigation can improve plant water availability in medium and low permeability fine-textured soils, providing that design and management are adapted to account for their soil hydraulic properties, (2) in highly permeable coarse-textured soils, water and nutrients move quickly downwards from the emitter, making it difficult to wet the near surface zone if emitters are buried too deep, and (3) changing the fertigation strategy for highly permeable coarse-textured soils to apply nutrients at the beginning of an irrigation cycle can maintain larger amounts of nutrient near to and above the emitter, thereby making them less susceptible to leaching losses. The results demonstrate the need to account for differences in soil hydraulic properties and solute transport when designing irrigation and fertigation management strategies. Failure to do this will result in inefficient systems and lost opportunities for reducing the negative environmental impacts of irrigation.

AB A Reusable Launch Vehicle (RLV) should be sized to minimise the specific launch costs and this probably means a payload around 10 tonnes and the 4.5 m diameter envelope, both similar to the Space Shuttle capability. This sizing means large payloads, in particular orbital infrastructure systems, if launched on the RLV would have to be carried in many pieces and assembled in orbit. It has been argued that while this approach leads to the lowest launch cost the savings are lost in the extra costs imposed on other factors in the overall acquisition cost. Using a Heavy Lift Vehicle (HLV) with high specific launch costs but able to launch the system in one piece would lead to lower overall acquisition costs. The paper explores the requirements for an HLV designed to support an RLV and proposes a payload of around 40 tonnes and a diameter of 7 meters. It explores three candidate systems Ariane 5 with enlarge payload fairing, an HLV variant of the Space Shuttle and a new reusable system. The most cost effective is the new system but its economic risk and acquisition cost is clearly not sustainable in parallel with an RLV development. However both Ariane 5 and a Shuttle based system could be used as transition launchers for the early stages of RLV operations, with a new HLV system development following when its market is established.

AB The field experiments were carried out at the Indian Agricultural Research Institute, New Delhi during 1996-97 to 1998-99 to study the effect of phosphate solubilizing bacteria (PSB) and incorporation of wheat and rice residue on the relative efficiency of diammonium phosphate (DAP) and Mussoorie rock phosphate (MRP) in three cycles of rice-wheat cropping system. Application of MRP had no significant effect on grain and straw yield and P uptake by rice and wheat; however, when it was inoculated with PSB, it increased grain and straw yields as well as P uptake of both rice and wheat. Efficiency of MRP+PSB was further increased when rice and wheat residues were incorporated and this practice made MRP on a par with DAP. Available P in soil after three cycles of rice-wheat cropping was more after MRP+PSB and incorporation of rice and wheat residues than after DAP. The results of the present study, therefore, indicate that low grade rock phosphate such as MRP can be advantageously utilized in rice-wheat cropping system when applied with PSB inoculation and incorporation of rice and wheat residues.

AB Agricultural and animal scientists need to embrace a new vision beyond the single-minded existing pursuit of biological efficiency. The public in the West is no longer concerned solely with cheap food. Other paramount issues define quality of life, including: health and safety of foods; nutritional value; traditional, regional, locally produced, and organic foods; animal welfare; sustainable farming, environment, and rural resources. The paper provides examples of how the credibility of animal scientists has been lost due to some recent unethical behavior. Research, teaching and application of agricultural and animal science, especially of biotechnology, need to be reshaped into a new "Quality of Life Agricultural Era" to replace the "Era of Intensification." This new era will need fresh assumptions, beliefs and leadership to match the emerging social agenda of the 21st century. Animal scientists have a special role in implementing this new plausibility structure.

AB Sustainability informs the framework for a seminar that we teach for junior and senior undergraduates entitled " The Ethics and Economics of Sustainable Societies." One of the class requirements has each student research and write a life- cycle case study, an exercise in which they trace the full, or partial, life- cycle of some product with which they are familiar. Students are expected to examine the economic, ethical, and ecological implications along each step in the life- cycle of the product. We believe that life- cycle cases in general are very helpful in revealing the full economic, ethical, and ecological consequences of product development, marketing, use, and disposal. We also believe that asking students to research the product themselves provides additional pedagogical benefits. After a brief review of the philosophical case for our alternative view of corporate social responsibility, we will describe the life- cycle case method, offer several examples from our own classes, and make the case for the pedagogical benefits of this approach.

AB The debate on sustainable globalized development rests on two clearly stated economic assumptions: that "development" proceeds, solely and inevitably, through industrialization and the proliferation of capital intensive high-technology, towards the creation of service sector economies; and that globalization, based on a neoliberal, capitalist, free market ideology, provides the only vehicle for such development. Sustainability, according to the proponents of globalized development, is merely a function of market forces, which will generate the solutions for all problems including the environmental dilemmas that loom over the globe today. The social focus of globalized development is clearly the "individual" and the much-touted goal of development in the context of these debates, is the emancipation of the individual from want. This glorification of the individual, so characteristic of the Enlightenment, has defined all aspects of modernity, leading to approaches that are self-focused and that give little thought to the needs of society or even the social context. The increasing impoverishment of human life and the growing environmental degradation, however, provide a poignant counterpoint to this onrush of capital interests, demanding a reassessment of sustainability separate from the logic of industrialization and globalized development. This paper examines the unfolding of the logic of capitalism, which underlies the structure of the Rostowian model of development and the problems in the assumptions underlying today's globalized development process. The evident impossibility of sustainability in the current growth-based market system leads to the examination of alternatives including a reflexive understanding of the choices and the inclusion of opportunity costs, related to the social, environmental and economic aspects of decision making. The integration of all factors of production into the logic of development provides a sustainable alternative to the current system.

CL PRAGUE, CZECH REPUBLIC
AB The fall of the former Soviet Union and the opening of the countries of Eastern Europe has prompted examination of why central planning failed, why capitalism with all its faults is succeeding, and what actions and institutions are necessary to move command economies toward successful, sustainable market economic systems. As they privatize State Owned Enterprises (SOE's) expectations are that the companies will function with the success experienced by western companies. Governments hope to derive tax revenue from company profits and expect companies to provide jobs. Effecting the change is, however, far greater than changing the name plate on the door. Transition success will hinge upon institutional and infrastructure changes that need to be wide-spread.
   The ethical quagmire is that without changes in the infrastructure of the command economy system private enterprise is doomed to fail. Governments will then be deprived of the anticipated revenue streams emanating from businesses. Governments may then not be able to fulfill the economic and social expectations of their citizens. This would be not only counter-productive for businesses and government but also confusing and bewildering to the general populous. This paper explores structural impediments in transition economies and discusses how each blocks and distorts the formation of a true market economy.

AB Emergy (with an 'm') synthesis was used to assess the balance between nature and humanity and the equity among forest outcomes of a US Forest Service ecosystem management demonstration project on the Wine Spring Creek watershed, a high-elevation (1600 m), temperate forest located in the southern Appalachian mountains of North Carolina, USA. EM embraces a holistic perspective, accounting for the multiple temporal and spatial scales of forest processes and public interactions, to balance the ecological, economic, and social demands placed on land resources. Emergy synthesis is a modeling tool that allows the structure and function of forest ecosystems to be quantified in common units (solar emergy-joules, sej) for easy and meaningful comparison, determining 'system-value' for forcing factors, components, and processes based on the amount of resources required to develop and sustain them, whether they are money, material, energy, or information. The Environmental Loading Ratio (ELR), the units of solar emergy imported into the watershed via human control per unit of indigenous, natural solar emergy, was determined to be 0.42, indicating that the load on the natural environment was not ecologically damaging and that excess ecological capacity existed for increasing non-ecological activities (e.g. timbering, recreation) to achieve an ELR of 1.0 (perfect ecological-economic balance). Three forest outcomes selected to represent the three categories of desired sustainability (ecological, economic, and social) were evaluated in terms of their solar emergy flow to measure outcome equity. Direct economic contribution was an order of magnitude less (224 x 10(12) solar emergy-joules (sej) ha(-1)) than the ecological and social contributions, which were provided at annual rates of 3083 and 2102 x 10(12) sej ha(-1), respectively. Emergy synthesis was demonstrated to holistically integrate and quantify the interconnections of a coupled nature-human system allowing the goals of ecological balance and outcome equity to be measured quantitatively.

TI Lessons from community based management of floodplain fisheries in
   Bangladesh
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
DE community-based management; co-management; access; equity; food security
AB Inland (floodplain) fisheries remain the most important contributor to fish production in Bangladesh. They have in the past been administered to generate government revenue without due concern for sustainability or equity. Community Based Fisheries Management (CBFM) is a possible solution and was tested in 19 waterbodies (rivers and beels) during 1996-2000. The outcomes so far are assessed with respect to social, institutional, and physical context, and the interactions that arose in establishing CBFM. The lessons drawn are that: it was essential that communities obtained rights over the fisheries, strong facilitation was necessary, taking up visible resource management actions greatly helped, success was more likely in homogeneous communities, external threats were a strong limiting factor, clear boundaries and small fisheries were not so critical, and new institutions could be built with as much ease (or difficulty) as modifying existing ones. Effective well-defined partnerships of NGOs and government were not easy to establish but were sufficiently beneficial that in several locations new community institutions for fisheries management were established. This is a slow process, the sustainability of local management institutions is not yet established, although they continued during an interim period without funding, further phased support is planned to strengthen these organizations and to generate evidence of impacts and momentum to influence wider fisheries policy in and beyond Bangladesh.

ID SCHIST AQUIFER; WATER; DENITRIFICATION; TRANSPORT; GROUNDWATER
AB In the intensive pig-farming (Sus scrofa) area of Brittany (western France), many surface and subsurface water resources are contaminated by nitrate (NO(3)) with concentrations that chronically exceed the European Community 50 mg L(-1) drinking standard. To ensure sustainable water supply, the fate of NO(3) must be considered in both surface water and ground water. The fate of N was investigated in a Britain catchment, the Coet-Dan watershed, with an integrated management tool: the hydrological SWAT model coupled with the ground water model MODFLOW, and its companion contaminant and solute transport model MT3DMS. The model was validated with respect to water quantity during a 6-yr period and for the NO(3) concentration during a 44-mo period, at two gauging stations in the catchment. The coupled models reproduced accurately the measurements. At the basin outlet, the Nash-Sutcliffe coefficients were 0.88 for monthly flow for the entire period and 0.87 for monthly N load. Alternative scenarios were simulated and showed potential benefits of decreasing manure application from 210 to 170 kg N ha(-1) as required by the European Commission Nitrates Directive.

DE agriculture; biotechnology; Hinduism seeds; South Asia
AB To take seeds in South Asia as vanishing objects unites concerns with embodied but equally ineffable religious meanings; with globalized debates over agricultural technology; and with grass roots movements to regenerate sustainable traditions. Using a devotional text recorded at a funeral wake in Rajasthan in 1980, I evoke a world in which reproductive cyclicality is the signal attribute of vanishing. At stake in the briefly incandescent but already obsolete furor over so-called 'terminator' or 'suicide' seeds is cyclicality's replacement by permanent loss. With excerpts from both mass-media articles and activists' reporting, I explore the ways corporate greed is perceived and portrayed as a kind of hypervandalism practiced on tradition. Finally, I consider an image - sprouting seeds - that suggests the opposite of vanishing. Aware of the pitfalls of nostalgia and romanticization, I nevertheless conclude with this germinal wish to highlight seed-saving and propagation practices that - even in the era of modern hyperecologies - allow cyclicality to prevail over termination.

AB Even in a world with adequate food supplies in global markets, which is the situation today, biotechnology offers important opportunities to developing countries in four domains. First, many agronomically hostile or degraded environments require major scientific breakthroughs to become productive agricultural Systems. Few of these breakthroughs are likely to be achieved through traditional breeding approaches. Second, biofortification offers the promise of greater quantities and human availabilities of micronutrients from traditional staple foods, with obvious nutritional gains for poor consumers, especially their children. Third, many high yielding agricultural systems are approaching their agronomic potential. Radically new technologies will be required to sustain productivity growth in these systems, and only modern genetic technology offers this hope. Finally, many cropping systems use large quantities of chemical inputs, such as herbicides, pesticides and fertilizers that can be unhealthy for people and soils alike. Biotechnology offers the potential to reduce the need for these inputs in economically and environmentally sustainable ways. Applying these new technologies to society's basic foods raises obvious concerns for both human and ecological health. For some, these concerns have become outright fear, and this has mobilized a backlash against genetically modified foods in any form. These concerns (and fears) must be addressed carefully and rationally so that the public understands the risks (which are not zero) and benefits (which might be enormous). Only the scientific community has the expertise and credibility to build this public understanding.

AB To alleviate poverty in developing countries, economies must grow. Without the necessary investments in human capital, national economic growth may not lead to poverty alleviation and socioeconomic development, nor be sustainable. Economic growth that leads to poverty alleviation is fueled by the creative and physical capacities of people. The impact of micronutrient malnutrition is established early in life, leading to growth stunting, lower cognitive abilities, lethargy and poor attention, and greater severity and rates of infection. These effects limit educational progress, physical work capacity and life expectancy, thereby reducing individual lifetime productivity and the aggregate ability of the population to enhance its well-being and participate in national and global markets. The diets of the poor are largely cereal-based, monotonous and lacking in diversity and micronutrients. Animal source foods (ASF) have been an important factor in human evolution, a component of what was an historically diverse diet and an important source of micronutrients. Poverty and micronutrient malnutrition positively influence each other. This poverty micronutrient malnutrition (PMM) trap requires outside inputs to change the state of development in developing countries. Nutrition interventions have been excellent investments in development. More productive interaction between agricultural scientists and nutritionists, supported by a strong federal agenda for development, is needed to break the PMM trap. In the end, food is the means by which nutrients are delivered. Food-based approaches will require long-term commitments, but are more likely to be sustainable because they are part of a development process that leads to long-term economic growth.

AB This article reviews constraints to household level animal source food production in developing countries and suggests solutions to some of these constraints. These constraints include land, labor, money, feed quality, water, disease, animal genetics, roles for animals beyond food production, grazing techniques and an understanding of the entire agricultural system at the household level. Better understanding of farming systems and the elements that comprise it which affect animal food production permits wise management of nutrient flows and enhanced sustainability.

AB This study explores economic effects of environmental taxation using an energy-economy-environment computable general equilibrium model of the Turkish economy. The model disaggregates the Turkish economy into seven sectors and describes production within a nested CES representation. Results, which are obtained under a Business-As-Usual as well as various environmental tax scenarios, provide insight into energy-economy-environment interactions in Turkey and indicate opportunities for an ecologically and economically sustainable development of the country. Besides general policy implications, it is found that a second dividend of environmental taxation, that is economic benefits in addition to environmental improvements, is possible when imported fuels are the primary source of pollutant emissions. This result has been obtained under tax revenue recycling that assumes public consumption of tax revenues instead of the common practice of using tax revenues for reducing existing tax distortions in order to obtain a second dividend.

AB Despite commitments to sustainability by essentially every national and international management agency, fisheries repeatedly fail to meet that objective. Major declines in stock status are common, and collapses have occurred in many jurisdictions. What makes unsustainability such a common feature of fisheries, when none of the parties-the managers, their science advisors, nor the industry itself-wish it? Historical trends in biomass and catch data for flatfish fisheries in New England, the Newfoundland-Labrador Shelf, west Coast of British Columbia, Bering Sea-Gulf of Alaska, and North Sea-Northern Shelf are used to test some general assumptions of governance and environmental variability and their role in sustainable fisheries management. The evidence suggests that sustainability is hard to achieve in flatfish fisheries, the majority of stocks (38 of 65) were overfished at some period during their history. However, some stocks in every category supported sustainable fisheries for the full period examined and this would appear to be achievable for a range of conditions. There were expected differences in the probability of management success between major geo-political regions and between different jurisdictional regimes. There were also contrary differences in sustainability, between bycatch and target fisheries and in stock size. There was no support for the assumptions regarding harshness of the environment. More than any other factor examined, failure to comply with science advice greatly increases the risk of unsustainability. Finally, the analysis provides insight into the value of quantitative reference points as an objective tool in performance measurement. Crown Copyright (C) 2003 Published by Elsevier B.V.

DE Irrigation; Jordan; management; re-use; treated sewage
AB Water demand in Jordan is of concern because all sectors are facing a supply shortage. In 1998-99, deficits in irrigation, municipal and industrial water supply were 35%, 30% and 9% respectively. By the year 2010, it is anticipated that the gap between supply and demand will reach about 515 million m(3) unless non-conventional resources are used.
   This paper (a) assesses the potential use of treated sewage for irrigation, (b) discusses the viability of using treated sewage in agriculture, (c) addresses an assessment of the water budget in Jordan and means to overcome the water deficit, and (d) presents scenarios and recommendations for sustainable water management Strategies to meet unsatisfied water demand include the use of non-conventional water resources and improving efficiency in water-distribution systems and demand management.

AB In March 2000, a document entitled Draft Regional Planning Guidance for the South East was published with the primary aim of providing a regional framework for the preparation of development plans to the year 2016.
   This paper discusses the potential effects for the water industry of SERPLAN predicted levels of housing growth on water resources, sewage treatment and the environment The need for sustainable development with the competing pressures of water-resource limitation, changing regulation, increasing demand and the environment, are discussed. Thames Water scale of operations is described together with the range of measures aimed at managing the reasonable demands of customers, consistent with achieving sustainable growth. Basingstoke is described as a wastewater case study, highlighting the problem in fulfilling the sewerage undertaker's statutory duties in (a) meeting already stringent effluent-treatment standards which are necessary to maintain and improve river quality, and (b) providing the necessary infrastructure for an area which is earmarked for continuing development.

SP S African Inst Min & Met
AB The name FISH (Fully Integrated Sort House) refers to a class of technology deployed at Jwaneng Mine final diamond recovery. The FISH concept is based on three pillars, namely:
   Improved sorting efficiency.
   FISH is based on laser technology, which is more efficient than hand sorting for certain product categories. Laser sorting is based on measuring in-elastically scattered light from molecules and this is referred to as Raman spectroscopy. The Raman scattered light occurs at wavelengths that are shifted from the incident light by the energies of molecular vibrations.
   Availability of production information.
   Roller gap diamond size distribution information is generated on line for upstream process optimization.
   Improved product security.
   A 'hands-off' philosophy reduces security risk during operation and maintenance of the plant.
   In addition, a number of lessons were learnt about the application of new technologies in the industry:
   The required human competency profile demanded by new technology should match the available competencies of the operational staff.
   An integrated information management system should be fully functional for both production management and diamond control purposes.
   Operational feedback must be correctly evaluated to identify design, maintenance, training and operational issues so as to accelerate the maturity of the new technology within the time span of the sustainable operations project.
   Project execution and technology maturity risks have to be evaluated and married to ensure risk mitigation by means of suitable project resource and contracting model selection.

TI Simulating the impacts of strong bus priority measures
SO JOURNAL OF TRANSPORTATION ENGINEERING-ASCE

DT Article
DE urban area; traffic congestion; public transportation; bus
AB Policies to reduce levels of traffic congestion and pollution in major urban areas often focus strongly on the concept of a sustainable transport system, but to achieve this vision a significant modal shift from private car to public transport will be required. This paper reports on a recent research study which provides a framework within which to model the behavioral responses of travelers following the implementation of strong bus priority measures (where road capacity is deliberately removed from general traffic and given to buses). A summary of the different behavioral responses which can be expected is given and results from a practical implementation of the framework which has been based on two commercial transport modeling packages (CONTRAM and TRIPS) are discussed. These results suggest firstly that the effect of implementing such strong bus priority measures is as dependent on the characteristics of the local travelers as on the scheme itself and secondly that implementing too strong a scheme may not benefit public transport overall.

AB It is well established that for multiple biophysical contexts there are legacies of past government policies in present land conditions. Despite this recognition, however, investigation of ongoing tropical deforestation dynamics often de-emphasizes the past. The case of the southern Yucatan peninsula demonstrates the need for historical analysis in identifying key drivers of deforestation. The most important land-use changes in the region over the past 100 years are connected to shifts in national development policies. These shifts represent tensions between centralized and decentralized approaches to land management-as represented by the policies of Presidents Diaz (1876-1910) and Cardenas (1934-40)-that persisted throughout the 20th century. The legacies of these reoccurring development strategies include depleted hardwood reserves, large areas of permanently cleared forest, a complicated system of land allocation, and long-standing tensions between economic, social welfare, and environmental conservation goals. These findings suggest that while centralized and decentralized approaches to development both focus on natural resource exploitation, the rates of deforestation tend to be faster, the patterns of forest clearing more pronounced, and land-use decision making less democratic under systems of centralized control. These conclusions hold implications for land-use decision making today. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

AB This paper examines ways to reduce conflicts and improve the sustainability and value of marine recreational fisheries by fully integrating the recreational sector into the management of fisheries. One possibility involves a novel approach, here called angling management organizations (AMOs), which combines three of the more pervasive and promising trends in fishery management worldwide-management devolution, strengthened harvest rights, and co-management. AMOs are community-based organizations that are designed to conform to seven basic principles of integrated fishery management, which are described below. AMOs are loosely related to rights-based producer organizations in commercial fisheries, and are expected to strengthen resource stewardship, reduce enforcement and monitoring costs, alleviate management conflicts, and produce greater long-term net economic benefits in recreational fisheries. The other organizational structures considered here, including the management status quo, do not conform to all seven principles and are not expected to be as effective as AMOs.

TI The economic sustainability of artisanal fisheries: the case of the
   trawl ban in the Gulf of Castellammare, NW Sicily
SO MARINE POLICY

DT Article
DE artisanal fishery; sustainability; trawl ban; exclusion zone
AB Small-scale fisheries and the communities they support are often given the protection of designated fishing zones from which non-artisanal vessels are excluded. This paper looks at one example of this approach, the trawl ban introduced in the Gulf of Castellammare (NW Sicily), focussing on the economic sustainability of the artisanal fishery currently operating within the protected area. The consequences of lifting the trawl ban and how far this would jeopardise the sustainability of the artisanal fishery are explored via an analysis of the financial viability of trammel net vessels under alternative assumptions concerning catch rates. The paper also investigates fishermen's attitudes towards the trawl ban and their predisposition either to remain in the fishery or to quit in the event of the ban being removed.

SO MARINE POLICY
LA English
DT Article
DE fisheries subsidies; WTO; access agreements
AB The paper considers the WTO negotiations on fisheries subsidies and the implications that envisaged disciplines will have on coastal developing countries. This is considered in relation to fisheries access agreements in the Central and Western Pacific where several least developed but resource rich island states such as Kiribati and Tuvalu are highly exposed to the risks associated with new WTO fisheries subsidies disciplines that do not consider their particular vulnerabilities. The paper considers some of the issues that coastal developing countries should incorporate into their emerging negotiating positions at the WTO. State-to-Sate fisheries access agreements which are often highly subsidised but where fishing vessel owners pay the equivalent of lump sum tax are paradoxically, the least distortionary and damaging to the environment. Strategies for managing the possible new disciplines are considered. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB One of the key environmental concerns about shrimp farming is the discharge of waters with high levels of nutrients and suspended solids into adjacent waterways. In this paper we synthesize the results of our multidisciplinary research linking ecological processes in intensive shrimp ponds with their downstream impacts in tidal, mangrove-lined creeks. The incorporation of process measurements and bioindicators, in addition to water quality measurements, improved our understanding of the effect of shrimp farm discharges on the ecological health of the receiving water bodies. Changes in water quality parameters were an oversimplification of the ecological effects of water discharges, and use of key measures including primary production rates, phytoplankton responses to nutrients, community shifts in zooplankton and delta(15)N ratios in marine plants have the potential to provide more integrated and robust measures. Ultimately, reduction in nutrient discharges is most likely to ensure the future sustainability of the industry. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

   democracy
AB On 29 May 1999 Nigeria went from military autocracy and absolutism to civil rule. Since then Nigerians have focused on the challenges of nurturing and consolidating the nascent democracy. However, as crucial as the mass media is in all regions and climes vis-a-vis democratic processes, not much attention has been paid to the inhibiting factors in the mass media's bid to sustain Nigeria's democracy. The thrust of this article, therefore, is the selectivity of the media in its agenda-setting role. The article infers that regional, geo-political and ethnicist imperatives impact negatively on Nigeria's mass media. The strongest recommendation of this article is that the mass media needs a mindset and worldview that is much more robust and comprehensive than it currently is for it to be a catalyst in sustaining democratic values in a plural and divided society.

AB The widespread occurrence of high inorganic arsenic in natural waters is attributed to human carcinogen and is identified as a major global public health issue. The scale of the problem in terms of population exposure ( 36 million) and geographical area coverage (173 x 10(3) Km(2)) to high arsenic contaminated groundwater (50 - 3200 mug L-1) compared to the National drinking water standard (50 mug L-1) and WHO recommended provisional limit (10 mug L-1) is greatest in the Holocene alluvium and deltaic aquifers of the Bengal Delta Plain ( Bangladesh and West Bengal, India). This large-scale 'natural' high arsenic groundwater poses a great threat to human health via drinking water. Mobilization, metabolism and mitigation issues of high arsenic groundwater are complex and need holistic approach for sustainable development of the resource. Mobilization depends on the redox geochemistry of arsenic that plays a vital role in the release and subsequent transport of arsenic in groundwater. Metabolism narrates the biological response vis-a-vis clinical manifestations of arsenic due to various chemical and biological factors. Mitigation includes alternative source for safe drinking water supply. Drinking water quality regulatory standards as well as guidelines are yet to cover risk assessments for such metal toxicity. Lowering of the ingested inorganic arsenic level and introduction of newer treatment options ( implementation of laterite, the natural material) to ensure safe water supply ( arsenic free and/or low arsenic within permissible limit) are the urgent need to safe guard the mass arsenic poisoning and internal arsenic related health problems.

DT Article
AB In recent years, Geographic Information Systems (GIS) have increasingly been used in a wide array of application contexts for development cooperation in lowlands and mountain areas. When used for planning, implementation, and monitoring, GIS is a versatile and highly efficient tool, particularly in mountain areas characterized by great spatial diversity and inaccessibility. However, the establishment and application of GIS in mountain regions generally presents considerable technical challenges. Moreover, it is necessary to address specific institutional and organizational issues regarding implementation.

TI Using Geographic Information Systems to assess possibilities of
   expanding traditional agroforestry in slash-and-burn zones in Madagascar
SO MOUNTAIN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB Beforona is a mountainous region in eastern Madagascar, where slash-and-burn cultivation (tavy) has been practiced for several generations to produce rice, the staple food of the Malagasy people. This system of cultivation has long been unsustainable (deforestation, erosion, loss of soil fertility, etc). Other types of cultivation considered more sustainable were inventoried in a study, particularly the irrigated rice field and traditional agroforestry system known as tanimboly found in the valleys. On the basis of research results, data were incorporated into a Geographic Information System (GIS) to elaborate descriptive models using different parameters related to this farming system. Spatial distribution of tanimboly shows that more than 90% is concentrated along small streams, in concave areas, and not on slopes and hillsides. Tanimboly becomes scarcer as the distance from the forest edge approaches 2 km, and surface areas are drastically reduced in proportion to distance from roads. GIS and regression models made it possible to identify potential areas for tanimboly. Relations between the various parameters were calculated using logistic regression functions to predict occurrence of the tanimboly phenomenon in nonsampled zones. It appears that farming strategies are particularly influenced by infrastructure.

ID DEFORESTATION
AB This article analyzes a project concerned with the conversion of agricultural land into forests and the impact on local communities in the upper Min River Basin in China. The aim of the project, called "Grain for Green" (Tui Geng Huan Lin), is to improve watershed conditions, enhance biodiversity, and conserve natural resources. Results from a participatory socioeconomic survey showed that the basic living standards of farmers were guaranteed by government subsidies because some of their cultivated land was converted into protected forest. The common perception is that although farmers were happy to participate in the project because they became less dependent on agriculture and were able to diversify their income, they were worried about their future after 8 years of government subsidies and preferred to plant forests for economic rather than ecological reasons. There is also a fear that if subsidies end, farmers may turn forestland into sloping cultivation land. To guarantee sustainable implementation of the Grain for Green Project, farmers discussed options with local government officials. In face-to-face interviews, they discussed issues such as basic cropland protection, educational investment, out-migration of the workforce, hydroelectricity exploitation, and tourism development.

ID SURFACE; GROWTH
AB Controlling materials on multiple length scales is one of the most compelling issues in nanotechnology research today. Here we demonstrate that arrays of nanometer-sized aggregates, each made of a few hundred single-molecule magnets derived from Mn-12 complexes, can be patterned on large areas by self-organization assisted by stamps on a surface in a dewetting regime. The large length scale is imposed by the motif of the stamp protrusions, and the smaller length scales, viz., the size and distance of the molecular aggregates, are controlled by deposition and growth phenomena occurring in a volume confined beneath the protrusions by capillary forces. The method is general to a variety of molecular materials and substrates because repulsive, as opposed to specific, interactions are required. Our result hints at the possibility of sustainable patterning of single-molecule magnets for ultra-high-density magnetic storage and quantum computing.

AB This article analyses the question: do attitudes towards risk influence participation in small-scale gold mining, a hazardous activity that generates uncertain income? This question is examined by measuring and comparing the risk attitudes of gold miners and non-mining community members in the rainforest of Suriname, South America. The author presents a multivariate model to predict the duration of work in mining areas as a function of risk tolerance, age, education, and household demographics.
   The results suggest that a greater tolerance to risk increases the duration of a person's mining career. However, attitudes explain only a fraction of the variation in occupational choices. Qualitative data suggest that these choices are primarily shaped by local barriers to human capital development and by national economic volatility. Given their marginal position in society and the multitude of mining risk mitigation strategies, it is questionable whether gold mining exposes Suriname forest peoples to greater risks than other subsistence alternatives. The author argues that sensitivity to local historical and cultural conditions would improve the efficiency of policies aimed at developing a more sustainable mining industry. By zooming in on the daily lives of miners, anthropology can complement macro-scale analyses and contribute to policy interventions in the small-scale mining sector.

AB Against the background of the current state of provision of drinking water and sanitation in the world - with one billion lacking safe water, and 2.2 billion not having adequate sanitation - this article argues that private participation is necessary. The most important issues for the management of water utilities in the 21(st) century are identified as mobilizing investment for the highly capital intensive operation of water supply and sanitation infrastructure, and achieving efficiency in the delivery of services. The article highlights the issues that need to be raised if private investment is to be seriously considered as an alternative. Case studies, especially from Latin America (Argentina, Chile, Peru, Bolivia), illustrate different modes of private participation, and possible reasons for successes and failures are discussed.
   The article stresses that regardless of the modality of private sector involvement, on-going government regulatory responsibilily in the water sector is crucial. It suggests that regulatory policy must go beyond just setting tariffs, to develop standards for drinking water quality and waste treatment, as well as other standards. In conclusion, the article recognizes that numerous and increasingly difficult challenges face utilities in fulfilling their responsibility to deliver drinking water of adequate quality, in sufficient quantity, and at affordable prices, as well as safe and sustainable disposal of wastewaters for members of urban and rural communities.

AB Although widely used, the most promising Li-based technologies still suffer from a lack of suitable electrodes. There is therefore a need to seek new materials concepts to satisfy the increasing demands for energy storage worldwide. Here we report on a new layered electrode material, Cu2.33V4O11, which shows a sustainable reversible capacity of 270 mA h g(-1) at a voltage of about 2.7 V, and electrochemically reacts with Li in an unusual and spectacular way. The reaction entails a reversible Li-driven displacement process leading to the growth and disappearance of Cu dendrites with a concomitant reversible decomposition and recrystallization of the initial electrode material. We show from structural considerations that the uniqueness of Cu2.33V4O11 is rooted in the peculiar flexibility of the stacked [V4O11](n) layers, which is due to the presence of pivot oxygen atoms. Fully reversible displacement reactions could provide a new direction for developing an alternative class of higher energy density Li storage electrodes.

   MANAGEMENT; SPORT FISHERIES; FISH; RECRUITMENT; HARVEST; TRENDS; MODEL
AB Sustainable exploitation of Ontario's aquatic resources calls for a new management approach. This vast resource includes more than 250,000 lakes and offers angling opportunities for many popular species (e.g., walleye Sander vitreus [formerly Stizostedion vitreum], lake trout Salvelinus namaycush, brook trout S. fontinalis, northern pike Esox lucius, smallmouth bass Micropterus dolomieu, largemouth bass M. salmoides, and muskellunge E. masquinongy). In pioneer days, the "apparently inexhaustible abundance of resources" fostered an open-access policy promoting the recreational use of these resources for the benefit of the economy. After World War II, there was a rapid increase in angling effort and by the 1970s many lakes were being overexploited. Clearly, an unrestricted, open-access policy was no longer appropriate. The result has been a rapid proliferation of fishing regulations as exceptions to divisionsvide regulations that were created to protect lakes where problems were detected. The growing complexity of these regulations is the result of a management approach that has focused on individual lakes. This complexity is not popular with the angling public, and evaluation of its benefits has proven difficult because a change in regulations on one lake may affect fishing effort on other lakes. We argue that a larger spatial and temporal scale of management is needed when a resource is widely dispersed across a large population of lakes. This new approach should incorporate (1) consensus on biologically achievable objectives, (2) periodic, unbiased assessment of the state of the resource, (3) periodic evaluation to decide whether current management practices are meeting objectives, and (4) adaptive management in choosing among alternative management actions. Recent progress towards establishing this management approach in Ontario is discussed.

TI Initial attempts to actively manage recreational fishery harvest in
   Minnesota
SO NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT

DT Article
ID LAKE; ECOSYSTEMS; LIMITS; CATCH
AB The theories and management style of commercial fisheries management have recently been applied to recreational fisheries. Several Minnesota recreational fisheries are now managed with target harvest levels based on sustainable yield predictors or quotas based on constant fishing mortality rate strategies. Creel limits and length-based regulations are being used to meet established targets or quotas. Three case histories are described. Both benefits and shortcomings have resulted from applying commercial fisheries management programs directly to recreational fisheries. However, recreational fisheries managers may not be controlling total fish harvest. To effectively manage recreational fisheries for "safe satisfaction returns," fisheries managers may need to adopt conservative, robust harvest regulations, kill quotas, or aggressive regulations on how people fish. The distribution and mix of those options can be determined by good social science, but the efficacy of managing for safe satisfaction returns will depend on good fisheries data (biological and sociological) and great social skill. The lessons learned from the three case histories reviewed could be used to improve recreational fisheries management.

AB Community-based research. projects are critically needed to reduce health disparities and ensure the delivery of health care that is culturally appropriate and relevant to families and communities. The purpose of this article is to share experiences and lessons learned from utilizing a participatory action approach in a series of five subprojects within the Indian Family Stories Project. Participatory action research (PAR) focuses on identifying community needs and designing action plans in partnership with the community. To effectively implement PAR projects, investigators need to: (a) Build and maintain strong, collaborative working relationships with a broad network of community representatives, (b) Secure funding that addresses community needs and provides mechanisms for giving back to the community, (c) Ensure that the project fits the particular cultural and community context, (d) Evaluate and adapt the project as needed, (e) Keep the community informed, (f) Develop sustainable community resources, and (g) Advocate on behalf of the community.

TI Group prenatal care and preterm birth weight: Results from a matched
   cohort study at public clinics
SO OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID RANDOMIZED-TRIAL; RISK; VISITS; GROWTH; WOMEN; MODEL
AB OBJECTIVE: To examine the impact of group versus individual prenatal care on birth weight and gestational age.
   METHODS: This prospective, matched cohort study included pregnant women (N = 458) entering prenatal care at 24 or less weeks' gestation; one half received group prenatal care with women of the same gestational age. Women were matched by clinic, age, race, parity, and infant birth date. Women were predominantly black and Hispanic of low socioeconomic status, served by one of three public clinics in Atlanta, Georgia or New Haven, Connecticut.
   RESULTS: Birth weight was greater for infants of women in group versus individual prenatal care (P <.01). Among those born preterm, infants of group patients were significantly larger than infants of individual-care patients (mean, 2398 versus 1990 g, P <.05). Although not statistically significant, infants of group patients were less likely than those of individual-care patients to be low birth weight (less than 2500 g; 16 versus 23 infants); very low birth weight (less than 1500 g; three versus six infants); early preterm (less than 33 weeks; two versus seven infants); or to experience neonatal loss (none versus three infants). There were no differences in number of prenatal visits or other risk characteristics (patient age, race, prior preterm birth).
   CONCLUSIONS: Group prenatal care results in higher birth weight, especially for infants delivered preterm. Group prenatal care provides a structural innovation, permitting more time for provider-patient interaction and therefore the opportunity to address clinical as well as psychological, social, and behavioral factors to promote healthy pregnancy. Results have implications for design of sustainable prenatal services that might contribute to reduction of racial disparities in adverse perinatal outcomes.

AB A highly photosensitive Sb/Er/Ge-codoped silica fiber for fabricating fiber Bragg gratings (FBGs) with strong high-temperature sustainability is presented. The photosensitivity and the high-temperature sustainability of FBGs created in this fiber are examined and compared with those produced in a Sn-doped silica fiber. The results show that the Sb/Er/Ge fiber has a much higher level of photosensitivity than the Sn-doped silica fiber and that the FBGs have a similar high-temperature sustainability of 800 degreesC. The strong fluorescence properties observed from this fiber are also examined. (C) 2003 Optical Society of America.

AB Successful revegetation of bauxite residue sand (BRS) requires large inputs of nutrients such as manganese (Mn), yet Mn deficiency is still encountered, raising doubts about sustainable revegetation of BRS disposal areas. The application of deep placement of Mn, a measure common in agriculture, was examined as a method for improving productivity and sustainability when lucerne ( Medicago sativa L.) is used as a species for BRS revegetation. In pots containing BRS, Mn was banded at 2.5-, 10- and 20-cm depths at rates of 10, 20 and 50 mug g(-1) BRS. Two lucerne genotypes used were Salado, a Mn-deficiency-tolerant variety, and Sirosal, a Mn-deficiency-sensitive variety. Banding at 10- cm depth produced the best shoot growth of Sirosal at each Mn rate. Greatest shoot growth in Salado was found at 2.5-, 10- and 20-cm depths for 10, 20 and 50 mug Mn g(-1) BRS, respectively. Deep banding 20 mug Mn g(-1) BRS at 10-cm depth significantly increased lucerne growth compared with mixing through the profile. Banding at 20 cm produced Mn deficiency symptoms in lucerne during early growth, but symptoms were alleviated when sufficient amounts of roots proliferated in the banding zone. Dissolution and movement of Mn away from the fertiliser band were also investigated. In pots without plants, water throughput from watering twice weekly to 110% field capacity had no effect on the amount of extractable Mn at distances more than 1 cm away from the original Mn band position. Whilst not only providing a more effective supply of Mn for BRS revegetation over one growth period, deep-banding of adequate rates of Mn may also result in a longer residual value, reducing the need for frequent broadcast applications.

AB Halley the 50-year-old Antarctic survey station where the hole in the ozone layer was discovered, is by necessity in one of the most inhospitable parts of the earth. Its resident staff are exposed to temperatures down to -55degreesC and winds up to 150 km/h, Everything they build eventually gets embedded in a moving ice shelf. As such, the first four stations were abandoned after ten years or so. The current station, Halley S, is radically different from previous designs in that it uses a mix of Jackable and ski-mounted structures, However, there is still room for improvement, particularly in regard to energy use, and Halley 6-already on the drawing board-is likely to be a further major step forward in sustainable ice-station design.

AB Civil engineering infrastructure is generally maintained in accordance with safety, economic and technical issues. But what of the environmental impact of such activities? Regular maintenance can have a significant environmental impact-particularly in the case of bridges, where closure can result in traffic jams and lengthy detours. Higher cost but lower maintenance components and transfer of structures to lower-grade sites are Possible answers which, until now, have been difficult to assess. This paper reports on a life-cycle assessment method developed to factor environmental impact into bridge maintenance strategy. Though developed for bridges, it has potential application throughout the facilities management sector.

AB Endocrine disruption has been reported in freshwater fish populations around the world. This phenomenon ranges from subtle changes in the physiology and sexual behavior of fish to permanently altered sexual differentiation and impairment of fertility. Despite widespread reports of endocrine disruption in fish (and this is well characterized at the individual level), few studies have demonstrated population-level consequences as a result of exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs). An exception to this is in Lake Ontario Lake trout where precipitous declines in the population have been linked with periods of high exposure to organochlorine chemicals (known EDCs). Recently, it has been established that roach (Rutilus rutilus) exposed to treated sewage effluent (that contains complex mixtures of EDCs) in UK rivers, have a reduced reproductive capacity. This, in turn, may have population-level consequences.
   Evidence for a link between exposure to effluents from kraft mill (BKME) and sewage treatment works (STW) and altered reproductive function in freshwater fish is compelling. In most cases, however, a causal link between a specific chemical and a physiological effect has not been established. Indeed, identifying specific chemical(s) responsible for adverse effects observed in the wild is difficult, given that tens of thousands of man-made chemicals enter the aquatic environment and that mixtures of chemicals can have combination (e.g., additive) effects. Some EDCs are known to act at a number of different body targets to affect a variety of physiological processes, further complicating the identification of the causative agent(s).
   Endocrine disruption appears to be particularly widespread in freshwater fish populations. There is little evidence, however, to suggest fish are more susceptible to EDCs relative to other wildlife. Notwithstanding this, there are some features of the endocrine physiology of fish that may be particularly susceptible to the effects of EDCs, including the processes of sex-determination and smoltification (in salmonids). Furthermore, their aquatic existence means that fish can be bathed constantly in a solution containing pollutants. In addition, uptake of chemicals readily occurs via the gills and skin, as well as via the diet (the major exposure route for most EDCs in terrestrial animals). The exposure of fish early life stages to the cocktail of EDCs present in some aquatic environments may be of particular concern, given that this is an especially vulnerable period in their development.
   The challenge, from the point of view of ecological risk assessment, is to determine effects of EDCs on freshwater fish populations and freshwater ecosystems. In order to meet this challenge, high-quality data are required on the population biology of freshwater fish, on the effects of EDCs on their various life history characteristics, and comprehensive and appropriate population models. Basic information on the population biology of most species of wild freshwater fish is, however, extremely limited, and needs significant improvement for use in deriving a sound understanding of how EDCs affect fish population sustainability. Notwithstanding this, we need to start to undertake possible/probable predictions of population level effects of EDCs using data derived from the effects found in individual fish. Furthermore, information on the geographical extent of endocrine disruption in freshwater fish is vital for understanding the impact of EDCs in fish populations. This can be derived using published statistical associations between endocrine disruption in individual fish and pollutant concentration in receiving waters. Simplistic population models, based on the effects of EDCs on the reproductive success of individual fish can also used to model the likely population responses to EDCs. Wherever there is sufficient evidence for endocrine disruption in freshwater fish and the need for remediation has been established, then there is a need to focus on how these problems can be alleviated. Where industrial chemicals are identified as causative agents, a practical program of tighter regulation for their discharge and/or a switch to alternative chemicals (which do not act as EDCs) is needed. There are recent examples where such strategies have been adopted, and these have been successful in reducing the impacts of EDCs from point source discharges on freshwater fish. Where EDCs are of natural origin (e.g., sex steroid hormones from human and animal waste), however, remediation is a more difficult task. Regulation of the release of these chemicals can probably be achieved only by improvements in treatment processes and/or the implementation of systems that specifically remove and degrade them before their discharge into the aquatic environment.

SO RENEWABLE ENERGY
LA English
DT Article
AB The potential of electric power generation from marine tidal currents is enormous. Tidal currents are being recognised as a resource to be exploited for the sustainable generation of electrical power. The high load factors resulting from the fluid properties and the predictable resource characteristics make marine currents particularly attractive for power generation and advantageous when compared to other renewables. There is a paucity of information regarding various key aspects of system design encountered in this new area of research. Virtually no work has been done to determine the characteristics of turbines running in water for kinetic energy conversion even though relevant work has been carried out on ship's propellers, wind turbines and on hydro turbines. None of these three well established areas of technology completely overlap with this new field so that gaps remain in the state of knowledge. This paper reviews the fundamental issues that are likely to play a major role in implementation of MCT systems. It also highlights research areas to be encountered in this new area. The paper reports issues such as the harsh marine environment, the phenomenon of cavitation, and the high stresses encountered by such structures are likely to play a major role on the work currently being undertaken in this field.

ID ESTABLISHMENT
AB Widespread marketing technologies recomend the use of high doses of chemical fertilizers and the control of pests and diseases to maintain the productive potential of farms. This affects the sustainability of the coffee agroecosystem, creating a total dependence of industrialized products. The objective of this study was to compare the alterations of some chemical, physical, and microbiological characteristics of a Typic Hapludox from the region of Santo Antonio do Amparo (Minas Gerais State, Brazil), in agroecosystems of "organic coffee"; "in conversion"; and "conventional" coffee production, to a native forest fragment. Data were collected throughout one year on two farms, under the influence of similar climate and relief conditions, and using the same cultivar (Acaia IAC474-19) of equal age (five years). Soil samples were collected twice (July 1999 and December 1999) at a depth of 0-20 cm. The principal component analysis allowed a comprehensive visualization of the characteristics that most influenced the soil behavior in the different studied systems. In general, the management forms for the production of organic, in conversion and conventional plantations increased the soil fertility in comparison to the soil under the native forest fragment. Larger chemical characteristic alterations were observed in the agroecosystem of organic coffee production in relation to the conventional; there were increments in the values of soil pH and Ca, Mg, K, P, Zn, B, CTC, base saturation, and decrease of exchangeable Al.

AB Few studies have investigated the impact of immunization campaigns conducted under the global polio eradication program on sustainability of polio vaccination coverage, on coverage of non-polio vaccines (administered under Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI)), and on changes in social inequities in immunization coverage. This study proposes to fill the gaps in the evidence by investigating the impact of a polio immunization campaign launched in India in 1995.
   The study uses a before-and-after study design using representative samples from rural areas of four North Indian states. The National Family Health Survey I (NFHS I) and NFHS II, conducted in 1992-93 and 1998-99 respectively, were used as pre- and post-intervention data. Using pooled data from both the surveys, multivariate logistic regression models with interaction terms were used to investigate the changes in social inequities.
   During the study period, a greater increase was observed in the coverage of first dose of polio compared to three doses of polio. Moderate improvements in at least one dose of non-polio EPI vaccinations, and no improvements in complete immunization against non-polio EPI diseases were observed. The polio campaign was successful, to some extent, in reducing gender-, caste- and wealth-based inequities, but had no impact on religion- or residence-based inequities. Social inequities in non-polio EPI vaccinations did not reduce during the study period.
   Significant dropouts between first and third dose of polio raise concerns of sustainability of immunization coverage under a campaign approach. Similarly, little evidence to support synergy between polio campaign and non-polio EPI vaccinations raises questions about the effects of polio campaign on routine health system's functions. However, moderate success of the polio campaign in reducing social inequities in polio coverage may offer valuable insights into the routine health systems for addressing persistent social inequities in access to health care.

AB The state government of Acre, Brazil, has integrated ecological, cultural, social, and economic forest values into a comprehensive forest policy to manage Acre's abundance of comparatively pristine forests, while couching specific goals and the processes for achieving them within a broader sustainable development framework. Inspired by the rubber tapper culture and social movement, policy implementation has been advanced with broad support from national and international allies. While these experiments in forest-based development serve as a hopeful alternative to the steady deforestation observed in Amazonia, many long-term ecological, economic, cultural, and political challenges remain for sustaining and adapting these policy initiatives.

AB To design viable strategies to implement sustainable forest management, tools are needed that allow the understanding and management of the driving forces behind conflicting opinions and divergent solutions. The approach of Thompson et al. (1990) to cultural theory-because of its descriptive power-may be an ideal basis to create such tools. The possibility of determining empirically the cultural bias of the actors and groups involved is fundamental to this approach. We conducted a pilot study in the eastern Amazon region to explore the possibility of characterizing individuals according to the four types of political culture defined by Thompson et al. The findings indicated that the empirical classification of individuals is possible but complex. A relation between the types of political cultures and perceptions of sustainable forest management was observed. A systematic elaboration of adequate indicators and assessment methods is crucial in exploring the potential of transferring the theoretical approach into practice.

AB There have been two distinct chapters in the history of converting cellulosic biomass to fuels and commodity chemicals in South Africa. The first chapter, from the late 1970s to the early 1990s, involved some of the most active research and development efforts of their kind anywhere in the world. Thereafter, during the second chapter, there has been very little activity in the field in South Africa while there has been an unprecedented awakening to the potential of biomass conversion elsewhere. This paper considers the rationale and possible benefits of a potential third chapter based on a revitalized effort on biomass conversion in South Africa. Such an enterprise would build on the country's large biomass production potential, strong technical capability in yeast biotechnology, a well-developed research and development infrastructure in biological processing, and expertise derived from the largest non-petroleum hydrocarbon processing industry in the world. Substantial societal benefits could be realized that address critically important national needs, including the utilization of sustainable resources, industrial development, and improved balance of payments. Moreover, establishing a modern biomass processing industry in South Africa appears to represent one of the largest potential sources of rural employment identified to date. We propose steps to realizing these benefits.

   PERSPECTIVE; METABOLISM; EXPRESSION; LEGUMES; SEEDS
AB Approximately eight species of southern African legumes are currently used as sustainable food crops. Biotechnology has the potential to improve the productivity of growing these plants by small-scale farmers who cannot afford sufficient phosphate fertilizer to optimize their nitrogen fixation and hence conversion to edible protein. The metabolic adaptations that enable legumes to fix atmospheric nitrogen are currently being investigated by our group for the purpose of genetic modification to enhance crop yields. Until now, attempts at modifying host plants or symbiotic bacteria have not significantly enhanced N-2 fixation. We propose, instead, to bioengineer the key enzymes that control the mechanisms involved in protein formation. This may lead to enhanced seed protein content, which would be of advantage to poor communities that rely on this source of food. We postulate that misregulation of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPc) could be exploited by biotechnology to improve N-2 fixation and protein content. We have found that, as distinct from their roots, legume nodules are under permanent phosphate stress, even during optimal phosphate supply to the host plant, implying that the development of phosphate stress may engage different forms of PEPc to ensure continued nodule functioning.

ID GROWTH
AB Increasingly, pine plantations worldwide are grown using early control of woody and/or herbaceous vegetation. Assured sustainable practices require long-term data on pine plantation development detailing patterns and processes to understand both crop-competition dynamics and the role of stand participants in providing multiple attributes such as biodiversity conservation and wildlife habitat. This study examined loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) plantations across 13 southeastern sites grown for 15 yr with near-complete control of woody, herbaceous, and woody plus herbaceous components during the first 3-5 yr compared to no plant control. This multiple objective experiment (the COMProject) documents stand dynamics at the extreme corners of a response surface that encompasses most conditions of woody and herbaceous competition common to pine plantations in the region. This is the first of two companion reports. After 15 yr, patterns of stand development remained significantly altered by early control treatments and were influenced most by the amounts of hardwoods and shrubs present or controlled. Herbaceous components were more similar across the region. Associated plants in these plantations included 68 species of trees, 33 species/genera of shrubs, and 140 genera of herbaceous and semiwoody plants, woody vines, clubmoss, and ground lichen-241 total taxa or an estimated 490 total species-more richness than previously reported or assumed. Hardwood rootstock numbers were on average maintained at fairly constant levels from yr 1-15 when not controlled, with no initial lag phase evident for reestablishment, indicating prior stand origin. Dynamics of associated vegetation were significantly altered with woody control initially increasing herbaceous cover, while herbaceous control increased hardwood cover and decreased shrub cover. After early herbaceous control, hardwood basel area (BA) was increased by an average of 28%. After rapid early colonization, herbaceous plants began to decline on all treatments about yr 8 as pine and/or hardwood canopy cover reached a total of 50-60%, while woody vines continued to increase. By age 15, plant component richness remained significantly changed by early treatments at all locations, most notably fewer tree species after early woody control.

AB Conventional continuous slab casting currently represents the best method for producing material for top-grade cold strip. Steady optimisation of the metallurgy and of the casting process has made it possible to reduce the material-induced defects in cold strip considerably. The present report describes the route taken by ThyssenKrupp Stahl AG over the past few years to achieve this goal. The classic continuous casting defects, such as slivers deriving from near-surface casting powder or slag inclusions, and especially blisters typical for bow type casters, have been sustainably reduced in this respect. So-called inclusion bands beneath the slab surface have also diminished to such an extent, thanks to substantial improvements in the secondary metallurgy, that even the surface of top-grade cold strip is no longer significantly affected.
   In the course of the investigations it has been possible to identify a further, independent defect type: the so-called microcrack defect. These are very fine subsurface cracks at the cast slab which have frequently been detectable only after the material has undergone initial or even final rolling. This defect type has so far either remained unconsidered among the host of classic defect types or has been wrongly attributed to the hot rolling process. Confirmed by controlled high-temperature simulations in a continuous casting simulator, it has now been possible to attribute this defect to a primary solidification phenomenon, namely the formation of fine interdendritic hot cracks beneath the slab surface, which is free of defects at the moment of the cracks' formation. The understanding gained in the meantime concerning the defect's causes will enable further optimisation of the continuous casting process.

TI Greening the United Nations' Human Development Index?
SO SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
ID SUSTAINABILITY; INDICATORS; GROWTH
AB The Human Development Index (HDI) introduced by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in 1990 has helped facilitate widespread debate amongst development researchers, practitioners and policy makers. The HDI is an aggregate index, calculated on an annual basis by the UNDP and published in its Human Development Reports, comprising measures of three components deemed by them to be central to development: W income (the gross domestic product per capita), (ii) education (adult literacy rate) and (iii) health (life expectancy at birth).
   The results of calculating the HDI are typically presented as country/regional league tables, and provide a quick means for policy makers and others to judge performance. Perhaps partly because of the relative simplicity of the index, the HDI has managed to achieve a level of acceptance and use amongst politicians and policy makers that has yet to emerge with any indicator of sustainability.
   Indeed, despite its existence for 11 years, including nine years after the Rio Earth Summit, the HDI has not even been modified to take on board wider issues of sustainability. This paper will critically examine the potential for 'greening' the HDI so as to include environmental and resource-consumption dimensions.

TI Sustainability assessment in the German detergent industry: From
   stakeholder involvement to sustainability indicators
SO SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB Since the early years of environmentalism, the detergent industry has been under pressure from NGOs and consumers. While the path towards an integrated product policy has been set, further developments towards sustainability are necessary.
   In a project conducted by the University of Oldenburg in cooperation with the German Detergent Manufacturers Association (IKW), future potentials for sustainable development were investigated. From this, a set of indicators was developed.
   This paper will review the project methodology, where a stakeholder assessment plays a key role, and present some findings. Stakeholder interviews and two workshops allowed discovery of the central issues to be tackled by the German detergent industry.
   The environmental product life-cycle and stakeholder concept provide the theoretical basis for the so called sustainability matrices, one each for the environmental, economic and social dimensions. These matrices were used to facilitate discussions regarding relevant sustainability issues and indicators. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.

TI Sustainability development analysis of semi-intensive shrimp farms in
   Sonora, Mexico
SO SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
ID AQUACULTURE; FISHERIES
AB During the year 2000, 12 modified and five new sustainable development indicators (SDIs) were applied and a sustainable index (SI) was developed for 21 out of the 33 semi-intensive shrimp farms in Sonora, Mexico, to measure their sustainable development. Farms 5, 7 and 19 showed the highest values in social indicators, farms 5, 7 and 19 in the economic indicators and farms 2, 3 and 4 in natural indicators. In contrast farms 9, 16 and 17 obtained the lowest values in social indicators, farms 3 and 11 in the economic indicators, and farms 9, 11 and 16 in natural indicators. In the SI, farm 9 obtained the lowest value, farm 20 the highest, and most farms values between 6 and 7. In Sonora most of the semi-intensive shrimp farms avoided adverse impacts on the environment by constructing on salty or and lands with no mangroves. Most of the projects are communal and benefits go directly to the population, giving Sonora, in comparison with other regions, a more sustainable development.

SO SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
ID ETHICS
AB This study attempts to use the shark fin business in Hong Kong as a case to illustrate its challenge to international sustainability and global environmental governance. Regarding the commercial fishing of sharks and the degradation of the species, the paper begins with a survey of characteristics of sharks in the world and the responses from the international environmental agents. The authors will then detail their statistical findings, together with interviews with the shark fin manufacturers in Hong Kong. Their study began in 1999 and the statistical data ran from 1977 to 2001. Finally, the so-called 'foodway' in the consumption of shark fin will be discussed with a view to the international concerns over endangered species in general and sharks in particular.

ID MODAL CHOICE; TRAVEL; BEHAVIOR
AB The heightening of issues, such as sustainable development and environmental pollution have resulted in many governments pursuing transport policies which aim to promote the use of public transport modes, including walking, as well as discourage the use of the car for various activities, such as shopping, work, recreation, etc. However, little has been done on understanding shoppers' perceptions of transport modes for shopping purposes. Particularly, not much research has been done on examining the attitudes of car owners and non-car owners towards transport modes for shopping purposes. Using Singapore as a study area, this study has attempted to analyse car owners and non-car owners' perceptions of the different types of transport modes (i.e., car, taxi, bus, mass rapid transit and walk) in their shopping trips. The research found that each transport mode has its own unique set of attributes. In addition, car owners and non-car owners portray different attitudes towards the public transport modes and the car. This calls for different strategies for these two groups of shoppers in encouraging them to use the public transport modes and restrain the use of the car.

AB A field study was conducted during 1997 to 2001 on a Dundee silt loam soil at Stoneville, MS, to examine the effects of rye and crimson clover residues on weeds, soil properties, soil microbial populations, and soybean yield in conventional tillage (CT) and no-tillage (NT) systems with preemergence (PRE)-only, postemergence (POST)-only, and PRE plus POST herbicide programs. Rye and crimson clover were planted in October, desiccated in April, and tilled (CT plots only) before planting soybean. Both cover-crop residues reduced density of barnyardgrass, broadleaf signalgrass, browntop millet, entireleaf morningglory, and hyssop spurge but did not affect yellow nutsedge at 7 wk after soybean planting (WAP) in the absence of herbicides. Densities of these weed species were generally lower with PRE-only, POST-only, and PRE plus POST applications than with no-herbicide treatment. Total weed dry biomass was lower when comparing CT (1,570 kg ha(-1)) with NT (1,970 kg ha(-1)), rye (1,520 kg ha(-1)) with crimson clover (2,050 kg ha(-1)), and PRE plus POST (640 kg ha(-1)) with PRE-only (1,870 kg ha(-1)) or POST-only (1,130 kg ha(-1)) treatments at 7 WAR Soils with crimson clover had higher organic matter, NO3-N, SO4-S, and Mn, and lower pH compared with rye and no-cover crop soils. Total fungi and bacterial populations and fluorescein diacetate hydrolytic activity were higher in soil with crimson clover, followed by rye and no cover crop. Soybean yields were similar between CT (1,830 kg ha(-1)) and NT (1,960 kg ha(-1)), no cover crop (2,010 kg ha(-1)) and rye (1,900 kg ha(-1)), and rye and crimson clover (1,790 kg ha(-1)), but they were higher in PRE plus POST (2,260 kg ha(-1)) than in PRE-only (1,890 kg ha(-1)) or POST-only (1,970 kg ha(-1)) treatments.

ID NATURAL-RESOURCES; ECONOMIES
AB An important connection between recent attempts to understand the determinants of economic growth and the measurement of sustainability is the finding of a negative and significant relationship between natural resource abundance and economic growth. This is the so-called resource curse hypothesis. Using cross-country regressions, we offer evidence that the curse may itself be a manifestation of the inability of governments to manage large resource revenues sustainably. In particular, these results offer another perspective on the resource curse hypothesis: the countries where growth has lagged are those where the combination of natural resource, macroeconomic and public expenditure policies have led to a low rate of genuine saving (net saving adjusted for resource depletion).

ID TECHNOLOGY
AB This paper reviews a recent donor-funded project concerning the introduction of post-harvest technology to poor hill farmers in India. Rather than conform to conventional development aid projects of either a "research" or an "interventionist" nature, it combines both approaches in a research-action program, which has more in common with a business development approach than a formal social science One. An important conclusion is that the work (and apparent success) of the project is consistent with an understanding of development that emphasizes the importance of innovation systems. It is also an example of the importance of continuous learning and of institutional change. In contrast to much conventional development aid, it is an interesting example of how projects can actually lead to long-term sustainable changes that survive the withdrawal of the donor, having built capacity that truly means self-sufficiency. It is therefore an approach that deserves careful consideration on the part of all participants in international development. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Who is responsible for the ongoing degradation of natural resources such as agricultural soils, rangeland, and forests? Evidence from across Latin America suggests that the nonpoor and the poor are both at fault. While the poor lack the means to invest in protecting natural resources, both the nonpoor and the poor often lack the incentives for good resource stewardship. Policies for agricultural intensification and livelihood diversification can alleviate poverty and its capacity constraint. But incentive policies for good stewardship are critically needed. Such policies should be targeted to specific environmental problems and tailored to the motivations of rural decision makers. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The causes of tropical deforestation are many and complex, but relative financial returns at the household level play a large role in determining which activities and investments are pursued. A farm-level bioeconomic model indicates that the best course for smallholders in the western Brazilian Amazon who seek to boost consumption levels over time is to convert forest to agriculture. Results of a simulated experiment show that permitting sustainable off-take of timber products on farms would improve incomes and slow smallholder deforestation, but use of cleared land would be little changed. Because such strong financial incentives exist to harvest timber unsustainably, mechanisms for monitoring timber off-take will be required. The costs of establishing and maintaining them should be shared among all beneficiaries of the environmental services provided by forests. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Multiple regression analysis of 1999 farm survey data from the Peruvian Altiplano finds that natural resource sustainability is not correlated with poverty; rather it varies by management activity. Soil erosion and fertility loss are reduced by fallowing, a practice of poorer farmers. Overgrazing and range species loss are increased by herd size (a measure of wealth) but reduced by rotational grazing, which is size-neutral. Deforestation-the only case of a clear poverty-environment link-results from fuel wood harvesting by the poorest households. Social and human capital variables favor the choice of more sustainable practices. When government investment is unavailable, change agents in poor areas can limit natural resource degradation by diffusing knowledge about natural resource stewardship using affordable practices.

AB German animal production assures food security with high quality and safe products. Nevertheless, German animal production is exposed to forces resulting from competition, societal trends, animal welfare, sustainability, environment, lobbying, ideologies and the political and legal frame work. The workshop aimed to discuss the present status and future of German animal production. Current high pressure resulting from cost could possibly be eased by enhanced vertical integration, by alternation of structural deficits and by improved communication with the consumer. Equally, politics must create a more favourable environment for animal production. Finally, the consumer must be willing to pay for product quality, which at present is not the case. German animal production must be competive internationally and should thus have a chance to produce in line with internationally accepted standards in order to remain competitive. Animal welfare and animal health need to develop based on scientific knowledge and established practical experience.
   Environment and ressource management will need a change in current paradigm based on differentiated and scientifically sound concepts and based on a clear definition of goals to be achieved. Ressourcemanagement includes efficient use of feed ressources notably of limited feed ressources (e.g. Phosphours). It needs improvement in order to reduce ressource use per unit of product and to reduce unwanted waste. Breeding strategies have, in the past, contributed considerably to improve efficiency, but existing problems can not be denied. The enhanced use of balanced breeding goals and the use of new technologies (e.g. molecular genetics) are promising venues for the future. Visions and perceptions for the future of German animal production include that animal production will be more sustainable, innovative, communicative and integrated; societal needs and preferences relative to quality and animal welfare will receive increased attention, new technologies will be of paramount importance, provided a competition oriented framework will exist.

AB Intensive animal production is characterised by a high biological and economic productivity with a simultaneously low input of labour, energy and space per animal. As a rule, intensive pig production results in bigger production units (herds), specialisation, standardised production procedures and regional concentration of specialised farms.
   The chances are a definitively increased competitiveness, a potential reduction of the environmental pollution (due to the increased productivity), and, most of all, the possibilty of a stringent quality management of the entire production process.
   The risks are a more fragile health status of the bigger population, which needs a more stringent management than in smaller herds, since the disease dynamics are changing with the population size. Apart from health, housing and husbandry conditions (such as flooring etc.) can have a negative impact on animal welfare. Recruiting the appropriate personnel for the demanding work in bigger specialised pig herds can be a problem under the current labour market situation. Furthermore, achieving and maintaining the acceptance of the non-agricultural society for intensive food animal, production is a challenge, which has been underestimated for a too long time.
   Solving these problems cannot be achieved by only the farming community, but politicians and industry associations need to act as well. There is an urgent need to improve the process quality of production chains for food of animal origin by establishing systems with a high health status (vertically coordinated production chains), highly qualified consulting and high-quality post gradual education programs. It has been demonstrated that there is the necessity of taking into consideration the biological needs of the animal, when health programs and husbandry systems are designed and implemented. Additionally, it needs to be tested, whether there are possibilities to increase the animals' adaptability to modern husbandry systems by improved genetic selection procedures.
   With optimised management systems it is possible to produce affordable and high-quality and safe food of animal origin and yet meet the society's demands for animal protection and for the sustainability of the production of food with and from animals.

AB Soil compaction and soil erosion can be severe environmental hazards which are closely related to agricultural land use. In arable cropping, conservation tillage can be an effective means to protect the environment against these hazards. In Germany, awareness of the ecological and economical benefits has resulted in a substantial increase in the beet crop area cultivated with conservation tillage systems during recent years (about 25% of the national beet crop in 2002). These tillage systems require less input in terms of energy (minus 8%) and are characterized by plant residues remaining on the soil surface (10 to 50% of soil cover) to prevent soil erosion (soil losses reduced by 95%). Additionally, the stable soil structure produced by conservation tillage increases the machine-bearing capacity and protects against subsoil compaction. On the other hand, the development of pests and diseases (slugs, Drechslera tritici-repentis (DTR) and Fusarium sp. in wheat) can be promoted by plant residues on the soil surface. These aspects are reviewed with reference to long term results from German field experiments.

AB In Australia, the shrimp farming industry operates within strict environmental guidelines applied at national and state government levels. In this paper, we briefly review the current status of the development of an ecologically sustainable shrimp fanning industry in Australia and the future research priorities to assist in maintaining sustainable development. The broad objectives of the current regulations governing shrimp aquaculture in Australia are to achieve appropriately sited and operated facilities. However, there are differences amongst the various jurisdictions, and these need to be reconciled. Currently, shrimp farm discharge regulations are based on permissible characteristics of discharge water quality. These parameters are highly variable over short time frames, and this presents a significant barrier to the development of cost-effective sampling strategies that accurately reflect trends in farm discharges. Furthermore, water quality parameters may provide little information about the effect of discharges on the ecology of the receiving waters. We describe more sophisticated indicators of the potential impacts of shrimp pond discharges, including the delta(15)N-nitrogen isotopic ratios in marine plants, which integrate the high variability in water quality parameters. In many shrimp-farming countries, including Australia, there is an increasing trend towards the use of sedimentation ponds (=settling ponds, settling basins) for treating pond effluent prior to discharge or recirculation. Despite this trend, the performance of such systems has rarely been studied at farm scale, and therefore their effectiveness is poorly understood. We have examined the nutrient reduction performance of sedimentation ponds on a commercial farm over an entire production season. The results demonstrated that the sedimentation ponds were effective in reducing discharges of suspended particulates, but were less effective in reducing nutrient concentrations. Total suspended solids (TSS) were reduced by 60% with residence time of 0.7 day. The best reductions of total phosphorus (TP) and total nitrogen (TN) (35% and 23%, respectively) were in a sedimentation pond with 2 days residence time. The pond with the longest residence time, 4.6 days, had poorer removal rates for each of the three parameters. Although sedimentation ponds alone are a useful strategy, we advocate that sustainable development of shrimp farming requires an integrated approach involving appropriate planning, regulation and effective monitoring protocols by governments, and reduction of the volume of effluent and mass loadings of nutrients from shrimp farms. The key future challenges are to continue to improve feeds and feed utilization efficiency; reduce water usage through recycling and reduced exchange; and improve treatment of discharge water to remove nutrients.

ID IMPACT
AB Environmental deterioration around fish farms has been widespread in Japanese coastal areas. In order to prevent self-induced deterioration of the surrounding environment, the "Law to Ensure Sustainable Aquaculture Production" was enacted in 1999. Criteria based on three indicators, i.e., (1) dissolved oxygen content of water in fish cages, (2) acid volatile sulfide content (AVS-S) in the sediment and (3) the occurrence of macrofauna under the fish cages were determined to promote the "Aquaculture Ground Improvement Program" by applying this Law. The second criterion (AVS-S) is based on the assimilative capacity of the sediments to organic wastes from a fish farm. For applying this criterion to each farm, the maximum phase in the process of biological remineralization must be detected for a farm site when the benthic oxygen uptake (BOU) rates shows maximum. The peak of BOU, however, could not be determined during a survey in Gokasho Bay, suggesting a need for reexamination regarding the practical application of this criterion. In order to obtain data for refining the third criterion (macrofauna), a quantitative survey was conducted at 22 fish farms (red sea bream and yellowtail) along the Kumano-nada coast, central Japan. The biomass of the macrobenthos peaked in sediments containing 1.2 mg/g of total nitrogen, where the majority of aerobic mineralization of the loaded organic matter is supposed to occur. In summer, animals were scarcely found in sediments with AVS-S>1.7 mg/g, suggesting that this is a critical condition for the fish farm environment. An index embayment degree (ED), which represents the topographic conditions of a farm site, is proposed to discriminate artificial factors arising from fish farming activities from the natural factors related to the topography. Community parameters of the macrobenthos and environmental factors were significantly correlated with ED (P<0.001). In shallow, semi-enclosed sites (larger ED values), environmental deterioration and decreases in the benthic biomass were more conspicuous in large-scale farms than in small-scale farms. Six assemblages of the macrobenthos were identified by cluster analysis and were classified into three groups, indicating conditions as healthy, cautionary and critical, respectively. As fish production increased, habitat of the assemblage in the cautionary zone shifted to the offshore, deeper areas (smaller ED values), indicating that both of aquacultural activities and topographic conditions affect the species composition. Macrofauna, sediment parameters and the index ED are concluded as useful to develop pragmatic guidelines for site selection of fish farms. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Reducing negative environmental impacts from aquaculture activities is a key issue for ensuring long-term sustainability of the industry. This study examines the major findings and methodology aspects from 28 peer-reviewed studies on marine aquaculture systems integrating fed and extractive organisms. All studies include seaweeds as extractive organisms. The main objective was to analyse the degree of relevance these findings have for large-scale implementation of integrated mariculture practices, and to identify necessary research areas for a future research agenda.
   The following directions for future research were identified: (1) understand in detail the important biological/biochemical processes in closed recirculating and open seaweed culture systems; (2) conduct research into these advanced aquaculture technologies at scales relevant to commercial implementation or suitable for extrapolation; (3) broaden the focus to include factors affecting seaweed growth and uptake capacity; (4) improve experimental design for statistical calculations; (5) attain a detailed understanding of the temporal variability in seaweed-filtered mariculture systems; (6) define numerical design parameters critical for engineers in designing commercial recirculation systems with seaweed filters; (7) study the influences of location-specific parameters, such as latitude, climate and local seaweed strains/species, on seaweed filter performance; (8) include economic components, considering the added value of seaweeds, and feasibility aspects; (9) analyse the role and function of integrated aquaculture practices for improved environmental, economic, and social acceptability within the broader perspective of integrated coastal management initiatives-, and (10) develop educational, training and financial incentive approaches to transfer these novel and somewhat complex technologies of integrated mariculture from the scientists to the industry.

AB Pressure from environmental groups will force most governments to impose effluent regulations on aquaculture. Shrimp and fish producers are concerned that these regulations will be unnecessarily restrictive and expensive. Most pond aquaculture cannot be conducted without discharge. Fish and shrimp farms tend to be concentrated in specific regions, but typically they are sprawling operations where large volumes of relatively dilute effluents are released at many points. Effluents from pond aquaculture resemble non-point sources of pollution more than point sources. Thus, application of traditional effluent treatment methods to meet effluent standards, as done for point source pollution, will be difficult or impossible. Many involved in aquaculture believe that application of best management practices (BMPs) could be a reasonable and affordable way to improve the quality and reduce the volume of pond effluents. During recent years, several organizations have suggested systems of BMPs for making pond aquaculture more environmentally responsible. These include international development organizations (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and International Finance Corporation), industry groups (Global Aquaculture Alliance, Australian Prawn Producers Association, Marine Shrimp Culture Industry of Thailand, and Alabama Catfish Producers), a research center (Coastal Resources Center, University of Rhode Island), and state agencies in the USA (Missouri Department of Natural Resources and Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services). The contents of BMP documents presented by the different groups are remarkably similar. Although the BMP approach is largely a "paper list" at present, the topic is being discussed widely, and producers are becoming more aware of environmental issues. There is an obvious attempt by producers in Latin America, Asia, Australia, and the United States to improve production practices, and some producers are voluntarily adopting BMPs. Many shrimp producers in several nations have installed settling basins, and a few large shrimp farms monitor effluent quality. The Aquaculture Certification Council (ACC) plans to implement a certification program based primarily on compliance with BMPs during 2003. There also is considerable discussion among producers and governmental agencies in several nations regarding BMPs, and it is expected that regulatory programs based on BMPs will be forthcoming.

AB There are large differences between countries in the rate of growth and development of marine aquaculture, and also in the sophistication and complexity of its regulation, control and monitoring procedures. The potentially deleterious impacts of aquaculture are widely documented in the literature [J. Appl. Ichthyol. 17 (2001) 181; Fernandes, T.F., Eleftheriou, A., Ackefors, H., Eleftheriou, M., Ervik, A., Sanchez-Mata, A., Scanlon, T., White, P., Cochrane, S., Pearson, T.H., Miller, K.L., Read, P.A., 2002. The Management of the Environmental Impacts of Aquaculture. Scottish Executive, Aberdeen, UK, 88 pp.]. It is widely accepted that such impacts would be minimised or negated by the adoption of appropriate culturing procedures and environmental safeguards including regulatory, control and monitoring procedures [Nature Conservancy Council (NCC), 1989. Fish Farming and the Safeguard of the Natural Marine Environment of Scotland. Nature Conservancy Council, Peterborough, England, 136 pp.; Codling, I.D., Doughty, R., Henderson, A., Naismith, I., 1995. Strategies for Monitoring Sediments and Fauna Around Cage Fish Farms. Marlow, UK: Scotland and Northern Ireland Forum for Environmental Research (SNIFFER), Report No. SR 4018, 78 pp.; GESAMP (IMO/FAO/UNESCO-IOC/WMO/WHO/IAEA/UN/UNEP Joint Group of Experts on the Scientific Aspects of Marine Environmental Protection), 1996. Monitoring the ecological effects of coastal aquaculture wastes. Scientific aspects of marine environmental protection. Rome, Italy: Rep. Stud. GESAMP No. 57, 38 pp.; GESAMP (IMO/FAO/UNESCO-IOC/WMO/WHO/IAEA/UN/UNEP Joint Group of Experts on the Scientific Aspects of Marine Environmental Protection), 2001. Planning and management for sustainable coastal aquaculture development. Rome, Italy: Rep. Stud. GESAMP No. 68, 90 pp.]. It is essential that such safeguards are formulated from the best available science and technology and from the best available experience and expertise. In this context, there are lessons to be learned from the strategy and regulatory framework for the regulation, control and monitoring of environmental impacts of marine aquaculture within the European Union (EU).
   This paper identifies some of the main issues relevant to the management of environmental impacts of marine aquaculture; reviews EU and international policy and regulations in this context and provides one example of a strategy for the management of the environmental impacts of marine aquaculture by reference to the marine aquaculture industry in Scotland. In conclusion, it examines a number of current, key environmental concerns pertaining to the impact and regulation of marine aquaculture, which whilst being the subject of divergent views, are pivotal to the development of the industry. Recommendations for systems, procedures and research to address these concerns are identified. The paper is primarily concerned with marine finfish culture, although brief reference is made to shellfish culture. The control of diseases of finfish and shellfish is outside the scope of the paper, although brief consideration is given to current concerns relating to sea lice (predominantly Lepeophtheirus salmonis) infestations in salmonids.

AB Environmental impacts of salmon cage aquaculture resulting from deposition of organic-rich particulate matter to the sea bottom have been thought to be a function of the local environmental conditions and management practices. However, testing of these suppositions have been limited by (1) widely varying monitoring methods employed, and (2) lack of data comparability resulting from the absence of standardized national monitoring schemes.
   In order to determine the sensitivity of different monitoring methods in detecting benthic environmental effects, a comparative analysis was undertaken of four methods commonly employed in Norway that vary in cost and expertise required: (1) visual diver surveys, (2) faunal analysis, (3) sediment chemistry, and (4) Sediment Profile Imagery (SPI). Results indicate that all methods agreed in the common "impact zone" under and immediately next to the cages. However, each of the methods differed in their sensitivity in detecting more subtle effects at greater distances from the cages.
   Data from 168 environmental survey samples located at various distances from working Norwegian salmon cage farms collected using similar methodology between 1996 and 1998 were analyzed to determine the relationship between environmental variables, management regimes, and levels of environmental impact. Total organic carbon (TOC) levels in sediments were significantly higher immediately adjacent to cages compared to reference sites, and approximately 32% of the samples under the cages showed significant degradation. At intermediate distances (50-100 m), influences from fish farming are not clearly detected by TOC analysis. Further, while neither depth nor current speed alone are good predictors for environmental management, the results suggest recovery of sites by periodic abandonment (or fallowing) is one of the best management tools for sustainable salmon fanning in cold-water environments.

ID IMPACT
AB In recent decades, net-cage aquaculture has become one of the main patterns of the intensive fish-culture in the lakes, reservoirs and even rivers in China. This aquaculture pattern results in enriching exogenous nutrients in water and, consequently, accelerates the process of lake eutrophication. To ensure that normal environmental conditions and fisheries in a lake remain sustainable, qualitative estimations of nutrients in relation to ecosystem changes are essential. A study, mainly on nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) influences due to cage fish-culture was carried out in a shallow 35.5 ha bay in Niushanhu Lake, a shallow lake located in middle Yangtze Basin, during the period from March to December 2000. Net-cages in total covered an area of 1000 m(2) and the annual fish yield was 16.0 metric tons (MT). Fish feeding residue entering the water during the period was equivalent to 1532.9 kg of total N and 339.2 kg of total P. Sampling and analyses of the total N and total P concentrations, diversity and biomass of plankton and Chi a were made monthly, while data on zoobenthos were collected twice, respectively, at the beginning and the end of the study. Results showed that the Chi a content in water was correlated negatively to distance from the cage. The Chi a content that is converted into wet biomass of phytoplankton may be expressed by the regression: B = 2.673 - 0.0016D (B, biomass in mg/l; D, distance in km, r=0.9362; n=7). The biomass of rotifers inside or near the cages was higher than that in areas more distant, while that of the cladocerans was the opposite. No significant difference of copepod density or biomass was detected between cages and open water. Changes of zoobenthic community were remarkable. At the beginning of fish farming, there were nine zoobenthic taxa inside and 13 outside the cages. Only two saprophilous taxa, chiefly oligochaetes, were present in the cages at the end of the culture. Density and biomass of benthic animals decreased as well. Several bioindices, such as Shannon-Wiener index, Simpson index, and Margelef index, also exhibited a declining tendency. Through this study, the authors are of the opinion that mass-input of exogenous nutrients may cause negative effects on water quality in areas from the cage to a distance of 50 m outwards.

AB Zeolites p and mordenite were impregnated with 0.1 wt.% Pt and varying (0, 0. 1, 0.3 and 0.5 wt.%) amount of Ni and reduced at 475 degreesC. The line broadening XRD analysis indicates that the increasing Ni addition decreases the crystallinity of zeolites. The TEM analysis indicates that the average metal particle size increases with increasing Ni addition. The states of Ni and Pt were analysed by ESCA. The acidity measurements by both TPD of ammonia and pyridine adsorbed FT-IR spectroscopy show the occupation of some of the acid sites by the added Ni species. Hydroisomerisation of n-heptane was carried out in the temperature range 225-375degreesC and found that Ni addition up to 0.3 wt.% over 0. 1 wt.% Pt/H-beta and 0. 1 wt.% over 0. 1 wt.% Pt/H-MOR enhance the n-heptane conversion, isomerisation selectivity and sustainability of the catalysts. Also, the multibranched (MTB) isomers selectivity and protonated cyclopropane (PCP) intermediate mechanism are favoured over the above catalysts. Further Ni addition above the threshold value leads to fall in activity and isomerisation selectivity drastically. Zeolite-beta based Ni-Pt catalysts always show higher activity and selectivity than mordenite based catalysts. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Chiral hydroperoxides as oxygen source in the catalytic stereoselective
   epoxidation of allylic alcohols by sandwich-type polyoxometalates:
   Control of enantioselectivity through a metal-coordinated template

AB The epoxidation of allylic alcohols is shown to be efficiently and selectively catalyzed by the oxidatively resistant sandwich-type polyoxometalates, POMs, namely [WZnM2(ZnW9O34)(2)](q-) [M = OV(IV), Mn(II), Ru(III), Fe(III), Pd(II), Pt(II), Zn(II); q = 10-12], with organic hydroperoxides as oxygen source. Conspicuous is the fact that the nature of the transition metal M in the central ring of polyoxometalate affects significantly the reactivity, chemoselectivity, regioselectivity, and stereoselectivity of the allylic alcohol epoxidation. For the first time, it is demonstrated that the oxovanadium(IV)-substituted POM, namely [ZnW(VO)(2)(ZnW9O34)(2)](12-), is a highly chemoselective, regioselective, and also stereoselective catalyst for the clean epoxidation of allylic alcohols. A high enantioselectivity (er values up to 95:5) has been achieved with [ZnW(VO)(2)(ZnW9O34)(2)](12-) and the sterically demanding TADOOL-derived hydroperoxide TADOOH as regenerative chiral oxygen source. Thus, a POM-catalyzed asymmetric epoxidation of excellent catalytic efficiency (up to 42 000 TON) has been made available for the development of sustainable oxidation processes. The high reactivity and selectivity of this unprecedented oxygen-transfer process are mechanistically rationalized in terms of a peroxy-type vanadium(V) template.

AB To evaluate a specific form of resource management, for example, the maintenance of valuable cultural landscapes, the contributions of many different viewpoints must be considered. In this paper, a model for assessing and integrating the different aspects contributing to landscape evaluation is proposed. Some results of its use in landscape assessment in the Madrid region (central Spain) are discussed.
   The model takes into account five assessment dimensions which are considered to be independent-the ecological, productive, economic, social and cultural evaluative systems and it recognises and assumes conflicts and trade-offs between these components. The inclusion of the production system as an independent assessment dimension is original and is justified because it is the link that connects the ecological and economic systems. Since this dimension acts most directly on the ecosystem, the production system includes the attribute of ecological or strong (in the sense of [For the Common Good, Beacon Press, Boston, 19941) sustainability.
   The evaluation method places special emphasis on defining a conceptual framework, and from this defines scenarios in comparison with which particular development models (landscape planning, resources management) can be evaluated. Seven scenarios, coming from a hypothetical, traditional sustainable scenario of resources management, are defined. One of these, the sound sustainable scenario, is defended as the only one viable in the long term, particularly in developing countries.
   This method was employed to evaluate the agricultural and natural landscape of the Madrid region municipalities. The multivariate approach adopted was based on the selection of indicator sets for each evaluative dimension. The structure of relationships among indicators was then analysed separately for each dimension and values assigned to the municipalities according to their position on the main axes of the multivariate analyses. Each municipality was assigned to one of the seven development scenarios by means of discriminant analysis. The approach's greatest assets are its flexibility in the selection of the indicators and the efficacy in its monitoring and comparison of the different analysed cases once a rigorous conceptual framework was established.
   The paper discusses the conditions for the sustainability of the human activities and provides a method for evaluating and comparing scenarios of resources management. (C) 2003 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Integrated Water Resources Management is an approach aimed at achieving sustainable development with a focus on water resources. This management concept is characterized by its catchment approach, inter-sectoral and interdisciplinary approach and multiple management objectives. There is an effort to widen the management scope to include multiple resources and environmental considerations in the river basin management schemes. In order to achieve river basin management objectives and multiple global environmental benefits, an ecosystem approach to river basin management is promoted. The Ecosystem-based River Basin Management aims to maximize and optimize the total value of the ecosystem functions relevant to classified ecosystems within a river basin by conserving and even enhancing these functions for the next generations. A procedure to incorporate such ecosystem functions into policy framework is presented in this paper. Based on this policy framework of the Ecosystem-based River Basin Management, a case study is introduced to apply the concept to the Yangtze River basin. According to the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) assessment report, this basin suffers from frequent floods of large magnitudes, which are due to the degradation of ecosystem functions in the basin. In this case, the government of the People's Republic of China introduced Ecosystem Function Conservation Areas to conserve ecosystem functions related to flood events and magnitude, such as soil conservation, agricultural practices and forestry, while producing economic benefits for the local population.

TI Energy, water, plant interactions: 'Green feedback' as a mechanism for
   environmental management and control through the application of
   phytotechnology and ecohydrology
SO HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES
LA English

AB One of the fundamental tenets of the sustainable development concept is the maintenance of a homeostatic equilibrium within the ecosystem. Overexploitation of the ecosystem or degradation of its biotic structure alters ecosystem processes to the point whereby the ability of the ecosystem to produce desired resources is seriously diminished. Water is the medium for all ecological processes, from molecular to global scale. The physical quantification of ecological processes in terms of energy and molecular dimension is fundamental for scientific investigation and sound ecosystem management. As a consequence, the water mesocycle within the basin and connected processes (i.e. those which can be measured) should be considered as the basic unit for the analysis of energy-water-biota interactions.
   The degradation of freshwater ecosystems can be characterized in terms of two dimensions: first, pollution, which can be reduced to a significant extent by technologies; and second, the degradation of established water and nutrient cycles within the ecosystem as a whole. This second dimension is much more complex. A new approach for solving both of these problems is the application of ecohydrology and phytotechnology. Our progressive understanding of the range of anthropogenic degradation of hydrological, biogeochemical and biological processes within water basins indicates the need to control and regulate nutrients and water dynamics by increasing plant biomass and diversity. Thus, phytotechnologies, applied within the context of ecohydrological principles, can provide an approach for increasing ecosystem carrying capacity and enhancing the resilience and functionality of ecosystems at the basin scale.
   The application of these interdisciplinary, holistic approaches, based on an understanding of the role of plant biomass in the control of water and biogeochemical cycles (i.e. 'green feedback'), can lead to an improvement of water resources quality, as well as the enhancement of system biodiversity, agricultural production, and bioenergy generation, with the potential for increased employment opportunities.

AB Arid and semi-arid regions are very vulnerable to environmental changes. Climate change studies indicate that the environment in such areas will steadily deteriorate with global warming; inland lakes will shrink and desert areas will expand. Mongolia is a landlocked country in north-central Asia that contains a unique ecological system consisting of taiga, steppe, and desert from north to south. The Selenge River basin (280000 km(2)) in northern Mongolia is a semi-arid region underlain by permafrost, between latitudes 46 and 52degreesN, and longitudes 96 and 109degreesE. The issue of sustainable development of the basin is very important owing to its limited natural resources, including fresh water, forest, and rangeland. To examine the water cycle processes in the basin, a hydrological analysis was carried out using a simple scheme for the interaction between the land surface and atmosphere (big-leaf model) coupled to a hydrological model for the period 1988-92 to estimate the hydrological regime of the basin. Annual precipitation in this period averaged 298 mm, ranging from 212 to 352 mm at a 1degrees x 1degrees resolution based on data from 10 gauges, and the estimated annual evapotranspiration averaged 241 turn, ranging between 153 and 300 mm. This indicates that evapotranspiration accounts for the overwhelming majority of the annual precipitation, averaging 81% and ranging between 64 and 96%. The annual potential evapotranspiration in the basin averaged 2009 mm; the ratio of evapotranspiration (actual to potential evapotranspiration) was 0.12 and the wetness index (annual precipitation to potential evapotranspiration) was 0.15.

AB Urban greenspaces are universally valued as amenity-recreation venues, wildlife refuges and essential livable-city ingredients. Western strategies of urban greenspace provision are difficult to implement or retrofit in most Asian cities, commonly constrained by a high-density compact form. With recent rapid urbanization and associated brown and green field developments. ample opportunities arise to overhaul greenspace standards and patterns. The case study of the ancient city of Nanjing in China pen-nits planning for an integrated greenspace network, aiming at flexibility for future urban expansion, green field acquisition, recreational functions, wildlife habitats and environmental benefits. It consists of green wedges, greenways and green extensions that incorporate urban green areas at three landscape scales. At the metropolis scale, through normative and substantive analyses of urban form and urban expansion, and assessment of suburban uplands, five green wedges are demarcated to generate a star urban form. The green wedges link the extensive countryside to the central city, and define elongated finger-like spaces between them for urban expansion to avoid conflicts with green fields. At the city scale, three major greenways, including city-wall circular greenway, Inner-Qinhuai River greenway, and canopy-road greenway, are designed as a permeating framework to guide new greenspace location, configuration and continuity, and to link existing parks. These greenways are equipped with a comprehensive trail system to foster pedestrian and cycling movements that are preferred by the public and the government. At the neighborhood scale, a greenspace organization, consisting of residential public open spaces, shaded sidewalks and riparian strips, conforms to the network geometry. As well-connected entities, these small proximate enclaves provide opportunities for residents to have day-to-day contact with nature. They also serve to resist undue urban influences and intrusions. Overall, the three-tiered greenspace system provides an alternative mode for urban development to the conventional transport-dominated one, to usher substantial improvement in landscape-environmental quality and to augment the sustainable-city notion.

TI Sustained benefit of a community and professional intervention to
   increase acute stroke therapy
SO ARCHIVES OF INTERNAL MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
ID RATES
AB Background: The ultimate test of an educational intervention is the sustainability of the effect after the intervention ceases.
   Methods:, The TLL Temple Foundation Stroke Project was a quasi-experimental study aimed at increasing Food and Drug Administration-approved acute stroke therapy in a nonurban community in east Texas. During the intensive community and professional intervention (phase 2), significantly more patients with acute stroke received intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) compared with the preintervention period (phase 1). In the. comparison community, no change was noted. We present the results of tPA treatment in the 6 months after the intervention ended (phase 3).
   Results: Two hundred thirty-eight patients had a validated stroke during phase 3. Among patients who experienced an ischemic stroke, 11.2% in the intervention group received intravenous tPA compared with 2.2% in phase 1 (P = .007). In the comparison group, 1.4% received intravenous tPA in phase 3 compared with 0.7% in phase 1 (P > .99). Among eligible candidates for treatment, 69.2% were treated in phase 3 in the intervention community compared with 13.6% in phase 1 (P = .002). In the comparison group, 20.0% were treated in phase 3 compared with 6.7% in phase 1 (P = .45). There was 1 protocol violation, among the 9 patients treated in the intervention community in phase 3.
   Conclusions: There was a sustained benefit of the intervention in increasing tPA treatments in the intervention community even after cessation of the educational effort. Treatments in the control community remained few through all 3 phases of the study. A carefully planned multilevel intervention can improve community stroke treatments even in a nonurban community.

LA English
DT Article
ID FAMILY-PRACTICE RESIDENCY; TEACHING NURSING-HOME; CURRICULUM
   RECOMMENDATIONS; ACUTE-CARE; EXPERIENCE; KNOWLEDGE; ROTATION
AB National surveys indicate a need for additional training in geriatrics during internal medicine residencies. This paper describes 1) "best practices" for integrating geriatrics education into internal medicine residency programs, 2) barriers to implementation of these practices, and 3) possible ways to improve geriatrics training for internal medicine residents. These best practices were determined by a systematic review of the literature and through interviews with leaders of 26 residency and geriatrics programs concerned with geriatrics training for residents.
   The most successful programs have clinical experiences with 3 key elements: model geriatric care in 1 or more settings (for example, in the hospital or in ambulatory practice), patient care across sites or transitions of care, and interdisciplinary teamwork. Barriers include attitudes, few faculty, need for relationships with nontraditional training sites, and lack of funding. Local solutions include engaging the internal medicine program director to accomplish a mutual goal-for example, by creating a model geriatrics training experience in which residents demonstrate their skill in a new Accreditation Council of Graduate Medical Education competency (such as systems-based practice). National solutions include reaching consensus on the competencies in geriatrics that should be achieved by board-eligible internists. This may mean increasing the number of questions that test geriatrics competency in the certifying and in-training examinations, increasing numbers of faculty members able to teach and model geriatric care, developing "effective medical resident teaching" courses for nonphysician faculty, and lobbying for improved systems of care.

AB [1] We present estimates of nitrogen (N) inputs to the Changjiang River basin for the period 1968 - 1997. The total N input is approximately 7.8 x 10(9) kg in 1997, which is a threefold increase over 1968 levels. N fixation was often a dominant input before 1978, providing about 2.2 x 10(9) kg year(-1), while N fertilizer dominated N input after 1983, supplying an additional input of some 4.4 x 10(9) kg year(-1). More than 40% of total N inputs is converted into manure N, and half of total manure N is returned to agricultural soil. We estimate that the river nitrate concentration and flux have increased about tenfold from 1968 to 1997. Our study suggests that the percent of N inputs to the basin that are exported by the river as NO3-N has increased steadily over the 30-year period and that about 30% of total N input is transported through the river. The integrated N input, budget, and storage have been linked to the increasing temporal trends of Changjiang River nitrate. N fertilizer application and human population density, as well as manure N production in the basin, are good predictors of the river's nitrate concentration and flux. Therefore, how N balance is kept ( especially for effective application of N fertilizer) is a crucial problem to the sustainable development of the basin.

AB We describe a graphic model for selecting tree species suitable for harvesting of pole-sized stems. Pole size stems are the most harvested size class by rural users of African forest. Increasing harvesting pressure on this size class has created an urgent need for tree species selection and harvest off-take strategies that differ from large-scale and canopy tree-logging processes. Methods for selecting species suitable for harvesting are constrained in their complexity by the need to use available data that are typically from single survey, size-class frequency distributions (SCDs) of population structure. Using SCD data sets from three subtropical Afromontane forests in South Africa, we use the spatial scale (grain) of regeneration of the harvestable fraction of pole-sized stems to identify species that can be harvested. In fine-grained species the sub-canopy individuals are well represented beneath the canopy of mature conspecifics and thus display high levels of natural regeneration over a small spatial scale. Fine-grained species are suitable for harvesting because there is a large supply of pole-sized trees whose exploitation has potentially less effect on forest structure and composition than the use of coarse-grained species. Furthermore, because the abundant fine-grained species may experience strong neighbourhood effects in time, and their stem densities are likely to be regulated by density-dependent factors, judicious exploitation of these species is arguably an extension of the natural process of density-dependent self-thinning. In contrast, coarse-grained species regenerate over large areas and at low densities and their use requires careful management and should probably be restricted. Unfortunately, most species being targeted for harvesting are coarse- to medium-grained and appear to regenerate at levels insufficient for replacement. Using the spatial grain of regeneration to select harvestable species does not provide estimates of sustainable harvesting rates. These critical harvesting limits (stems ha(-1) per annum) are set from experience. Incorporated into the management process, this model provides a simple means of ensuring that levels of natural regeneration are maintained without the need for intervention to maintain either tree species diversity, or potential economic value for pole production, in heavily used subtropical forests.

AB Based on an empirical study of the forest practise at Lauenburgische Kreisforsten in Northern Germany an economic analysis of near-natural beech stand management is performed. The profitability, cash flow and economic flexibility of near-natural management (NNM) is compared to that of converting to: (i) Norway spruce, (ii) a clear felling beech regime with a rotation of 120 years (CF) and (iii) a cyclic beech regime with a regeneration thinning at stand age 90 and liquidation of the last holdovers at age 110 (CYC).
   The internal rate of return (IRR) of NNM is 2.9%, which for many investors would be a satisfactory real rate of return. For required real rates of return less than 2.5%, the net present value (NPV) of NNM exceeds the NPV of clearing the stand and planting Norway spruce at all stages of the rotation as well as the NPV of the two alternative beech regimes. When comparing the profitability of the alternatives using IRR as criteria, both of the alternatives CYC (IRR = 3.3%) and Norway spruce (IRR = 3.1%) should be preferred above NNM and CF (IRR = 1.8%). However, it was discussed that when comparing investment alternatives like those presented in this paper the choice between investment alternatives should be dictated by their NPV at the required rate of return and not their IRR.
   In comparison to the management alternatives CYC and CF, NNM provides high mean annual net revenue, which exhibits relatively small fluctuations during the rotation. The latter may be important, especially at forest districts which do not have forest stands in the entire range of age classes and therefore may foresee periodical lack of liquidity. Due to the prolonged retention of the holdovers, the accumulation of capital in the forest is greater for NNM than for CYC and CF. Since economic flexibility of a silvicultural regime to a large extent is associated with the ability to accumulate liquid reserves in the forest, NNM may provide the owner with greater economic flexibility than the two shorter-rotation beech alternatives.
   It is concluded that near-natural beech stand management may provide an economically sound alternative to other, more traditional regimes for investors having a required real rate of return within the range common to most forest investments. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The effects of prescribed burning, herbicide application, and thinning treatments were examined in upland Quercus stands with a replicate block field study. Two site types were analyzed: (1) nonsuccessional with a Quercus overstory and Quercus understory, and (2) successional with a Quercus overstory and an Acer saccharum understory. Treatments were examined for their effects on vegetation structure and composition, especially with respect to altering the natural succession from Quercus communities to mesophytic species. In addition, impacts of burning on soil nutrients were examined prior to and immediately following burn treatments. Results from the study indicate that fire had little effect on A horizon soil nutrients following burns. The data suggest fire plays a more important role as a decomposer for nutrient release in February bums than in November bums. Natural precipitation and leaching from the litter layer in the fall rendered similar nutrient dynamics as burning in November.
   The structural changes to vegetation following fire were more noticeable than compositional changes. Thinning of the canopy was generally necessary for the understory to respond to burning treatments. Burning did not affect stems >3.8 cm dbh (diameter at breast height). Density of most woody species <3.8 cm dbh decreased with burning, but increased with burning and thinning, indicating the stress of shaded conditions. Thus, burning prior to thinning may be an effective method for controlling an A. saccharum invasion into Quercus stands.
   Herbaceous, seedling, sapling, and overstory strata diversity were unaffected by the treatments. Data indicated that the community responds with species extant at the time of treatment. Thus, the initial conditions prior to disturbance were important factors in the response of the stand to disturbance.
   Although fire has played a major role in upland forest dynamics prior to settlement, forest structure and composition can no longer be maintained by fire. Succession without fire has resulted in a different structure and composition to oak forests, altering both fuels and fuel moisture levels. Species normally considered intolerant of fire have reached size classes large enough that they tolerate cool to moderate burns. More severe disturbance techniques, or combinations of techniques, are necessary for sustainable oak forest management in the central hardwood region. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB With the advent of more stringent controls on wastewater treatment, sewage sludge production in Europe and many parts of the world is increasing. With this increase comes the problem of sludge disposal, and recycling to land arguably offers an economically and environmentally sustainable option. However, a major limitation of sewage sludge reuse is the potential release of heavy metals from the sludge and heavy metal accumulation to toxic levels in topsoils. The properties of the sludge play a crucial role in determining the initial release and subsequent availability of heavy metals in amended soils. Bioavailable forms of heavy metals in recently amended soils are most likely to be those that are bioavailable in the sewage sludge. In this paper, published research on the importance of sewage sludge characteristics on metal release and bioavailability will be reviewed and contrasted with original research. A selection of sludges from around Australia has been collected for this purpose. Through the use of incubation studies, isotope dilution techniques, ion-selective electrode measurements and C-13-NMR spectroscopy, the importance of a range of sludge properties on heavy metal behaviour in sludges and sludge-amended soils is addressed.

AB Ages were estimated for the tropical sparid, Acanthopagrus berda, caught in northern KwaZulu-Natal estuaries. Whole otoliths were used in the age determination. Age estimates were validated by marginal increment analysis and oxytetracycline labelling, which indicated that opaque deposition occurs primarily from September to November each year. The reproducibility of age estimates was described by a coefficient of variation of 10%. The von Bertalanffy growth curve was found to best describe the growth of A. berda. The parameters of the von Bertalanffy growth curve indicated that A. berda in northern KwaZulu-Natal is a slow-growing species, capable of reaching at least 16 years of age. Longevity of the species, coupled with sex change, late maturation and estuarine dependency, give cause for concern for the continued sustainable utilization of this species.

AB The arboreal sesarmid crab Parasesarma leptosoma is recorded for the first time from Mozambique and South Africa. These herbivorous crabs are found in mangrove forests on Rhizophora mucronata and Bruguiera gymnorrhiza, but not Avicennia marina. The biogeographic distribution of this crab species is discussed in relation to the southerly distribution of its associated mangrove species. Aspects of its ecology, biology and conservation are given. At all the collection sites, both R. mucronata and B. gymnorrhiza have been targeted by the local human communities for building poles. This habitat destruction will have a direct effect on this tree-dependent crab species and may also have an indirect effect via a trophic-cascade through the food web. These mangrove systems thus need to be managed in a sustainable way if their biodiversity is to be maintained.

TI Agroforestry adoption in southern Malawi: the case of mixed

SO AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article
ID FARMERS; TECHNOLOGY; SYSTEMS
AB Agroforestry, now considered as a sustainable agricultural system, is being widely promoted all over the world especially in sub-Saharan Africa. This paper investigates the adoption of mixed inter-cropping an agroforestry tree species, Gliricidia sepium, and maize in Malawi. The differences between adopters and non-adopters of Gliricidia sepium in terms of their age, active members of the family, extension contact, income sources and other socioeconomic variables are examined. Results from logistic regression analysis suggest that age of the farmer, extension contact and the number of people who contribute to farm work are important variables in determining the adoption of agroforestry. It was observed that farmers modified technologies to suit their situation, suggesting that local participation is important in technology development. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

DE plant diversity; agricultural landscape; farming; land-use; field type
AB An effort was undertaken in Bushwere Parish (Mbarara district, south-western Uganda) between 1999 and 2000 to develop sustainable and participatory approaches to plant biodiversity conservation at the farm level. One hundred farmers were interviewed on their socio-economic profiles and plant use strategies. Plant diversity was assessed in 400 plots of 5 m x 5 m established in 53 field types of seven land-use categories. The most species-rich land-use category was under annual crops (149 plant species) while the most species-rich field type was planted with bananas (118 species). Shannon diversity and Sorensen's similarity indices were used to compute species diversity and similarity, respectively, between field types and land-uses. The most plant diverse land-use was natural woodland, the least fallow. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) showed that occurrence of species, field type or land-use depended upon environmental factors such as elevation, position on the slope and soil type. Redundancy analysis (RDA) showed that species utility and occurrence were related to the socio-economic status of farmers. Plant species were most diverse in land-uses located on hill tops and steep slopes. Farmers should therefore be advised on how to maintain plant diversity in agricultural landscapes.

AB The unification of societies is increasing social and ecological risks, nowhere more so than within agro-ecological systems. Opportunities for conserving agrobiodiversity in situ could offer solutions to these concerns within regions marginal for agricultural production. Key stakeholders in the process of on-farm conservation in Switzerland, Turkey and Nepal were interviewed to gather their perceptions of the methods that could be applied for diversity conservation in the margins. It is argued that the appropriate application of in situ conservation approaches offer opportunities for sustaining diversity, particularly where productivity increases are likely to have minimal impacts on the profitability of agricultural activities. A human ecology paradigm, alternative to the dominant neo-classical approach, could focus primarily on issues of socio-ecological sustainability by ensuring that development supports local diversity.

AB Research and practice in Canadian forest vegetation management was reviewed for the period 1990 to present. Results indicate continued evolution toward a more integrated and ecologically sound program with appropriate focus on key competitors and crop species. Increasing collaboration between academia, government and industry has resulted in >666 new scientific publications, substantially augmenting the existing knowledge base. The development of (Chondrostereum purpureum) as the first biocontrol agent in Canadian forest vegetation management and the use of nutrient-loaded seedlings to enhance establishment success are considered key research highlights. Recent trends in operational practice include a move toward more intensive management on higher quality sites and adoption of innovative approaches (e.g. nutrient loaded seedlings, larger planting stock) and advanced technologies (e.g. electronic guidance in aerial herbicide applications). The lack of long-term growth response data and economic analyses demonstrating positive cost/benefits remain as shortcomings, however continued development of the program will undoubtedly enhance sustainable wood supply and minimize impact on the forest environment.

AB In 1998 the Deutsche Gesellschaft fur Technische Zusammenarbeit (GTZ) launched the Convention Project on Chemical Safety in developing countries. The project aims to support developing countries in the implementation of the Rotterdam and Stockholm Conventions, create human resources and institutional capacities and to demonstrate via pilot measures how chemical safety in the partner countries can be improved and sustainably implemented in line with international standards. With this objective the development of a Chemical Management Guide (CM Guide) for small and medium-sized enterprises in developing countries has been initiated. The guide describes a step-by-step approach which is based on identifying 'hot-spots' as a first step, and making a chemical inventory as a second step. The third step is the continuous improvement of chemical management. In total, there are six tools that aim to support the chemical management process: basic concepts for risk assessment; description of control approaches; using material safety data sheets (MSDSs); risk phrases for hazardous substances; safety phrases for hazardous substances; symbols used for labelling hazardous substances. In the course of the test-implementation of the CM Guide in Indonesia, it was found that MSDSs were not available in most of the smaller companies. In contrast, medium-sized and larger companies do have more MSDSs available. It was also found that the way to engage the minds of company owners and managers is with economic arguments related to the loss, waste and expiry of materials, and quality standards expected from importing countries.

AB Rural energy planning is a nexus of sustainable development issues, particularly the sustainable utilization of biomass resources, on which rural parts of the developing world remain critically dependent. A landscape based rural bioenergy planning framework is presented, which is based on location-allocation and landscape ecology principles and considers both domestic and commercial energy demands and energy flows, as well as the landscape impact of the required bioenergy production zones. p-median modelling principles underly the location-allocation formulation. Optimized bioenergy landscape designs are presented, which illustrate both accessibility and landscape ecology objectives.

ID SUSTAINABILITY
AB An economic model of land taxation involving a local government and a private developer constitutes the theoretical framework in this research. The model hinges around a two-tier approach including both a conservation and an efficiency criterion. The analysis indicates that sustainable tourism calls for the use of land taxation and planning legislation simultaneously geared to the achievement of efficiency and the signaling of the government's commitment to conservation policies. To provide support for the theoretical conclusions, an Italian case study is discussed, showing how the local government chose not to yield to a developer's requests by not changing a norm prohibiting construction near of the coastline.

   Energy Saving and Pollution Reduction

AB The pinch analysis (PA) concept emerged, late '80s, as one of the methods to address the energy management in the new era of sustainable development. It was derived from combined first and second law analysis, as a technique ensuring a better thermal integration, aiming the minimization of entropy production or, equivalently, exergy destruction by heat exchanger networks (HEN). Although its ascendance from the second law analysis is questionable, the PA reveals as a widespread tool, nowadays, helping in energy savings mostly through a more rational use of utilities. Unfortunately, as principal downside, one should be aware that the global minimum entropy production is seldom attained, since the PA does not tackle the whole plant letting aside the chemical reactors or separation trains. The chemical reactor network (CRN) is responsible for large amounts of entropy generation (exergy losses), mainly due to the combined composition and temperature change. The chemical pinch analysis (CPA) concept focuses on, simultaneously, the entropy generation reduction of both CRN and HEN, while keeping the state and working parameters of the plant in the range of industrial interest. The fundamental idea of CPA is to include the CRN (through the chemical reaction heat developed in reactors) into the HEN and to submit this extended system to the PA. This is accomplished by replacing the chemical reactor with a virtual heat exchanger system producing the same amount of entropy. For an endothermic non-adiabatic chemical reactor, the (stepwise infinitesimal) supply heat deltaq flows from a source (an external/internal heater) to the stream undergoing the chemical transformation through the reactor, which in turn releases the heat of reaction AHR to a virtual cold stream flowing through a virtual cooler. For an exothermic non-adiabatic chemical reactor, the replacement is likewise, but the heat flows oppositely. Thus, in the practice of designing or retrofitting a flowsheet, in order to minimize the entropy production, the chemical reactor should be viewed as a group of two or three virtual heaters/coolers destroying the same amount of exergy. As a result of PA, new operating conditions could be revealed for some or all of the chemical reactors, ensuring a further reduction of the global entropy production of the plant. In this paper, the simple case of the methanol synthesis heat integrated reactor will be analyzed, proving the benefits of the CPA. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Rangelands are among the most important agricultural ecosystems in the United States and the world. The rangelands of the western United States are fundamental to the rural economy. In order to maintain the quality of these rangelands, they must be monitored over time and space. The ecological condition of rangelands is a major factor in their environmental quality, in their overall performance as watersheds, and in wildlife and livestock production. The monitoring system must be science-based and take into account topography, climate, soils, plant communities, and animal populations that go to make up the western range. An information storage, processing, interpretation, and retrieval system must be included if the monitoring data are to be assessed in a timely manner. This report outlines a research program for the development of a new approach to monitoring rangelands. It includes the principle variables (climate, soils, plants, and grazing animals) involved in determining rangeland condition and trend as an indication of rangeland health.

AB Monitoring of rangelands has evolved from traditional focus on plant communities and their successional status, taken from a few selected subsamples, to much broader perspectives. Rangelands, being complex biosocial systems, offer a near infinite array of possibilities for choice of variables and how to collect and interpret the data. Past monitoring approaches have inadequately considered objectives, critical definitions, and appropriate sequencing of steps taken. While management objectives should ideally have primacy in choice of variables used in inventory and monitoring, there are some countervailing advantages in employing some commonalities in monitoring protocols among tracts of rangelands. Inventories should come before monitoring. Assessment should follow collection of an adequately long time series of data which is the essence of monitoring. Trends involve judging whether the monitoring data show increases, decreases, or stable trajectories. Assessment involves an always at least partially subjective judgement of condition in relation to appropriate standards and objectives. We are no longer limited to just plant community data collected annually in a few conveniently and subjectively chosen quadrats. Geomatics (remote sensing, GIS, and GPS) opens the possibility of frequent, synoptic (everywhere, instantaneously) landscape coverage via satellite imagery. Indisputable evidence of cause(s) requires concurrent data on these influences along with similar trends from similar circumstances (replications) and controls [reference areas lacking the putative cause(s)]. Three alternatives that could replace plant succession as the underlying, dominant theory of rangeland monitoring are: risk assessment, sustainability, and desertification. Risk assessment is well proven where biophysical indicators can be employed. Politically neutral incorporation of socioeconomic considerations have yet to be demonstrated, however. Sustainability is such a broad and diffuse concept that anyone can read into it whatever he or she wishes. Desertification is the preferred macroconcept to guide us into the future, because its use can more objectively encompass both biophysical and socioeconomic features, at any scale in time and space.

AB Rangelands and pastures are found in every state and cover 55% of the land surface of the United States. Taken as a whole, from Western deserts and grasslands to meadows and woodlands, rangelands comprise some 364 million ha or 80% of the land in the 17 Western states. The vast expanses and remoteness of rangelands make assessing economic and ecological sustainability a difficult task. Currently, there is no national monitoring framework in place to collect data on long-term or episodic processes and agents of change over time. There are no defined methods for summarizing the health of rangelands. Thus individual conclusions about the health or sustainability of the nation's rangelands vary from person to person and organization to organization. Over one million people derive some portion of their income from farm and ranch activities on rangelands and pastures in the western United States. These individuals own and operate over 406,000 farms and ranches with revenues from selling beef cattle exceeding $13 billion in the 17 Western states. Their continued economic survival is dependent on the environmental sustainability of rangelands. Moreover, organizations and individuals charged with selection of best management systems on rangelands are under increasing pressure to consider not only livestock production issues, but also sustainability and health under multiple land use. As a result, ranchers, government agencies, and other organizations have a critical need for improved methods to balance the economic viability of ranchers, the well being of rural America, and the health and sustainability of the nation's range- and grazinglands. Therefore, a coordinated national research and technology transfer effort is required to successfully develop and transfer to ranchers and rangeland managers a science-based, monitoring system to determine the effect of management practices on sustainability of rangeland ecosystems.

AB Prescribed fires are used to manipulate and manage rangelands, but effective monitoring techniques are needed to ensure that management goals and objectives are being met. The application of an effective fire program on rangelands is not a simple task. Overgrazing by livestock since the early development of the livestock industry has altered the vegetative complex on most rangelands with an increase in woody plants. Because of its relatively low cost, prescribed fire, both cool and warm season, are sustainable practices if proper grazing management is part of the management scheme. Grazing management and prescribed fire have often been treated as separate issues by rangeland managers; however, development and application of an effective prescribed burning program requires an understanding of the relationship between fire and grazing. Ranchers need fuel (grass) to burn and they also need income from livestock, which requires forage (grass, a major part of forage). In the short-term, fire reduces carrying capacity for livestock but, in the long-term, fire increases grass production, resulting in increased carrying capacity. Therefore, some monitoring technique is needed that will allow the manager to budget grass for both fuel and forage. The Grazing Manager (TGM) is a software program that projects both forage production (expressed as animal unit days) and, animal demand (expressed as animal unit days) for each forage year. TGM has been successfully used on the Texas A&M University Research Station at Sonora as a tool to integrate prescribed fire and grazing management.

AB One of the serious biological obstacles that must be addressed in any comprehensive revision of rangeland ecological condition assessment is what to do with sites dominated by exotic self-invasive species. In certain cases such species have truncated succession so that with a bare minimum of disturbance, the sites will never return to dominance by native perennial species. Are such sites destined to remain always in what is defined as "poor'' ecological condition. Many communities dominated by exotic annuals are closed to the recruitment of seedlings of native perennial species. At the same time the communities are open to invasion by other introduced species. Should susceptibility to future invasions be a criteria in assessing the ecological condition of rangeland communities. The sustainability of communities dominated by exotic invasive species is assessing the ecological condition of such communities. Deviation from the plant community concepts of range condition and trend judgement involves setting new benchmark standards. This is an endeavor fraught with many perils.

AB Monitoring of rangelands in the western USA formally began in the U.S. Forest Service in the 1930s. Other federal land management and advisory agencies did not usually monitor their clients' public or private rangelands until after World War II. The initial focus was on the portion of vegetation that was livestock forage. Attention to soils generally came after World War II. The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969 changed the formerly independent role of the action agencies and gave the interested public means of input to and oversight on the actions of the managerial agencies. NEPA also gave the interested public leverage through the courts if a decision was not of their liking. The result has been near grid, lock on proactive management on public rangelands and diversion of a large portion of operating funds to planning. Availability of monitoring data for some locales is largely due to the foresight and persistence of particularly dedicated individuals. Lack of consistent and comparable monitoring procedures within and between the federal management, advisory, and regulatory agencies has made it impossible to conclude reliably what the overall condition and trends in conditions of our public rangelands are. There are currently many competing proposals before Congress to fund efforts at rangeland monitoring standardization. Many additional federal agencies and nongovernmental organizations are getting involved in this debate. By carefully reviewing the history of development of rangeland monitoring, it is possible to identify fatal flaws in previous approaches and suggest actions to avoid previous pitfalls during the forthcoming development of more defendable monitoring approaches at both local and national scales.

TI Falls prevention in rural general practice: what stands the test of time

AB Objective: General practitioner recall of the 1992-96 'Stay on Your Feet'(SOYF) program and its influence on practice were surveyed five years post-intervention to gauge sustainability of the SOYF General Practice (GP) component.
   Methods: A survey assessed which SOYF components were still in existence, current practice related to falls prevention, and interest in professional development. All general practitioners (GPs) situated within the boundaries of a rural Area Health Service were mailed a survey in late 2001.
   Results: Response rate was 66.5% (139/ 209). Of 117 GPs in practice at the time of SOYF, 80.2% reported having heard of SOYF and 74.4% of those felt it had influenced practice. Half (50.9%) still had a copy of the SOYF GP resource and of those, 58.6% used it at least 'occasionally'. Three-quarters of GPs surveyed (75.2%) checked medications 'most/almost all' of the time with patients over 60 years; 46.7% assessed falls risk factors; 41.3% gave advice; and 22.6% referred to allied health practitioners. GPs indicated a strong interest in falls prevention- related professional development. There was no significant association between use of the SOYF resource package and any of the current falls prevention practices (all chi(2)>0.05).
   Conclusions and implications: There was high recall of SOYF and a general belief that it influenced practice. There was little indication that use of the resource had any lasting influence on GPs' practices. In future, careful thought needs to go into designing a program that has potential to affect long-term change in GPs' falls prevention practice.

DT Article
AB After the second world war the Danubian Swabians originating from the south-western regions in Germany had lost their ancestral settlements along the median shores of the river Danube which they had cultivated since the 18(th) century. With the assistance of charity organizations from Austria and Switzerland, 500 families of Danubian Swabian descent were resettled in 1951 with the objective to farm the high plane of Guarapuava, Parana, Brazil.
   The cooperative organization of the settlers initially resulted into modest gains that were not sufficient to sustain the economic and social needs of their communities. It was only in 1968 when the allocation of funds from the German development aid for the purchase of threshing-machines and fertilizers gradually led to sustainable development within these settlements. Eventually the newly generated resources based on ever growing yields of wheat, soya beans and maize were utilized in the extension of arable land for each farmer, the implementation of agri-industrial projects and the built-up of a co-operative social community capable to provide significant inputs in medicare, education, utilities and infrastructure.
   The grant of German development aid to the Danubian Swabians in Parana, Brazil has provoked the mobilization of their self-reliant and inherent resources and caused the extension of cooperative structures emphasizing the principle of "help to help yourself".

AB Aboriginal people in remote Australian communities have limited opportunity to participate in the market economy. The Aboriginal arts and craft industry offers an important option to generate cash income and the sustained supply of native plants used in production is vital. We assessed the current harvest of a rainforest tree species commonly used for sculpture, Bombax ceiba. Information from field surveys, a regional rainforest inventory and sales figures from the Maningrida region were used to estimate the population size and structure of B. ceiba, the harvest intensity of. patches and the economic value of the harvest. We estimate the density of B. ceiba to be 105.10 +/- 12.32 stems ha(-1) and a regional population of 76615 +/- 14063 stems. A cumulative harvest over 20 years of 6% suggests approximately 4596 stems harvested, and the harvest was worth about $200,000 over the last three years. The majority (80%) of harvested stems coppiced and were suitable for harvesting. Logistic regression suggests both distance to outstation and township influence harvesting intensity, with some localised over-harvest. Rainforests provide a valuable resource to Aboriginal artists in Maningrida and their maintenance provides important conservation benefits to the Australian community. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

ID CONSERVATION; PLANTS
AB European native plant diversity is currently suffering erosion and extinction and thus, it is crucial to improve conservation strategies to maintain this essential resource. If unchecked this genetic erosion and species extinction will cause unnecessary and irreversible harm to the economy and social well being of Europe. Much plant biodiversity is undoubtedly found in the existing 9654 European protected areas that cover 1,066,358 km(2), but clearly targeted and active conservation of priority plant species is required within these protected areas. To help ensure more efficient long-term sustainable conservation, A novel approach to the in situ conservation of European plants, notably crop wild relatives, is suggested. The purpose of this approach is to know what plant genetic resources (PGR) we have, where they are located and to assess whether the current network of protected areas includes a representative sample of European PGR diversity. The generation of in situ conservation and management plans for PGR populations in existing protected areas can significantly improve the present conservation status. Additionally, the identification of gaps of certain PGR in current protected areas can provide the basis for the designation of new. complementary PGR in situ reserves. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

TI Contribution of biological nitrogen fixation to cowpea: a strategy for
   improving grain yield in the semi-arid region of Brazil

AB Nodulating bacteria from the family Rhizobiaceae are common in the semi-arid tropics around the world. The Brazilian semi-arid region extends over 95 million hectares of which only 3% is suitable for irrigation, therefore leaving an immense dryland area to be exploited by peasant farmers, who often lack appropriate technologies for sustainable management. Cowpea is an important crop in this area, representing the staple protein source for human nutrition. This work aimed to identify rhizobial strains capable of guaranteeing sufficient nitrogen derived from biological fixation for cowpea cultivated in dryland areas, evaluating not just efficiency but also the ecological parameters of competitiveness and survival in the soil. Grain yield and nodulation parameters showed that strain BR 3267 is capable of establishing efficient nodulation, improving both yield and total N accumulated in grain. Cowpea inoculated with strain BR 3267 showed grain productivity similar to plants receiving 50 kg of N per hectare, which is the amount of fertilizer commonly used in the north-east region. These characteristics associated with previously determined ecological properties makes strain BR 3267 an important resource for the optimization of biological nitrogen fixation in cowpea in the dryland areas of the semi-arid tropics. Data on the dynamics of rhizobial populations in such areas have shown that (1) the naturalized rhizobium population is very small and, by themselves, do not promote proper nodulation and, (2) the inoculant rhizobia do not persist between crops. Such characteristics represent an opportunity for the introduction of superior rhizobia strains, such as BR 3267, during the cowpea crop.

TI Submucosal microinfusion of endothelin and adrenaline mobilizes ECL-cell
   histamine in rat stomach, and causes mucosal damage: a microdialysis
   study

AB 1 Rat stomach ECL cells release histamine in response to gastrin. Submucosal microinfusion of endothelin or adrenaline, known to cause vasoconstriction and gastric lesions, mobilized striking amounts of histamine. While the histamine response to gastrin is sustainable for hours, that to endothelin and adrenaline was characteristically short-lasting (1-2 h).
   2 The aims of this study were to identify the cellular source of histamine mobilized by endothelin and adrenaline, and examine the differences between the histamine-mobilizing effects of gastrin, and of endothelin and adrenaline.
   3 Endothelin, adrenaline or gastrin were administered by submucosal microinfusion. Gastric histamine mobilization was monitored by microdialysis.
   4 Local pretreatment with the H-1-receptor antagonist mepyramine and the H-2-receptor antagonist ranitidine did not prevent endothelin- or adrenaline-induced mucosal damage. Submucosal microinfusion of histamine did not cause damage. Acid blockade by ranitidine or omeprazole prevented the damage, suggesting that acid back diffusion contributes.
   5 Gastrin raised histidine decarboxylase (HDC) activity close to the probe, without affecting the histamine concentration. Endothelin and adrenaline lowered histamine by 50-70%, without activating HDC. Histamine mobilization declined upon repeated administration. Endothelin reduced the number of histamine-immunoreactive ECL cells locally, and reduced the number of secretory vesicles. Thus, unlike gastrin, endothelin (and adrenaline) is capable of exhausting ECL-cell histamine.
   6 Microinfusion of alpha-fluoromethylhistidine (known to deplete ECL cells but not mast cells of histamine) reduced the histamine-mobilizing effect of endothelin by 80%, while 1-week pretreatment with omeprazole enhanced it, supporting the involvement of ECL cells.
   7 Somatostatin or the prostanoid misoprostol inhibited gastrin-, but not endothelin-stimulated histamine release, suggesting that endothelin and gastrin mobilize histamine via different mechanisms.
   8 While gastrin effectively mobilized histamine from ECL cells in primary culture, endothelin had no effect, and adrenaline, a modest effect. Hence, the striking effects of endothelin and adrenaline on ECL cells in situ are probably indirect, possibly a consequence of ischemia.

The sustainability of cereal cropping systems may be improved by the addition of legumes. The effects of seeding rate were studied for intercrops of berseem clover (Trifolium alexandrinum L.) and oats (Avena sativa L.). Bigbee berseem clover, an annual forage legume, was intercropped with oats on a Black Chernozemic soil at Edmonton, Alberta, in 1996 and 1997. Berseem dry matter (DM) yields were greatly reduced by increasing oat plant density. There was a linear decline in berseem DM with increasing oat DM or oat tiller density. The relationship between oat plant density and berseem DM was nonlinear and varied between years and harvests. Berseem yield reductions varied from 44 to 82% with target densities of 100 oat plants m(-2). Effects of berseem seeding rate (BSR) on oats varied between years. Increasing BSR from 6 to 24 kg ha(-1) decreased oat tillering, oat DM and oat plant DM by 22-51, 0-57 and 8-51 %, respectively, and increased oat tiller DM by 0-18%, with oats at 10 to 20 plants m(-2). Differences between years were likely due to environmental factors and relative emergence times. After a silage-stage harvest, oat regrowth was negligible but berseem regrowth averaged 3.1 Mg ha(-1) DM.

AB The Red Data Book of Japanese Vascular Plants is based on their risk of extinction. In order to construct the list, 2000 taxa were evaluated using population data and rates of decline for approximate to4400 grids, each of approximate to100 km(2). This database can be used to estimate the impact of human activity on a threatened plant's risk of extinction. In order to evaluate extinction risks and apply the evaluation to conservation actions, the discount mean time to extinction is defined as a measure of extinction risk, where the present value of a species' persistence in the future decreases exponentially. The rate of decrease has to be much less than the rate of economic discounting, in order to realize intergenerational sustainability. Increases of the inverse, and logarithm, of the discount mean time to extinction are considered measures of the extinction risk. We applied these measures to an environmental impact assessment for the Japanese World Exposition that is to be held in 2005. Development will have a greater impact on threatened Salvia species than it will on star magnolia, Magnolia tomentosa, which has been conserved by changing the site plan. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

AB In the first part of the paper urban sustainability issues in African countries are considered with a focus on urban growth. The need for urban management tools that are able to provide prospective scenarios is addressed. Urban simulations can represent a useful approach to an understanding of the consequences of current planning policies or their incompleteness. Simulations of future urban growth are usually quite difficult without tools that embrace the complexity of the urban system. The second part of this paper describes an urban growth simulation for the city of Lagos in Nigeria using a dynamic spatial model prototype. We propose a bottom-up approach, integrating land-use factors with a dynamic approach for modelling future urban land-use scenarios. The model for Lagos was calibrated and tested using measured time-series data on land-use, through a set of spatial metrics and Kappa (K) coefficients. Afterwards, a twenty-year simulation was run until 2020. The simulation results are realistic and relatively accurate, confirming the effectiveness of the proposed model. This work was performed in the framework of the European Commission's MOLAND project. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Site selection is a key factor in any aquaculture operation, affecting both success and sustainability. Moreover, it can solve conflicts between different coastal activities, making a rational use of the coastal space. Geographical information systems (GIS) have become of increased significance for environmental planning and assessment mainly because of the need to compare a great number of spatially related data, and because it can be used to couple these spatial data with their attributes and overlay them. This study used GIS and related technology to build a spatial database using those criteria which were considered to have any influence in integrating marine fish-cage culture within the tourism industry in Tenerife. Criteria were grouped in three submodels (distance to beaches, nautical sports, and viewshed), which were combined to generate a final output showing the most suitable areas for cage culture development in coexistence with tourism. Most areas of the coastline of Tenerife were identified as being suitable (56%) or very suitable (46%), suggesting that marine cage aquaculture could be developed on the island in coexistence with the well-established tourism industry.

TI Hunting-related changes in game encounter rates from 1994 to 2001 in the
   Mbaracayu Reserve, Paraguay
SO CONSERVATION BIOLOGY

AB This longitudinal study examines the impact of native hunting on the populations of 10 important game species in the Mbaracayu Reserve, Paraguay. From July 1994 to July 2001, native Ache research assistants surveyed 7,535 km of diurnal random transects in the reserve. Analyses of data from these transects and harvest-rate data from 5,526 Ache hunter days suggest that the hunting return rate declined significantly for one species. Nonsignificant declines were observed for 6 of the other 9 species. Native harvest percentages of the stock population appear sustainable for 10 major prey species, but rates of harvest from nonindigenous poaching could not be determined. Crude encounter rates for all 10 species declined over time, but only 2 of these were statistically significant in a univariate model. Multivariate logistic regression controlling for habitat type and location in the reserve showed significant declines in encounter rates over time for 4 species, but the effect of interaction between time and hunting pressure failed to confirm that declines in encounter rates were steeper in more-hunted versus less-hunted areas of the reserve. This may mean that other factors unrelated to hunting pressure are responsible for some of the declines in game encounter rates.

AB There is renewed interest in the revival of health co-operative as a "third option" for meeting health care needs of populations in developing countries in the context of health sector reforms. This article reviews some international experiences with health co-operatives. We briefly assess the history of health co-operatives in industrialized countries where they originated and review past experience from China and the states of Kerala and Gujarat in India to explore the viability of health co-operatives for the provision of health care. In industrialized countries, co-operatives came into existence as autonomous entities with voluntary participation, aiming to contribute to the welfare of their members. In recent years, however, co-operatives are being envisaged as a mechanism to overcome economic barriers in access to health care, despite lack of evidence of their cost-effectiveness and sustainability. In China, health co-operatives achieved universal coverage of basic health services but became dysfunctional when state support was withdrawn. In Gujarat/India, co-operatives have been useful to provide primary health care services and not as a mechanism to run hospitals and provide medical care for the general population. In Kerala/India, health co-operatives could not successfully compete with expanding state health services and private services unless they were managed like private enterprises. In terms of managerial effectiveness and sustainability co-operatives can not be "prescribed" to compensate for the deteriorating access to health services following market-oriented health sector reforms in developing countries.

AB In Uttaranchal state of the Indian Himalayas, where population pressure continues to increase, significant agro-ecological features of rainfed hill crop farming include continuously changing land use patterns, high cropping intensity (161%), the dominance (> 70%) of small size landholdings (< 1 hectare (ha)) and scarcity of arable land (0.10-0.15 ha capita(-1)). Using various agricultural regionalization techniques, cropping patterns and their productivity have been analyzed by different methods to ascertain regional imbalances and gaps in the spatio-temporal distribution of sustainable crop systems. While there are various cropping patterns in the study area-a wheat-paddy combination, involving the two important staple crops is dominant in six of the eight districts analyzed. In some other districts, a few other crops have very high concentration. Crop diversity as a whole is low in the Uttaranchal Himalaya. Regarding crop productivity, five districts out of eight can support only five persons ha(-1), as measured by the standard nutrition units (SNUs) per ha, which is below the sustenance level. These five districts have been identified as the weakest productive regions of the study region and require additional development attention. SNUs per person are poor in the same regions of the hills, with the exception of Nainital district. The Kumaun region of Uttaranchal, which has a relatively moderate topography compared to the Garhwal, hill region is productive enough to nearly provide adequate food for its people.

AB Ecological engineering is defined as "the design of sustainable ecosystems that integrate human society with its natural environment for the benefit of both." It involves the restoration of ecosystems that have been substantially disturbed by human activities such as environmental pollution or land disturbance, and the development of new sustainable ecosystems that have both human and ecological value. While there was some early discussion of ecological engineering in the 1960s, its development was spawned later by several factors, including loss of confidence in the view that all pollution problems can be solved through technological means and the realization that with technological means, pollutants are just being moved from one form to another. Conventional approaches require massive amounts of resources to solve these problems, and that in turn perpetuates carbon and nitrogen cycle problems, for example. The development of ecological engineering was given strong impetus in the last decade with a textbook, the journal Ecological Engineering and two professional ecological engineering societies. Five principles about ecological engineering are: (1) It is based on the self-designing capacity of ecosystems; (2) It can be the acid test of ecological theories; (3) It relies on system approaches; (4) It conserves non-renewable energy sources; and (5) It supports biological conservation. Ecology as a science is not routinely integrated into engineering curricula, even in environmental engineering programs, while shortcoming, ecologists, environmental scientists, and managers miss important training in their profession-problem solving. These two problems could be solved in the integrated field of ecological engineering. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A shift from traditional engineering approaches to ecologically-based techniques will require changing societal values regarding 'how and what' is defined as engineering and design. Non-human species offer many ecological engineering examples that are often beneficial to ecosystem function and other biota. For example, organisms known as 'ecosystem engineers' build, modify, and destroy habitat in their quest for food and survival. Similarly, 'keystone species' have greater impacts on community or ecosystem function than would be predicted from their abundance. The capacity of these types of organisms to affect ecosystems is great. They exert controlling influences over ecosystems and communities by altering resource allocation, creating habitats and modifying relative competitive advantages.
   Species' effects in ecosystems, although context-dependent, can be evaluated as 'beneficial' or 'detrimental'. The evaluation depends on whether effects on other species or ecosystem function are more or less desirable from a given perspective. Organisms with beneficial impacts facilitate the presence of other species, employ efficient nutrient cycling, and are sometimes characterized by specific mutualisms. In contrast, many cases of detrimental engineering are found from introduced (i.e., exotic) species and are characterized by a loss of species richness, a lack of nutrient retention and the degradation of ecosystem integrity. Species' impacts on ecosystems and community traits have been quantified in ecological studies and can be used similarly to understand, design and model human engineering structures and impacts on the landscape. Emulation of species with beneficial impacts on ecosystems can provide powerful guidance to the goals of ecological engineering. Using role model organisms that have desirable effects on species diversity and ecosystem function will be important in developing alternatives to traditional engineering practices, (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.

AB Pioneering efforts in ecological engineering (a precedent setting engineering and applied science discipline in which the self-engineering capabilities of ecosystems are managed for the benefit of the environment and humankind) research and practice have proven to be tremendous strides toward establishing a new engineering discipline with a science base in ecology. Case studies, demonstrations and applications pertaining to restoration, rehabilitation, conservation, sustainability, reconstruction, remediation and reclamation of ecosystems using ecological engineering techniques are numerous. This has brought the field to the current level where many scientists and engineers adequately support the concept of, and need for, ecological engineering, and generally agree that ecological engineering has been sufficiently defined. There is also general agreement that full emergence as an engineering discipline remains a difficult task. Certain general characteristics of existing engineering disciplines can guide the emergence of ecological engineering and thus are a vital context covered in this paper. From the context of engineering practice, three concepts are evident including: (1) establishment of formal foundations for ecological engineering research and development;, (2) development of core ecological engineering sciences and curricula; and (3) certification in ecological design. These elements are important components of a formal approach to develop ecological engineering as a principled, quantitative, recognized, practical, novel, and formal engineering discipline that coalesces past and future research and practice into cohesive underpinnings.

AB Considerable effort is being expended on research and demonstration projects aimed at introducing hydrogen into the transportation sector as a fuel, generally motivated by concerns about carbon dioxide emissions and petroleum imports (or scarcity). In this paper we focus on one aspect of strategy for introducing hydrogen-the choice of transportation mode. Our analysis suggests that cost of introducing hydrogen can be reduced by selecting a mode that uses a small number of relatively large vehicles that are operated by professional crews along a limited number of point-to-point routes or within a small geographic area. In addition, technological innovation in vehicle design will take place most quickly in modes where individual vehicles are produced to order and each receives significant engineering attention (not those manufactured in vast quantities on assembly lines). The immediate environmental benefits of introducing hydrogen fuel will occur in modes that have relatively less stringent pollution regulations applied to them. These insights, suggest that heavy-duty freight modes would be a less costly way to introduce hydrogen as a transportation fuel and a more effective way to advance hydrogen-related technologies so that they could subsequently be used more widely in light-duty vehicles.

TI Development of techno-economic integrated models: LFSGR and aerobic
   composting for municipal waste management
SO ENVIRONMENT AND DEVELOPMENT ECONOMICS
LA English
DT Article
AB In the present study, integrated models have been developed to find out the most appropriate cost of municipal solid waste (MSW) disposal using two potential and widely used methodologies, viz. landfill system with gas recovery (LFSGR) and aerobic composting (AC). Objective functions with important costs and benefits including externalities were developed to find out the net unit cost of disposal. Multivariate functional models have been developed for each activity of the objective functions. These integrated techno-economic models can be used not only to determine the most appropriate cost of waste disposal, but also to explain the interparametric linkages and even to compare the potentiality and suitability of a particular methodology for a set of conditions. This can give valuable information that can enhance environmental management leading to sustainable development.
   In the simulation studies carried out, LFSGR with its proven energy generating potential from MSW in the form of landfill gas, was found to perform better than aerobic composting (AC) for rates of waste generation greater than 1,000-2,000 t/d (tons per day). LFSGR showed a better performance irrespective of the landfill collection system installation and operation costs. For both methodologies, unit cost of disposal was most sensitive to land rent followed by, in the case of LFSGR, the organic content.

TI Personal mobility: a corporeal dimension of transnationalisation. The
   case of long-distance travel from Sweden
SO ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING A
LA English
DT Article
ID TIME; CONSUMPTION; FUTURE
AB Mobility is a key concept within recent social theorising on globalisation, transnationalisation of social relations, and new divisions of society. Mobility growth is also central to issues of global warming and the need for sustainable development. The aim of this paper is to elucidate empirically some properties of recent developments in international mobility. A theoretically informed understanding of changing patterns of long-distance travel is briefly outlined. This understanding is confronted with empirical findings concerning the actual development of international travel from Sweden during the 1990s. The findings confirm expected trends of further increasing intensity, extensity, and velocity in long-distance mobility. A tendency towards globalisation is observed, though an intraregional transnationalisation is the dominant process at work. It is concluded that an increasing short-term flexibilisation in people's use of time and space is a more important driving force behind the transnationalisation of mobility, than is the geographical extension of more enduring social relations. Influencing factors behind the social division of mobility are addressed by identifying the hypermobile segment of the population. Implications for the wider issues of globalisation and environmental sustainability are discussed.

TI Guadalajara's water crisis and the fate of Lake Chapala: a reflection of
   poor water management in Mexico
SO ENVIRONMENT AND URBANIZATION
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper describes the water crisis faced by the city of Guadalajara with the drying up of its main source of water, Lake Chapala. This drying up of Mexico's largest lake will cause far-reaching economic and ecological consequences for the extended region. The paper also examines the underlying causes, which are centred on the inadequate and unsustainable management of the Lerma-Chapala river basin (that extends over five states). It looks at the innovative, although as yet insufficient, institutional response towards integrated sustainable water management in Mexico, which centres on a shift from centralized water management at the federal level to a multi-stakeholder and participative system based in river basins, and reflects on the current challenges posed.

DT Article
AB This paper describes the growing trend for microfinance institutions in many different nations to provide loans for home improvements with examples drawn mainly from India, Peru, Mexico, the Philippines and Bangladesh. It describes the nature and scale of various institutions' home-improvement loan portfolios and the modifications needed in loan terms and conditions from conventional micro-enterprise loans. It also considers what is known about the impacts of such loans, and examines their financial sustainability and the conditions that allow for rapid expansion in the number of home improvements supported. It ends by discussing what is needed from national governments and international agencies to support such an expansion.

AB Dust storms in north China, which are associated with land deterioration from increasing human pressures, have intensified over the past decades. Although synoptic meteorological conditions and sedimental environments dictate the occurrence of dust storms, their increase in frequency in north China due to human activities can be expected. Sand stabilization and control projects may be compromised by the pursuit of short-term economic returns and lack of systematic and integrated understanding of land degradation. Two actions are recommended as positive responses to escalating dust storms in north China. A policy of long-term ecologically sustainable development strategies is needed as well as a scientific research initiative combining biophysical and socioeconomic aspects.

AB Military and civilian aircraft overflights are an issue that may impact the quality of life for millions of United States residents. Aircraft noise annoys many people worldwide and is generally thought to adversely affect some wildlife species. In light of increasing demands being placed on airspace, and because of technological improvements in acoustical testing, there is a need to reexamine the effects of aircraft noise exposure on humans and wild-life. This paper reviews past research, current laws and legislation, and presents an argument for the need to revisit the effects of aircraft noise on humans and wildlife. Some evidence suggests that noise may adversely impact wildlife and humans, however, many of the past studies were inconclusive and based on relatively small sample sizes. Given that aircraft noise abatement legislation has been enacted and because of the recent promulgation of community-based noise awareness programs, future studies should be conducted to resolve public policy problems and debates associated with aircraft noise. The need to further study the effects of aircraft noise on humans and wildlife is critical for creating sustainable land use policies near aircraft installations. Data derived from these studies will be used to create sound public policies that enhance the operational capacity of military and civilian aircraft while reducing the opportunity for human and wildlife exposure to aircraft noise.

AB Soil organic C (SOC) content can increase by managing land use practices in which the rates of organic C input exceed those of organic C mineralization. Understanding the changes in SOC content of Black soils (mainly Typic Halpudoll) in northeast China is necessary for sustainable using of soil resources there. We used the RothC model to estimate SOC levels of Black soils under monoculture cropping corn in a long-term fertilization trial at Gongzhuling, Jilin Province, China. The model outputs for the changes in SOC were compared with measured data in this long-term fertilization/manure trial. The sound performance of model in simulating SOC changes suggests that RothC is feasible with Black soils in the temperate climatic region of northeast China. The modeled and measured results indicated that the treatment without fertilizer/farmyard manure (FYM) addition led to a continuous decline in SOC during the study period and N and NPK fertilization were inadequate to maintain the SOC levels in the plow layer (upper 20 cm) unless FYM was added under the current conventional management associated with no above-ground crop residues returning into the soil. Soil organic carbon could follow the same path of decline if the same management practices are maintained. Model results indicate that returning above-ground crop residues to the soil from 2002 to 2022 would increase SOC by 26% for the treatment without fertilization addition, 40% for N treatment, 45% for NPK treatment, and 38% and 46% for N and NPK treatments with FYM addition, compared to the levels in the corresponding treatments in 2002. The simulation results suggest that the RothC model is a feasible tool to assess SOC trend under different management practices, and returning above-ground crop residues into the soil would lead to a remarkable increase in SOC of Black soils in the region.

ID ECOLOGY
AB The Prairie Ecozone contains 5% of Canada's land area and represents 16% of the Great Plains of North America. Current estimates indicate that 25 - 30% of original Canadian grassland habitats remain, largely concentrated in southeastern Alberta and southwestern Saskatchewan with fragments distributed throughout southern Manitoba. The size, distribution and condition of native grasslands serve as valuable indicators of the ecological integrity and the sustainability of those landscape types. With so little native grasslands remaining, areas that conserve grasslands serve as core sites for indicators such as gaps in ecosystem and wildlife habitat protection, i.e. which ecosystems are well-represented, poorly represented or have no representation. Such gap analyses helps to determine where protection efforts need to be placed in the future. Overall, about 3.5% of the Prairie Ecozone of Canada is under some form of conservation area status. This paper reports, relative to the ecoregions and political jurisdictions of the Prairie Ecozone, on the amount and distribution of various types of conservation areas and native grasslands. Relationships between the occurrence of conservation areas and grasslands are presented. Implications for conservation area planning and management are discussed within regional, national and international contexts. The issue of which characteristics of conservation areas should be assessed and monitored to address conservation objectives for sustainability is also discussed.

AB Climate change is expected to have important impacts on aquatic ecosystems. On the Boreal Shield, mean annual air temperatures are expected to increase 2 to 4degreesC over the next 50 years. An important challenge is to predict how changes in climate and climate variability will impact natural systems so that sustainable management policies can be implemented. To predict responses to complex ecosystem changes associated with climate change, we used long-term biotic databases to evaluate how important elements of the biota in Boreal Shield lakes have responded to past fluctuations in climate. Our long-term records span a two decade period where there have been unusually cold years and unusually warm years. We used coherence analyses to test for regionally operating controls on climate, water temperature, pH, and plankton richness and abundance in three regions across Ontario: the Experimental Lakes Area, Sudbury, and Dorset. Inter-annual variation in air temperature was similar among regions, but there was a weak relationship among regions for precipitation. While air temperature was closely related to lake surface temperatures in each of the regions, there were weak relationships between lake surface temperature and richness or abundance of the plankton. However, inter-annual changes in lake chemistry (i.e., pH) were correlated with some biotic variables. In some lakes in Sudbury and Dorset, pH was dependent on extreme events. For example, El Nino related droughts resulted in acidification pulses in some lakes that influenced phytoplankton and zooplankton richness. These results suggest that there can be strong heterogeneity in lake ecosystem responses within and across regions.

AB The paper describes the Ecological Monitoring and Assessment Network's (EMAN) operational and program response to certain challenges of environmental monitoring in Canada, in particular, efforts to improve the ability of the network to deliver relevant information to decision makers. In addition to its familiar roles, environmental monitoring should deliver feedback to society on environmental changes associated with development patterns, trends, processes and interventions. In order for such feedback to be effective, it must be relevant, timely, useful and accessible: all characteristics that are defined by the user, not the provider. Demand driven environmental monitoring is explored through EMAN's experiences with Canada's Biosphere Reserves, the NatureWatch Program and the Canadian Community Monitoring Network.

DE community based monitoring; ecosystem change; influence; sustainability
AB Community-based ecosystem monitoring activities in Canada are increasing in response to a number of factors including: (i) the needs of decision-makers for timely information on local environmental changes; (ii) limited use of government monitoring data and information by decision makers; (iii) government cuts to monitoring programs; (iv) the increasingly recognized need to include stakeholders in planning and management processes; and ( v) the desire of citizens to contribute to environmental protection. To date there has been no network coordination of community based monitoring in Canada. This paper reports on the establishment of the Canadian Community Monitoring Network by Environment Canada's Ecological Monitoring and Assessment Network Coordinating Office and the Canadian Nature Federation. Information on research prepared in support of network establishment is presented along with a discussion of the potential of the network.

ID CATCH DATA; HOOK
AB A study of European hake Merluccius merluccius gill net selectivity was undertaken off the Algarve (Southern Portugal), between 1999 and 2001. Four nominal mesh sizes (70, 80, 90 and 100 mm) were used in fishing trials and the 'share each length class catch total' (SELECT) method was used to fit gill net selectivity curves. Hake were caught in the same size range by all mesh sizes, between 17 and 65 cm total length. While most fishes were wedged, significant and similar proportions were entangled in all mesh sizes, contributing to the wide size range, and in some cases, bimodal shape of catch size frequency distributions. Insignificant numbers of undersized hake were caught, with most catches consisting of mature female fish. Catch rates decreased sharply with increasing mesh size. The bimodal model gave the best fit for hake that were wedged, with estimated modal lengths of 40.1, 46.7 and 51.0 cm for the 70, 80 and 90 mm nominal mesh sizes, respectively. The high catch per unit effort of the smallest mesh size, with most fish caught being female, together with the fact that the modal length of the fitted selectivity curve is well below the size at maturity for hake in Portuguese waters, suggests that the 80 mm nominal mesh size is more appropriate for ensuring resource sustainability.

TI Evaluating the efficacy of managing West Coast groundfish resources

ID AFRICAN PELAGIC FISHERY; SOUTH EAST FISHERY; MANAGEMENT PROCEDURES;
   HARVEST RATES; NEW-ZEALAND; PERFORMANCE; ROCKFISH; PACIFIC
AB Management of West Coast groundfish resources by the Pacific Fishery Management Council involves Federal government and academic scientists conducting stock assessments, generally using the stock synthesis framework, applying the 40-10 rule to determine harvest guidelines for resources that are not overfished and conducting rebuilding analyses to determine harvest guidelines for resources that have been designated as overfished. However, this management system has not been evaluated in terms of its ability to satisfy the National Standard 1 goals of the Sustainable Fisheries Act. A Monte Carlo simulation framework is therefore, outlined that can be used to make such evaluations. Based on simulations tailored to a situation similar to that of managing the widow rockfish (Sebastes entomelas) resource, it is shown that catches during recovery and thereafter are likely to be highly variable (up to +/-30% from one year to the next). Such variability is far greater than has been presented to the decision makers to date. Reductions in interannual variability in catches through additional data collection are, however, unlikely. Rather, improved performance will probably arise from better methods for predicting future recruitment. Rebuilding analyses include quantities such as the year to which the desired probability of recovery applies. The estimates of such quantities are, however, very poorly determined.

AB An efficient depression of coal sulphides in the flotation process means a healthier environment and may be essential for the sustainability of a coal operation. Nitric and ferric oxidative pre-treatment of coal pyrite have been tested to improve pyrite depression, and the results are compared with those from the process of raw, not pre-treated coal. The removal indexes point to nitric pre-treatment as the best, but depression is still low. The microscopic study of feed and products, coupled to Digital Image Analysis (DIA) in all the cases, provide important clues to understand the behaviour of pyrite, which can be related to quantitative parameters, such as the exposition ratio (ER), and to qualified interpretation of the textures. Pyrite shows in the first float an unexpected hydrophobic behaviour, which is due to its occurrence as framboids, or porous particles which may be intergrown with organic matter and behave as coal. In general, the flotation results can be predicted from the DIA-data, e.g. depression of liberated pyrite into the tailings, increased by oxidative pre-treatments by 300% (ferric) or by >400% (nitric); or concentration of middlings with lower pyrite ER in the floats. DIA is an efficient tool to obtain some important quantitative informations which otherwise would be inaccessible (e.g. the morphological data on >1,000,000 pyrite particles for this study), and its use should be enhanced to check ore processing.

ID SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT; DESIGN
AB Backcasting represents a form of explicitly normative scenario analysis. This paper reviews some of the key theoretical and methodological issues that are raised by a backcasting approach and discusses how these are addressed in the Georgia Basin Futures Project, a five year participatory integrated assessment project focusing on modeling, scenario analysis and community engagement. The paper argues for a "second generation" form of backcasting, where the desired future is not determined in advance of the analysis but is an emergent property of the process of engaging with users and project partners. In this sense backcasting contributes to a process of social learning about possible and desirable futures. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Collaborative efforts between university researchers and community entities such as citizen coalitions and community-based organizations to provide health prevention programs are widespread. The authors describe their attempt to develop and implement a method for assessing whether community organizations had the organizational capacity to collaborate in a national study to prevent HIV infection among young men who have sex with men and what, if any, needs these institutions had for organizational capacity development assistance. The Feasibility, Evaluation Ability, and Sustainability Assessment (FEASA) combines, qualitative methods for collecting data (interviews, organizational records, observations) from multiple sources to document an organization's capacity to provide HIV prevention services and its capacity-development needs. The authors describe experiences piloting FEASA in 13 communities and the benefits of using a systematic approach to partnership development.

AB Composted poultry litter (CPL) may be applied as a mulch in fruit orchards to manage waste and to provide a slow-release nutrient source and weed control. With proper management, poultry manure and bedding (litter) can prevent environmental degradation, such as hypoxia in aquatic communities. Peach (Prunes persica L. 'Sunhigh') plots all received preemergence herbicides in May and then the following treatments in June 1998: commercial fertilizer (N at 15 g(.)m(-2)), low rate CPL (N at 15 g(.)m(-2) as CPL at 2.9 kg(.)m(-2)), high rate CPL (N at 62 g(.)m(-2) as CPL at 11.6 kg(.)-m(-2)), and no fertilizer or mulch control. Weed's were completely controlled by mulch and herbicide during 1998 but not during 1999. By Sept. 1999, the high rate of CPL had only 27 % weed cover compared with 86% for the commercial fertilizer-treated plots. Soil N was highest (NH4-N and NO3-N at 16.4 and 18.6 mg(.)kg(-1) soil, respectively) in plots treated with commercial fertilizer, 6 weeks after treatment (WAT). Soil N did not differ among the two CPL treatments and the control at any time. At the high rate of CPL, there was NH4-N and NO3-N at 3.2 and 0.7 mg(.)kg(-1) soil, respectively, at 6 WAT. Water-extractable P (WEP) in the soil did not differ among the CPL and commercial fertilizer treatments at 6 WAT (P at approximate to14 mg(.)kg(-1) soil). However, at 47 WAT, plots with the high rate of CPL had significantly higher WEP, with P at 30 mg(.)kg(-1) soil vs. 14 mg(.)kg(-1) soil in plots treated with commercial fertilizer. High applications of CPL could elevate P in surface runoff to levels that cause environmental degradation. In general, Mehlich 1-extractable P (MEP) did not differ among the CPL- and fertilizer-treated plots (averaging P at 45 mg(.)kg(-1) soil). MEP was lowest in control plots (averaging P at 21 mg(.)kg(-1) soil). Results indicate that CPL could be used as a weed suppressant without adversely affecting N release to the environment; however, P concentration in soil water may be problematic.

AB Several orchard floor management strategies were evaluated beginning in Fall 1993 in a 'Limoneira 8A Lisbon' lemon (Citrus limon) grove on the Yuma Mesa in Yuma, Ariz. and in a 'Valencia' orange (Citrus sinensis) grove at the University of Arizona Citrus Agricultural Center, Waddell, Ariz. At Yuma, disking provided acceptable weed control except underneath the tree canopies where bermudagrass (Cynodon dactylon), purple nutsedge (Cyperus rotundus), and other weed species survived. Mowing the orchard floor suppressed broadleaf weed species allowing the spread of grasses, primarily bermudagrass. Preemergence (norflurazon and oryzalin) and postemergence (glyphosate and sethoxydim) herbicides were used to control weeds in the clean culture treatment in Yuma. After three harvest seasons (1994-95 through 1996-97), the cumulative yield of the clean culture treatment was 385 kg (848.8 lb) per tree, which was significantly greater than the 332 kg (731.9 lb) and 320 kg (705.5 lb) per tree harvested in the disking and mowing treatments, respectively. In addition, the clean culture treatment had a significantly greater percentage of fruit in the 115 and larger size category at the first harvest of the 1995-96 season than either the disk or mow treatments. At Waddell, the management strategies compared were clean culture (at this location only postemergence herbicides were used), mowing of resident weeds with a vegetation-free strip in the tree row, and a 'Salina' strawberry clover (Trifolium fragiferum) cover crop with a vegetation-free strip. The cumulative 3-year yield (1994-95 through 1996-97) of the clean culture treatment was 131 kg (288.8 lb) per tree, which was significantly greater then the 110 kg (242.5 lb) per tree yield of the mowed resident weed treatment. The yield of the strawberry clover treatment, 115 kg (253.5 lb) of oranges per tree, was not significantly different from the other two treatments. The presence of cover crops or weeds on the orchard floor was found to have beneficial effects on soil nitrogen and soil organic matter content, but no effect on orange leaf nutrient content. The decrease in yield in the disked or mowed resident weed treatments compared to the dean culture treatment in both locations was attributed to competition for water.

AB A major factor limiting application of bacterial sulfate reduction to removal of sulfate and heavy metals in wetland systems is the requirement to supply carbon and energy to drive the process. Primary production by aquatic plants and algae is a cheap option for driving sustainable bacterial sulfate reduction and most operational systems have relied on plants. The use of harvested. non-growing algal biomass to support bacterial sulfate reduction was investigated. Two genera of green algae, strains N9 and A3, were isolated from treatment cells from the Artificial Wetland Filter at the Ranger uranium mine (Northern Territory, Australia) which successfully removes UO22+, Mn2+ and nitrate, but little sulfate, from mine waters. These algae were identified as Carteria sp. and Scenedesmus sp. and were used as the sole carbon and energy source to enrich a sulfate-reducing mixed bacterial culture from the constructed wetland. Bacterial sulfate reduction supported solely by degradation of algal biomass was demonstrated at laboratory scale using both algae. In excess of 300 mg/L, sulfate was reduced in 17 days following an initial period of approximately 8 days during which sulfate levels did not decrease. The amount and rate of reduction was shown to be dependent on the concentration of algal biomass added. Carteria algae at low concentration showed reduction earlier; however, yields at higher concentration were affected by unknown inhibition. Scenedesmus strain N9 produced a maximum specific yield of 94.3 g of sulfate reduced per gram biomass added compared with 43.5 for Carteria strain A3. Sequence analysis of the 16S rRNA gene of members of the bacterial consortium indicated that the sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) showed highest homology (98.5%) with Desulfovibrio alcoholovorans. A second bacterium, which showed homologies of 91-92% with organisms of the Clostridial assemblage, was also present in the culture and represents a new species, or possibly a new genus.

AB The high turnover of carbon dioxide during bacterial oxidation of sulfides witnessed in cultures of Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans Leptospirillum ferroxidans, and even more efficient by Sulfolobus and other thermophile bacteria (e.g., Acidianus brierleyi), and the parallel rapid buildup of bacterial biomass suggests a coupling of these processes to solar energy in order to develop carbon dioxide cycling technologies for sustainable future applications. Synergistic effects can be expected with biometallurgical research and technology which also aims to further increase energy turnover reflected in higher leaching rates. The prospective technology has been investigated by growing bacteria on iron sulfide synthesized from iron sulfate using solar energy A catalytic process was developed which allows sulfate to sulfide reduction at a carbon electrode at 120 degreesC. Photovoltaic energy is used to drive the electrochemical reaction and thermal heat for maintaining the operation temperature. H2S is immediately converted in Fe2+-containing solution to iron sulfide which is supplied to bacterial cultures for biological CO2 fixation. It is estimated that solar-powered biohydrometallurgical processes for CO2 fixation may reach efficiencies exceeding biological photosynthesis by one order of magnitude. In addition, they can be operated in infertile environments with very limited water. The bacterial biomass has a high quality and could be used for energy, materials, and even for food production. The perspectives and challenges for coupling biohydrometallurgical processes to regenerative energy utilization are discussed. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Primary determinants of the productivity of most fisheries are the level of fishing mortality and the age structure of the catch. Constraints on nominal effort or catch and technical measures such as mesh sizes are typically the most effective methods of ensuring productivity and sustainability. Stock assessment models are generally well adapted to assess the biological implications (though less often the economic implications) of these measures. However, the increasing use of spatial management measures such as marine protected areas (MPAs) or seasonal area closures presents new challenges for fishery managers. Assessment models and data collection programs are rarely designed or adaptable for analysis of these measures. Using spatial management measures effectively requires new models and data. Models of Georges Bank groundfish fisheries are presented and used to explore the impacts of area closures in the context of the overall management system. Although the spatial dynamics of the models are highly stylized, they illustrate mechanisms through which area closures can increase productivity and profitability of a spatially heterogeneous multispecies fishery. The utility of taxes to control the distribution of effort is also explored. (C) 2003 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.

ID MODEL
AB Big changes occurred in the Eastern Baltic cod biomass and catches in the 1976-1997 period. At present, the Eastern Baltic cod stock spawning biomass (SSB) and catches are approximately five times lower than their highest ever recorded levels observed in the middle of the 1980s. The reasons for the stock decline, namely low recruitment and high fishing mortality, are widely known and well described in the literature. Throughout the whole period, the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) made scientific recommendations regarding the exploitation level of the cod stock. The ICES presented and analysed different management strategies based on fishing mortalities which corresponded to biological reference points (BRP) and also recommended total allowable catches (TACs) for cod, taking into account the sustainability of cod resources. In fact, in most years the TAC established by the International Baltic Sea Fisheries Commission (IBSFC) and cod catches (observed exploitation) exceeded the ICES-recommended TAC and thus their scientific advice was neither taken into account by the IBSFC nor by fishermen.
   This paper evaluates: (1) the would-be state of the Eastern Baltic cod stock if it had been exploited according to ICES-recommended TAC levels, as compared with observed stock exploitation; and (2) the potential effects of management using fishing mortality rates which correspond to BRP on SSB estimates and catch levels, as compared with observed stock exploitation.
   It is concluded that if ICES advice had been followed, the cumulative cod catches in the 1976-1997 period would have been the same as those observed, but the stock biomass would have been much higher and at a safe level (SSB above 240000 t).
   Furthermore, from the comparative analysis of different management strategies based on BRP and the observed strategy, it appears that other management strategies could have been applied which would have produced a higher biomass and greater cumulative catch numbers than those observed.

TI Poverty reduction and microfinance - Assessing performance
SO IDS BULLETIN-INSTITUTE OF DEVELOPMENT STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
AB Poverty reduction has always been a main goal of microfinance. This goal is under serious challenge as pressures to demonstrate financial sustainability and to commercialise operations threaten to overwhelm the social mission of microfinance organisations (MFOs). MFOs need to perform on both fronts. There are good ways to measure and monitor financial performance but there are no poverty reduction performance standards to assess how well they are doing on poverty reduction. Increasingly, there is mobilisation within the microfinance industry to correct this omission, which is undermining the development value of the industry. This article reviews these issues and makes some preliminary proposals on the development of poverty performance standards.

AB This article is based on the experience and evolution of a large MFO, BRAC (Bangladesh Rural Advancement Committee), which is working in Bangladesh. The article stresses that poverty is not homogeneous, but is manifested in different ways and in different contexts. It considers BRACs response to this broader understanding of poverty in Bangladesh, referring particularly to the ways in which specific programmes were tailored and adapted to embrace new information about client needs and behaviour. The study goes on to discuss impact assessment studies conducted on BRACs initial programme - Rural Development Programme - that provided significant data to substantiate BRACs positive effect on poverty alleviation, as well as providing information that led to subsequent programmatic shifts in emphasis.

TI Strategies for poverty alleviation in India: CYSD's holistic approach to
   empowerment through the self-help group model
SO IDS BULLETIN-INSTITUTE OF DEVELOPMENT STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
AB This article discusses the Self-Help Group (SHG) model on which CYSD (Centre for Youth and Social Development), in India, bases its poverty outreach programme. It argues that, in order to effectively reach and have a positive impact on the poorest groups, programmes need to take into account their specific needs and circumstances. The article discusses CYSD's context-based approach, which addresses the complex, multidimensional aspects of poverty that characterise the people with whom they work. It emphasises that disempowerment is a central element of poverty, showing how the SHGs act as empowering, confidence-building mechanisms where poor women in particular are given a voice, and where the group wields greater social and political power than individuals. A key point in the article is that, in order to have a sustainable and effective impact on the poor in the specific circumstances outlined, the provision of credit alone may not be sufficient; rather, financial services should be an integral part of an holistic programme that addresses broader social needs, such as education, health care and empowerment.

AB The dramatic linear increase in ergodic capacity with the number of antennas promised by multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wireless communication systems is based on idealized channel models representing a,rich scattering environment. Is such scaling sustainable in realistic scattering scenarios? Existing physical models, although realistic, are intractable for addressing this problem Analytically due to their complicated nonlinear dependence on propagation path parameters, such as the angles of arrival and delays. In this paper, we leverage a recently introduced virtual representation of physical models that is essentially a Fourier series representation of wide-band MIMO channels in terms of fixed virtual angles and delays. Motivated by physical considerations, we propose a D-connected model for correlated channels defined by a virtual spatial channel matrix consisting of D nonvanishing diagonals with independent and identically distributed (i.i.d) Gaussian entries. The parameter D provides a meaningful and tractable measure of the richness of scattering. We derive general bounds for the coherent ergodic capacity and investigate capacity scaling with the number of antennas and bandwidth. In the large antenna regime, we show that linear capacity scaling is possible if D scales linearly with the number of antennas. This, in turn, is possible if the number of resolvable paths grows quadratically with the number of antennas. The capacity saturates for linear growth in the number of paths (fixed D). The ergodic capacity does not depend on frequency selectivity of the channel in the wide-band case. Increasing bandwidth tightens the bounds and hastens the convergence of scaling behavior. For large bandwidth, the capacity scales linearly with the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) as well. We also provide an explicit characterization of the wide-band slope recently proposed by Verdu. Numerical results are presented to illustrate the key theoretical results.

AB This paper presents transient deformation of an elastic half-space under two types of line-concentrated impulsive loads applied simultaneously. One load is a sustainable normal force, while the other is a momentarily applied vector shear force. For each of the two loads the author gave the respective solution in two separate papers. Here the two solutions are superimposed to determine the response of the half-space under the combined loads. The present work is devoted to the salient wave propagation features seen in the resultant computer plots that disclose the strained half-space. Since each critical deformation is explicitly indicated in the plots by a wave front, the interpretation of the response of the half-space to the applied load is readily available at a glance. A comparison is then presented that identifies those deformation traits and wave fronts, among the nineteen here, that are more closely related to those found in previous works.

TI District health systems in a neoliberal world: a review of five key
   policy areas

AB District health systems, comprising primary health care and first referral hospitals, are key to the delivery of basic health services in developing countries. They should be prioritized in resource allocation and in the building of management and service capacity.
   The relegation in the World Health Report 2000 of primary health care to a 'second generation' reform-to be superseded by third generation reforms with a market orientation-flows from an analysis that is historically flawed and ideologically biased. Primary health care has struggled against economic crisis and adjustment and a neoliberal ideology often averse to its principles. To ascribe failures of primary health care to a weakness in policy design, when the political economy has starved it of resources, is to blame the victim.
   Improvement in the working and living conditions of health workers is a precondition for the effective delivery of public health services. A multidimensional programme of health worker rehabilitation should be developed as the foundation for health service recovery.
   District health systems can and should be financed (at least mainly) from public funds. Although in certain situations user fees have improved the quality and increased the utilization of primary care services, direct charges deter health care use by the poor and can result in further impoverishment. Direct user fees should be replaced progressively by increased public finance and, where possible, by prepayment schemes based on principles of social health insurance with public subsidization.
   Priority setting should be driven mainly by the objective to achieve equity in health and wellbeing outcomes. Cost effectiveness should enter into the selection of treatments for people (productive efficiency), but not into the selection of people for treatment (allocative efficiency).
   Decentralization is likely to be advantageous in most health systems, although the exact form(s) should be selected with care and implementation should be phased in after adequate preparation. The public health service should usually play the lead provider role in district health systems, but non-govemment providers can be contracted if needed. There is little or no evidence to support proactive privatization, marketization or provider competition. Democratization of political and popular involvement in health enhances the benefits of decentralization and community participation.
   Integrated district health systems are the means by which specific health programmes can best be delivered in the context of overall health care needs. International assistance should address communicable disease control priorities in ways that strengthen local health systems and do not undermine them.
   The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria should not repeat the mistakes of the mass compaigns of past decades. In particular, it should not set programme targets that are driven by an international agenda and which are achievable only at the cost of an adverse impact on sustainable health systems. Above all the targets must not retard the development of the district health systems so badly needed by the rural poor. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF OCCUPATIONAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH
LA English
DT Article
AB This article highlights current economic conditions in China and analyzes existing obstacles to improving workplace conditions and labor practices. There are significant disincentives to strengthening workplace protections, and downward pressures are currently worsening conditions in a number of economic sectors. However, there are also potential strategies for motivating multinational corporations (MNCs) and Chinese government agencies to improve workplace conditions and to implement international and national laws and corporate codes of conduct. Four key principles are discussed that hold promise for creating incentives and sustainable mechanisms to improve factory conditions: transparency, verification, and accountability for MNGs and Chinese government agencies, and greatly strengthening worker participation. Key words: China; worker representation; workplace protections; regulation; multinationals; health and safety.

AB The heritability of resistance has an important bearing on the management of pest resistance, especially for evaluating the sustainability of a chemical on a particular pest population. The susceptibility of pests to insecticides may change depending on the selection pressure of these compounds on populations. Tetranychus cinnabarinus, a very important mite pest of many crops in China, was continuously selected with methrin, abamectin, pyridaben and mixtures of pyridaben and abamectin (pyidaben: abamectin=7.4:0.1 m/m), and methrin and abamectin (methrin: abamectin=8.9:0.1 m/m). After 16 generations, the resistance increased to 25.8-, 3.7-, 1.3-, 4.0- and 2.5-fold to methrin, abamectin, pyridaben, pyridaben+abamectin and methrin+abamectin, respectively. The more generations selected, the higher was the resistance level, except in the case of the strain selected with pyridaben. The realized heritabilities of resistance to methrin, abamectin, pyridabe, pyridaben+abamectin and methrin+abamectin were: 0.20, 0.15, 0.03, 0.18 and 0.08, respectively. Higher values of heritability occurred during the second eight generations selected than through the first eight generations except in the case of the strain selected with the mixture pyridaben+abamectin.

AB The introduction of Eulemur fulvus in 1975 into the Berenty Reserve and their recent attainment of population densities comparable to those of Lemur catta led us to analyze food partitioning among the 3 large prosimian species in the gallery forest. We assessed the diets of ring-tailed lemurs ( Lemur catta), brown lemurs ( Eulemur fulvus) and sifakas (Propithecus verreauxi) from food intake measurements during 3 successive short-term studies. All species exhibited marked seasonal changes in their major food categories. Dietary overlap was very high between ring-tailed lemurs and brown lemurs during 2 of 3 seasons, including the middle of the dry season. During the latter period, Eulemur appeared to compensate for a low quality diet by increasing the amount of food eaten. In contrast, Lemur fed on lower amounts of food and seemed more efficient at coping with fibrous plant materials. There is low dietary overlap of Lemur catta and Eulemur fulvus versus Propithecus, which exhibit by far the highest dietary diversity of the 3 species. We discuss sustainable coexistence among them, based on respective dietary adaptations and potential for dietary flexibility.

AB The potential to derive indicators of sustainable resource use from satellite remote sensing is discussed. Particular attention focuses on indicators related to land cover condition and type in tropical forest environments. This includes the mapping of forest cover, estimation of biomass and biodiversity as well as the impacts of extreme events such as drought on the forest. Each of these issues is discussed with emphasis placed on the potential to increase the level of information extraction beyond that derived with conventional approaches in order to more usefully inform sustainable development practices.

AB The advent of a new generation of space-borne ocean colour sensors brings the prospect of global ocean measurements for decades into the future. These measurements will provide the basis for characterizing variability in the structure of the ocean's phytoplanktonic communities and the response of those communities to climatic change. In addition, the measurements will allow development of the scientific basis necessary to manage the sustainable resources of marine ecosystems. These studies will require a merged, long-term, multi-satellite ocean colour time series extending beyond the operational lifetimes of individual instruments. The Sensor Intercomparison and Merger for Biological and Interdisciplinary Oceanic Studies (SIMBIOS) Project has been tasked to develop the tools required to create this time series. Among these tools are a comprehensive in situ (field collected) bio-optical dataset for validating ocean optics algorithms and associated models of oceanic properties; a programme to evaluate different atmospheric correction techniques; a programme to link the calibrations of individual satellite instruments; a programme to develop consistent calibration and validation datasets for satellite instruments; and a set of alternate methods to combine ocean colour measurements from different sources into a single time series. We report on the progress of this development work by the SIMBIOS Project.

TI Breeding competitive and sustainable sugar beet hybrids. Some elements
   of the VanderHave approach
SO INTERNATIONAL SUGAR JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
AB In many countries crop diseases are an increasing problem for modern agriculture. Crop rotations are becoming more and more intensive and soil born diseases are difficult to treat with chemicals. As a result of this, breeding for disease resistant varieties is an integral part of a sugar beet breeding program for all sugar beet plant breeding companies. The success of a disease resistance breeding program depends very much on the availability of reliable screening methods on different levels. The three situations are: Field tests, or Bioassays and Marker assisted selection in the breeders laboratory. The big challenge for modern sugar beet seed companies like VanderHave Sugar Beet Seed lies in developing varieties, which meet the demands of both of the sugar industry and sugar beet grower within a sustainable environment.

AB 1. Increased demand for food and energy is leading to changes in the global nitrogen cycle. These changes are resulting in increasing levels of nitrogen in the environment in its pollutant forms with consequences for both biodiversity and human health. In this paper, we discuss the impacts in the UK and give examples of the steps that are being taken by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) to tackle these problems.
   2. Over 70% of the UK land area is farmland. The farmed environment is composed of a wide range of semi-natural habitats including heather moorland, chalk downland, wet grasslands farm woodlands and hedgerows. As a result, much of the UK's cherished biodiversity is an integral part of agriculture and therefore vulnerable to changes in farming practices.
   3. Defra's overall goal is to build a sustainable future for the UK. With regard to nitrogen pollution, this involves finding ways of continuing to meet our food and energy requirements whilst causing little or no harm to the environment.
   4. Defra's science programme has a central role to play in the development of its nitrogen pollution policies. These pollution policies provide a key input to the Department's evidence base for policy formulation, and support international negotiations on pollution targets.
   5. The Department's science programme has addressed the major components of the nitrogen cycle associated with harmful impacts on the environment and human health. The main aims have been the understanding and quantification of impacts through monitoring and modelling and the development of abatement measures.
   6. Synthesis and application. It is becoming increasingly apparent that whilst advances can and have been made in the reduction of emissions from combustion processes, the problem of nitrogen pollution from agriculture is far more intractable. This scientific challenge, when taken together with emerging regulatory initiatives, will require imaginative solutions if the UK Government is to forge a sustainable way forward.

   the importance of density-dependence and timing of harvest for a

AB 1. Structured population models are used in a range of forms to predict the long-term behaviour of populations of economic or conservation interest. Such models rarely include density-dependence and do not account explicitly for the ordering of events within a generation.
   2. We analysed a model for the harvesting of adults of the edible palm Euterpe edulis in which the role of density-dependence had been clearly defined. We modified the timing of harvesting in relation to the point in the life cycle at which populations were censused.
   3. It is shown that the timing, form and intensity of harvesting are all important in determining asymptotic population behaviour. If harvesting affects only those individuals that were recorded as being adults at the start of a year, then the model predicts that all adults may be harvested without population eradication. In contrast, if harvesting also affects individuals moving from the next smaller size class during the course of a year then populations can, under some forms of harvesting, tolerate much lower levels of harvesting.
   4. If density-dependence is not taken into consideration, predictions of population responses to harvesting may be erroneous. A review of transition matrices for woody plants indicates that many of these may have been derived from populations subject to strong population regulation.
   5. Synthesis and applications. In the specific case of E. edulis our model shows that, although populations appear to be robust to very high levels of harvesting, when modelled as affecting only reproductive adults, this conclusion may be sensitive to varying the timing and form of harvest, and to the assumption that only reproductive individuals are removed. Structure population models used to determine levels of harvesting should account for the existence of density-dependence as well as its timing.

AB 1. The hunting of wild animals for consumption by people currently threatens many species with extinction. In the tropics, where the threat is most acute, hunting frequently targets many prey species simultaneously, yet our understanding of the dynamics of hunting in such multi-prey systems is limited. This study addressed this issue by modelling the effects of human hunters on prey population dynamics in a multi-species prey community. Both pursuit hunting (in which offtake depends partly on hunters' prey preferences) and trap hunting (in which the offtake is determined solely by random processes) were considered as submodels.
   2. The pursuit hunting submodel was validated against studies of subsistence hunting in tropical forests, while the trap hunting submodel was validated against data from five studies of offtake rates by snare hunters in subSaharan Africa. In all cases, observed prey removal rates were predicted well by the model.
   3. Simulations demonstrated the emergence of distinctive prey profiles at different intensities of hunting, related to sequences of overexploitation dependent on species' vulnerabilities to exploitation.
   4. Synthesis and applications. A model is developed to explore the impacts of harvesting on multi-species prey communities. Model predictions can be used to aid the interpretation of incomplete monitoring data, such as snapshots of the species taken by hunters. This will improve our ability to assess the sustainability of multi-species hunting systems using the limited information typically available in these cases.

AB 1. Dispersal parameters are critical for modelling spatially dynamic populations yet remain among the most difficult to quantify. Linyphiid spider aerial dispersal by 'ballooning' on silk threads is dependent on meteorological factors and amenable to analysis and quantification.
   2. Spider aerial activity was measured during consecutive 10-min periods for up to 11 h a day. Aerial density was measured at four heights using sticky traps. The time intervals between successive flights were measured by observing spiders landing and taking-off.
   3. Meteorological measurements (wind speeds and temperatures) were taken simultaneously with the collection of airborne spiders, and used to calculate Richardson numbers to estimate atmospheric turbulence.
   4. Numbers of airborne spiders on any given day, and their vertical density profile on different days, were significantly correlated with Richardson numbers.
   5. Single flight distances were modelled using estimates of ascent and descent rates, the vertical density profile of airborne spiders and the wind speeds they experience aloft. The distributions of single flight distances and the time spent between successive flights were combined in an alternating renewal process to model the number of flights and the total daily dispersal distances of ballooning spiders as a function of available dispersal time.
   6. On a day with, for example, 6 h of suitable weather, linyphiid spiders can potentially disperse a mean distance of approximately 30 km downwind.
   7. Synthesis and applications. We have developed a dispersal model of linyphiid spiders that is central to the further development of spatially dynamic population models of these spiders in agricultural landscapes. It could also be adapted for application to other wind-borne organisms. Such models have a key role in the future management of sustainable agricultural systems where natural predators are seen as major components of pest control.

DE Negev desert; desert trees; shade and microclimate amelioration;
   sustainable planting
AB The use of indigenous trees in the Negev landscape avoids the introduction of foreign species which have had, and may have, detrimental effects on the local ecology, which may alter landscape character and diminish landscape quality in areas that are sensitive to change. One of the key uses of trees in the landscape is to create shade and by creating shade, the indigenous trees of the Negev Desert can be seen to significantly modify microclimate below and within the vicinity of the tree canopy. This shade benefits local plant and animal communities as well as people who find respite from the heat of the sun. The amelioration of short wave solar radiation and long wave radiation from the ground by the native trees is highly significant and this reduction in energy indicates the potential for the use of these native trees in development projects.

   Methods The investigated forests were of the low and the high varzea type, on an annual average flooded around 4 and 1 months, respectively. The two low-varzea forests belonged to the secondary and to the late-successional stage, the high-varzea forest also to the late-successional stage. A total of 24 circular sample plots covering 1885 m 2 were installed. They were nested within three rectangular 1 ha permanent sample plots where individuals greater than or equal to 10 cm d. b. h. were formerly inventoried. Average inundation and radiation [ relative photosynthetically active radiation (rPAR)] at the forest floor was recorded in all inventoried plots. The Mean spatial Distribution Center (MDC; Ebdon, 1998) for all sapling species was calculated. Sapling species were grouped into associations with respect to their light-demand and their location along the flood-level gradient.
   Results Average flood height and average rPAR at the forest floor was highest in the secondary stage of the low varzea and lowest in the high-varzea forest. Overall average density and basal area of the saplings averaged 2250 individuals and 2.3 m(2) ha(-1) in the secondary stage, 2330 individuals and 2.6 m(2) ha(-1) in the late-successional stage of the low varzea and 5000 individuals and 4.8 m(2) ha(-1) in the high varzea. In all forest types, species richness of saplings was lower than species richness of trees greater than or equal to 10 cm d. b. h., and amounted to 25 species in the secondary stage, to 35 species in the late-successional stage of the low varzea and to 88 species in the high-varzea forest. The amount of 'immigrants' (Bazzaz, 1991) at the sapling level increased with proceeding forest succession and amounted to 24 and 29% in the low varzea and to 31% in the high varzea. Sapling species distribution, species richness and individual density was linked to both, the gradient of flooding and the gradient of irradiation. Species richness and individual density was highest in the high varzea and decreased with increasing influence of flooding. The high varzea was predominated by pronounced shade-tolerant sapling species, whereas in the low varzea occured both, light demanding and shade-tolerant species groups.
   Main conclusions Influence of flooding seems to be the main factor triggering species composition and structure of sapling communities in varzea forests. Proceeding forest succession reduces the impact of flooding because of the biogenical induced silting up of the forested sites. However, forest succession also alters forest architecture of the overstory and such the light conditions at the sapling level. Therefore, radiation is an important factor influencing species composition of sapling communities in varzea forests.

AB The chemical industry developed over the past century using petroleum as its primary feedstock. A variety of economic, political and social forces are now leading the chemical industry to use or consider renewable plant-based feedstocks in addition to or instead of petroleum. The next century may see a gradual transition away from petroleum as the primary feedstock for chemicals, materials and liquid fuels. If this transition is to occur, and if the chemical industry is to become more sustainable, a considerable amount of research must be done. This paper summarizes the research and development priorities for a more sustainable, or 'green', chemical industry based on renewable plant resources and relies heavily on a recent report of the National Research Council (NRC) of the United States.

AB This paper focuses on methodological development in research to study climate change impacts and regional sustainability. It starts with an introduction of a conceptual structure for identifying important attributes of regional sustainability and salient properties of climate change to guide research on regional impact assessment and adaptation options. This is followed by a brief review of some methods and approaches which have been used for climate impact assessment and policy evaluation. The paper then presents a research approach for climate change impact assessment and regional sustainability evaluation. In particular, an integrated approach is presented in some detail.

AB The Nigerian forests have been subjected to unguarded exploitation over the years. Although there is overwhelming empirical evidence, which show that Nigeria's forest, may soon vanish, available statistics have shown its increasing importance in the energy sector. With increasing population come the attendant demands on the biotic environment through increased land clearing, deforestation, devegetation, desertification. with attendant soil erosion, flooding, sand dune formation, and changes in the micro-climate with consequent loss of biological productivity and associated socio-economic and socio-political problems in the country. There is therefore the need to adopt measures that will shift the attention of the Nigerian populace from the forest to satisfy their energy needs. However, such measures that will address the challenges confronting the forestry, forest-based energy systems and the environment should be consistent with the development needs, resources and priorities of the nation. Hence, for sustainable forest-energy-environment interactions, a holistic and integrated strategy that can be adopted to minimise the observed forest depletion must take cognisance of options from various land use practices, energy and forest sectors. The focus of this paper is on a strategy of options from both the energy and forest sectors. Based on the socioeconomic, socio-political and environmental analyses of various options from the energy and forest sectors, the philosophy behind the mosaic approach to sustainable development has been considered in developing the proposed strategy. Policy measures to implement this strategy of options in the national development programs are also suggested. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The Pinchot Institute for Conservation conducted a study to gauge the potential for refining,certification assessment methodologies through research in school forests involving faculty, staff, and students. The study was based on a series of interviews with certification experts and a survey completed by 38 schools with research and teaching forests. It evaluated the potential for better use of untapped capacity at research universities by addressing needed improvements in certification programs, current level of participation by school forests, and capacity for and interest in certification. Facilitating the dialogue and coordination between the certification programs and the students, faculty, and staff who conduct research in school forests can refine the assessment methodologies used for certification.

ID EVAPORATING LIQUIDS; PLATES
AB An investigation has been conducted into the interactions of binary fluid mixtures (pentane [C5H12] coolant and decane [C10H22] additive) and thermocapillary effects on a heated, evaporating meniscus formed in a vertical capillary pore system. The experimental results show that adding decane, the secondary fluid that creates the concentration gradient, actually decreases the meniscus height to a certain level, but did increase the sustainable temperature gradient for the liquid-vapor interface, so did the heat transfer rate, delaying the onset of meniscus instability. The results have demonstrated that interfacial thermocapillary stresses arising from liquid-vapor interfacial temperature gradients, which is known to degrade the ability of the liquid to wet the pore, can be counteracted by introducing naturally occurring concentration gradients associated with distillation in binary fluid mixtures. Also theoretical predictions are presented to determine the magnitudes of both the thermocapillary stresses and the distillation-driven capillary stresses, and to estimate the concentration gradients established as a result of the distillation in the heated pore.

ID MORTALITY; CARE
AB School-based health centers have been proposed as an avenue to provide health care for vulnerable youth. Colorado has 45 school-based health centers that provided 50,000 visits to 18,600 vulnerable youth in the 1998-1999 school year. Sustainability of the centers, however, depends on the ability to obtain an ongoing stream of revenue including managed care contracts, which in turn depend on the center's ability to meet the standard of care in the community. School-based health centers should meet standards of care similar to those of community health centers including certification, credentialing of providers, and a systematic evaluation of the outcomes of services. This article reports on a statewide quality improvement program that established certification standards for school-based health centers, verified the credentials of providers at the centers, and measured quality of care in centers across the state.

TI Anatomy of a Bushmeat commodity chain in Takoradi, Ghana
SO JOURNAL OF PEASANT STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
AB Bushmeat, the meat of wild animals, is a highly valuable non-timber forest product in West and Central Africa. The trade in this commodity is currently of great interest to development and conservation agencies, due to concern over the sustainability of its use and the implications of its loss for poor rural households. In this study, we describe the bushmeat commodity chain that supplies the city of Sekondi-Takoradi in Ghana. There are five primary actors in the trade: commercial hunters and farmer hunters, all of whom are men based in local rural areas; and wholesalers, market traders and chopbar owners, all of whom are women based in the city. Bushmeat is freely traded between all actors and actor groups, but the main trade route is from commercial hunters to wholesalers to chopbars. Wholesalers are the smallest actor group but handle the largest per capita market share, whilst chopbars are the most numerous group and together account for 85 per cent of retail sales. The costs of participating in the trade appear to be lowest for hunters and highest for chopbar owners. Kin support networks play an important role in minimizing these costs, especially with respect to entry costs (nearly hat( of all bushmeat traders inherit their business) and labour costs (many employees are family members); kin also assist in other ways, especially through sharing knowledge and supplying credit. Amongst the urban actors, the bushmeat trade as a whole is perceived as a low-status occupation, although individual reputation remains important. In Takoradi, the bushmeat trade is largely unregulated by either state or local institutions, and there is no evidence of any individual actors or actor groups exerting control over the market. Hunters make significant profits, indicating that the bushmeat trade has the potential to make a substantial economic contribution to rural households. In contrast, urban actors appear to make relatively small profits. Comparison with the existing literature suggests that the structure and operation of the bushmeat trade in Takoradi is typical of the trade in many other parts of West Africa.

SO JOURNAL OF PROFESSIONAL ISSUES IN ENGINEERING EDUCATION AND PRACTICE
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper presents an approach for implementing sustainability within a university environment, and for helping students become more effective problem solvers and professionals. In a "Sustainable Urban Development" course, taught by the writer, students develop projects to make their campus and community more sustainable. In the process, students learn how to analyze sustainability, work with decision makers, and put classroom knowledge into practice. Further, through this course's emphasis on problem-based learning, students acquire critical cognitive skills and professional skills as they tackle complex, interdisciplinary, and real-world problems. Systematic evaluations of the course offer useful lessons. One is how to create synergies. For instance, while students benefited from hands-on experience with sustainability, the university benefited from students' work. Another is how to demonstrate and quantify benefits from sustainability, which is vital to gaining support. Yet another is how to enable students to learn from both successful and unsuccessful attempts to implement ideas. Courses such as this can create important bridges between theory and application, and between education and professional practice.

AB This study has two purposes: (a) methodological-to design and test a new instrument able to reflect changes in attitudes toward science over time, and (b) investigative-to find out the effect of two similar curricular treatments on the attitudes of two classes. Items about the relevance of science to students' lives were developed, pilot-tested, and analyzed using Rasch modeling. We then divided reliable items into three equivalent questionnaire forms. The final three forms of the questionnaire were used to assess high school students' attitudes. Over 18 weeks, one class used a core curriculum (Science and Sustainability) to learn science in the context of making decisions about societal issues. A second class used the same core curriculum, but with parts replaced by computer-based activities (Convince Me) designed to enhance the coherence of students' arguments. Using traditional and Rasch modeling techniques, we assessed the degrees to which such instructional activities promoted students' beliefs that science is relevant to them. Both classes tended to agree more, over time, that science is relevant to their lives, and the increases were statistically equivalent between classes. This study suggests that, by using innovative, issue-based activities, it is possible to enhance students' attitudes about the relevance of science. (C) 2003 Wiley Periodicals.

AB Contemporary wisdom holds that the scholarly community is in transition from a paper-based knowledge system to an electronically based system. 'Twilight' argues that this transition is not sustainable and that constraints on energy resources and other necessary resources will arrest digitization in the not-distant future. Thus, archives in physical formats, not digitized archives, are essential to preserve the scholarly record.

AB Modified Crops (GMCs) have generated considerable interest as a potential solution to the ever-growing problems of food and sustainable development. While recognizing its importance the area under GMCs worldwide has increased more than thirty-five times in just 5 y, from 1.7 in ha in 1996 to 58.7 in ha in 2002. Worldwide, nearly 90 varieties of crops have been approved for commercial cultivation including cotton, rice, tobacco, soybean, corn, tomato, and rape. The present paper examines the status of Chinese efforts in this direction with particular attention to Bt cotton.

AB In order to establish a sustainable society, with practical material recycling, it is appropriate to focus on a range of guiding "Earth principles," including the character and application of hydrothermal processes. In this paper, it is demonstrated how information obtained from the study of fundamental Earth principles can be used to inspire the development of new methods for material recycling, such as the following: 1) Hydrothermal hot-pressing processes, simulating the formation of sedimentary rock sequences, can be used for the solidification of toxic and hazardous materials. 2) Organic materials could be formed from CO2 under hydrothermal conditions (using Fe and Ni metals, and low valence Fe oxides), at temperature and pressure conditions consistent with a subduction (tectonic) setting, such as (under Japan) where the Pacific Plate sinks beneath the (Eurasian) continental plate. 3) Diamond-structured carbon may be formed from toxic chlorinated hydrocarbon, in very high pressure regions of the Earth, and at high alkaline hydrothermal conditions, where magma formation may occur. 4) High temperature dry steam in rock fractures (at near critical conditions -i.e. below saturated vapor pressure, but relatively high pressure) is not only a source/carrier of noble metals, including gold, silver and copper, but also ceramic materials, silica and alumina. Its laboratory simulation may also be a guide for the formation of thin layer silicate ceramics on metal plates (e.g. SUS-304 nickel alloy). 5) To design an underground boiler in hot dry rock, non-equilibrium dissolution and deposition hydrothermal processes may be studied using a tube reactor, which simulates fluid flow and temperature gradients in fractured hot rock.

AB Purpose: This preliminary report describes the development and implementation of a project to improve access to literature in Latin American social medicine (LASM).
   Methods: The University of New Mexico project team collaborated with participants from Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and Ecuador to identify approximately 400 articles and books in Latin American social medicine. Structured abstracts were prepared, translated into English, Spanish, and Portuguese, assigned Medical Subject Headings (MeSH), and loaded into a Web-based database for public searching. The project has initiated Web-based publication for two LASM journals. Evaluation included measures of use and content.
   Results: The LASM Website (http://hsc.unm.edu/lasm) and database create access to formerly little-known literature that addresses problems relevant to current medicine and public health. This Website offers a unique resource for researchers, practitioners, and teachers who seek to understand the links between socioeconomic conditions and health. The project provides a model for collaboration between librarians and health care providers. Challenges included procurement of primary material; preparation of concise abstracts; working with trilingual translations of abstracts, metadata, and indexing; and the work processes of the multidisciplinary team.
   Conclusions: The literature of Latin American social medicine has become more readily available to researchers worldwide. The LASM project serves as a collaborative model for the creation of sustainable solutions for disseminating information that is difficult to access through traditional methods.

ID SOILS; INDIA
AB One of the main objectives of "restoration forestry" is to suggest management options for improving degraded soil fertility through biological processes of trees. This aspect was formulated on the premise that the sustainable productivity of a natural ecosystem is derived to a great extent from the biogeochemical processes of litter and soil. These processes include biomass and nutrient accumulation by carbon assimilation, nutrient recycling by litter fall, root turnover and their subsequent decomposition and decay, resulting in humus synthesis. The soil fertility build-up and its sustainability is dependent not only on the maintenance of these activities at certain critical levels but even more importantly on their functioning as an integrated system with regulatory mechanisms operating in a synchronised manner. Essentially it means making acyclic processes more cyclic, thereby leading to improvement of structure and function of an ecosystem. However, little is known about the mechanism of these effects especially with respect to restoration of degraded sites by tree planting. The discussion in this paper is focused on these aspects of restoration forestry and their importance in field management of plantations based on biogeochemical cycles. It is envisaged that a judicious decision on management of a restored area would depend on such rotations that maintain and sustain the cyclic nature of ecosystems without jeopardising the production of such areas.

AB The Ontario Environmental Farm Plan Programme (EFP) represents a significant departure from previous agri-environmental initiatives in Canada. In this programme, the focus is not on the promotion and adoption of any particular farming innovation, but rather on the completion of a farm-level environmental appraisal and the development of a farm-specific environmental action plan. As with more traditional schemes, there is interest in understanding how the programme is performing and in documenting outcomes. Evidence suggests that a significant proportion of farmers who enter the programme complete only part of the process or apply the evaluation to only certain aspects of their operation. In effect, there is variation in the way participants participate. This paper examines the nature of, and reasons for, differing levels of engagement among participants in the EFP Programme. Results from a survey of past participants suggests that farm-specific environmental conditions, farmers' motivations concerning the environment, and positive perceptions of the programme itself are associated with more complete levels of participation. Underlying some of the revealed variations in participation are abiding concerns for the confidentiality of the process and more general concerns relating to the intervention of the state in agricultural land use.

AB Reproduction and health traits are of significant economic importance for dairy production. Most of these traits are expressed in a categorical way and show heritabilities of 5% or less. Nevertheless, their additive genetic variation is considerable. For example, the incidence of clinical mastitis in the first lactation varies among daughter groups of Swedish Holstein bulls between 10 and 26%, stillbirth rate at first parity between 3 and 16%, and the number of inseminations per serviced cow between 1.6 and 1.9. Unfavourable genetic correlations of the order of 0.2-0.4 between production on one side, and mastitis and female fertility on the other, have generally been found. Well integrated recording schemes in the Scandinavian countries enabled early the adoption of total merit indexes (TMI), including reproduction and health traits, into their selection schemes. In practice, TMI selection has proven to be effective in maintaining functional efficiency of the cows simultaneously with a sharp increase in production. As bull selection nowadays takes place globally, sustainable breeding programmes require more extensive recording and genetic evaluations of reproduction and health traits internationally, a development that presently grows quickly. The Scandinavian experiences are reviewed in this paper in the light of this international development. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This report describes a Department of Defense humanitarian assistance project to develop and build a regional computer-assisted laboratory-based electronic disease surveillance system in the Caribbean basin. From 1997 through 2000, the project donated 146 computer systems and trained more than 250 personnel from 14 ministries of health to operate this system. This humanitarian mission provided the region with a sustainable and locally maintained and operated surveillance system having a broad and long-term impact on public health. It has improved data gathering, analysis, and reporting at the local, national, and regional level. Benefits to the region include the dissemination through the Internet of increasingly timely and accurate information on the incidence and prevalence of endemic, epidemic, and newly emerging diseases. This serves the Caribbean residents, travelers, and U.S. national interests. The project is a model for cooperative Department of Defense capacity building and training programs in support of partner countries and international public health agencies.

AB In this paper, we established the exploitation of impulsive harvesting single autonomous population model by Logistic equation. By some special methods, we analysis the impulsive harvesting population equation and obtain existence, the explicit expression and global attractiveness of impulsive periodic solutions for constant yield harvest and proportional harvest. Then, we choose the maximum sustainable yield as management objective, and investigate the optimal impulsive harvesting policies respectively. The optimal harvest effort that maximizes the sustainable yield per unit time, the corresponding optimal population levels are determined. At last, we point out that the continuous harvesting policy is superior to the impulsive harvesting policy, however, the latter is more beneficial in realistic operation.

ID FARMING SYSTEMS NUTMON; ECONOMIC-PERFORMANCE; BALANCES; FLOWS
AB Agricultural management has its roots in the manipulation of the system to optimise conditions for crop production. It is now widely recognised that this could result in land degradation with subsequent serious impact on crop productivity if the nutrient losses to the agricultural system are not replaced. A nutrient budget is an account of gains and losses of nutrients in an agricultural system, a tool that could be used to develop sound nutrient management and sustainable agriculture. This tool was applied to the annual crop farming system in the highlands of southwestern Uganda to demonstrate (i) within farm nutrient depletion and accumulating zones, and (ii) the extent of nutrient losses at farm and district levels through marketing pathways. Partial nutrient budgets were constructed at field and farm levels using farmer-recorded resource inputs and outputs over a period of one year, and at the district level using annual inventory data of agricultural imports and exports. The computed nutrient balances were highly variable at field and farm levels, but predominantly negative. Nitrogen (N) gains and losses averaged 30.6 and 72.3 kg ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively in the homestead fields; 10.8 and 33.4 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) in the outfields; 15.8 and 17.4 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) at the farm level; and only losses of 5.6 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) at the district level. Potassium (K) gains and losses followed a similar trend, although less in magnitude. The phosphorus (P) balance was positive but only in the homestead fields and at the farm level. Where agricultural produce were marketed, nutrient losses were reflected more at the higher scales (e.g. district level) and became tied up in pools from which recycling back to agriculture was barely feasible, and with quite alarming monetary implications. Such results can be used to influence policies at different scales on nutrient management.

AB We present the first population estimate for the Natuna leaf monkey Presbytis natunae, endemic to the island of Bunguran, Indonesia, based on a 2-month survey. Bunguran has a land area of only 1,605 km(2) and was until 1980 largely covered in primary forest. At present primary forest exists only in small patches within a matrix of logged forest, which covers nearly 70% of the island. Natuna leaf monkeys are confined to forest and have a preference for primary lowland forest patches. Groups average 3.5+/-SD 2.0 individuals and occur in a density of 2.3+/-SD 1.1 groups per km(2). Extrapolation of the density estimates to the entire island indicates that <10,000 individuals remain in two subpopulations. On Bunguran these monkeys make popular pets and the species is threatened in part by the demand for captive individuals but mostly by continuing degradation and reduction of forest. An assessment of the species following IUCN threat criteria indicates that it should be categorized as Vulnerable. We make a number of recommendations for the conservation of the species, most importantly the implementation by the district government of Natuna of two strict conservation areas on the island, and the maintaining of a larger area of sustainably used natural forest.

AB Introduction: The past decade has seen a notable shift in the practice of pharmacy, with a strong focus on the provision of cognitive pharmaceutical services (CPS) by community pharmacists. The benefits of these services have been well documented, yet their uptake appears to be slow. Various strategies have been developed to overcome barriers to the implementation of CPS, with varying degrees of success, and little is known about the sustainability of the practice changes they produce. Furthermore, the strategies developed are often specific to individual programs or services, and their applicability to other CPS has not been explored. There seems to be a need for a flexible change management model for the implementation and dissemination of a range of CPS, but before it can be developed, a better understanding of the change process is required.
   Objectives: This paper describes the development of a qualitative research instrument that may be utilised to investigate practice change in community pharmacy. Specific objectives included gaining knowledge about the circumstances surrounding attempts to implement CPS, and understanding relationships that are important to the change process.
   Methods: Organisational theory provided the conceptual framework for development of the qualitative research instrument, within which two theories were used to give insight into the change process: Borum's theory of organisational change, which categorises change strategies as rational, natural, political or open; and Social Network Theory, which helps identify and explain the relationships between key people involved in the change process.
   Results: A semi-structured interview guide was produced, combining the factors affecting practice change found in the literature that warranted further investigation with the theoretical perspectives of organisational change and social networks. To address the research objectives, the instrument covered four broad themes: roles, experiences, strategies and networks.
   Conclusion: The qualitative research instrument developed in this study provides a starting point for future research to lead to a description and understanding of practice change in community pharmacy, and subsequent development of models for the sustainable implementation of CPS.

TI Physics of pedestal density profile formation and its impact on H-mode
   density limit in burning plasmas
SO PHYSICS OF PLASMAS

DT Article
ID DISCHARGES; CONFINEMENT; TRANSITION; LAYER
AB Based on semianalytic modeling of experimental H-mode density profiles, a pedestal density limit is computed for a prototypical next generation burning plasma. For a range of input assumptions, the projected limit lies near or above Greenwald density limit [M. Greenwald, J. L. Terry, S. M. Wolfe, S. Ejima, M. G. Bell, S. M. Kaye, and G. H. Neilson, Nucl. Fusion 28, 2199 (1988)]. Two separate models are developed and utilized: the first model determines the edge density profile from consideration of cross-field transport in the steep gradient region and the distribution of fueling sources. It is shown that the observed shape of the density profile in H-mode can be explained with constant particle diffusivity within the separatrix. The second model determines the separatrix density above which the conduction limited scrape-off layer (SOL) transport is no longer sustainable. These results imply that further increases in pedestal density (while maintaining separatrix density below the power balance limit) are achievable through control of the fueling profile, e.g., with shallow pellets from the high-field side and divertor pumping.

AB Field experiments were conducted to evaluate the effect of soil-incorporated poultry litter on the population dynamics of Hoplolaimus columbus and cotton lint yield. Rates of poultry litter applied varied from 0.0 to 27.0 t/ha and were applied in December, February, or March. Time of application did not influence population densities of this nematode or cotton yield. The rate of poultry litter applied was negatively related to the population density of H. columbus at midseason, but not at other sampling dates. The lower midseason levels of this nematode corresponded with increases in cotton lint yield in all experiments. Cotton yield increases generally were linear with respect to the rate of litter applied, although the highest rates of litter applied did not always result in the greatest cotton yield. Poultry litter can be used effectively to supply nutrients to the crop and suppress damaging levels of H. columbus. Optimal rates of litter application were from 6.0 to 13.4 t/ha. Application of poultry litter at these rates, however, may exceed nutrient levels required for best management practices.

ID GENERAL ECOLOGICAL BEHAVIOR; ENVIRONMENTAL ATTITUDES; KNOWLEDGE; ENERGY
AB Given that overconsumption in industrial countries is a main cause of environmental degradation, a shift toward more sustainable consumption patterns is required. This study attempts to uncover personal and contextual barriers to consumers' purchases of green food and to strengthen knowledge about fostering green purchases. Survey data are used to examine the influence of distinct categories of personal factors (such as attitudes, personal norms, perceived behavior barriers, knowledge) and contextual factors (such as socioeconomic characteristics, living conditions, and store characteristics) on green purchases of Swiss consumers. Results from regression analysis suggest that green food purchases are facilitated by positive attitudes of consumers toward (a) environmental protection, (b) fair trade, (c) local products, and (d) availability of action-related knowledge. In turn, green behavior is negatively associated with (e) perceived time barriers and (f) frequency of shopping in supermarkets. Surprisingly, green purchases are not significantly related to moral thinking, monetary barriers, or the socioeconomic characteristics of the consumers. Implications for policy makers and for companies and marketers engaged in the promotion and commercialization of green products are discussed. (C) 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

TI An introduction to Decentralized Cooperation: Definitions, origins and
   conceptual mapping
SO PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION AND DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB The term 'Decentralized Cooperation', coined in the 1980s, is interpreted differently by various organisations involved in development cooperation. However, there are points of convergence among these interpretations that suggest a common definition involving: (a) the lead actors (local governments), (b) an overarching objective (sustainable local development) and (c) the nature of activities carried out (exchanges and support). From a historical perspective, the origin of Decentralized Cooperation is two-fold. On the development cooperation scene, the concept emerged when the array of actors involved in development projects widened as a result of major changes in aid themes and approaches. In the field of international relations between local governments, Decentralized Cooperation activities appeared as the scope of municipal twinnings also widened accordingly to involve partners from countries in development or in transition. Today, Decentralized Cooperation continues as an evolving concept located at the intersection of its two parent fields: development cooperation and international municipal relations. At this intersection, a fusion of experiences, resources and ideas is taking place. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

AB The CLIMNEG world simulation (CWS) model is introduced here for simulating cooperative game theoretic aspects of global climate negotiations. The CWS model is derived from the seminal RICE model by Nordhaus and Yang [Am. Econ. Rev. 86 (1996) 741]. We first state the necessary conditions that determine Pareto efficient investment and emission abatement paths under alternative regimes of cooperation between the regions. We then show with a numerical version of the CWS model that the transfer scheme advocated by Germain et al. [M. Germain, P.L. Toint, H. Tulkens, Financial transfers to ensure international optimality in stock pollutant abatement, in: F. Duchin, S. Faucheux, J. Gaudy, I. Nicolai (Eds.), Sustainability and Firms: Technological Change and Changing Regulatory Environment, Edward Elgar, Celtenham, UK, 1997] induces an allocation in the ("gamma") core of the world carbon emission abatement cooperative game.

AB This paper reviews the contribution of the book 'The Garbage Society: Caciquismo in Mexico City'; written 20 years ago when no official statistics on garbage production were available, to the development of sustainable waste management practice in Mexico. At that time public information was extremely difficult to obtain and environmental pollution was not regarded as an important research area for many disciplines, including social sciences. The objective of 'The Garbage Society' was to provide a detailed description of all the stages involved in garbage disposal from the time when it is discarded, until it resurfaces in recycled products. This process can be summarized as Garbage + Working force = Merchandise. The garbage problem in Mexico City is an accurate reflection of the Mexican political system that has traditionally supported corporatism in which caciques (a person who exercises absolute power over a group) play a key role. Current data are used to verify the events of that first study and through reflection on the historical process, to indicate the requirements for ongoing research as a means of clarifying and categorizing the inherent problems associated with sustainable waste management in Mexico.

AB Unlike most developed countries, Mexico has inadequate, enacted legislation and similarly ineffective regulation regimes, to cover the majority of current, key waste management issues. Because of this, an opportunity has been lost to drive the sustainable waste management agenda through the engagement of industry, commerce and the general public. To encourage the widespread adoption of sustainable practice, the educational system in Mexico needs to become pro-active and develop a range of suitable programmes for students at all levels. It must be acknowledged that there are a number of key barriers to the development of such sustainability-based programmes. Central and local authorities rarely have the knowledge base required to facilitate such developments and this added to internal organisational problems within institutions means that developments in new, multi-disciplinary areas are given low priority. This paper describes a case study of the development of a solid waste management programme in the University of Baja California-this is unique within Mexico. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB The present water quality of the Humber rivers and coastal zone depends on a complex interplay of factors, including physical ones, such as the underlying geology, which influences soil type, climatic ones, such as the rainfall, which influences runoff, socio-economic ones, which influence present-day human activities in the catchment, and the legacy of former activities, such as contaminated sediments from mining. All of these factors affect the fluxes of nutrients and other contaminants to the rivers and coastal zone. The Water Framework Directive (WFD) requires the production of a river basin management plan intended to lead to the achievement of good chemical and ecological status for all water bodies in the catchment over the next two decades. This paper provides an overview of the current environmental and socio-economic state of the Humber catchment and coastal zone, and broadly examines how socio-economic drivers affect the fluxes of nutrients and contaminants to the coastal zone, using the driver-pressure-state-impact-response (DPSIR) approach. This is followed by an overview of future research, describing the use of scenarios to simulate future fluxes and provide a consistent framework to evaluate potential policies to improve water quality in the estuary. The Humber catchment is one of eight case studies within a European research project, EUROCAT (EVK1-CT-2000-00044), which aims to achieve integrated catchment and coastal zone management by analysing the response of the coastal sea to changes in fluxes of nutrients and contaminants from the catchments. For the Humber case study, the research focuses on the fluxes of two nutrient elements, N and P, and four metal contaminants, As, Cu, Pb and Zn. The project requires the integration of scientific and socio-economic approaches, bringing together quantitative environmental data garnered for individual river catchments and coastal zones in previous research programmes, and local and regional socio-economic data, to aid decision-makers in their search for integrated and sustainable coastal zone management strategies.

AB This paper reports research that attempts to rehabilitate toxic Pb/Zn mine tailings, in Guangdong, China, to achieve a healthy functional soil that supports sustainable vegetation. We studied the effects of the earthworm Pheretima guillelmi on the growth of a woody legume Leucaena leucocephala on Pb/Zn mine tailings diluted with varying amounts of mineral soil in pot experiments. L. leucocephala grew successfully on tailings with a 25% (w/w) soil amendment, but P. guillelmi only survived and actively burrowed with a 50% soil amendment. The presence of earthworms improved the yield of plants by 10-30%. Whilst earthworms marginally increased available N and P in soil, they increased uptake of phosphorus (by about 10%) to above-ground plant tissues. Six-month-old plants were more sensitive than 10-month plants to metal stress. P. guillelmi increased bioavailable metal concentrations in the amended spoils, accompanied by a direct increase of metal uptake by the plants. Increased metal uptake by plants was largely due to the higher dry matter production stimulated by earthworm activity, but this increased the rate of metal uptake into plants from spoil by at least 16% and as much as 53%. These results demonstrate that we should broaden the ecological context of phytoremediation by considering the plant-soil-animal interactions that influence metal mobility. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The loads imposed by modem farm machinery have considerable potential to increase subsoil stress. Within the context of economically viable and environmentally sustainable systems, the practices associated with subsoil damage and methods for avoidance are identified. The greatest potential for damage is on fragile, wet or loosened subsoils combined with high wheel or track loads and contact pressures that create noticeable ruts in the topsoil. In-furrow ploughing increases this potential considerably by placing loads on the subsoil. Measures to avoid this potential involve a whole farm approach and an understanding of the many interactions between cropping systems and machinery. Alternatives to in-furrow ploughing that involve working from the surface and building a protective topsoil are discussed. Key measures to reduce the risk to subsoils involve a clear understanding of tyre load and inflation data and simple on-farm methods of achieving this are suggested. Although avoidance has the potential to reduce the risk, confinement of damage to specific strips in the field is seen as a realistic alternative. Controlled traffic operations, together with precision guidance, offer an economic means by which compaction on the cropped area can be avoided. The most effective route to improvement in soil care across the European Union (EU) is an appropriate management structure coupled with a best practice framework. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB The resource-based view of the firm postulates that sustainable abnormal rents call accrue to firms having valuable, rare, inimitable, non-substitutable resources and capabilities. Given these criteria, sustainable resources are hard to attain. Our study of some two dozen firms shows how some of them were able to overcome this dilemma by building not so much oil resources and capabilities as on asymmetries. Asymmetries are typically, skills, processes, or 'assets' a firm's competitors do not and cannot copy at a cost that affords economic rents. They are rare, inimitable and non-substitutable, although not connected to any engine of value creation, and, in fact, often act as liabilities. By discovering and reconceptualizing these asymmetries, embedding them within a complementary organizational design, and leveraging them across appropriate market opportunities, manY firms were able to turn asymmetries into sustainable capabilities.

ID STRATEGIC DECISIONS; ADVANTAGE; INDUSTRY; FIRM; VIEW
AB Heterogeneity among rivals implies that each firm faces a unique competitive set, despite overlapping market domains. This suggests the utility of a firm-level approach to competitor identification and analysis, particularly under dynamic environmental conditions. We take such an approach in developing a market-based and resource-based framework for scanning complex competitive fields. By facilitating a search for functional similarities among products and resources, the framework reveals relevant commonalities in an otherwise heterogeneous competitive set. Beyond its practical contribution, the paper also advances resource-based theory as a theory of competitive advantage. Most notably, we show that resource substitution conditions not only the sustainability of a competitive advantage, but the attainment of competitive advantage as well. With equifinality among resources of different types, the rareness condition,for even temporary competitive advantage must include resource substitutes. It is not rareness in terms of resource type that matters, but rareness in terms of resource functionality. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

DT Article
AB In the United States, both the healthcare (HC) and the educational (ED) systems are in crisis. The problems appear to be analogous, even identical, seeming to be twins in their troubles. We describe many of these problems-in-common such as: timeline and casuality; substrate and compliance; measurement of outcomes; micro-economic disconnection; learning; contradictory incentive systems; corporate culture and organizational structure; change management. Possible solutions derive directly from the analysis, viz., measure what we really want rather than what we have measured in the past; develop incentives that encourage desired behaviors. We warn that there is no quick and easy fix. Effective sustainable solutions will be costly, painful and require decades.

TI Agricultural vehicles and sustainable safe road traffic: solving
   conflicts on arterial highways
SO TRANSPORT REVIEWS
LA English
DT Article
AB Addressing the issues of traffic safety in rural areas presents a constant challenge. The mix of light and heavy vehicles and the considerable differences in speed among these traffic participants result in high risks and delays for the faster vehicles. Agricultural vehicles (AVs) in particular have such an impact on traffic, especially when using arterial highways. This paper reviews the problems of safety and delays that AVs cause on arterial highways, and the appropriate mitigation. The concept of 'sustainable safety' in The Netherlands focuses on these problems, because of the proposed construction of parallel roads alongside all arterial highways. However, Dutch accident statistics cannot justify the high costs for the construction of parallel roads alongside 7000 km of arterial highways. Delays experienced by fast traffic are another reason for separating AVs from other road users with parallel roads. Alternative measures alongside the arterial highway, such as passing bays, restricting AVs to travelling at off-peak only and improving the conspicuity of the AVs, may be more cost-effective ways of reducing delays and/or improving traffic safety on arterial highways. Another solution may be to eliminate the need for AVs to use the arterial highway by altering their routes. For this purpose, land reallocation projects (as practised in Holland) can provide a useful tool.

ID ANALYTIC HIERARCHY PROCESS
AB The present study examines the impact of including various qualitative criteria for the selection of alternative transportation options in Delhi. Three alternative transport options viz. 4-stroke 2-wheelers, CNG cars and CNG buses are prioritized based on six different criteria-energy saving potential (energy), emission reduction potential (environment), cost of operation (cost), availability of technology (technology), adaptability of the option (adaptability) and barriers to implementation (barrier). Based on quantitative criteria 'energy', 'environment' and 'cost', CNG car showed more potential in contributing to environmentally sustainable transport system in Delhi followed by 4-stroke 2-wheelers and CNG buses. Qualitative criteria viz. 'technology', 'adaptability' and 'barriers' in prioritization process resulted in higher priority for 4-stroke 2-wheelers followed by CNG bus and CNG car. Integrated quantitative and qualitative criteria gave a contrasting result as compared to that of the conventional quantitative approach and qualitative approach with highest priority for CNG bus followed by 4-stroke 2-wheelers and CNG car. This could explain the reasons for failure of many potential alternative urban transport options. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Changes in soil structure, hydraulic properties, and organic C content were investigated in a swidden cultivation system, and an adjacent natural forest, in western Thailand. Using the chronosequence approach of sampling closely-spaced sites, differences in soil properties were assessed and an evaluation made of changes to such properties over a typical fallow period of 10 years. Such aspects have important repercussions not only for the successful re-establishment of vegetation after cultivation and the sustainability of that swidden system, but also for the influence they have on plant growth rates, soil erosion, and local hydrology. The soil structure remained in good condition for all fallow years tested, compared with undisturbed forest, as shown by the maintenance of low bulk density values and high porosities. The already low plant available soil water did not change and organic C contents were maintained at reasonably high levels for all treatments, although assumptions were made about the changes in quality. The lack of changes are assumed to be due to the low intensity. of the farming method and the inherent soil properties giving it resilience to change.

AB A multi-centre study to determine whether community-directed distributors (CDDs) are capable of carrying out additional healthcare and developmental activities in their communities was carried out in Cameroon, Nigeria, Sudan, Uganda and Togo to ascertain the potential effects of their involvement on the implementation of community-directed treatment with ivermectin (CDTI).
   Both quantitative and qualitative methods were used to collect data from households, community-directed distributors, community leaders, and health workers. The results showed no major decrease in the CDDs' performance in CDTI: on the contrary, the involvement of CDDs in other health and development activities motivated them to perform their CDTI functions better. However, the results did not show any significant increase in therapeutic coverage of ivermectin distribution.
   The expansion of the CDDs' experience to include additional healthcare and development related activities would be of interest to onchocerciasis control programmes - it will strengthen CDTI sustainability through greater integration.

AB Since 1994, the Peruvian Malaria Control Program has used a simplified operational approach for monitoring antimalarial drug efficacy, in which blood smears are taken 7 and 14 days after treatment from all patients diagnosed with malaria at Ministry of Health facilities. The proportion of patients with parasitaemia on one of their return visits provides an indication of the efficacy of the drug being administered. We compared this approach for antimalarial drug resistance monitoring to the more labour-intensive and expensive World Health Organization (WHO) 14-day in vivo efficacy trial at six sites in the Amazon Basin and the north coast of Peru. Although the proportion of treatment failures at 7 and 14 days identified by the operational monitoring system was considerably lower than the results of the WHO in vivo efficacy test, the operational approach did accurately reflect the overall efficacy or lack of efficacy of the drugs being evaluated. Differences in the results of the two methods were greatest in the Peruvian Amazon region, where fully supervised treatment and patient follow-up is very difficult due to the widely dispersed population. While the operational approach cannot be considered an alternative to WHO in vivo testing for evaluating the efficacy of antimalarial drugs or for recommending changes in malaria treatment policy, if treatment is supervised and follow-up blood smears taken as scheduled, this method could serve as a simple, inexpensive and sustainable early warning system for reduced drug efficacy.

ID LANDFILL LEACHATE
AB Leachate treatment is one of the major environmental issues faced by landfill owners. One promising method for reduction of pollutant discharge is reverse osmosis (RO). RO technology was tested at a pilot plant at Hedeskoga Landfill in southern Sweden. This landfill receives municipal solid waste (MSW) and industrial, commercial and institutional (IC&I) waste, and produces about 3000 m(3)/ha of leachate annually.
   Annual variations in the volume of leachate produced, estimated from changes in leachate electrical conductivity, were relatively small and should therefore have a minor effect on the main performance parameter of an RO plant, i.e., the achievable Volume reduction. The volume reduction (V-permeate/V-feed) of polluted water achieved in batch experiments with 200-1000 litres of raw leachate was more than 80% (4MPa) and the remaining 20% was left as retentate. However, raw leachate caused severe fouling problems in a continuous flow run and after 24 hours, the flux had decreased to about 20% of the initial value. By pre-treating the leachate in a storage pond combined with a wetland, the situation was significantly improved and the decrease in membrane flux was only 0.2% per hour during a 200 hour run. The retention in terms of total solids and chemical oxygen demand was 90%, and for ammonia, it was 82%, at a volume reduction of 50%.
   The HELP-model was used for prediction of the water balance for the Hedeskoga landfill, with special focus on estimation of potential evapotranspiration. With different types of vegetation and a volume reduction of 75% in the RO plant, it was found possible to achieve safe disposal by irrigating 25% to 40% of the leachate-producing landfill area with pre-treated leachate.
   Pre-treatment with wetlands and nature based systems reduce the need of detergents for cleaning of the membranes and water only can be used. Short pre-treatment by aeration is not sufficient to bring leachate to a condition sustainable for RO-treatment. In that case, it was found necessary with alkaline-acid-alkaline treatment to restore the permeability. The total treatment cost for a full scale treatment plant at Hedeskoga was estimated to be approximately 30 SEK/m(3), of which 25 is capital and 5 is operational costs. This can be compared to the total treatment costs for municipal sewage in Sweden, which is 8 SEK/m3.

TI German unification and 'model Germany': An adventure in institutional

SO WEST EUROPEAN POLITICS

DT Article
AB Germany today appears to be anything but the fortunate country it was on the eve of unification. The extension of model Germany to Eastern Germany has contributed to the predicament it has encountered in the emerging international political economic setting. The chosen mode of unification and its consequences have impaired the sustainability of the once cherished socio-economic order. Unification has made institutional reform both more urgent and more difficult. If major reform cannot be achieved without an external shock, a redistribution of political jurisdictions in favour of the Lander level could perhaps prove a feasible path to better performance.

AB Large areas of the Amazon are subject to seasonal flooding due to water level changes of the river. This 'flood pulse' causes rapidly changing conditions for microorganisms living in the soils which affects the cycling of nitrogen in the ecosystem. An understanding of the nitrogen dynamics in the seasonally flooded soils is essential for the development of productive and sustainable management concepts. We measured nitrogen concentrations, denitrifier enzyme activity (DEA), cell numbers of nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria, respiration, pH and total carbon in the seasonally flooded soils over one entire annual hydrological cycle. By comparing three sites with different vegetation (forest, aquatic macrophyte stand and bare sediment with annual herbs) we assessed the effect of vegetation on soil nitrogen dynamics. Inorganic nitrogen was always dominated by ammonium indicating reduced conditions in the soil even during the terrestrial phase. Although conditions were generally poor for nitrification we observed high numbers of nitrifying bacteria between 10(4) and 10(7) cells g(-1). Pulses of ammonium as well as high DEA were observed during the transition periods between aquatic and terrestrial phase. Thus the alternation between aquatic and terrestrial phase promotes nitrogen mineralization and denitrification in the soils. There were no plausible correlations between microbial activities and numbers with soil physical or chemical parameters except a relation between the numbers of nitrate reducing bacteria and soil moisture (R-2 = 0.81) and ammonium (R-2 = 0.92) at one site. This shows the complex regulation patterns in this habitat. Different vegetation did not alter the general patterns of nitrogen dynamics but the absolute extend of fluctuations. We conclude that both the soil physical and chemical changes directly caused by the flood pulse and the vegetation have a great impact on microbial nitrogen turnover in the soils. The effects of the flood pulse can be buffered by a fine soil texture or a litter layer which prevents desiccation of the soil during the terrestrial phase.

AB This paper examines the sustainability of conventional and ecological agricultural systems based on their environmental soundness, economic viability and social acceptability. Significant differences were found in crop diversification, soil fertility management. pests and diseases management, and use of agrochemicals. No remarkable variations were found in land-Use pattern, crop yield and stability, financial and economic returns, risk and uncertainties, or food Security. The findings Suggest that ecological agriculture is relatively more sustainable. and it could be an economically and environmentally viable alternative to the conventional agricultural system. Ecological agriculture Could become an alternative if market distortions created by subsidies were removed, and financial benefits were provided to resource-conserving farmers along with necessary Support through extension, credit, research, and marketing.

AB Chromate (Cr(VI)) reduction tests were performed with nitrate- and fumarate-grown stationary phase cultures of Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 (hence-forth referred to as MR-1) and disappearance of Cr(VI) was monitored over time. A rapid initial decrease in Cr(VI) concentration was observed, which was followed by a slower, steady decrease. These observations appear to be consistent with our previous results indicating that Cr(VI) reduction in MR-1 involves at least two mechanisms (Viamajala et al., 2002b). Modeling of metal reduction kinetics is often based on single-enzyme Michaelis-Menten equations. However, these models are often developed using initial rates and do not always match actual reduction profiles. Based on the hypothesis that multiple Cr(VI) reduction mechanisms exist in MR-1, a model was developed to describe the kinetics of Cr(VI) reduction by two parallel mechanisms: (1) a rapid Cr(VI) reduction mechanism that was deactivated (or depleted) quickly, and (2) a slower mechanism that had a constant activity and was sustainable for a longer duration. Kinetic parameters were estimated by fitting experimental data, and model fits were found to correspond very closely to quantitative observations of Cr(VI) reduction by MR-1.

AB Accelerator driven clean nuclear power system (ADS) as an innovative technique in the 21st century is among the most challenge of high-tech fields since it makes nuclear power system safer, cleaner, cheaper, and more reliable. ADS is very necessary option for sustainable development of nuclear energy in the 21st century. However, beam halo-chaos occurred in high-current accelerators of ADS has become a key concerned issue for many important applications of intensity ion beam.To understand the complex of beam halo-chaos, this paper analyzes one of the main physical mechanism for halo-chaos formation, i.e. nonlinear resonance overlapping routes to halo-chaos. Then some efficient nonlinear control methods of beam halo-chaos are presented. The simulation results demonstrate that the control methods we proposed are very effective for beam halo-chaos suppression.

TI Opportunities for increasing productive water use from dam water: a case
   study from semi-arid Zimbabwe
SO AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
DE semi-arid; runoff; evaporation; earth dam; small reservoir and
   productive water use
AB Communities in the semi-arid areas of Zimbabwe rely on dryland farming, but do not get adequate yields in many years because of the low and erratic rainfall. Surface water from small reservoirs and groundwater is used for water supply and to irrigate community gardens. These gardens provide an additional source of nutrition and income from produce sold. These limited water sources are a buffer during dry seasons and dry years and should be managed appropriately, but management often is hindered by inadequate knowledge of the relationships among rainfall, run-in, evaporation, seepage and productive water use. A study was carried out within the catchment of the Mutangi dam, a small reservoir (surface area, 8.7 ha; capacity, 111,000 m(3); maximum depth, 2.5 m) in a semi-arid area in southern Zimbabwe during the 1999/2000 and 2000/2001 seasons. In these seasons, the Mutangi catchment received 755 and 615 mm of rainfall of which 13% (102 mm) and 10% (62 mm) resulted in runoff, respectively. Of this runoff, 79 and 45 mm spilled over the dam and 24 and 19 mm was caught by the reservoir in 1999/2000 and 2000/2001 seasons, respectively. Monthly rates of water loss/use from the dam varied between 3.8 mm day(-1) in June and 8.6 mm day(-1) in November. In volume terms, the highest rate of loss occurs when the dam is full and its surface area is at its maximum. Almost 97% of the loss was through surface evaporation with only 3% used productively, split approximately as 2% garden irrigation and 1% animal watering. Scenarios on how much water to use for irrigation in years with different rainfall were run. Water usage could be safely increased by a factor of 5 in years when the dam last spilled between February and May. The later the last spill occurs, the more water is available for productive use. It is better to use water earlier in the dry season when volumetric loss rates are highest, to "compete" with this loss. The study highlights that a management approach that matches the quantity of water used to the amount of water in the reservoir is required for sustainable use of surface water resources. The volume of water in the reservoir should be monitored by the communities using a staff gauge and a stage-volume curve for the reservoir, to allow rational decisions on setting permissible rates of water use through the dry season to ensure that a "buffer" reserve of water will be maintained in the event of late arrival of the rains. If critical levels are reached, water use can then be reduced, and non-essential use stopped. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB White clover and rye were grown during the winter and spring (November-May) for two seasons from 1999 to 2001 in Ehime, Japan in order to evaluate biomass production, N states and weed growth in following paddy rice. Our goal was to develop external low-input, sustainable agriculture (ELISA). Five no-till, direct-sown, winter rice crop (Oryza sativa L.) plots and a conventional transplanted rice control were evaluated in 2000. The conventional control was deleted in 2001 and transplanting and fertilization sub-treatments added to the original no-till, direct-sown plots.
   Rice yielded 0.5-3.58 t/ha in 2000 and 0.05-6.36 t/ha in 2001. Shoot N of rice contained 1.23-9.77 g/m(2) in 2000 and 0.39-18.1 g/m(2) in 2001. White clover residues contained about 14 g/m(2) before submergence, therefore the release of N from residues was potentially sufficient to supply the rice crop demand.
   Total weed dry weight ranged from 93 to 482 and 66 to 505 g/m(2) in 2000 and 2001, respectively, when sampled at rice ripening. At rice harvesting in 2000, weed nitrogen content ranged from 1.06 g/m(2) in the fertilized rye-rice plot to 6.32 g/m(2) in the control. Due to their shoot N content, Echinochloa crus-galli and Polygonum hydropiper posed the greatest competition to rice growth. Our results show that the white clover in rotation with rice was the best ELISA option, producing good rice yield and minimizing weed infestation. The rye-white clover treatments also reduced weeds, but without fertilizer and transplanting did not yield as well as white clover alone, and they were difficult to manage.

AB In Subtropical regions where two crops are grown each year, effects of fertilizer P applications to summer, winter or both crops each year were evaluated on the basis of crop yields and transformations of fertilizer P into different soil P pools. Summer-grown groundnut showed small and inconsistent response to fertilizer P. Winter-grown crops responded significantly and consistently suggesting 40 and 60 kg P2O5 ha(-1) as adequate for rapeseed-mustard and wheat, respectively. Application of P to winter crops produced yields comparable to those when applied to both summer and winter crops. After 25 years of cropping, while Olsen-P decreased slightly in no-P control plots, organic P declined by 39% of the 8-year value. In fertilizer-treated plots, organic P increased by 18-22% of the 8-year value, whereas Olsen-P increased from initial 11.6 to 14-34 kg P ha(-1) after 3 years, 16-58 kg P ha(-1) after 8 years and 18-59 kg P ha(-1) after 25 years. Negligible increase in Olsen-P was observed in between 8 and 25 years. This was probably due to reduction in the applied P rates and raising five crops in between rotational changeovers without applying fertilizer P. Of the total fertilizer P added in 25 years, crops removed 21-54% whereas 33-64% accumulated in plough layer soil leaving 12-32% unaccounted for. This was probably leached to lower soil layers. The residual fertilizer P was transformed into labile (14-18%), moderately labile (28-35%) and non-labile (47-57%) pools of soil P. Results of this study with groundnut-based cropping systems in a subtropical region reveal that (a) long-term applications of fertilizer P to both crops each year significantly increased residual fertilizer P accumulation in soil and accelerated its conversion to non-labile P forms. (b) While application of fertilizer P to winter crops is essential, P requirement of summer-grown groundnut can be met from soil-derived and residual fertilizer P; this practice helps enhance fertilizer use efficiency (42-54% as compared to 27-40% in cumulative P treatment), saves costly fertilizer (50%), and reduces P accumulation by 44-76%. (c) The Olsen-P test alone is not adequate to reflect the depletion/accumulation of bio-available P. Therefore, the status of different soil P pools in long-term fertilized soils need to be determined to assess and make use of accumulated fertilizer P for sustainable crop production and environmental safety.

AB The sustainable management of areas of logged-over tropical forests requires an understanding of the potential yield from the forest and likely financial performance of the management system. This paper describes an analytical approach that involves the linkage of a simulation model of forest growth and yield to a financial model based on data from a forest concession in East Kalimantan (Indonesian Borneo). The growth and yield model SYMFOR (silviculture and yield management for tropical forests) was linked to a financial model derived for a forest concession managed under the Indonesian selective logging and replanting system (TPTI). This combined approach was used in this study to predict the likely timber yield for contrasting management regimes and then to calculate estimates of the financial performance described as the internal rate of return (IRR) and net present value (NPV) of the forest estate.
   This approach was used in a study that compared the standard TPTI system with alternatives that combined reduced impact logging (RIL) techniques with alternative systems of yield regulation. The TPTI system regulates timber yield using a single diameter limit given for each type of forest (currently two categories for lowland Dipterocarp forests and one for swamp forest). The alternative systems that were evaluated included one defined by a maximum of eight harvested stems per hectare and others based on maximum volume extracted of either 50 or 60 m(3) ha(-1). Each of these systems was evaluated for cutting cycle lengths of 25; 35 and 45 years. These management regimes were implemented for a simulated period representing three additional cutting cycles. The impacts of alternative management regimes were compared through statistical analysis of the results from the simulations that was able to remove the effect of the very significant variability between experimental plots.
   The results of this analysis clearly demonstrated that the conventional TPTI management system failed to achieve criteria of sustainability for timber yield and financial performance. Average yields dropped from over 80 m(3) ha(-1) for the first simulated harvest from the logged-over area (second harvest) to between 35 and 40 m3 ha-1 for the third and fourth harvests. The financial analysis showed that this system was not viable after the second harvest leaving the only financially viable alternative of land conversion after clear felling of the remaining forest.
   The alternative management regimes based on reduced impact logging and more effective systems of timber yield regulation performed much better. The study suggested that management systems based on a cutting cycle of 35 years with yield regulated to 50 m(3) ha(-1) or 45 years with yield regulated to 60 m3 ha-1 were the best alternatives to the current TPTI system. Neither of these two alternatives was able to consistently achieve the desired internal rate of return of 16% unless there were also decreases in wastage associated with the harvesting and timber extraction.
   Optimisation techniques where used to determine the combination that would produce an internal rate of return of at least 16%. This process suggested that the concession studied would be able to achieve or exceed this criterion over all harvests when (a) a management regime involving a cutting cycle of 45 years is combined with a yield regulation system harvesting a maximum of 60 m(3) ha(-1) and (b) the efficiency of timber conversion increases from 52 to 60%. It is considered that this is readily achievable using existing methods and appropriate training.
   The methods described in this paper can be transferred to other concessions or countries and may be modified to utilise alternative growth and yield or financial models. The paper also indicates that the approach could be adapted,to consider a wider range of goods and services provided by forests to extend the analysis into a more comprehensive economic analysis. A preliminary consideration of these issues demonstrated that the system of management selected on the basis of timber yield and financial performance will also provide benefits for the environment and local communities.

AB Forestry practices produce intense alterations on soil processes, which in turn could lead to more intense transformations of the system in relation to the availability of resources. From this point of view we conducted research in the critical Mediterranean environment of central Spain to check if length of time-rotation on chestnut (Castanea sativa Mill.) coppice stand allows recovery towards pre-disturbance conditions.
   According to the management scheme for chestnut forests in the zone, the quadrants which were clear-cut in 1957, 1967, 1982 and 1993 were used to build a chronosequence. Ten plots were allocated and physiographic, soil and forestry variables were measured to build a linear model in which the time since the last clear-felling was considered as a fixed variable. Almost all soil variables showed no significant differences between the studied stand-ages, but organic matter, nitrogen and potassium content showed an intense depletion after clear-cutting.
   The sustainability of this management scheme, as is shown in our results, is primarily based on the ability of chestnut trees to rapidly recover their canopy structure from rootstock as well as, from a forestry perspective, on a twofold increase in time-rotation (in more mesic chestnut stands of Mediterranean Spain, clear-cuts are conducted after 20 years). Under stressful conditions of our stands, maximum productivity (20 years) does not coincide with the time to soil recovery (40-50 years) and consequently this management scheme has lengthened the time-rotation interval to guarantee viability of the stand.

AB Construction of a multidisciplinary conceptual framework of environmental quality and quality of life is required to advance the field of urban development, environmental quality and human well-being. such a framework would allow for a more theory-based choice of indicators and for the development of tools to evaluate multidimensional aspects of urban environmental quality. These tools are required to assess the current and future quality of the urban environment and to have, eventually, the ability to assess the implications of spatial and urban planning policies with respect to these dimensions. Against this background, the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment in the Netherlands (RIVM) performed a major literature review [Leidelmeijer, van Kamp, 2002, in press] to identify various concepts in the literature concerning environmental quality, the relationships between these various concepts, as well as their respective theoretical bases. This paper summarises the outcomes of this survey. It reviews the main (types of) concepts of livability, environmental quality, quality of life and sustainability, and presents examples of underlying conceptual models. Different notions and concepts are compared along the dimensions of domain, indicator, scale, time-frame and context as described by [Urban Environmental Quality-a social geographical perspective, this issue]. It is concluded that a multidisciplinary conceptual framework of environmental quality and quality of life that will go beyond the disciplinary differences found in the current literature is needed if the field is to advance.

AB Common logging practices in tropical rainforest are often not sustainable and can degrade the forest. The Palcazu Forest Management system (strip clear-cutting) has been proposed as one sustainable alternative. However, low growth rates of commercial tree species during early regeneration indicate that strip-cutting may not be sustainable. To test whether a silvicultural treatment enhances the growth, survival, recruitment or richness of regenerating trees, we carried out an experimental thinning in 1996 within two strips cleared in 1989 at Jenaro Herrera, Peru, then censussed and remeasured trees on thinned and control plots in 2000. In addition, for strip 2, we compared tree regeneration on two felling treatments, clear-cutting and deferment-cutting.
   Thinning significantly enhanced annual growth increment (AGI) for stems of all regeneration categories (recruits, stump sprouts, and advance regeneration) of commercial species in strip 1, and for all categories of recruits and stump sprouts in strip 2. In most cases, mean increment in the thinned treatment was approximately twice that of the control. Recruitment, survival and richness, however, demonstrated little response to thinning. Although growth tended to be higher in clear-cut portions, significant differences in increment for felling treatment were detected for only two of seven categories on strip 2, and there was no effect of felling treatment on survival, recruitment or richness. Thinning is likely to raise the value of the second harvest on the strips by enhancing the growth rates of regenerating trees, so thinning should be included in the strip clear-cutting system. This system should not, however, be considered sustainable unless growth rates are sufficient to ensure the value of successive harvests. Crown Copyright (C) 2003 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Delayed rectifier potassium current diversity and regulation are essential for signal processing and integration in neuronal circuits. Here, we investigated a neuronal role for MinK-related peptides (MiRPs), membrane-spanning modulatory subunits that generate phenotypic diversity in cardiac potassium channels. Native coimmunoprecipitation from rat brain membranes identified two novel potassium channel complexes, MiRP2-Kv2.1 and MiRP2-Kv3.1b. MiRP2 reduces the current density of both channels, slows Kv3.1b activation, and slows both activation and deactivation of Kv2.1. Altering native MiRP2 expression levels by RNAi gene silencing or cDNA transfection toggles the magnitude and kinetics of endogenous delayed rectifier currents in PC12 cells and hippocampal neurons. Computer simulations predict that the slower gating of Kv3.1b in complexes with MiRP2 will broaden action potentials and lower sustainable firing frequency. Thus, MiRP2, unlike other known neuronal beta subunits, provides a mechanism for influence over multiple delayed rectifier potassium currents in mammalian CNS via modulation of alpha subunits from structurally and kinetically distinct subfamilies.

TI Pyrethroid-impregnated curtains for Chagas' disease control in Venezuela
SO ACTA TROPICA
LA English
DT Article
DE Chagas' disease vectors; pyrethroid-impregnated curtains; preference in
   vector protection; Latin America
AB The use of insecticide treated materials for the control of Chagas' disease transmission is potentially a cost-effective and sustainable option where vectors are sylvatic. A study was undertaken in two rural Chagas' disease endemic communities (96 households) of Trujillo State, Venezuela. After a baseline study (including a short questionnaire survey, assessment of housing conditions, vector behaviour and preferences in vector protection), 37 households were chosen at random for protection by impregnated or non-impregnated curtains. During the 30-day entomological study vector collection of triatomine bugs were conducted in the early morning. The protective efficacy of curtains was determined by the number of vectors found dead or alive in control and experimental houses. It was found that house infestation of Chagas' disease vectors was high (60% of houses) in spite of good-quality houses due to a re-housing programme. The vectors were sylvatic (mainly Rhodnius robustus) and entered the houses at night. More than half the population (52%) preferred curtains to bednets for Chagas' disease protection. Users of pyrethroid-impregnated curtains were well protected as no living triatomines were found in bedrooms of houses with impregnated curtains compared to houses with non-impregnated curtains where an average of 4/7 vectors were found alive in bedrooms. In houses with impregnated curtains 21/30 triatomines died within 72 h; the triatomines which survived were found exclusively in rooms where no impregnated curtains had been placed. In houses with non-impregnated curtains 20% (6/30) of vectors died, probably due to rough handling. It is concluded that pyrethroid-impregnated curtains represent an important option for the reduction or even elimination of man-vector contact and thus of Chagas' disease transmission in areas where species of small triatomine bugs such as Rhodnius prolixus and R. robustus are the main vectors.

TI The broad delta airliner
SO AERONAUTICAL JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
AB Aeronautics faces new and increased challenges in the 21st century. These include climate change, long-term fuel supply, traffic congestion, and noise pollution. Radical technological steps will be demanded of the industry in order to maintain a sustainable transportation system.
   In setting out its ideas for a Sonic Cruiser, Boeing has recently acknowledged that there is a need to look beyond the high-aspect-ratio wing with separate fuselage and podded engine configuration, which it pioneered at the start of the Jet era.
   This paper sets out the case for the broad delta including its advantages as a basis for achieving higher transonic cruising speeds, with very long range and large payloads, while providing progressive and significantly improved environmental impact. The work is based on concept designs drawing on flight and weight data from the Vulcan bomber and the Concorde aircraft-both pioneering designs, by no means at the end of their technical potential.
   A broad delta is taken to mean an aircraft of aspect ratio in the range 2 to 4. Not only does such a planform have application to many sizes of airliner, cruising at various high subsonic speeds, but also it is inherently well suited to later application of laminar flow. Wing surfaces undisturbed by flaps and slots and unhampered by very thick wing skins, together with favourable engine inlet locations, could be a basis for improved overall aerodynamic efficiency.
   Airliners designed for operation in the region of Mach 1 are likely to pose more difficult problems for the aerodynamicist. Designs must cater for both cruise and maximum design speeds, which may encompass the Mach 1 condition.

AB Trees play a critical role in the development of sustainable land use systems in the southern Africa region, but access to tree germplasm is limited. It was hypothesized that facilitating the establishment of farmer nurseries would promote decentralized tree seedling production in an efficient way, while at the same time provide opportunities for building natural, human and social capital. A study was conducted in Malawi, Zambia and Tanzania over 2 years to analyze the productivity of farmer nurseries and their functions in sustainable development. With limited outside support, farmers produced an estimated 6.2 million tree seedlings from 1901 nurseries across the three study areas over two years. Productivity of nurseries depended greatly on access to scarce water sources during the dry season. Farmers located the majority of nurseries therefore in ecologically sensitive dambo locations and along riverbanks, both posing possible land use conflicts in the future due to increasing human populations. Farmers organized two types of nurseries, with group nurseries producing significantly fewer tree seedlings compared to individual nurseries. This was attributed to larger transaction costs associated with organization and capacity building of group nurseries. On the other hand, the success of individual nurseries appeared to depend on human and social "start-up" capital being provided by group nurseries through previous training. In the absence of rigorous valuation of the longer-term effects of both types of nurseries in building natural, human and social capital, it appears that both have a role to play in meeting local demand for tree seedlings. Results generally suggest that smallholder farmers can play a pivotal role in providing tree germplasm for the development of sustainable land use systems. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB Support to farmer nurseries is classified as either "hard" referring to material inputs (tree seed. water, inoculum, tools and fencing) or "soft" (information, training and backstopping advice). Against a background of poor services for smallholder farmers in southern Africa, it was hypothesized that a number of support agents operating at the grass root level together with farmers themselves provide the different support functions needed in farmer nurseries. A study was conducted to evaluate the role of support systems in farmer nurseries in Malawi, Zambia and Tanzania. Furthermore, the early tree planting impact of farmer nurseries was assessed in Malawi. Support for hard inputs came largely from single service providers, with significant and increasing contributions coming from farmers themselves. Soft inputs came from a larger diversity of providers with collaborative effort gaining importance. There is an urgent need to facilitate grassroot level support systems with larger participation from the private sector for tree seed and from the national extension services for provision of training and backstopping advice. It was noted that individual nurseries achieved larger transplanting impact, but this did not translate into higher impact at the landscape level, because group nurseries were the predominant type. Strengthening the human capital of farmers and service providers emerged as critical in increasing impact. Farmer nurseries are shown to play a number of important and interrelated functions in building natural, human and social capital. Monitoring and evaluating farmer nurseries in catalyzing these three functions should therefore receive proper attention in assessing the impact of sustainable land use systems. Policies need to be articulated to address some of the major constraints identified. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper discusses them practical impact of a non-materialistic culture on sustainable farm management. Two elements are discussed: first, how deeply rooted religion is in this culture; second, the feasibility of using both human knowledge and experience, so-called tradition and divine guidance in management. Finally, the implications of the fusion of these two elements are drawn. The outcome is the capability of man to integrate ethical values into decisions and actions. This integration, when applied by skilled farmers, leads to a management of natural resources in an altruistic fashion and not merely to economic ends. Moreover, it makes agriculture meaningful and sustainable.

AB The reasons why upland farmers on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi are engaged in a cacao boom and its long term implications are addressed in the context of protected area management regulations, and political and economic conditions in Post-Suharto, Indonesia. In the remote case study village of Moa in Central Sulawesi, we found that while few households cultivated cacao in the early 1990s, all had planted cacao by 2000. Furthermore, the vast majority cultivate cacao in former food-crop focused swidden fields under full-sun conditions. Farmers cultivate cacao to establish property rights in light of a land shortage driven in part by the prohibition of farming and forest product collecting in a nearby national park, and to secure a future source of income, a concern that has been exacerbated by Indonesia's economic crisis. However, conversion of swidden fields to sun-grown cacao constrains future food production opportunities, increases susceptibility to drought stress and potential soil nutrient and organic matter losses, and increases household dependence on a commodity that is subject to extreme price volatility. These factors raise significant concerns for local food security and agricultural sustainability.

ID CONVENTIONAL FARMERS; ADHERENCE
AB Sustainable farming, and ways to achieve it, are important issues for agricultural policy. New Zealand provides an interesting case for examining sustainable agriculture options because gene technologies have not been commercially released and there is a small but rapidly expanding organic sector. There is no strong government subsidization of agriculture, so while policies seem to favor both options to some degree, neither has been directly supported. Results from a survey of 656 farmers are used to reveal the intentions, environmental values, and farming practices for organic, conventional, and GE intending farmers. The results show that organic and conventional farmers are relatively similar but contrast to GE intending farmers, especially with respect to perceived consequences of each technology. While 75% of farmers have not yet made a commitment to either technology, one fifth were GE intending and one quarter may become organic. Organic farmers have different attitudes to nature, matched in part by conventional farmers. In terms of policy for sustainable agriculture, the results suggest that organic and conventional farmers are incrementally moving towards agroecological sustainability while GE intending farmers are committed to intensive production methods of which GE products are potentially important. GE intending farmers reject incrementalism in favor of a revolutionary technological fix for sustainability concerns in agriculture. Overall, the results show that there are clearly two different paradigms of sustainability among farmers. Policies that are seeking to achieve sustainable agriculture need to address the tensions that span the different paradigms.

AB Research explored methods for "shortening the food links" or developing the "local foodshed" by connecting farmers with food service buyers (for restaurants and institutions) in Colorado. Telephone interviews were used to investigate marketing and purchasing practices. Findings include that price is not a significant factor in purchasing decisions; that food buyers prioritize quality as their top purchasing criterion but are not aware that local farmers can provide higher quality, that institutions are interested in buying locally; that small farms can offer comparable or higher quality produce and service; and that farmers need to show buyers what the quality of produce and service they can provide.

AB Research for a concept of sustainable agriculture and for the sustainable use of agricultural landscapes are closely related to the development of an international acknowledged indicator framework for the analysis and valuation of the environmental situation by the OECD. Worldwide efforts are focussing on this new topic in the environmental discussion: quantifying and valuation of impacts of agricultural practice on the animated and unanimated environment to draw conclusions for agricultural policy. A key function holds the term sustainability, which is assumed to dominate future policy approaches. The growing insecurity about the environmental impacts of agricultural land use systems led to the overall goal to avoid irreversible damages by agriculture.
   The development of tools for decision-makers on all decision levels are to:
   1. recognise and value impacts degrading the environment;
   2. assess future sources of danger;
   3. develop sustainable land use systems.
   Decision supporting tools are worked out since few years for diverse purposes. As a term reflecting the most relevant environmental aspects on the global level agri-environmental indicators (AEIs) are in the focus of interest. Latest since the [Environmental Indicators for Agriculture, vol. 1: Concepts and Framework. Publications Service, OECD, Paris, 1997] launched the driving force-state-response (DSR) model and a catalogue with 14 AUI areas, which resulted from international discussions started on the Rio Conference in 1992, the political significance of an environmental measuring system was recognised.
   One of the focal points was the indicator issue concerning landscapes and to define indicators which are capable to describe landscapes. Actual indicator concepts for landscape of the OECD, the EU and the PAIS research project illustrate the efforts to integrate landscapes in agricultural policies. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Referring to the agricultural history in Central Europe determinants of floristic diversity at the habitat scale and the decline in diversity over the last few decades are described. In this context the preservation of floristic diversity is stressed to be one important goal of modern, multifunctional agricultural land use. To reach this goal indicators of diversity are useful tools to evaluate the effects management practices have on floristic diversity in agro-ecosystems. However, "key indicators" that allow an easy assessment and evaluation of diversity are still lacking. Potentially, indicators of biodiversity measures at the habitat scale can be developed from a large number of parameters. An attempt to classify parameters into three major types of indicators and requirements indicators have to meet are presented.
   Based on the contributions in this special issue and further references recent approaches to indicate floristic diversity at the habitat scale in agricultural landscapes of Central Europe are summarized and discussed. It is concluded that further research should focus on the validation of existing approaches and their integration into a comprehensive set of indicators and on the development of standardized modes of collection for data.

AB Most political statements (e.g. convention on biodiversity), referring to existing approaches regarding the development of biotic agrienvironmental indicators focus mainly and nearly exclusively on "biodiversity", the enhancement of which is almost the overall target for the development of agricultural landscapes towards sustainability. In this regard the understanding of the term "biodiversity" is rather different: mostly it is interpreted as species richness, only occasionally as richness of varieties, cultivars or genetical expressions (e.g. micro-organisms).
   In this contribution the approach of evaluating the quality of species communities in agroecosystems mainly oil the basis of "biodiversity" (in the sense of species richness), will be analysed critically. General difficulties of an exact sampling or establishment of biodiversity especially of invertebrate communities in agricultural landscapes will be highlighted. Arising from this synthesis, it is demonstrated that biotic agrienvironmental indicators should not only address a maximising of species numbers in agricultural habitats, but also a sustainable and long-term stability, and the reproductive potential of populations of species typical of agroecosystems.
   In this regard alternative biotic indicators for the assessment of the effects of husbandry practices are required that are based on existing knowledge of the reactions of populations and species communities to environmental stress, and which give information about the physiological fitness of populations of species that are relevant members of the agrobiocoenosis from both the qualitative (rarity, endangerment status) and functional point of view (natural enemies, parasitoids, decomposers). Regarding the sensitivity of those indicators it will be indicated that in contrast to many recent scientific experiments it is usually necessary to evaluate and compare cultivation intensities, that are quite similar (e.g. gradual differences in conventional managed farms and landscapes) as well as those displaying much larger differences (e.g. organic farming vs. conventional fanning), because conventional farms currently cover nearly 90% of the area under plough in Europe. Finally an assessment of the practicality, the power of indication statements and the remaining work required to validate indicators will be provided for discussion, as well as suggestions for a simplification of indicator systems in order to minimise the input needed for data recording.

AB The challenge of finding applicable indicators for sustainable agriculture requires evaluations at regional scales to lead to policy-relevant results. In this study, the regional diversity of temporary wetland carabid beetles was analysed for six landscapes of 10 km(2) each. The relative importance of landscape features and cultivation intensity for the regional diversity was compared. Total species richness was correlated with the mean soil-indices that were used as indicators of cultivation intensity. This is consistent with studies on local scales, which emphasise the importance of cultivation intensity for arthropod communities. The diversity of wetland and habitat-specific species correlated with the temporary wetlands mean duration of flooding and the density of temporary wetlands, but apart from this, there was no impact of landscape features on diversity. These results do not corroborate concepts of using indices of landscape structure as biodiversity indicators, but the importance of cultivation intensity cannot be too strongly emphasised.

AB Diversity of insect communities in grasslands is often negatively correlated with management intensity. Targets of sustainable husbandry practices in agricultural systems should include the conservation of insects highly specific to certain types of grassland. In general, Auchenorrhyncha can be regarded as suitable indicators of biotic conditions in grasslands because (i) their response to management, like cutting, grazing and fertilizing, is strong and immediate, (ii) quantitative and semiquantitative sampling is relatively easy, (iii) their abundance and species numbers in grasslands are usually high, and (iv) they show different life strategies ranging from polyphagous pioneer species to strictly monophagous specialists.
   This study was conducted in the floodplains of the middle course of the Elbe river (northern Germany). Its purpose was (i) a survey of local Auchenorrhyncha communities and their responses to different grassland management regimes, and (ii) a study of their suitability as indicators of habitat disturbance, particularly in comparison to plant communities. Samples were taken with the sweepnet in 1999, and with a suction apparatus in 2000. The plots included 25 sites in meadows, pastures and fallows. Altogether, 88 species were recorded. Regarding the distribution of generalist species, differences between plots being subject to high-intensity management and those being subject to low-intensity management were little pronounced. However, most plots of low-intensity pastures and fallows showed higher numbers and higher proportions of specialists. In late spring, suction sampling produced higher individual numbers in low-intensity sites. Moreover, diversity in high-intensity sites was reduced, with generalists dominating. We discuss different responses of plant and animal communities on grassland management and propose species numbers and proportion of both pioneer species and specialists as robust indicators of biotic conditions in grasslands. Furthermore, we make proposals for a future land use management of flood plain grasslands. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB It is investigated, whether the arable weed vegetation can perform as a characteristic to stimulate sustainable development of agriculture in Central Europe. The concept of sustainable development represents a dynamic process, influenced by ecological, economic and social aspects. Characteristics are required to integrate desired ecological aspects into farming concepts, in order to stimulate production systems which add to a sustainable development of the sector. The investigations rely on data of an arable farming system experiment (INTEX). Three farming systems called good-farming-practice (GFP), integrated-flexible and integrated-non-inversion were established from 1994 to 1998 on two sites. The systems differed in crop rotation, soil tillage, fertilisation and pesticide use. Thus, weed management comprised Cultural or indirect control by plant husbandry and direct mechanical and chemical control. A residual weed vegetation after terminating all direct control in the arable crops was ex-ante intended in the integrated systems.
   The spring weed densities were observed in winter wheat previous to any direct control treatments. The residual weed vegetation was investigated in all crops by monitoring species numbers and total ground cover after terminating all direct control.
   The direct chemical control intensity was considerably lower in the integrated farming system, in which the crop rotation was extended and the soil was ploughed annually. Spring densities of problematic weeds like annual grass weeds and Galium aparine in the winter wheat crop were not higher in these systems.
   Higher covers of the residual weed vegetation Occurred more often in the productive arable crops of the two integrated farming systems, which additionally hosted higher number of species after terminating direct control. The different system strategies, including a higher input of herbicides in the system integrated-non-inversion, averted severe problems, including those arising from the dominating species being generally problematic in arable land use.

AB In this paper the effects of precision farming were compared to conventional agricultural management estimating bacterial and fungal diversity and also microbial processes in the nitrogen cycle during the vegetation period of maize. The aim was to find parameters which can be used as indicators for sustainable soil quality. Two plots, a high yield and a low yield site, were selected in the two systems. It could be demonstrated that the microbial biomass and community structure of bacteria and fungi in the top soils were not influenced by precision farming. Microbial biomass was reduced during the summer month, due to the dryness and hot temperatures. The microbial community structure changed in late spring time probably due to the application of fertilizers and high amounts of root exudates in the rhizosphere.
   The measured enzymatic activities however did not show only a seasonal variation with the highest measured values in spring and early summer, but also clear effects based on the investigated plot (high yield or low yield) and the used farming management system (conventional or precision). Proteolytic activity was significantly higher on the high yield plots at all measured times. Mainly on the low yield sites precision farming caused a higher proteolytic activity compared to the conventional management. Nitrification and denitrification activities were mainly effected after the application of N-fertilizer. Significant higher values were found on the low yield plots, where conventional farming was applied. The results indicate that the effectiveness of nitrogen turnover might be a good indicator for sustainable agriculture and soil quality. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Sustainable conservation management in cultivated landscapes urgently needs indicators that provide quantitative links between landscape patterns and biodiversity. As a contribution to this aim, the influence of the matrix surrounding managed grassland sites on species richness of ants, wild bees and vascular plants was investigated at two different scales (50 and 200 m radius). In addition, patch variables describing habitat quality were included in the analyses. Species richness of the three taxa was not significantly inter-correlated. Multiple linear regression analysis revealed significant predictor variables for the species richness of the different taxa at both matrix scales. The variation of the matrix radius had no impact on the variance explanation of the regression models. The degree of variance explained by the regression models varied between taxa (bees > plants > ants). Moreover, the predictive variables were different for the taxa, with the regression model for wild bees including both patch and matrix variables, that for plants richness including patch variables only, and that for ants including matrix variables only. We conclude that landscape diversity and percentage cover of certain land-use types might serve as useful indicators for species richness at the landscape scale. However, the specific response patterns revealed in our study suggest that a variety of taxa must be included in this type of approach. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

   planning; agri-environment program
AB Indicators in the field of bio-diversity and landscape are applied on various levels, including the continental field as well as the individual agricultural enterprise. Apart from the ecological evaluation of agricultural enterprises and agrarian policy measures, indicators are also used in environmental reporting and evaluation as well as in planning or simulation models in administrative and scientific fields. Already for longer period of time, indicators have been used as assessment criteria in landscape planning to support decisions regarding land use. Due to the standards the EU commission requires from the member states in this regard, the application of indicators to assess the effects of agri-environment programs have gained prominence. The EU requires proof of the achievement of the promotion aims such as soil (erosion, nutrients, plant-protective agents), water, bio-diversity and landscape (EU/VO 12004/00).
   This commitment can be met by means of a functioning environmental reporting. However, only an insufficient number of suitable indicators exist in the fields of bio-diversity and landscape. In a bottom-up approach, control systems to assess ecological farming achieved on an operational level for a future development were recently developed. Here, a future development is seen in the alignment referring to results or goals, respectively, and in the regionalisation. The article gives an overview of the indicator application on different spatial levels and for different purposes. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

   nature balance
ID BIODIVERSITY
AB Farming needs more and more support in society to get further subsidies. This will only be possible when the ecological benefit can be proved. Up to now a method to measure biodiversity and ecological benefit of farms is missing.
   In the state of Baden-Wurttemberg (Germany), farmers and agri-environment experts have worked together to devise schemes to record the ecological richness and benefits of farms, especially in the field of biodiversity and cultural landscape issues. The scheme uses 47 different indicators divided into four sectors, biodiversity-structural richness, biodiversity-species richness, farm management, and field management (farming methods). Farmers can perform the assessment themselves, on average sized farms in Southwest Germany one working day may be sufficient. After assessing the ecological situation of the farm an evaluation can easily be made in form of a nature balance scheme. The presented nature balance scheme is based on a 100-point target system revealing ecological benefits as well as shortcomings of the farms.
   The paper presents results after applying the method to 16 farms in different natural environments and especially the case study Gengenbach (10 farms). Four out of 10 farms achieved the target of 100 points and thus it could be stated that they manage a sustainable agriculture in the sense of biodiversity and environmental sound farming. The results are encouraging because they show that the method works well and farmers become aware of the ecological situation of their farms. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

DT Article
DE economic value; ecological value; economic modelling; landscape model;
   ecological indicator; economic indicator
AB This article deals with the interrelation of ecological and economic aspects through the use of indicators. Two aspects are painted out: the first being the measurement of the economic value of ecological services, and the second being the integration of economic aspects into comprehensive indicator systems.
   The measurement of the economic value provides a means of determining consumer-orientated values of landscapes and bio-diversity issues. This measurement, however, is viewed critically by some, especially in nature conservancy circles. For them the intrinsic values of a landscape, which cannot be measured in economic terms, play the central role in the assessment of landscapes [Oekonomische Bewertungsgrundlagen und die Grenzen einer 'Monetarisierung' der Natur. In: Theobald, W. (Ed.), Integrative Umweltbewertung. Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg, pp.95-117]. On the other hand, Braeuers [Money as an indicator: to make use of economic evaluation for biodiversity conservation. In: Buechs, W. (Ed.), Biotic Indicators for Biodiversity and Sustainable Agriculture. Agric. Ecosys. Environ.], whose article presents an overview of current economic assessment methods, provides an alternate point of view. Braeuer [Money as an indicator: to make use of economic evaluation for biodiversity conservation. In: Buechs, W. (Ed.), Biotic Indicators for Biodiversity and Sustainable Agriculture. Agric. Ecosyst. Environ.] argues that through the inclusion of monetary values into the assessment process the whole issue can remain on a factual level. The article by Gerowitt et al. [Rewards for ecological goods-requirements and perspectives for agricultural land use. In: Buechs, W. (Ed.), Biotic Indicators for Biodiversity and Sustainable Agriculture. Agric. Ecosyst. Environ.] even goes further and suggests that a market oriented system be implemented for environmental goods.
   In contrast to the subjective measurement of economic value, land use models are based on "objective" expertise. Aim of the articles in this sector is to analyse the enhancement of scientific models by economic aspects. These models would then be used to verify the feasibility of ecological motivated land use claims. The results would form the basis for political decision making by a society. The model of Meyer-Aurich and Zander [Consideration of biotic environmental quality targets in agricultural land use-a case study from the biosphere reserve Schorfheide-Chorin. In: Buechs, W (Ed.), Biotic Indicators for Biodiversity and Sustainable Agriculture. Agric. Ecosyst. Environ.] reviews land use decision making on the operational level, while the model of Herrmann et al. [Threshold values for nature protection areas as indicators for bio-diversity-a regional evaluation of economic and ecological consequences. In: Buechs, W. (Ed.), Biotic Indicators for Biodiversity and Sustainable Agriculture. Agric. Ecosyst. Environ.] reviews decision making at a regional level. The concluding article by Kantelhardt et al. [Is there a reliable correlation between hedgerow density and agricultural site conditions? In: Buechs, W. (Ed.), Biotic Indicators for Biodiversity and Sustainable Agriculture. Agric. Ecosyst. Environ.] attempts to correlate selected different economic and ecological indicators. The key issue here being how farmers can be compensated for the conservation and preservation of landscapes.

TI Effect of soil solarization and goat manure amendment on weed control
   and muskmelon yield (Cucumis melo L.)
SO AGROCHIMICA
LA English
DT Article
ID OROBANCHE-CRENATA
AB The effect of soil solarization during 30 days (June 13 to July 13) and the amendment with goat manure to the soil at the rate of 0, 20 and 40 t ha(-1) was studied; the objective of this experiment was to increase soil temperature in order to evaluate its effect on weeds population and on muskmelon yield. Solarization produced maximum soil temperatures of 55 degreesC and 44 degreesC at the depth of 1.5 and 10 cm respectively, which in turn dramatically reduced the emergence and growth of weeds in the solarized plots. Goat manure only increased soil temperature by 1.5 to 2.5 degreesC, but it had an antagonist effect on weeds density, however, this effect was not clear on solarized plots. Perennial weeds like Cyperus esculentus was affected but not eliminated by solarization. The effect of high soil temperatures on weed control was reflected in higher muskmelon yield of solarized treatments, meanwhile, yield of non-solarized plots without the amendment was significantly reduced, reporting 11.63 t ha(-1) compared to almost 30 t h(-1) of solarized treatments amended with goat manure. Yield of control non-solarized plots was significantly increased by goat manure, because with 20 and 40 t ha(-1), it was improved by 7.36 and 14.05 t ha(-1) respectively. We concluded that soil solarization and organic fertilization with goat manure, and not their interaction, can be a sustainable alternative to methyl bromide fumigation or to the use of herbicides for weed control, and for increasing muskmelon yield.

AB Rice (Oryza sativa L.) demand in West Africa is unmet because of insufficient production. Legume fixed N [biological N fixation (BNF)] may sustainably increase rice productivity in low-input systems. However, P deficiency limits BNF on the acid soils encountered in the region, despite the prevalence of phosphate rock (PR). Pot and field experiments were conducted in Cote d'Ivoire in 1996-1998 to study the impact of combined legume and PR on rice performance. Triple superphosphate and PR were applied at rates of 60 (pot) and at 90 (field) kg P ha(-1) to rice and the legume Aeschynomene afraspera grown for 8 wk and then incorporated before rice transplanting. Legume fixed N was determined by N-15 isotope dilution. Under field conditions, addition of PR doubled the biomass of A. afraspera. Irrespective of P source, P application increased the amount of BNF-N (three- to eightfold) to 36 mg N plant(-1) in pots and to 84 kg N ha(-1) in the field. Nitrogen derived from the air was correlated with legume P uptake (r = 0.97***, where *** = significant at the 0.001 level) and nodulation (r = 0.91**, where ** = significant at the 0.01 level). The synergy of PR and BNF on N and P cycling improved P nutrition and total biomass of subsequent lowland rice under pot conditions. Combining legume green manure (GM) with PR enhanced soil extractable Bray-1 P and may thus play an important role in improving the availability of PR. Under field conditions, due to asynchrony in GM nutrient release and demand, the impact of the combined GM-PR treatment on rice yield was minimal.

AB In a world increasingly modified by human activities, the conservation of biodiversity is essential as insurance to maintain resilient ecosystems and ensure a sustainable flow of ecosystem goods and services to society. However, existing reserves and national parks are unlikely to incorporate the long-term and large-scale dynamics of ecosystems. Hence, conservation strategies have to actively incorporate the large areas of land that are managed for human use. For ecosystems to reorganize after large-scale natural and human-induced disturbances, spatial resilience in the form of ecological memory is a prerequisite. The ecological memory is composed of the species, interactions and structures that make ecosystem reorganization possible, and its components may be found within disturbed patches as well in the surrounding landscape. Present static reserves should be complemented with dynamic reserves, such as ecological fallows and dynamic successional reserves, that are part of ecosystem management mimicking natural disturbance regimes at the landscape level.

AB During the last decade, several well-publicized grazing-related incidents of vegetation degradation have helped to form an official opinion of overutilization of some mountain areas and a concern that Swedish reindeer husbandry may not be ecologically sustainable. We examine these examples in a temporal and management perspective to assess the scale of impact on summer grazing grounds in the Swedish mountains. Long-term data on population dynamics of reindeer show no trend with fluctuations around 225 000 animals for the last century. Data on grazing effects from Langfjallet (Dalarna) and Mittaklappen (Harjedalen) are discussed in detail. We compare these data to the situation in Finnmark, Norway, and in northern Finland where reindeer husbandry in recent decades does not seem to have been ecologically sustainable. We conclude that large-scale overexploitation by reindeer in the Swedish mountains is not evident. However, strong grazing and trampling effects may be found around enclosures and fences.

AB The 1999 severe crop season drought in the northeastern US was followed by hurricane-driven torrential rains in September, offering a unique opportunity to observe how managed and natural systems respond to climate-related stress. The Rodale Institute Farming Systems Trial has been operating since 1981 and consists of three replicated cropping systems, one organic manure based (MNR), one organic legume based (LEG) and a conventional system (CNV). The MNR system consists of a 5-year maize-soybean-wheat-clover/hay rotation, the LEG of a 3-year maize-soybean-wheat-green manure, and the CNV of a 5-year maize-soybean rotation. Subsoil lysimeters allowed quantification of percolated water in each system. Average maize and soybean yields were similar in all three systems over the post-transition years (1985-1998). Five drought years occurred between 1984 and 1998 and in four of them the organic maize outyielded the CNV by significant margins. In 1999 all crop systems suffered severe yield depressions; however, there were substantial yield differences between systems. Organic maize yielded 38% and 137% relative to CNV in the LEG and MNR treatments, respectively, and 196% and 152% relative to CNV in the soybean plots. The primary mechanism of the higher yield of the MNR and LEG is proposed to be the higher water-holding capacity of the soils in those treatments, while the lower yield of the LEG maize was due to weed competition in that particular year and treatment. Soils in the organic plots captured more water and retained more of it in the crop root zone than in the CNV treatment. Water capture in the organic plots was approximately 100% higher than in CNV plots during September's torrential rains.

AB The expansion of organic farming has taken off in the European Union and particularly in Austria, where 9% of farmland is certified organic. The main reasons for this development are subsidies and cooperation with supermarket chains. In Austria, many organic farms are located in the mountainous areas, while lowlands with arable cropping have fewer organic farms than the national average. Exploring two regions as case studies, this paper investigates whether the organic farming movement can keep its promises of environmental safety, economic viability and social justice. There is a high level of environmental concern among those who practice organic farming, but local differences are large. It is the individual farmer who determines whether environmental issues beyond the official organic regulations are considered. The economic situation for organic farms is positive due to the financial support from the government and cooperation with supermarket chains, but processing and marketing operations are still lacking for organic products. Regarding social justice, organic farming enjoys a high esteem among consumers, but relations and cooperation between organic and conventional farm sectors is poor. We conclude that it is crucial for the organic movement to focus on qualitative issues rather than quantitative expansion for further sound development of organic farming in Austria.

AB Background: One potentially sustainable approach to improving iron status at the community level is to encourage the consumption of local ascorbic acid-rich foods, in conjunction with meals high in nonheme iron.
   Objective: The study, conducted in rural Mexico, measured stable isotopes of iron to evaluate the effect on iron absorption of the addition of 25 mg ascorbic acid as agua de limon (limeade) to 2 typical meals per day for 2 wk.
   Design: Fifteen nonpregnant, nonlactating, iron-deficient (ferritin < 12 mug/L) women ((x) over bar +/- SD age: 28.3 +/- 7.7 y) fasted overnight and were brought to a community clinic. After an initial blood sample, subjects consumed 0.25 mg Fe-57 with both breakfast and lunch for 14 d. On day 29, another blood sample was taken, and a reference dose of 2.7 mg Fe-58 with 25 mg ascorbic acid was given. For the following 15 d, participants consumed 0.25 mg Fe-57 added to both breakfast and lunch with 25 mg ascorbic acid added to each meal as limeade. A final blood sample was taken on day 59.
   Results: Iron absorption was calculated from recovery of isotopes in blood obtained 14 d after administration of each isotope. When 25 mg ascorbic acid as limeade was added to test meals twice a day for 2 wk, iron absorption increased significantly (P < 0.001) in every subject: the mean absorption rose from 6.6 +/- 3.0% to 22.9 +/- 12.6%.
   Conclusions: The consumption of 25 mg ascorbic acid as limeade twice daily with meals substantially improved iron absorption and may improve the iron status of nonpregnant, nonlactating, iron-deficient women.

AB Nutrition ecology is an interdisciplinary scientific discipline that encompasses the entire nutrition system, with special consideration of the effects of nutrition on health, the environment, society, and the economy. Nutrition ecology involves all components of the food chain, including production, harvesting, preservation, storage, transport, processing, packaging, trade. distribution, preparation, composition, and consumption of food. as well as disposal of waste materials. Nutrition ecology has numerous origins, some of which go back to antiquity. The introduction of industrialized agriculture and mass animal production gave rise to various negative influences on the environment and health. Food quality is determined in part by the quality of the environment. The environment, in turn, is influenced by food consumption habits. Research shows that vegetarian diets are well suited to protect the environment, to reduce pollution, and to minimize global climate changes. To maximize the ecologic and health benefits of vegetarian diets, food should be regionally produced, seasonally consumed, and organically grown. Vegetarian diets built on these conditions are scientifically based, socially acceptable, economically feasible, culturally desired, sufficiently practicable, and quite sustainable.

AB Worldwide, an estimated 2 billion people live primarily on a meat-based diet, while an estimated 4 billion live primarily on a plant-based diet. The US food production system uses about 50% of the total US land area, 80% of the fresh water, and 17% of the fossil energy used in the country. The heavy dependence on fossil energy suggests that the US food system, whether meat-based or plant-based, is not sustainable. The use of land and energy resources devoted to an average meat-based diet compared with a lactoovovegetarian (plant-based) diet is analyzed in this report. In both diets, the daily quantity of calories consumed are kept constant at about 3533 kcal per person. The meat-based food system requires more energy, land, and water resources than the lactoovovegetarian diet. In this limited sense, the lactoovovegetarian diet is more sustainable than the average American meat-based diet.

ID ANIMAL PRODUCTION; ENERGY; SUSTAINABILITY
AB Quantitative environmental evaluations of meat, fresh vegetables, and processed protein based on soybeans suggest that the environmental burden of vegetarian foods is usually relatively low when production and processing are considered. The environmental comparison of cheese varieties made from cow milk and directly from lupine and the evaluation of energy inputs in fish protein and vegetable protein also suggest an environmental advantage for vegetarian food.
   In the evaluation of processed protein food based on soybeans and meat protein, a variety of environmental impacts associated with primary production and processing are a factor 4.4-> 100 to the disadvantage of meat. The comparison of cheese varieties gives differences in specific environmental impacts ranging between a factor 5 and 21. And energy use for fish protein may be up to a factor 14 more than for protein of vegetable origin. Assessment suggests that on average the complete life cycle environmental impact of nonvegetarian meals may be roughly a factor 1.5-2 higher than the effect of vegetarian meals in which meat has been replaced by vegetable protein. Although on average vegetarian diets may well have an environmental advantage, exceptions may also occur. Long-distance air transport, deep-freezing, and some horticultural practices may lead to environmental burdens for vegetarian foods exceeding those for locally produced organic meat.

AB Mounting evidence suggests physical and mental health problems relate to the built environment, including human-modified places such as homes, schools, workplaces, parks, industrial areas, farms, roads and highways. The public health relevance of the built environment requires examination.
   Preliminary research demonstrates the health benefits of sustainable communities. However, the impact of mediating and moderating factors within the built environment on health must be explored further. Given the complexity of the built environment, understanding its influence on human health requires a community-based, multilevel, interdisciplinary research approach.
   The authors offer recommendations, based upon a recent conference sponsored by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS), for research and policy approaches, and suggest interagency research alliances for greater public health impact.

AB The quality of our indoor environments affects well-being and productivity, and risks for diverse diseases are increased by indoor air pollutants, surface contamination with toxins and microbes, and contact among people at home, at work, in transportation, and in many other public and private places.
   We offer an overview of nearly a century of research directed at understanding indoor environments and health, consider current research needs, and set out policy matters that need to be addressed if we are to have the healthiest possible built environments. The policy context for built environments extends beyond health considerations to include energy use for air-conditioning, selection of materials for sustainability, and design for safety, security, and productivity.

AB This paper presents some of the problems in the Latvian energy-system, the Latvian economy and how a sustainable restructuring of the energy system with renewable energy, co-generation and the production of energy technology can help solve some of the problems. Latvia has economic growth but a negative trade-balance. With this in mind, it is important that Latvia is able to meet the challenge and use the economic development to develop a sustainable energy-system and a sounder trade-balance. A combination of energy planning, national economy and innovation processes in boiler companies will form the reflective approach of this paper to the future of energy supplies in Latvia.

AB This paper presents the work developed under the framework of a research project "Transition Scheme through a Sustainable-Energy System in Sahelian Countries". The project ran between 1997 and 2001, involved several European Union and African entities and was coordinated by the New University of Lisbon. It was financed by the Research Directorate under the framework of INCO DC Programme. The researchers were trying to answer a multiplicity of questions and to find realistic solutions for the transitional period for one of the most problematic regions of the World, namely the Sahel Region. The present paper intends to highlight some of the aspects related to the energy affordability, e.g. income, spending, indirect costs of energy, and energy subsidies that have been revealed during the study. It considers "customer-sustainable" and "customer-affordable" energy structures and proposes measures for energy-affordability enhancement. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

DE international energy standards; complete energy matrix
AB International standards are playing a crucially important role in all industries for rational production, international terminologies, safety and health protection, measurement, analysis, quality control and environmental protection, particularly in the energy field, where standards for the interfaces in energy flows are indispensable, such as electric connectors, fuelling devices, calibration methods and electrical safety. Of particular significance is the SI system of units and the OSI standards which allow the world-wide harmonization of data exchanges and computers. International standardization is shared between the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) for all non-electric matters, founded just after World War II as the successor to ISA and the much older International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) both based in Geneva, Switzerland, in the same building. Besides the specific standards for petroleum, coal, nuclear and hydro-power, solar energy, wind-power, hydrogen and the vast field of electricity, the energy standards series ISO 13600 allows the characterization, analysis and comparison of all energy systems and soon will issue a global energy statistics and planning matrix for the transition to environmentally-sound sustainable economics. These standards allow integrated resource planning, including all new renewable options, such as the increasingly important direct and indirect solar energy, co-generation, hybrid systems, small decentralized units, bio-energy, ambient temperature use by heat pumps and substitutions of muscle-powered systems or vice versa, besides the more efficient production and use of conventional finite and renewable energy-sources.

DE feasibility studies; energy planning; energy economics
AB Identification of political objectives is a very important part of making feasibility studies. Very often. energy projects are evaluated against narrow energy-sector objectives, such as securing "a sufficient energy supply" and/or securing "reasonable energy prices". Established technologies using fossil fuels are chosen, while new technologies with less pollution are regarded too risky or too expensive. Meanwhile, most countries have a number of important national objectives beside the energy sector, such as "decreasing imports", "creating better employment", "development of new products for export," etc. Very often, such objectives are not directly included in feasibility studies of energy projects, even though new technologies are likely to fulfil these objectives better than many established technologies. Based upon the case of a planned new 1400 MW coal-fired power station in Prachuap Khiri Khan in Thailand, this paper performs a feasibility study, in which a power-plant project and a proposed technical alternative are assessed in relation to a wide range of specific and general official development objectives for Thailand. The current plans of implementing a coal-fired power plant at Prachuap Khiri Khan is indeed not rational and alternatives exist, which are more suitable for Thailand in terms of economic growth, employment, rural development, industrial development and environmental sustainability.

AB The liberalisation of electric-power markets has mixed implications for the upkeep of environmental policies. A further regulatory completion of the liberalisation of electric-power markets within a sound social-economic and sustainability setting requires steps that incite the introduction of capacity-scarcity signals (e.g. ToD pricing) in the retail-pricing structure. As a consequence, efforts for environmentally-benign conversion options and energy efficiency will go up. A great challenge connected with this step is the rearrangement of risk-assessment practices and the handling of risks. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The concept of sustainable economic development, parallel to a further improvement in the quality of life, conflicts with energy-driven changes in life-styles. In order to gain time, convenience, comfort and mobility, households are steadily increasing their energy use, neglecting economic and environmental concerns. This paper scrutinises Norwegian households' use of energy and the consequences of price (and climate) changes. Less well-off households were found vulnerable to energy-price hikes: households' attitudes towards energy use and their actual behaviour were inconsistent. Any measures to curb end-users energy demand must consider, besides distribution effects, that energy substitutes not only for capital and labour, but also for time and space.

AB Energy consumption in the residential and tertiary sectors is especially high in developed countries. There is a great potential for energy savings in these sectors. Energy conservation measures are developed for newly constructed buildings and for buildings under refurbishment. However, to achieve a significant reduction in energy consumption apart from the standard energy-efficiency methods, innovative technologies should be implemented, including renewable energy. Coherency of standard, modern energy efficiency and renewable options becomes necessities. To approach the idea of sustainable buildings, a few developmental steps are needed, regarding energy, water, land and material conservation, together with environmental loading, and the qualities of the indoor and outdoor environments.

AB 1. Forest restoration through silviculture (gardening) programs revives productivity, biodiversity, and stability. As in silviculture approaches, the coral 'gardening' strategy is based on a two-step protocol.
   2. The first step deals with the establishment of in situ and/or ex situ coral nurseries in which corals are farmed (originating from two types of source material: asexual [ramets, nubbins], and sexual [planula larvae, spat] recruits).
   3. The second is the reef rehabilitation step, where maricultured colonies are transplanted into degraded sites.
   4. We compare here the rationale of forest restoration to coral reef ecosystem restoration by evaluating major key criteria. As in silviculture programs, a sustainable mariculture operation that focuses on the prime structural component of the reef ('gardening' with corals) may promote the persistence of threatened coral populations, as well as that of other reef taxa, thus maintaining genetic diversity. In chronically degrading reef sites this may facilitate a halt in biodiversity depletion.
   5. Within the current theoretical framework of ecosystem restoration, the recovery of biodiversity indices is considered a core element since a rich species diversity provides higher ecosystem resilience to disturbances.
   6. The gardening measure may also be implemented worldwide, eliminating the need to extract existing colonies for transplantation operations. At degraded reef sites, the coral gardening strategy can assist in managing human and non-human stakeholders' requirements as is done in forest management. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

AB 1. River restoration is now widely undertaken and may be considered an increasingly important aspect of river management. Recent developments in European legislation (Habitats Directive and the Water Framework Directive) should give further impetus to river restoration across EU member states, as this legislation places greater emphasis on the processes that support river ecology.
   2. Traditional river restoration approaches have been reach-focused and opportunistic, capitalizing on flood defence works and the cooperation of sympathetic landowners.
   3. Furthermore, many schemes have been species- or habitat-driven and, thus, have sought to recreate channel forms believed to be favoured by particular species or associated with particular habitats. Such approaches have not always given due attention to the underlying geomorphological processes that create channel form and, consequently, the schemes have not been self-sustaining, requiring continued management input.
   4. Consistent with the ethos of the Water Framework Directive, an eco-hydromorphic approach to river restoration is proposed here. This approach views spatial and temporal heterogeneity as fundamental characteristics of fluvial systems and advocates recreating a framework within which natural processes, such as sediment transport and nutrient dynamics, can occur.
   5. Mesoscale habitat approaches are considered as one possible way to plan and achieve this framework, providing the potential to link the wide range of spatial and temporal scales that characterize river systems.
   6. It is argued that river restoration will only be sustainable if it is undertaken within a process-driven and strategic framework with inputs from a wide range of specialists. Such an approach needs to be reviewed constantly in light of appraisal and monitoring of previous river restoration schemes. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

AB Policymakers are becoming increasingly interested in the means by which individuals can be encouraged to engage in environmental actions around the home. This paper uses evidence from existing empirical research and a large questionnaire Survey undertaken by the author to argue that environmental action is open to a range of influences, focusing especially on environmental Values, Situational characteristics and psychological variables. Accordingly, the paper asserts that strategies for promoting environmentally responsible behaviours (such as energy saving, water conservation and waste recycling) should take account of these factors. The implications for the study of environmental behaviour are considered.

AB A recent development in the assurance services profession is the emergence of engagements on a broad range of subject matter that are designed to provide a moderate level of assurance. A significant issue for the profession is how to convey to users the limited extent of the assurance provided by such engagements. This study identifies four main categories of moderate assurance reporting forms (opinion on procedures, negative assurance, positive assurance, positive assurance with a limitations paragraph) being used in practice worldwide for providing assurance on environmental and sustainability reports. It examines whether these four reporting forms convey a lower level of assurance than that provided by a traditional high assurance report, and whether these reporting formats lead to significantly different levels of assurance perceived by a group of 792 shareholders. The findings indicate that users perceive that these moderate assurance reporting formats generally provide a lower level of assurance than that provided by a high assurance report. However, one significant difference was found between the four types of moderate assurance reports, with the opinion on procedures format providing higher assurance than the positive assurance with a limitations paragraph format. Implications for policy makers in their deliberations on assurance report wording in relation to moderate assurance engagements are considered.

AB The rapid development of the economy and urbanization create great pressure on population of Hong Kong, China and other developing countries. This not only brings great changes on the form and style of the urban sphere, but also, challenges to the natural environment and resources to support urban habitation. Regarding the process of urbanization, the development of the housing industry becomes the focus to resolve the need of materialization for urban living. For this reason, from time to time, technical and economical considerations are always prior to the significance of human settlement environment, humanity, and sustainable development. Considering the deficiency in urban human settlements environment, especially in responsiveness to the natural environment. Information technology (IT) undoubtedly can help to promote and assess the design and planning quality in both environmental and regional microenvironment aspects. A research project-Environmental Responsible Architecture and Urban Design (ERAU)-is established to support urban scale planning, information processing, and computer-aided performance evaluation on both micro- and macro-building design and planning efficiency.

ID EVAPOTRANSPIRATION; WEEDS
AB Azolla filiculoides (red waterfern) is a floating fern native to South America which has invaded aquatic ecosystems in South Africa. Thick mats of A. filiculoides on dams and slow-moving water bodies cause economic losses to water-users. Affected water-users were surveyed using a questionnaire to assess the importance of the weed. Among those most seriously affected were farming (71%), recreational (24%), and municipal (5%) users. The average water area covered by A. filiculoides (per water-user) was 2.17 ha, with an expansion rate of 1.33 ha per year. The frond-feeding weevil Stenopelmus rufinasus was released as a biological control agent at the end of 1997. Within 3 years, the weevil had reduced the weed population to the point that it was no longer considered a problem in South Africa. Based on year 2000 data, the cost savings (per user per hectare) resulting from the biological control program included a reduction of on-site damages caused by the weed to the value of US$589 per hectare per year. The average cost per hectare per year for the biological control program for the period 1995-2000 amounted to US$278, excluding investment costs of USD$7700 in 1995. These historic costs and benefits were adjusted to constant year 2000 values. The predicted spread of the weed was calculated on the basis of a sigmoid-curve rate of spread model. The net present value (NPV) of the program was calculated from 1995 onwards and discounted at 8%. This resulted in a NPV of US$1093 per hectare and US$206 million for South Africa as a whole. For the year 2000, the benefit-cost ratio was calculated at 2.5:1, increasing rapidly to 13:1 in 2005, and 15:1 in 2010 as the costs of the biological control program are expected to decrease. These indicators reinforce the overall economic viability of biological control, but do not necessarily confirm the viability of biological control on each management unit itself. The results reflect the dynamics of biological control on site-specific survey information, and place higher benefit-cost ratios achieved in other national level studies in a better context. It also raises the important policy question of who is responsible to finance such control programs in future, because on-site benefits of control are enough to justify the program in its own right. The paper concludes with recommendations on a financial mechanism to address biological control of invasive species in a sustainable manner. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science (USA). All rights reserved.

AB Toward the development of an in vitro cultivation of marine sponge cells for sustainable production of bioactive metabolites, the attachment characteristics of marine sponge cells of Hymeniacidon perleve on three types of microcarriers, Hillex, Cytodex 3, and glass beads, were studied. Mixed cell population and enriched cell fractions of specific cell types by Ficoll gradient centrifugation (6%/8%/15%/20%) were also assessed. Cell attachment ratio (defined as the ratio of cells attached on microcarrier to the total number of cells in the culture) on glass beads is much higher than that on Cytodex 3 and Hillex for both mixed cell population and cell fraction at Ficoll 15-20% interface. The highest attachment ratio of 41% was obtained for the cell fraction at Ficoll 15-20% interface on glass beads, which was significantly higher than that of a mixed cell population (18%). The attachment kinetics on glass beads indicated that the attachment was completed within 1 h. Cell attachment ratio decreases with increase in cell-to-microcarrier ratio (3-30 cells/bead) and pH (7.6-9.0). The addition of serum and BSA (bovine serum albumin) reduced the cell attachment on glass beads.

AB Native Aspen Parkland landscapes consist of a complex mosaic of plant communities, including riparian meadows, upland grasslands, and forests. Sustainable livestock production in this environment depends on an understanding of livestock grazing behavior among communities, particularly under contemporary, intensive management rotational grazing systems. This study examined seasonal patterns of absolute (kg(.)ha(-1)) and relative (%) herbage utilization, as well as plant community visitation, across a Parkland landscape by 150 heifers in two rotations of a high-intensity, low-frequency grazing system. Graminoids constituted more than 92% of the total herbage utilized. Absolute graminoid utilization within each grazing period was greater (P < 0.05) throughout the growing season from riparian meadows (2003 to 2114 kg(.)ha(-1)) than from upland grasslands (762 to 1041 kg(.)ha(-1)) or forests (782 to 800 kg(.)ha(-1)). In contrast, relative graminoid utilization remained similar (P > 0.05) among communities in either rotation, suggesting heifers grazed in proportion to graminoid availability (57-61% in first rotation, 44-54% in second rotation). Although riparian meadows represented a small fraction of the landscape (-4%), and provided up to 9.5% of the total forage used, the majority of herbage removal at the paddock level continued to originate from upland grasslands and forests. Patterns of visitation indicated heifers initially visited riparian meadows more often within each 3-4 day grazing period, regardless of entry date. While upland grasslands were least visited in June, forests were least visited in August. Based on these utilization and visitation patterns, we discuss the implications of using high-density, rotational livestock grazing for the sustainable management of Aspen Parkland rangelands.

ID REDEFINING SECURITY; NATIONAL-SECURITY
AB Despite contentious debates within the field of environmental security, findings of the principal research projects undertaken in the 1990s suggest significant agreement about the process linking environmental change to conflict. This article offers a reconsideration of the theoretical arguments unifying much of the research in environmental security, and argues that cases must extend their time frames considerably. The authors suggest that this would improve understanding of the social effects of environmental change, but is likely to revise mainstream arguments connecting environment and security in dramatic ways. By focusing on the often neglected role played by adaptive mechanisms, longer-range case studies tend not to support the claim that environmental stress is, an urgent security issue, viewing it instead as an issue with long-term theoretical and policy relevance to those concerned not only with security, but also with sustainable development and environmental justice.

AB With the ever-increasing urban population and economic activities, water usage and demand are continuously increasing. Hence, finding/re-creating adequate water supply and fully utilizing wastewater become important issues in sustainable urban development and environmental benign aspect. Considering Hong Kong's situation, e.g., lack of natural fresh water, domination of municipal wastewater, etc., developing wastewater reclamation and reuse system is of specific significance to exploit new water resource and save natural fresh water supplied from Mainland China. We propose and have carried out some preliminary studies on the potential of categorizing municipal wastewater, developing grey and storm water recycling system in public housing estate, investigating the feasibility and potential of using reclaimed grey water, etc. Since there is very limited experience in grey water recycling, such initial studies can help to understand and increase knowledge in utilizing grey water, to foresee the feasibility of developing new water resource, to estimate the cost-effectiveness of reclaiming grey water in metropolitan city.

   functions; indirect use value
AB Direct use values of forest ecosystem have been recognized apparently due to its easy and convenient assessment, while indirect use values are usually neglected because they are not easy to be recognized by the public. For a nature reserve with forest ecosystem, the most important economic values are the indirect use values, which provide human beings and other living things with beneficial services through ecological processes and functions. In this case study, a quantifying framework to estimate the annual indirect use values of forest ecosystem has been established in Yaoluoping National Nature Reserve based on alternative cost method and opportunity cost method. The ecological functions assessed in the study relate to six aspects: soil protection, water conservation, CO(2) fixation, nutrient cycling, pollutant decomposition and disease and pest control. These ecological functions provide an economic value of 86.1 x 10(6) yuan ( RMB) per year (US$ 10.37 x 10(6)), which is 25 times higher than the opportunity cost for regular timber production. This study can contribute to the monetary assessment of indirect use values of forest biodiversity and to the conservation and sustainable use of nature reserves.

ID VULNERABILITY
AB Five years down the road from Kyoto, the Protocol that bears that city's name still awaits enough qualifying ratifications to come into force. While attention has been understandably focussed on the ratification process, it is time to begin thinking about the next steps for the global climate regime, particularly in terms of a deeper inclusion of developing countries' concerns and interests. This paper begins doing so from the perspective of the developing countries. The principal argument is that we need to return to the basic principles outlined in the Framework Convention on Climate Change in searching for a north-south bargain on climate change. Such a bargain may be achievable if we can realign the policy architecture of the climate regime to its original stated goals of sustainable development. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Developing countries are vulnerable to extremes of normal climatic variability, and climate change is likely to increase the frequency and magnitude of some extreme weather events and disasters. Adaptation to climate change is dependent on current adaptive capacity and the development models that are being pursued by developing countries. Various frameworks are available for vulnerability and adaptation (V&A) assessments, and they have both advantages and limitations. Investments in developing countries are more focused on recovery from a disaster than on the creation of adaptive capacity. Extreme climatic events create a spiral of debt burden on developing countries. Increased capacity to manage extreme weather events can reduce the magnitude of economic, social and human damage and eventually, investments, in terms of borrowing money from the lending agencies. Vulnerability to extreme weather events, disaster management and adaptation must be part of long-term sustainable development planning in developing countries. Lending agencies and donors need to reform their investment policies in developing countries to focus more on capacity building instead of just investing in recovery operations and infrastructure development.

DT Article
AB Learning from the Western experience of economic development, the developing countries of the world, after their liberation from colonial rule in the 1940s and 1950s, pinned their hopes on industry and urbanisation to stimulate accelerated economic growth and the social transformation of backward regions. However, in-many cases industrialisation of backward regions has generated unintended social and ecological consequences resulting in the involuntary displacement of human populations, the loss of traditional sustainable livelihoods, the marginalisation of the locals, especially the tribals, and the increasing environmental pollution of the region. As the process of development is usually designed at the top, it mostly serves the social and economic interests of the elite and privileged sections of society at the cost of the poor and downtrodden. The present article analyses the processes of industrialisation and economic development as causal factors in ecological degradation in Rourkela, the site of the India's first public sector steel plant and a region which, in the past, was predominantly inhabited by indigenous peoples.

ID AGRICULTURAL SUSTAINABILITY; CONSUMPTION; IMPACT; INDICATORS
AB These days, sustainability is a key issue for many private companies that address their sustainable corporate performance (SCP). The perspective is essential for their license to operate and forms the basis for business principles and practices. The lack of internationally accepted reporting standards on what, when and where to report makes it difficult to assess sustainability, however. Moreover, measuring tools providing information on SCP are only the first step towards sustainability. To prevent negative effects of operations being transferred from one company to another, the second step is the development of a system-based approach for all companies that contribute to an end product. This paper presents the findings of a study about the use of environmental indicators for food production and proposes a measuring method for environmental sustainability in food production systems. The study shows that environmental SCP often focuses on events at a local level. The enormous number of indicators found in the literature generates too much data that often provide no additional knowledge on the environmental sustainability of a system. Moreover, although environmental research has addressed many aspects of sustainability, it has often ignored interactions. Overall environmental implications of food production are therefore poorly understood. The proposed measuring method uses three indicators that address global environmental issues: the use of energy (from both fossil and renewable sources), land and water. The systemic approach can calculate trade-offs along supply chains that make up a production system. The use of the method implies an extension of environmental SCP towards the overall performance of a production system. The final outcome is expressed in three performance indicators: the total land, energy and water requirement per kilogram of available food. For companies, the data generated can be used to compare trends over time, to compare results with targets and to benchmark a company against others. For consumers, data can be used to compare the environmental effects of various foods. The method is also applicable to other business sectors. The study is part of a multidisciplinary project on the scientific modeling and measuring of SCP involving economic, social and environmental dimensions. Acceptance of the measuring methods developed may be a powerful contribution towards creating sustainable business practices. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper presents the findings of an economic analysis of Ream National Park, a protected area located in southern Cambodia. The objective is to assess how the establishment or destruction of the Park distributes benefits and costs among different stakeholders. A household survey of local communities was undertaken to provide social, economic and ecological data. The paper determines the costs and benefits of three management options: (1) The experimental park scenario corresponds to the base case where some level of protection is achieved, but fisheries eventually collapse; (2) the ghost park scenario assumes that all timber and fish are harvested, destroying the area; (3) the dream park scenario only allows subsistence activities, recreation, education and research. At a 10% discount rate, the dream park has the highest net present value (US $11.9 million). This compares with US $10.0 million for the ghost park and US $9.8 million for the experimental park. Although the dream park scenario has the highest net present value, it exceeds that of the ghost park by less than US $2.0 million. However, protection scenarios allocate the bulk of the Park's benefits to local communities. The dream park confers three times more benefit value to villagers compared with the ghost park. Local communities, whose traditional livelihoods depend on the sustainable use of the Park, stand to loose most; commercial loggers and fishing fleets, as well as the Armed Forces, stand to gain most from the wanton exploitation of timber and marine resources.

AB Different options for wastewater treatment have different performance characteristics and also different direct impacts on the environment. These impacts occur over the whole life cycle of the treatment system. Natural wastewater systems such as the reedbed may offer reduced whole life cycle environmental impacts compared to systems with more technical and material sophistication. This paper describes a study of the life cycle impacts of two options for smallscale wastewater treatment which are a horizontal flow reedbed system and a package bio-filtration plant. The study is limited to impacts during the construction and operation phases. Energy use, CO2 emission and solid emissions were chosen as the environmental aspects. It was found that overall the reedbed and conventional systems were quite similar in terms of life cycle energy use. Transport occurring during construction and operational maintenance was a key contributor to energy use and CO2 emissions. The environmental impact of the reedbed reduced if the soil excavated on site was suitable for re-use in the infill. The effect on the results of the different assumptions made during the study was checked using sensitivity analysis. This analysis also helped us to identify recommendations for reducing the life cycle impact of the reedbed system. (C) 2003 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB This research deals with the dynamic simulation modelling of a shallow freshwater lake ecosystem and analysis of potential sustainable management policies. The study region consists of a shallow freshwater lake and its surroundings, where fishing is a major commercial activity. The lake is under high nutrient loads, hence eutrophic with macrophyte dominance. The goal of this research is to find a balance between the ecosystem and economic activities in the region. To this end, a system dynamics model of the wetland is constructed. The results obtained from model simulations show that there is no threat of a shift to algal dominance in the near future. The major problem seems to be a potential decline in the welfare of the inhabitants, mainly due to unsustainable population increase. Different scenario runs reveal that the lake would have become eutrophic with algal dominance, if the crayfish population did not collapse due to a fun.-us disease in 1986. One particular scenario analysis (the recovery of crayfish sometime in the future within the model time frame) results in increase in crayfish harvest; hence in income from fishing, leading to betterment in social conditions. As for the alternative policies tested, 'improved agricultural techniques' is the only policy that leads to better social conditions, through increased yield per hectare. It is hoped that the dynamic simulation model will serve as a laboratory to study the different features of the eutrophication problem in shallow freshwater lakes and to analyse different policy alternatives with an integrated, systemic approach.

AB Advocates of no-take marine reserves emphasize their conservation benefits. Critics counter that reserves would decrease fisheries yield. Analysis of a spatially explicit harvesting model, however, shows that no-take marine reserves are always part of an optimal harvest designed to maximize yield. The optimal harvest generates a spatial source-sink structure with source populations placed in reserves. The sizes and locations of the optimal reserves depend on a dimensionless length parameter. For small values of this parameter, the maximum yield is obtained by placing a large reserve in the centre of the habitat. For large values of this parameter, the optimal harvesting strategy is a spatial 'chattering control' with infinite sequences of reserves alternating with areas of intense fishing. Such a chattering strategy would be impossible to actually implement, but in these cases an approximate yet practicable policy, utilizing a small number of reserves, can be constructed.

AB The wheat straw, an inedible biomass that can be continuously produced in a space vehicle has been used to produce activated carbon for effective control of NO, emissions from the incineration of wastes. The optimal carbonization temperature of wheat straw was found to be around 600degreesC when a burnoff of 67% was observed. The BET surface area of the activated carbon produced from the wheat straw reached as high as 300 m(2)/g. The presence of oxygen in flue gas is essential for effective adsorption of NO by activated carbon. On the contrary, water vapor inhibits the adsorption efficiency of NO. Consequently, water vapor in flue gas should be removed by drying agents before adsorption to ensure high NO adsorption efficiency. All of the NO in the flue gas was removed for more than 2 h by the activated carbons when 10% oxygen was present and the ratio of carbon weight to the flue gas flow rate (W/F) was 30 g.min/L, with a contact time of 10.2 s. All of NO was reduced to N-2 by the activated carbon at 450degreesC with a W/F ratio of 15 g.min/L and a contact time of 5.1 s. Reduction of the adsorbed NO also regenerated the activated carbon, and the regenerated activated carbon exhibited an improved NO adsorption efficiency. However, the reduction of the adsorbed NO resulted in a loss of carbon which was determined to be about 0.99% of the activated carbon per cycle of regeneration. The sufficiency of the amount of wheat straw in providing the activated carbon based on a six-person crew, such as the mission planned for Mars, has been determined. This novel approach for the control of NO, emissions is sustainable in a closed system such as the case in space travel. It is simple to operate and is functional under microgravity environment.

AB The main challenge to energy policy makers in the 21st century is how to develop and manage adequate, affordable and reliable energy services on a sustainable manner to fuel social and economic development. About 60 per cent of the world's two billion population, who do not have access to modern energy services, live in Asia and the Pacific region. The demand for energy is expected to continue growing at a high rate well into the century, often at a greater rate than economic growth. Latest assessment of conventional energy resources shows that their availability is not going to be an immediate threat to the security of supply but the question is can the region afford to allow current patterns of production and consumption of energy to continue in a rapidly deteriorating health of the environment? Changing these unsustainable patterns is the main challenge for the developed and developing countries alike. The paper dwells upon what are the major issues facing the region in promoting sustainable energy development and what are some of the policy options and possible strategies that the countries could consider to attain the objective of sustainable energy development. In this respect, the paper also dwells upon the need for strategic planning and management of energy resources. (C) 2003 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB This paper examines the intricacy of energy policies, issues and challenges woven into the development of the energy sector in Malaysia. As highlighted in the Third Outline Perspective Plan (OPP3) and the Eighth Malaysia Plan (8MP) unveiled in April 2001, efforts will be intensified to moderate the growth of energy demand and to develop renewable energy as the fifth fuel in electricity generation. Whilst the general energy policy thrust for the next ten years remains unchanged, concerted efforts will be made to usher the energy sector development on a greener path. With a projected average economic growth rate of 7.5% per year in the 2001-2005 period, resource rich Malaysia would have to cater for the 7.8% yearly increase in final energy demand. Total primary energy supply is projected to grow at an average of 7.2% per year in the same period. Against the backdrop of a growing need for coal and piped natural gas imports and Malaysia becoming a net crude oil importer in 2008, greater challenges lie ahead for the energy sector. This implies that Peninsular Malaysia may become a net importer of fossil fuels (oil, gas and coal) sooner than expected. Higher utilization rate of natural gas as the 'green' fuel will be encouraged in electricity and non-electricity sectors. Furthermore, fiscal incentives in Budget 2001 to promote renewable energy and energy efficiency provide a timely boost for implementation of the new fifth fuel strategy. Although the overall approach in addressing energy issues and challenges hinges on the precautionary principle, the main thrust of energy sector development in Malaysia will continue to focus on adequacy, quality and security of energy supply and the promotion of its efficient utilization with minimum negative impacts on the environment.

AB An integrated econometric model consisting of macroeconomic sub-model, energy sub-model and environment sub-model was developed and used to perform a long-term simulation study for China. In the coming 30 years, the potential of GDP growth will be around 7% annually and the continuation of rapid economic growth could result in insurmountable difficulties for energy security, air protection, and CO2 emission reductions. For the sustainable development, more comprehensive measures should be adopted, including improvements in energy efficiency, more rapid energy switching from coal to natural gas and renewable energy sources, imposing carbon tax, development of clean coal technology, establishment of strategic petroleum stockpiling, enforcement of air protection, etc. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

DE China; modeling; technology
AB This paper summarizes an assessment of future energy-technology strategies for China that explored the prospects for China to continue its social and economic development while ensuring national energy-supply security and promoting environmental sustainability over the next 50 years. The MARKAL energy-system modeling tool was used to build a model of China's energy system representing all sectors of the economy and including both energy conversion and end-use technologies. Different scenarios for the evolution of the energy system from 1995 to 2050 were explored, enabling insights to be gained into different energy development choices. The analysis indicates a business-as-usual strategy that relies on coal combustion technologies would not be able to meet all environmental and energy security goals. However, an advanced technology strategy emphasizing (1) coal gasification technologies co-producing electricity and clean liquid and gaseous energy carriers (polygeneration), with below-ground storage of some captured CO2; (2) expanded use of renewable energy sources (especially wind and modern biomass); and (3) end-use efficiency would enable China to continue social and economic development through at least the next 50 years while ensuring security of energy supply and improved local and global environmental quality. Surprisingly, even when significant limitations on carbon emissions were stipulated, the model calculated that an advanced energy technology strategy using our technology-cost assumptions would not incur a higher cumulative (1995-2050) total discounted energy system cost than the business-as-usual strategy. To realize such an advanced technology strategy, China will need policies and programs that encourage the development, demonstration and commercialization of advanced clean energy conversion technologies and that support aggressive end-use energy efficiency improvements.

AB The insurance and risk management industries are typically considered to have little interest in energy issues, other than those associated with large energy supply systems. The historical involvement of these industries in the development and deployment of familiar loss-prevention technologies such as automobile air bags, fire prevention/suppression systems, and anti-theft devices, evidences a tradition of mediating and facilitating the use of technology to improve safety and otherwise reduce the likelihood of losses. Through an examination of the connection between risk management and energy technology, we have identified nearly 80 examples of energy-efficient and renewable energy technologies that offer loss-prevention benefits (such as improved fire safety). This article presents the business case for insurer involvement in the sustainable energy sector and documents early case studies of insurer efforts along these lines. We have mapped these opportunities onto the appropriate market segments (life, health, property, liability, business interruption, etc.). We review steps taken by 53 forward-looking insurers and reinsurers, 5 brokers, 7 insurance organizations, and 13 non-insurance organizations. We group the approaches into the categories of. information, education, and demonstration; financial incentives; specialized policies and insurance products; direct investment; customer services and inspections; codes, standards, and policies; research and development; in-house energy management; and an emerging concept informally known as "carbon insurance". While most companies have made only a modest effort to position themselves in the "green" marketplace, a few have comprehensive environmental programs that include energy efficiency and renewable energy activities.

TI Playing with fire: the global threat presented by brominated flame
   retardants justifies urgent substitution

AB Few would now deny that the use of organobromine compounds to achieve fire retardancy in a diverse array of products and materials has led to contamination of the ecosphere on a widespread scale. This environmental prevalence and persistence of the brominated flame retardants, coupled with growing evidence of their potential for harm, present all too familiar parallels with the previous generation of persistent organic pollutants. Indeed, given the intrinsic properties of these brominated chemicals, the nature and extent of the current problem could well have been predicted in advance. The question is then whether we are prepared to let history repeat itself once more or to take precautionary action now to switch to more sustainable alternatives. The choice facing society is not between brominated flame retardants and unsafe products, but between fire safety leading to global contamination or fire safety achieved in less polluting ways. If we look beyond options for simple chemical-for-chemical substitution to alternative materials and designs, many of the solutions are already available. The remainder could undoubtedly be developed given the incentives to do so. However, a strong and clear policy approach, backed by legislative phase-outs within specified (and challenging) timeframes, will be necessary to break our current dependency on organobromine chemistry. This paper presents the justification for such an approach, reviews those initiatives already underway to replace brominated flame retardants and identifies pathways to the use of more sustainable products in the service of society.

SO ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION
LA English

ID CONSERVATION
AB Regional colleges in Tanzania, Cameroon and, recently, South Africa have trained some 4000 wildlife managers. Training need assessments called for major curriculum reforms, which were developed and implemented in the late 1990s. This is an analysis of the factors that influenced this curriculum reform in the colleges' endeavour to respond to new developments in African wildlife management. Since 1979, the curriculum of Garoua Wildlife College, Cameroon, has changed only gradually, whereas work placement subjects, selected by students and their employers, have quickly responded to developments in wildlife management, with an increase in the number of people-oriented subjects amongst other things. In the new curriculum, Garoua's mid-career students appreciated biology and inventory disciplines for their relevance, as well as courses in other disciplines tailored to conservation practice. The curriculum reforms implemented at Garoua depended on the presence of interested lecturers with an appropriate background, often obtained by additional training. The curricula of the regional wildlife colleges at Garoua (Cameroon) Mweka (Tanzania) and SAWC (South Africa) showed important differences, as a result of regional differences and differing visions of the wildlife management profession. All three colleges have struggled to establish a feedback system for continuous curriculum review. Increasing the exchanges between the colleges could further develop the curricula. While pursuing necessary changes in curriculum and institutions, care should be taken to avoid reducing the colleges' sustainability.

AB There is increasing degradation of non-timber forest products (NTFPs) in the mountains of Nepal. It has been proposed that different components of a common property resource (CPR) do not undergo degradation at the same rate, as they are not managed in the same way under different types of property rights regimes. To examine this, information was collected through a survey of 324 households, community resource assessment ranking and group discussion in a small mountain watershed of Nepal. The study analysed NTFP collection and management practices under government and community forest management systems, and impact of these practices on the status of forest and NTFPs. The analysis based on people's perception revealed that NTFPs were being depleted more rapidly than timber components in both types of forest. The pace of depletion was, however, considerably lower in community forests, as these forests were accessible only to the relevant forest user group members. Depletion of NTFPs was due primarily to the lack of proper institutional arrangements, including the lack of a comprehensive government policy framework, for sustainable use and management of NTFPs.

TI The external goods approach to environmental virtue ethics
SO ENVIRONMENTAL ETHICS
LA English
DT Article
AB If virtue ethics are to provide a legitimate alternative for reasoning about environmental issues, they must meet the same conditions of adequacy as any other environmental ethic. One such condition that most environmental ethicists insist upon is that an adequate environmental ethic provides a theoretical platform for consistent and justified critique of environmentally unsustainable practices and policies. The external goods approach seeks to establish that any genuinely virtuous agent will be disposed to promote ecosystem sustainability on the grounds that ecosystem sustainability is a necessary external good for cultivating the virtues and/or human flourishing. At most the external goods approach is able to provide an environmental ethic that in most contexts will require that any genuinely virtuous agent will have the goal of promoting a weak environmental sustainability. A better approach may be the substantive approach, which incorporates environmental concern and practice into the substance of the virtues, rather than as a boundary condition for any prospective virtue.

AB In this paper one uses an infinite time horizon optimal control paradigm to deal with three important issues in global climate change integrated assessment, namely the equitable treatment of all the generations involved, the representation of technical progress, and the uncertainty concerning technological progress and climate change processes. The notion of economic sustainability is associated with the concept of turnpike in infinite horizon optimization models. The issue of deciding on the proper discount rate is addressed in this context and a method is proposed to reconcile long term sustainability and short term time preference for current generations. One also formulates a model where environmental damage and/or technical progress are represented as stochastic jump processes. One calls this random evolution a mode switching process. In this context, sustainability is represented by a family of turnpikes, and the economy will be driven from one steady state to the other as the modes switch. These concepts are illustrated on the DICE model and their possible implementation in other types of integrated assessment models is discussed.

CT Workshop on Climate Risk Assessment
CY OCT 05-09, 2001
CL ENGADINE, SWITZERLAND
AB This paper discusses equity issues in relation to climate change. Models of long-term climate assessments study changes in relative prices. These changes lead to gains and losses for different economic actors and these consequences are held responsible for problems related to social acceptability. Policy recommendations issued by such models cannot be put into practice. Equity should be integrated into those models in order to make them more relevant for policy. This paper considers this problem in three parts.
   The first part shows that equity is only one aspect of the social dimension of sustainable development, which cannot be treated separately. It invites an understanding of complexity. Equity is also interrelated with the economic and ecological dimensions of sustainable development.
   The second part deals with the fact that different aspects of equity have to be taken into account and several concepts of equity coexist. If only distribution of income is taken into account, equity can effectively be addressed through economic growth, but the specific characteristics of sustainable development are left out of the analysis.
   Therefore, the third part is a questioning of traditional modelling approaches and of the reasons why modelling should be carried out. The paper concludes with a short discussion about the normative content of any attempt to model climate change.

   physical and chemical characteristics; wheat
AB Field experiments were carried out during 1996-97 at Gulawathi, Muthiani and Salarpur Villages, IARI Farm, New Delhi and NCPP Campus, Dadri to evaluate changes in soil characteristics and growth of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), mustard (Brassica juncea L.), lentil (Lence esculenta Moench.), rice (Oryza sativa L.) and maize (Zea mays L.) by varying amounts of flyash addition (up to 50t ha(-1)) in soils at sowing/transplanting time of crops. Flyash addition in areas adjoining NCPP Thermal Power Plant, Dadri, Ghaziabad, U. P. ranged from 5-12 t ha(-1) yr(-1) in 1995-96. Shoot and root growth and yield of test crops at different locations after flyash incorporation resulted in beneficial effects of flyash addition in most cases. The silt dominant texture of flyash improved loamy sand to sandy loam textures of the surface soils at the farmers' fields. The increased growth in yield of crops with flyash incorporation was possibly due to modifications in soil moisture retention and transmission characteristics, bulk density, physico-chemical characters such as pH and EC and organic carbon content. The response of flyash addition in the soil on soil health and crop productivity needs to be evaluated on long-term sustainable aspects.

ID INPUT; MODEL
AB Governments need good information to design policies. However, in the Argentine Pampas there are neither sufficient knowledge on environmental issues, nor clear perception of environmental alterations across space and time. The general objective of this work was to provide decision makers with a scientifically sound set of indicators aiming at the assessment of current status and future trends in the rural environment of this sensitive region. As driving criteria to select indicators, we assumed that they had to be sound, simple to calculate, easy to understand, and easily applicable by decision makers. They are related closely to significant ecological structures and functions. Twelve basic indicators were identified: (1) land use, (2) fossil energy use, (3) fossil energy use efficiency, (4) nitrogen (N) balance, (5) phosphorus (P) balance, (6) nitrogen contamination risk, (7) phosphorus contamination risk, (8) pesticide contamination, (9) soil erosion risk, (10) habitat intervention, (11) changes in soil carbon stock, and (12) balance of greenhouse gases. Indicators were geographically referenced using a geographic information system (GIS). The strength of this study is not in the absolute value of environmental indicators, but rather in the conceptualization of indicator and the identification of changing patterns, gradients and trends in space and time. According to our results, we can not definitely say that agriculture in the Pampas, as a whole, tends to be sustainable or not. While some indicators tend to improve, others keep stable, and the rest worsen. The relative importance among indicators must also be considered. The indicators that showed a negative net change are key to the identification of critical problems that will require special attention in the close future.

ID SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
AB Environmental policy integration (EPI) is a key defining feature of sustainable development. Despite the fact that EPI has been the subject of much debate both in academic and policy-making circles, conceptual issues relating to EPI have received relatively little treatment. The conceptual work that has been completed on EPI,generally fails to place the concept in an appropriate environmental policy context. and this in turn appears to betray the fact that the concept clearly implies a relatively strong revision of the traditional hierarchy of policy objectives. In this article the author'S discuss the origins of the concept and provide conceptual clarification regarding its definition and context. Further, the article derives a simple analytical framework consisting of vertical and horizontal dimensions of EPI. which can serve as a useful point of departure for further empirical work on the implementation of EPI.

DT Article
ID POLICY TRANSFER; CONVERGENCE; STATES
AB In recent years, the diffusion of environmental policy innovations has become a topic of considerable interest. Often, studies of diffusion portray it in positive terms. as a process of 'policy learning or the spread of environmental 'best practice'. Such portrayals, which tend to ignore the political-ideological roots of environmental policy innovation and diffusion, contribute to the depoliticisation of environmental (and sustainable development) decision-making. In particular, the spread of neo-liberal ideology has provided a basis for environmental policy innovations that. under the Guise of 'objectivity', tilt the 'playing field' further to the advantage of dominant interests. Thus, the challenging political, economic and social issues generated by the environmental policy and sustainable development debates. which have the potential to re-politicise economic policy (the 'Washington Consensus'). are side-stepped. As environmental decision-making is devolved to 'the market'. local government, experts, and the courts, the environmental 'threat' is defused. It is this effect that makes the New Zealand innovations attractive to the governments of other countries. especially those with an adversarial political system. The article analyses the neo-liberal roots. and effects. of New Zealand's environmental innovations to demonstrate the argument.

AB Central to this article is the suggestion that modem planning and development frameworks in England are currently at a potentially productive, although problematic turning point. Whilst on the one hand the UK is attempting to make the legislative and institutional changes necessary to facilitate the process of regionalization and devolution, it is at the same time facing the challenge of ensuring the necessary levels of inter-agency cohesion and integration required for the delivery of the meta-objectives at the heart of sustainable development. Of particular concern for the English regions is the increasing complexity of organizational relations, the fragmentary nature of provisions, the potential mismatch between the need to preserve environmental welfare and at the same time ensure regional economic competitiveness, and more fundamentally, the failure to provide an appropriate mechanism for the evaluation of sustainable development goals. In the light of these challenges, the authors highlight the value of Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) as a mechanism for improving the environmental quality of decision-making and make recommendations as to how the regional level of decision-making can provide an effective platform for the development of an SEA system which is capable Of reconciling the sustainability conflicts derived from different tiers of decision-making. Within this discussion, suggestions are made as to the manner in which current ideas for introducing sustainability appraisal for Regional Planning Guidance should be amended.
