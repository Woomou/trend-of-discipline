AB A nutrient balance study was carried out for 26 farms in three different districts in Kenya. Balances for the major nutrients nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium were calculated for individual activities within the farms and for the entire farms, using Farm-NUTMON, a research tool that combines calculation of nutrient flows and balances with economic farm analysis. Four flows into the farm (chemical fertilizer, organic fertilizer and feeds, atmospheric deposition, nitrogen fixation), six flows out of the farm (farm products, other organic outputs, leaching, gaseous losses, erosion and human excreta) and six internal flows (consumption of external feeds, household waste, crop residues, grazing, animal manure, and home consumption of farm products) were considered. Data on fertilizer use, use of organic materials, yields, home consumption and the management of residues, manure and household waste were gathered by interviewing the farmer. Assumptions for deposition, leaching and gaseous losses were made by using empirical relationships based on literature data (transfer functions). Erosion was estimated relating the overall slopes of the farms to soil loss figures. The mean balance of all farms was -71 kg N, +3 kg P and -9 kg K ha(-1) yr(-1), with large variations between farms and little variation between districts. Emissions (leaching, gaseous losses and erosion) were estimated to be much higher than immissions (atmospheric deposition and N-fixation). Inflows and outflows at field level were much higher for cash crops than for food crops. Soil nutrient mining under napier grass (Pennisetum purpereum) was severe from high estimated losses in the napier-livestock-manure cycle. Based on an evaluation of the results of this case study, recommendations were made for improvement to the approach. Developing a sustainability indicator for soil fertility requires the nutrient balance to be linked to the actual soil nutrient stocks and other soil quality indicators.

AB At the national level, agricultural production in Kenya is characterized by a negative nutrient balance and a downward trend in food production per capita and can therefore be classified as unsustainable. However, little information is available concerning ecological and economic sustainability of the various production systems at farm level. A one year monthly monitoring activity was conducted in the season 1995/1996 in three districts with the participation of 26 farm households covering the major existing fanning systems in these districts, in which data were collected on agronomic and economic aspects of the farm management. The average N-balance at farm level is -71 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) with large variations among farms ranging from -240 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) to +135 kg ha(-1) yr(-1); the average K- balance is slightly negative, the P-balance slightly positive. Net farm income shows no relation with the nutrient balance. A high market orientation on the other hand correlates with a more negative N- and K-balance. The market-oriented farms located in the highly populated areas are characterized by intensive crop and livestock activities, import nutrients through fertilizers and/or animal feeds, but insufficient to compensate the outflow through marketed products, leaching and erosion. The average annual net farm income amounts to US$ 1490 per farm, with large variations among farms. Average returns to family labour (US$ 2.2 per day(1)) and returns to land (US$ 91 per ha(-1)) are comparable or higher than unskilled wage rates and annual land rent respectively, but 50% of the farms perform below these rates. Market oriented farms have an economic performance that is similar to subsistence oriented farms. Off-farm income, however, is essential for large groups of small-scale farm households to achieve economic viability: without additional off-farm income, 54% of the farms in the sample are estimated to be below the poverty line. The replacement costs of mined nutrients amounts to 32% of the average net farm income.
   At crop level the cash crops tea and coffee realise higher gross margins and considerably lower nutrient mining levels than the major food crops maize and maize-beans. It is concluded that a multi-disciplinary monitoring activity at farm level, contributes to targeting and prioritization of development options aimed at optimization of soil nutrient management.

AB Nutrient balances were estimated for small-scale farming systems at four sub-humid, medium altitude locations in eastern and central Uganda. Data from several sources were used to estimate nutrient fluxes, including farmer interviews, observations of the fanning systems, soil analyses, and the output of simulation models. Results from the three locations were combined because of similarity of farming systems, with the Palissa location treated separately. Nutrient balances were determined to be negative for all crops except for N and P in the banana-based land use type (LUT) which benefited from the transfer of nutrients from other land use types in organic materials. The annual crops-LUT occupied more land than other LUTs and accounted for more nutrient loss than all other LUTs combined. Crop harvest and soil erosion were the major causes of nutrient losses at the crop and LUT levels. N and K balances were positive and negative, respectively, for the fallow and pasture LUTs. Harvests and livestock dung and urine were brought to the household LUT, and the losses in this relatively small LUT appeared to be high from burning, volatilization and erosion. No farmer used fertilizer and nutrients in any form were applied to banana, only. Marketing and purchasing of commodities resulted in farm-level nutrient deficits for Palissa but had little effect on the balances at other locations. The cumulative effect of several low-input management practices was estimated to give nutrient balances of near zero for N and P, but K losses at the held-level continued to be high.

AB A farm simulation model was designed to assess the long-term impact of existing soil management strategies, on farm productivity, profitability and sustainability. The model, which runs in time units of 1 year, links soil management practices, nutrient availability, plant and livestock productivity, and farm economics A case study is presented of the application of the model to existing, mixed farm systems in Vihiga district, in the highlands of western Kenya. Three representative farm types were developed using participatory techniques to reflect differences in resource endowments and constraints faced by farmers. The model was used to assess the sustainability of the existing systems for the three farm types as a basis for recommending improved practices for each. A summary model for calculating new sustainability indicators of soil productivity is presented. The low (LRE) and medium (MRE) resource endowment farms, which comprise about 90% of the farms in the area, have declining soil organic matter and low productivity and profitability. In contrast, the high resource endowment category of farms (HRE) have increasing soil organic matter, low soil nutrient losses and are productive and profitable. Crop nutrient yields were 17, 19 and 86 kg N ha(-1) year(-1) on LRE, MRE and HRE farms, respectively. Soil C, N and P budgets were negative in LRE and MRE but positive in HRE. Farm revenue in LRE and MRE was 2-13% of farm revenue in HRE. It comprised 7% of household income in LRE compared with 25% in MRE and 63% in HRE. It is concluded that low land and capital resources constrain the adoption of ecologically and economically sustainable soil management practices on the majority of farms in the area. Strategies are needed to (i) increase the value of farm output (ii) increase high quality nutrient inputs at low cash and labour costs to the farmer, and (iii) increase off-farm income.

AB Nutrient depletion is an important limiting factor for agricultural sustainability in shifting cultivation systems. This paper presents a case study examining nutrient dynamics for a hillrice-fallow system located on the eastern escarpment of Madagascar. A nutrient assessment was carried out, measuring total C, N, P, K, Ca and Mg concentrations in phytomass, ashes and harvests and total C and N, exchangeable K, Ca and Mg and available P concentrations in topsoils, soil loss material and river discharges. At representative slash-and-burn sites, the soil-pool of P and K increased from 100% beneath 5-year-oId fallow vegetation to 166% and 126% at harvest, but Ca and Mg decreased. Comparisons between fallow and burnt fields showed that 95-98% of phytomass-fixed and 22-24% of soil-fixed C and N were lost by burning. Paddy at harvest only contained 1-7% of the nutrients in the burnt phytomass of the previous stand. Nutrients regenerated rapidly in the fallow vegetation, which after 1 year contained already 36-57% of the previous phytomass pool, whereas topsoil nutrient concentrations started to increase only after 3-5 years of fallow. The long-term nutrient depletion was studied by comparing nutrient stocks at sites and watersheds, which were characterised by increasing levels of degradation. The topsoil cation content increased during the early stages of shifting cultivation, but under long-term shifting cultivation, the soil nutrients fell to approximately 2/3 of the initial stock. The nutrient stocks of the most degraded vegetation unit (grassland) was merely 1.1-6.5% of the nutrient stocks in the rainforest. Finally, the nutrient stocks in a forested and a degraded watershed were calculated and compared. The established nutrient balances showed, that the dynamics and the depletion depend greatly on the spatiotemporal scale of observation, on the topography of the sites and on the type of nutrients.

AB The farming system of the Kano close-settled zone, northern Nigeria, is known for its longevity and continued productivity in spite of population increases in the area. Mounting circumstantial evidence has led to its reputation of being 'sustainable'. Rural population density in this region now exceeds 300 km(-2), and almost all land (86.4%) is under annual cultivation. It is generally believed that such an intensive fanning system is only possible under high input levels. This study set out to determine the nutrient balance to see if the system really was sustainable. Agronomic and soil fertility management practices were monitored on three farms over a two year period. Inputs and outputs measured at the field level included fertilizer use (manure and inorganic), dry deposition, biological N fixation, and the harvest of crops and hedgerow products. The results indicate great variability among fields, farmers, and years, and showed that the N balance was strongly negative, whereas P, K, and Mg balances were close to zero. The Ca balance was quite positive as a result of dry deposition. The study also quantified nutrient dynamics within the farming system, highlighting, (1) the role of leguminous crops in bringing in N through fixation, and as a source of fodder for small ruminants, (2) the role of small ruminants in converting cop residues into manure, and (3) the input of nutrients through dry deposition.

AB This paper presents an overview of the current status, problems and prospects for achieving a better nutrient balance to support varying levels of productivity from the three major livestock systems in Africa. In free range grazing systems, livestock nutrient deficiencies are mainly overcome by moving the animals to better grazing areas. This makes monitoring and managing of nutrients within a system very difficult. Nutrient recovery, cycling and synchronization of manure with other recycled or purchased sources are greater in mixed crop-livestock systems. In these systems, inclusion of nitrogen-fixing leguminous forage/tree crops as companions or rotation crops with cereals further improves the nutrient use efficiency and balance. With more favourable market and policies, commercialized dairy systems are developing around the urban areas of Africa. Such systems heavily depend on purchased feeds and nutrients, and have serious implications for the nutrient balance and sustainability of land use systems in the rural areas which supply the feeds, and for the urban areas because of the risk of pollution from the accumulating animal wastes.

AB This paper reviews the application of the nutrient budget and balance approach from a range of settings and scales in Africa. The paper asks: can such analyses help in the design of effective policy which supports improved soil fertility management by Africa's small-holder farmers? Through the examination of existing studies, the paper highlights some of the difficulties with nutrient budget analyses, including potential problems with a snapshot approach when trying to understand longer term dynamic processes; the danger of extrapolation to wider scales from limited locale-specific data sets; the challenges of understanding diversity, complexity and uncertainty within small-holder fanning systems; and the importance of insights into the many socio-economic and institutional factors which influence decision-making at farm level and so mediate the processes of environmental change. The paper concludes by recognising the potential contribution of nutrient budget analyses to the policy process, but suggests caution over uncritical use; particularly the employment of aggregate studies to diagnose generalised problems and suggest blanket solutions. The paper also highlights how nutrient budget analyses can be used as simple devices to encourage debate and dialogue among farmers, technical scientists and policy actors in a participatory process of negotiating interventions or policies for tackling issues of agricultural sustainability in Africa.

AB Integrated nutrient management (INM) is a broad-based remedy against excessive soil fertility decline or accumulation, problems which are increasingly recognised as major constraints to farming in both temperate and tropical hemispheres. The different technical indicators of INM (nutrient stocks, nutrient flows, technologies) are listed in the paper. At the same time, INM requires social interventions to arrive at technologies that simultaneously improve soil fertility in a sustainable way, and make sense to farmers given their different social and economic motives. As the limitations of transfer of technology to promote better INM become more obvious (particularly in lesser-endowed regions in the tropics), there is a need to develop new strategies, focussing on the facilitation of farmer learning to become experts at INM and at capturing the opportunities in their diverse environments. Facilitating INM therefore, requires a praxeology (theory informing practice, and practices feeding new theory) about facilitating innovation, focussing on enhancing the farmers' capacity to observe, experiment, discuss, evaluate and plan ahead. The paper lists the work needed to facilitate this learning with respect to INM, borrowing a leaf from earlier successes in the field of integrated pest management (IPM). Indispensable ingredients are participatory rural appraisals and participatory technology development, which emphasizes mutual open-mindedness and empathy between ail the participants. The paper provides guidelines for the development of INM learning, but further field testing still has to be undertaken. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

TI The reality of the stomach: Coastal management at the local level in
   Eastern Africa
SO AMBIO
LA English
DT Article
ID ZONE MANAGEMENT; RESOLUTION; ARUSHA
AB The coastal areas of Eastern African are the centers for economic growth in most of the countries in the region. Migration toward the coast and population growth, together with overuse of resources and widespread poverty, contribute to the degradation of coastal environments. During the last decade a number of local-level projects have been carried out in the region to improve coastal development and management. This article discusses the experiences and lessons learned from many of these projects. Overall, the degree of success of these projects has been mixed. Projects focusing on biodiversity protection, but neglecting local development are often only successful in the short term. An important concern is that most projects are completely dependent on donor support and are thus far from sustainable. To be successful over the long term, local and national ownership is critical and has to be improved. Legal and regulatory frameworks are still poorly developed and enforcement of regulations is weak at best. The article discusses the need for research and capacity building to support coastal management projects; the role of monitoring and evaluation; and the importance of better communication. Project experiences with community participation are presented. It is noted that coastal managers have not yet fully recognized that private enterprise is the single most important factor driving change along the coastline of the region. In conclusion, the experiences gained over the last 10 years of ICZM in Eastern Africa indicate that projects directly targeted at the local level with activities planned and carried out in cooperation with local stakeholders have a relatively high degree of success.

TI Lessons learned from practicing integrated coastal management in
   Southeast Asia
SO AMBIO
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper assesses the performance of 8 integrated coastal management (ICM) projects in Southeast Asia, developed through the ASEAN/US Coastal Resources Management Project (1986 to 1992) and the GEF/ UNDP/IMO Regional Programme for the Prevention and Management of Marine Pollution in the East Asian Seas (1994-ongoing). The assessment is based on common performance indicators for measuring the level of achievements in the planning and implementation processes (process indicators); in reducing environmental stress (stress indicators); in ensuring sustainability of programs (sustainability indicators); and in arresting environmental degradation or improvement of environmental quality (environment status indicators). All 8 ICM programs have successfully completed the requirements for problem identification and program formulation. However, only the 2 programs established in Batangas Bay, Philippines, and Xiamen, China, have reached the implementation stage. The author discusses the lessons learned from 13 years of practicing ICM including the formulation and implementation of the 8 ICM programs in 7 countries in the Southeast Asian region. The discussion includes ICM concept, project timeframe; performance monitoring; project design; selection and prioritization of management issues; management boundary; research and studies; ICM program development and implementation cycle; local government commitment; institutional arrangements; public awareness, and building local capacity.

ID REEF-BUILDING CORAL; GREAT-BARRIER-REEF; REGENERATION; GROWTH;
   TRANSPLANTATION; REPRODUCTION; DAMAGE
AB The harvesting of reef building corals has a negative impact on coral reefs. This pressure is likely to increase with the growing human population along the tropical coasts and, therefore, alternative sources of livelihood and sustainable methods for resource extraction are needed. This paper presents the results of two experiments on coral culturing and one study on temporal patterns in the coral recruitment near Zanzibar, Tanzania. The survival and growth of cultured coral fragments of different sizes was compared for several species of corals, and the effects of lesions on coral fragments were examined. Temporal patterns in recruitment were assessed through regular deployment and sampling of terracotta tiles. The results show that within 1 year, fragments as small as 1-2 cm can be reared into coral colonies that can be sold to the aquarium market or used for reef rehabilitation. Lesions had no negative effect on the growth of the fragments, while a larger initial size had a positive impact on the fragment's growth rate. Coral recruitment was seasonal, with two annual peaks in February-April and November-December. This information could be of use for the timing of deployment of artificial settlement substrata for coral-culturing purposes, as well as for the planning of potentially disturbing coastal development.

TI Self-pollution: A major threat to the prawn farming industry in Sri
   Lanka
SO AMBIO
LA English
DT Article
AB Shrimp farming is rapidly expanding over a coastal belt of about 120 km in the northwestern province of Sri Lanka. The Dutch Canal Mundel lagoon system, a shallow semienclosed coastal water system with very limited tidal mixing due to sandbar formation, act as the major brackish water source and a receiving body for the effluents discharged for 70% of the shrimp farms in Sri Lanka. Farms are mainly developed on intertidal areas in land-use categories of mangroves, salt marsh and scrubland; occupying more than 60% of the natural flood plains. Floods during intermonsoons have affected 40% of the farms directly and retension of flood water in lagoons has resulted in unusually low salinities (2 ppt) for 2-5 weeks, restricting water exchange in farms. Concentrations of sulfides (5.2-8.0 mg L-1) and nitrites (0.58-0.93 mg L-1) were at suboptimal levels in culture ponds during rainy seasons. Contamination of water source by discharged effluents is evident due to unplanned location of inlet and outlet canals. Highly acidic water (pH 3.5) with high concentrations of aluminum (1.8-2.5 mg L-1), manganese (0.16-3.6 mg L-1) and iron (1.7-19.3 mg L-1) were observed in water discharged to the major waterbodies from ponds built on acid-sulfate soils. Self-pollution caused by farming activities has resulted in environmental degradation which in return has caused major problems to the shrimp farming industry. High incidence of disease symptoms, growth retardation, poor shrimp quality, socioeconomic problems together with environmental problems have caused major threats to the industry. Better planning with due consideration to environmental and socioeconomic problems when locating and constructing shrimp farms would help to improve and ensure sustainability of the industry.

AB Coral reefs are an important resource base for many coastal communities throughout the Western Indian Ocean region (WIO). With the continued growth of coastal populations and the concomitant increase in the need for marine resources, coral reefs stand at the face of overexploitation in many countries, and are being subjected to widespread degradation due to destructive fishing practices and pollution. Within this setting, the islands of Zanzibar exhibit almost all of the problems seen throughout the WIG, and so serve to exemplify some of the issues involved. Zanzibar has extensive coral reefs, which are actively used as a resource base by an increasing coastal population. At the same time, the expansion of urban areas and the development of coastal tourist facilities means that the coral reefs are coming under increasing pressure to provide even more resources than they have historically been required to deliver. At the same time, they are recipients of increasing levels of pollutants from expanding human populations, and they are subject to a range of physically destructive activities. In general terms, the reefs of Zanzibar are in comparatively good condition although there are clear areas of significant perturbation adjacent to certain urban areas and areas of high visitation. The main anthropogenic threats to the coral reefs of Zanzibar include overexploitation, destructive activities (fishing and anchor damage), and pollution. There are indications that overfishing of key species may be leading to a decline in certain economic species as well as ecological shifts in the benthic communities of some reef areas. As is often the case regionally, the lack of historical data limits attempts to resolve the true impact of some of these factors. In line with perceived local problems, a number of activities have been undertaken in Zanzibar to address specific coral-reef related issues, and these are discussed here in the light of the larger regional setting. Some discussion is also centered around the basic issues that undermine the sustainable management of coral reefs in Zanzibar, and how these problems are being dealt with in other parts of the WIO.

   programmes for onchocerciasis control in Uganda
SO ANNALS OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND PARASITOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB A retrospective analysis was made of quantitative data on coverage obtained over 4 years of annual ivermectin treatment of the eligible populations (approximately 56 000 individuals) of 71 communities with endemic onchocerciasis in the Kabale, Kisoro and Rukungiri districts of Uganda. The objective was to formulate methods for defining sustainability in community-directed, ivermectin-treatment programmes (CDITP). Three dependent-variable scales of programme sustainability (PS), PS1, PS2 and PS3, were tested for statistical significance by analysis of variance. The inhabitants of a random sample of 230 households drawn from 23 communities [each containing one community leader and one community-based distributor (CBD)] were then invited to answer a questionnaire covering seven independent variables. These variables were analysed in regression and correlation models, with the PS scales as dependent variables. In the regression model, only one variable, selection of CBD by community members (P = 0.038), which scored 100% on the scale of programme-indicator sensitivity, passed as a useful indicator for predicting the sustainability and monitoring the sustainment of CDITP at the community level. The same variable was also selected in the correlation model (P = 0.028). Although two other variables-involvement of CBD in other primary-health-care activities (P = 0.0594) and provision of incentives for the CBD (P = 0.0558)-showed weak negative associations with sustainability in the correlation model, they did not exhibit a linear relationship with it and cannot therefore be used as valid indicators for predicting sustainability or monitoring sustainment.

TI Trends in commuting in England and Wales - becoming less sustainable?
SO AREA
LA English
DT Article
AB It is widely accepted that the nature and extent of commuting patterns worldwide represent a large slice of the overall environmental problems associated with transport use. There has been a long-standing concern over the 'congestion peaks' derived from daily travel-to-work patterns, and a preoccupation with the ways in which greener modes of commuting might contribute to a more environmentally benign transport system. This article uses Census data to focus on commuting patterns in England and Wales, concluding that despite recent moves towards promoting a more integrated and sustainable transport system, worrying trends persist that would seem to undermine this strategy. On a more positive note, the Census data also suggest that many shorter trips might potentially be converted to 'greener modes'-walking or cycling-with substantial environmental benefits.

SO AVIATION SPACE AND ENVIRONMENTAL MEDICINE

ID AVIATION SPATIAL ORIENTATION; HEAD POSITION
AB Introduction: The optokinetic cervico reflex (OKCR) is a recently hypothesized, visually driven reflex that serves to stabilize die image of the external horizon on the retina during roll maneuvers in high-performance aircraft. Although reported anecdotally, head tilt during helicopter flight has not been studied formally. Such research is required to determine the full impact and significance that it may have on the flying performance of a rotary-wing aviator. Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between horizon position and the perception of orientation and, thus, to generate vital information to assess whether OKCR plays an important role in spatial disorientation. Hypothesis: Pilots of rotary-wing aircraft will exhibit the OKCR. Methods: A UH-60 flight simulator study, with 20 volunteer pilots participating, was performed to examine the effects of this reflex during day flight and during flight with night vision goggles (NVGs). Results: The results confirm that the OKCR occurs during simulated helicopter flight, both with and without NVGs. As with previous studies, head roll increased during flight under visual meteorological conditions in relation to an increasing aircraft roll angle up to a maximum sustainable level and then remained constant. Head roll did not occur during night under instrument meteorological conditions. Conclusion: The presence of the OKCR will impact rotary-wing operations. Various aspects are discussed, and recommendations are made for future research.

AB The northern Andes is extremely rich in plant species, but this diversify is threatened by extensive deforestation. This study reports on how five palm species respond to human disturbance in an area of montane forest in Ecuador. The abundance of each species was determined in 250 40 x 30 m plots, established in disturbed and undisturbed forest within an area of 3 x 3 km and altitudes spanning 1248-1938 m. Aiphanes erinacea (H. Karst.) H. Wendl. and to a lesser degree Geonoma undata Klotzsch were negatively affected by even moderate human disturbance, while Chamaedorea linearis (Ruiz & Pav.) Mart. and C, pinnatifrons (Jacq.) Oerst. benefitted from such disturbance and Prestoea acuminata (Willd.) H.E. Moore was unaffected given time enough to replenish its population after disturbance. At the scale of the plots, species richness was maximized in undisturbed forest. Aiphanes erinacea is endemic to northern Ecuador and southern Colombia and must be considered threatened by the extensive deforestation here. If the behaviour of these palms is representative of Andean rain forest plans in general, the negative effect of moderate anthropogenic disturbance on plant biodiversity at scales of greater than or equal to 1 km(2) might be negligible. Thus, biologically sustainable logging could be possible.

AB As concern over the sustainability of commercial moss harvest in the Pacific Northwest has grown, so too has the need to develop methods for estimating the rate of harvest, the biomass inventory, and the rate of accumulation of commercially harvestable epiphytes. We estimated biomass and net moss accumulation in 10 sites in both the historically heavily moss-harvested Coast Range and the historically relatively unharvested Cascade Range of northwestern Oregon. Harvestable epiphyte biomass in the lower canopy (<2 m above ground) ranged from c. 120 to 1470 kg ha(-1) in the Coast Range, and 25 to 1068 kg ha(-1) dry weight in the Cascade Range. The greater biomass at the Coast Range sites resulted from a higher density of suitable substrates, with epiphyte mass per unit area of substrate roughly equal in the two sets of sites. Epiphyte mass accumulation on vine maple Acer circinatum was extremely variable within and between sites, especially in the Coast Range. A model describing the factors affecting epiphyte mat accumulation is described. We recommend active management to conserve epiphytic bryophytes through promoting hardwood tree and shrub substrates, restricting moss harvest to the lower canopy, controlling the rate of harvest, and instigating rotation periods.

TI Attractors: Building mountains in the flat landscape of the World Wide
   Web
SO CALIFORNIA MANAGEMENT REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
ID ELECTRONIC MARKETS; ADVANTAGE
AB Advocates of the World Wide Web claim it is a great-leveler and that participants have a more equal voice. This flatness of the Web creates a major challenge for many businesses: How do you attract visitors and prospective customers to the firm's Web site? The Web site that can attract more visitors, all other things being equal, is more likely to communicate its message to a wider audience or sell its product to more people. Organizations want to build mountains-or "attractors"-in the otherwise flat landscape of Web-based marketing and advertising. This article classifies existing approaches to creating attractors, identifies four basic types of attractors, and predicts that there will be a move towards creating highly interactive attractors as a device for mass customization. The article also addresses the notion of sustainable attractiveness and presents recommendations for designing an attractor.

TI Paradox in project-based enterprise: The case of film making
SO CALIFORNIA MANAGEMENT REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
ID SUSTAINABLE COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE; CORPORATION; COMPETENCE; MODEL; FIRM
AB The creation of temporary enterprises for project-based work has become an increasingly salient feature of the new economy. These project-based enterprises challenge several tenets of strategic management theory. Film making has a long tradition of project-based organizing. This article presents an intensive case study of a big-budget motion picture project which provides the context for identifying some paradoxical attributes of project-based enterprises. Each of the paradoxes challenges strategic management theory assumptions of a relatively permanent firm as the locus of learning, knowledge transfer, and competitive advantage. Findings from the film case suggest the importance of human and social capital that is embodied in individual free-agent careers and mobilized within communities of professional and industry practice.

AB This paper examines 20th-century environmental change in the subhumid southwestern Canadian Plains, specifically in relation to the dominant agricultural landscape and to the climate of the past millennium as reconstructed from proxy data. Anthropogenic landscape change in the last century has been dominated by the conversion of grasslands to ranchland and cropland. This has heightened landscape vulnerability to climatic fluctuations, especially drought. Instrumental climate records, extending back to the 1880s, highlight the variability of precipitation in this region. Proxy environmental records, derived from lake cores and tree-ring analysis, extend this picture into the last millennium and show that drought has been a recurring theme of the Prairie climate. Tree-ring records suggest that some droughts in the last millennium may have exceeded in severity any in the instrumental record. The sustainability of Prairie agriculture depends on adaptation to the amplitudes of climatic change and variability evident in these proxy records.

AB Triuris hyalina Miers, an unusual achlorophyllous plant, was investigated for subterranean morphology, root anatomy, and mycotrophy. Stems with scale leaves extend subterraneously to a depth of 15 cm. Pairs of adventitious roots develop at the scale leaves and clumps of apparently radiating roots, formed by accumulations of side shoot and scale leaf developments, occur. Roots consist of epidermis, short cell exodermis, three distinct layers of cortex parenchyma, endodermis, and an extremely reduced central cylinder with one or two central tracheidal xylem elements. The fungus associated with T. hyalina roots exhibits thick-walled, 6-9 mu m thick, aseptate external hyphae. It penetrates the epidermis by developing appressoria and enters the cortex solely through the short cells of the exodermis. In the cortex cells, the aseptate hyphae start to coil. In the outer cortex layer, hyphae are thin, frequently branched, and most densely coiled. In the middle cortex layer they are thicker and less densely coiled, and mostly appear degenerated to clumps of amorphous fungal material. The inner cortex layer rarely becomes colonized. Vesicles occur in the outer and the middle cortex layers. This mycorrhizal pattern is interpreted as an adaption to attain a sustainable use from the endophyte. It is suggested that the mycorrhiza in Triuris hyalina be interpreted as a type of arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM). Implications for systematics and ecology are discussed.

TI Implementation of legal requirements in self-responsibiIity
SO CHIMIA
LA German
DT Article
AB In Switzerland, legal aspects of the handling of highly reactive substances is regulated by the Law of Labour (Arbeitsgesetz), the Law of Environmental Protection (Umweltschutzgesetz) with their corresponding ordinances and some other laws. Discussions on the use of highly reactive substances are focussed to incidents. Therefore, the ordinance on the protection against major accidents (StFV) plays a central role. It's the duty of the managing director to overcome emergencies. The chemical industry commits to the principles of sustainable development and to the Responsible Care Programme. As a consequence, not only legal requirements but also responsibility for safety and environmental protection influence the production processes.
   A successful emergency management is based on professional and well-tested guidances and plans. General emergency concepts for incidents with hazardous materials and radioactive substances are well-known. As an example of responsible implementation of legal requirements, the general guidance of handling incidents in bio-areas (areas with biological materials) of F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd. is presented.

TI Issues management in a global environment
SO CHIMIA
LA German
DT Article
AB The purpose of this presentation is to give an overview on the newest developments on Issues Management in international companies.
   The conclusions were drawn from business experience at Ciba and Novartis as well as from international and American benchmark studies in the industry over the last ten years. The conclusions address expected trends and requirements beyond the year 2000 and focus on the increasing importance of a company's good reputation. In an environment characterized by fast advancing globalization, a revolution in information/communication technologies, fierce media competition and an increasing number of active stakeholders, the reputation of a company is becoming a key success factor for its sustainable growth.
   Besides being successful in the marketplace of products, companies are under increasing pressure to be winners in the marketplace of opinions. A well-conceived Issues Management approach can be decisive in that effort.
   When unforeseen incidents and accidents actually happen, Issues Management can help the company respond quickly and professionally preventing the kind of functional paralysis that often accompanies crisis situations.
   Based on these conclusions, the article also contains a benchmark evaluation model, which can be used to evaluate a company's Issues Management function.

TI Tyranny of inappropriate policies - Sharing as housing strategy among
   middle/low income households in Abuja, Nigeria
SO CITIES
LA English
DT Article
ID DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES
AB The housing strategies adopted by urban households in a situation of housing shortage in a particular city will often reflect the peculiar circumstances of that city, This paper investigates one strategy - sharing of dwelling units - adopted by some middle/low income households in Abuja, Nigeria's new capital, in a situation of rapidly increasing population, high cost of living and inadequate housing provision. It is found that a combination of factors - the inability of most Abuja residents to secure residential accommodation from the dominant but limited public sector supply, cultural factors, the housing allowance policy of government and the fact that many relocatees to Abuja do not bring their families - have made a good number of households favourably disposed towards sharing, an option which keeps the amount spent on housing low but which, in most cases, completely excludes personal comfort. It is recommended that, since standard estimates of affordability often provide little guidance to policy makers, the appropriate strategy in search of sustainable solutions would be to make available a range of housing packages from which households in Abuja will choose, and to make adjustments to regulatory regimes so as not to constrain the production of housing.

AB Objective. To elucidate the morphological and biomechanical manifestation of the triceps surae muscle-tendon unit during passive extension.
   Design. The instantaneous changes within the load-deformation curve of muscle-tendon unit were analyzed by an in vivo rabbit model.
   Background. Although muscle strains occur more frequently than complete failures, the failure mechanism of these sub-failure injuries is rarely investigated. Monitoring of the instantaneous changes in the load-deformation curve allows correlation with the morphological changes that occur during passive extension.
   Methods. After anesthesia, the triceps surae muscle of rabbit was dissected and then stretched to failure by a MTS Bionix 858 machine. The morphological changes in failure patterns were recorded by photographs.
   Results. The morphological and biomechanical manifestations of the triceps surae muscle-tendon unit was divided into five different portions: first, the viscoelastic portion with minimal morphologic change; second, the portion of micro-failure with local ecchymosis; third and fourth, the portions of macrofailure with sequential rupture of the muscle fibers; and filth, the portion of rupture and separation of muscle parenchyma.
   Conclusions. A threshold for stretch-induced injury does exist. The threshold of the initiation of micro-failure in this model was 16.5% of the strain, which corresponded to 16.6% of the maximal sustainable force.
   Relevance
   Elucidation of the existence of micro-failure in skeletal muscle gives a good reference point to determine the functional capabilities and limitation of muscular tissue. With this, the deleterious effect of muscle stretching can be avoided by limiting muscle stretching to below this limit. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Sustainable decision making stands for decision making which contributes to a sustainable society. It should take into account developmental, environmental, social, technical and economic factors. Different models of decision making are presented and discussed in the context of sustainable decision making. The appropriateness of existing decision support systems for sustainable decision making is considered. Examples from the areas of water resources and energy planning and management are presented to illustrate some of the main issues.

AB Bottom trawling and use of other mobile fishing gear have effects on the seabed that resemble forest clearcutting, a terrestrial disturbance recognized as a major threat to biological diversity and economic sustainability. Structures in marine benthic communities are generally much smaller than those in forests, but structural complexity is no less important to their biodiversity. Use of mobile fishing gear crushes, buries, and exposes marine animals and structures on and in the substratum, sharply reducing structural diversity. Its severity is roughly comparable to other natural and anthropogenic marine disturbances. It also alters biogeochemical cycles, perhaps even globally. Recovery after disturbance is often slow because recruitment is patchy and growth to maturity takes years, decades, or more for some structure-forming species. Trawling and dredging are especially problematic where the return interval-the time from one dredging or trawling event to the next-is shorter than the time it takes for the ecosystem to recover; extensive areas can be trawled 100-700% per year or more. The effects of mobile fishing gear on biodiversity are most severe where natural disturbance is least prevalent, particularly on the outer continental shelf and slope, where storm-wave damage is negligible and biological processes, including growth, tend to be slow. Recent advances in fishing technology (e.g., rockhopper gear, global positioning systems, fish finders) have all but eliminated what were de facto refuges from trawling. The frequency of trawling (in percentage of the continental shelf trawled per year) is orders of magnitude higher than other severe seabed disturbances, annually covering an area equivalent to perhaps half of the world's continental shelf, or 150 times the land are that is clearcut yearly. Mobile fishing gear can have large and long-lasting effects on benthic communities, including young stages of commercially important fishes, although some species benefit when structural complexity is reduced. These findings are crucial for implementation of "Essential Fish Habitat" provisions of the U.S. Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act which aim to protect nursery and feeding habitat for commercial fishes. Using a precautionary approach to management, modifying fishing methods, and creating refuges free of mobile fishing gear are ways to reduce effects on biological diversity and commercial fish habitat.

AB Fishing gear is used over large regions of continental shelves worldwide, but studies of the effects of fishing on seafloor habitats are generally conducted on a limited number of sediment types, making the wider application of particular studies difficult. Fishing gear can reduce habitat complexity by smoothing bedforms, removing emergent epifauna, and removing species that produce structures such as burrows. I developed a conceptual model of gear impacts across gradients of habitat complexity and levels of fishing effort to provide a more holistic understanding of the effects of fishing gear. Each habitat type, in an unaffected state, was categorized and scored numerically based on the components of habitat structure. Values for highly affected habitats based on observations, were integrated into the model and represented the most affected state. The model predicts linear reductions in complexity based on linear increases in fishing effort. For example, the complexity value of pebble-cobble with emergent epifauna decreases linearly to half the unaffected value (i.e., 10 to 5) in the most affected condition. Research is needed to refine the model and develop improved predictive capabilities. For example, threshold effects may occur that depend on habitat type, fishing gear and fishing effort Adding feedback loops to the model based on recovery rates of habitats, will greatly increase the value of such models to managers. The model can be used directly for management in the current iteration by adopting a well-conceived adaptive management strategy. The objective of such an approach must include both the sustainable harvest of fishes and the maintenance of biodiversity.

AB Bottom trawling is one of the most disruptive and widespread human-induced Physical disturbances to seabed communities and has become a global environmental concern. We used a comparative approach to test the hypothesis that persistent otter trawling decreases bottom habitat complexity and biodiversity, increases the abundance of opportunistic species, and benefits prey important in the diet of some commercially valuable fish. We compared two similar and adjacent fishing areas at 180 m off central California in Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary: one inside the three-mile coastal zone of restricted fishing with light levels of trawling and one beyond the three-mile limit with high levels of trawling. Differences in fishing effort between the two areas were confirmed and quantified by means of data and tow number statistics from Pacific Fishery Management Council (PFMC) Trawl Logbook records We used still photography, video footage, bottom grab samples, and experimental trawling to compare the physical and biological parameters of the two areas The area with high levels of trawling had significantly more trawl tracks, exposed sediment, and shell fragments and significantly fewer rocks and mounds and less flocculent material than the lightly trawled area Most invertebrate epifauna counted were significantly more abundant in the lightly trawled area. The density of the amphinomid polychaete, Chloeia pinnata, as well as that of oligochaetes, ophiuroids, and nematodes, were higher every year in the highly trawled area and there were significantly fewer polychaete species every year in the highly trawled area. Content analysis of fish guts showed that C. pinnata was a dominant prey item for some of the commercially important flatfishes in both lightly and heavily trawled areas. Our study provides evidence that high levels of trawling can decrease bottom habitat complexity and biodiversity and enhance the abundance of opportunistic species and certain prey important in the diet of some commercially important fishes. Our work also illustrates how constraints currently imposed on fisheries research by the near universal absence of true unfished control sites severely limit our ability to determine appropriate levels of harvest pressure for maintaining sustainable fisheries and marine biodiversity. Valid research in these areas will require marine reserves in which fishing effort and methods can be manipulated in collaborative studies involving fishers, researchers, and resource agencies.

AB The amount of terrestrial protection achieved for biodiversity through designation of no-take public wilderness areas in the United States is much greater than no-take protection in the nation's National Marine Sanctuary System. With the exception of a small area in the Florida Keys, no permanent reserve in the United States protects marine biodiversity from commercial fishing with gear that has strong effects on marine habitats and which has been identified as one of the major threats to marine biodiversity. A recent national poll has shown that public support does exist for conservation of the marine environment and protection of marine biodiversity. The New England region provides examples of the obstacles that such support may face in regions with a long history of commercial exploitation of marine species. I discuss the overall Influence that the commercial fishing industry in New England has had on marine conservation efforts in the region, contrast the public's perception of marine versus terrestrial wildlife species, and describe the nature of the media's coverage of the commercial fishing industry and fisheries management issues in the region. I propose the creation of a national no-take marine wilderness preservation system as a way to achieve protection of marine biodiversity as a separate goal from sustainable fisheries management in New England and other; similar regions in the United States.

AB Two feeding systems (triphasic and monophasic) with three crude protein (CP) levels (high, medium and low) with or without the addition of synthetic amino acids (SAA) dl-methionine and 1-lysine in maize-soybean diets, were evaluated using 2160 broilers of both sexes of the E-24 commercial hybrid, which were distributed according to a completely randomized design with a 2 x 3 x 2 factorial arrangement. In both the triphasic and monophasic systems, the protein level worsened the feed intake/gain ratio (2.39, 2.44 and 2.46) throughout the fattening stage. However, the inclusion of SAA improved this indicator at both the starting (1.93, 2.14 and 2.09 vs. 1.81, 1.79 and 1.76) and growth stages (2.33, 2.50 and 2.39 vs. 2.22, 2.16 and 2.29), while this did nor occur in the finishing stage, in which it provoked an impairment in the main economical indicators. This suggests that the inclusion of SAA is not justified in the finishing stage. There was an interaction between the feeding system used and the inclusion of SAA, where the triphasic system proved to be the most efficient. Also, the cost per Cuban peso produced decreases between 0.02-0.05, with respect to the monophasic system. It is Suggested that it is possible to attain better economical advantages with an adequate strategy from the use of SAA and the triphasic feeding system, taking into account not only the productive but also the economic benefits, thereby contributing to make broiler production more sustainable.

AB The increasing prevalence of Type 2 diabetes mellitus has made diabetes a major public health problem worldwide. Healthcare systems are faced with the major challenge of developing innovative approaches to improving the prevention of diabetes and associated complications, particularly in populations undergoing rapid cultural development. Examples of community-based primary prevention projects in two Native communities in Canada that have high incidences of diabetes are reviewed. These projects are notable for the active participation of the communities, the collaborative relationship that was established between the communities and the researchers, and the way that traditional native culture and beliefs were incorporated into the intervention design. This phenomenon has impacted on the success of the projects and has enhanced their long-term sustainability. (C) 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

SO DISASTERS

DT Article
DE relief-development continuum; aid policy
AB Developmental relief has become the central doctrine of 'good practice' in humanitarian responses to complex political emergencies. This is despite the fact that a proliferation of such emergencies reflects a failure of development for people in those countries in crisis. Drawing on case study material from Sudan, Somalia, Rwanda and Uganda, this paper challenges assumptions made about the efficacy of developmental relief models in complex emergencies. The trend towards developmental relief practices coincides with an increasing acceptance of higher levels of humanitarian distress in Africa. Myths of aid dependency and the pursuit of sustainable programming in the midst of war are linked to a global reduction in aid. The mantra of 'local solutions to local problems' locates the causes of crises firmly within those societies in crisis. It provides a premise for international disengagement, and the denial of international responsibility for the genesis and prolongation of humanitarian crises in Africa. Assigning solutions to the poor, the marginalised and victimised through enhanced 'participation' and local financing of services sustains a myth that development is occurring, when in fact levels of distress are rising.

ID ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
AB An evolutionary economics perspective between technological innovation and public policy is applied to analyse the relationships between technological change, sustainable development and industrial competitiveness. This leads us to emphasise the fundamental role that firm's strategies vis-a-vis the endogenisation of technological change can play for giving effect to 'win-win' strategies. However, allowing industrial competition to become the only factor determining 'win-win' strategies could lead to 'locked' technological and social options being chosen which do not contribute to overall goals of ecological, social and economic sustainability. For this reason we introduce, as complements to competitiveness, the requirement of new forms of governance in pursuit of ecological-economic sustainability. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB This article shows how prevailing World Bank and IMF orthodoxy affects the environment in the South, and offers an analytical methodology for dealing with it. Existing studies and reviews conclude that structural adjustment programmes (SAPs) in developing countries have both negative and positive environmental impacts, and that both types of impacts show great variation. This article summarises the methodological difficulties in environmental impact assessments (EIAs) of SAPs and reports on a study on the environmental impacts of SAPs which took as the entry point of analysis, the three natural resources, soils, water and forests, contrary to other studies on this subject. The methodology developed for this study aimed at generating more specific conclusions for variable ecological regions and social groups. The methodology appears to be a useful starting point to develop practical strategic environmental assessment (SEA) tools for planning SAPs and other policies oriented at sustainable development. Such tools would be applied at the earliest possible stage of development planning, preferably before SAPs are implemented. Available SEA tools and methodologies should be reviewed, adjusted and improved to serve the purpose of identifying the crucial environmental and social issues involved, to be considered during the economic adjustment process, and to identify key sustainability indicators. It can be concluded that the methodology developed for this study has been useful to further clarify and specify environmental impacts of SAPs, and to identify relevant key issues which, in the absence of necessary data, contribute to finding relevant indicators of an efficient monitoring system.

TI Adjusted forest accounts for China

DT Article
DE forest; adjusted forest accounts; China
AB So far there is no unified rule on the incorporation of degradation of environmental capital into national income accounting procedure. Net national product is currently derived by deducting from gross product the depreciation of man-made capital only. Deducting depreciation of natural capital in national income can provide a better indicator of the 'green' net national product. The contribution of this paper is to show how one can use two methodologies in deriving 'green' net national product. This paper estimates the depreciation of forest resources in national accounts for China from 1976 to 1992. The procedure of calculation is described in the paper by valuing the changes of forest resources. Two alternative approaches are used: the net price approach and the user cost approach. By using the net price approach both physical and monetary accounts are computed to derive forest depreciation. In the user cost approach 0, 5 and 10% discount rates an used to derive the depreciation. Measuring sustainability is proceeded by the level of net investment. Both approaches show that the development of the forest sector is not sustainable due to the negative net investment. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A generic methodology is presented for exploration of sustainable land use options at the regional level by quantifying trade-offs between socio-economic and biophysical sustainability objectives. The methodology is called SOLUS (Sustainable Options for Land USe), and was developed over a ten year period of investigation in the Northern Atlantic Zone of Costa Rica. SOLUS includes a linear programming model, technical coefficient generators for livestock and cropping activities and a geographic information system. The linear programming model maximizes regional economic surplus subject to a flexible number of resource and sustainability constraints. Economic sustainability indicators are economic surplus and labor employment, and biophysical ones include soil N, P and K balances, pesticide use and its environmental impact, nutrient losses and a proxy for trace gas emissions. The capabilities of the methodology are illustrated for the Northern Atlantic Zone of Costa Rica. Though ample scope exists for reducing environmental effects and introducing sustainable production systems separately, pursuing both objectives simultaneously, considerably reduces economic surplus and agricultural employment. Agricultural area can be decreased and forested area increased without severely affecting the regional economic surplus. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

   autocorrelation; spatial heterogeneity
ID CATTLE
AB Using gamma distribution and spatial autocorrelation, it was demonstrated that plant biomass per unit area of a pasture grazed by cattle exhibited two kinds of spatial heterogeneity: small-scale heterogeneity caused by grazing and large-scale heterogeneity caused by topography, land aspect, etc. For each of the 10 measurement times from May to August, 100 quadrats 50 cm x 50 cm were arranged along a straight line 50 m long in a pasture, and the plants within the quadrats were harvested at the height of 3 cm above the ground surface to measure the dry weight. The data were aggregated into frequency distributions, and gamma distribution and the parameter values were estimated. This analysis showed that with the progression of grazing the amount of biomass decreased and the degree of spatial heterogeneity in biomass, measured per 0.25 m(2), increased, and due to plant regrowth the trends were reversed. By rearranging the 100 biomass data in order of weight, it was suggested that plots with an extremely large biomass were not grazed by cattle and remained in the pasture. For the same data, variations of biomass along the straight line were divided into two parts based on the moving average: the spatial trend and the residuals which cannot be explained by the trend. In this analysis, 48-75% of the total spatial variation was explained by the trend along the straight line. Analysis using spatial autocorrelation for the actual biomass changes showed that the biomass changes within a range of about 10 m on the straight line gave a positive correlation, which indicates a topographical trend in biomass. Spatial autocorrelation for residuals suggested that the spatial changes in biomass along the straight line followed a wave-like or checker-board pattern. Small-scale spatial heterogeneity in plant biomass may be caused by the uneven deposition of excreta by grazing animals, uneven use of the grassland by grazing animals, and uneven dispersal of plant seeds through faeces over the grassland. The possibility that such unevenness might accelerate energy flow in the grassland ecosystem and contribute to grassland sustainability is discussed.

DE generational accounting; aging of the population; labour participation

AB After 2010 the aging of the population will start to form a sizable burden on public finances. On the other hand, some shifts in the private sector, such as the increase of labour participation, are expected to generate higher tax revenues. These contrasting developments raise the question whether the present system of public arrangements is sustainable in the long run or will, on balance, result in an unfavourable treatment of future generations. This paper, which assigns net public sector benefits to generations, indicates that the present arrangements are unsustainable when indexed to productivity growth. However, the required policy adjustment can be considered small. Because the alleviating factors will occur before the sizeable effects of aging set in, implementing a sustainable system implies a sharp reduction of the budget deficit in the coming decades. The paper uses, and in some ways extends, the standard Generational Accounting methodology as developed by Auerbach, Gokhale, and Kotlikoff.

TI Looking for a path to sustainability in Eastern Siberia
SO ECOSYSTEM HEALTH
LA English
DT Article
ID ENVIRONMENTAL-POLICY; MARKETS
AB The purpose of this work is to describe a version of sustainable development strategy for the so-called "resource dependent territories" (RDT) of Eastern Siberia, which is based on a paradigm of "the infinite value of the integrity of an ecosystem."
   The main feature of RDTs is that the use of nature (natural resources) is practically the only source of economic growth for these regions. This is the result of a long history of previous economic development. RDTs have enormous possibilities both for the destructive and environmentally acceptable use of nature. However, incomes from the destructive use are far greater than those derived from renewable use. The differences often reach two-to-three orders of magnitude. We cannot expect market mechanisms in the economies of the RDTs to guarantee a sustainable use of the environment.
   It is declared a priori that the value of ecosystem integrity is much larger than any benefit from the use of its resources. This paradigm can be supported by a comprehensive system of institutional and legal tools. The main directions of this strategy should be defined as follows:
   Efficient financial tools for "ecological debt" return.
   Institutional procedures for the creation of "a reserved fund of natural capital." This is necessary to prevent areas from irreversible changes.
   Efficient procedure for the identification of some areas as "victims of growth." This means that estimating restoration costs to establish an integral ecosystem must be one of the priorities of the decision-making process.
   Financial and institutional mechanisms of overcoming the "investment barrier" to make natural resources available for sustainable use. This would allow the transfer of the "reserved fund" to the "assets of natural capital".

TI A concept of integrated water management illustrated for Flanders
   (Belgium)
SO ECOSYSTEM HEALTH
LA English
DT Article
AB Integrated catchment management (ICM) is an application of the concept of sustainable development for aquatic ecosystems. It aims at developing, maintaining, and restoring the water system to reach the quality objectives of multifunctional use for this generation without compromising the uses for future generations. The quality objectives should be based on sufficient ecosystem knowledge. ICM demands a solid and workable framework built on the integration of knowledge and organizational integration which are supported by statutory rules and (international) regulations. In Flanders, future legal support will be based on both the framework for water action plans proposed by the European Commission, and a Flemish decree concerning integrated water management. The overview given for ecosystem knowledge is (on a Flemish scale) based on data networks. The interrelation and processing of large data sets deliver basic knowledge to build up policy visions for land-use planning and environmental planning. Organizational integration will be worked out on two levels: an Integrated Water Consultation Committee on a Flemish level (13,806 km(2)) will work out the outlines and examine the sector-oriented long-term demand for water; and Catchment Committees on a subbasin level (scale: 700-2300 km(2)) will bring together the relevant parties and work out integrated catchment plans (ICP). Bringing together the administrations of Environmental Planning and Town and Country Planning around one vision, with a balanced multifunctional use, is one of the biggest challenges of ICP in Flanders.

AB Energy-efficient, economical and durable building materials are essential for sustainable construction practices. The paper deals with production and properties of energy-efficient steam-cured stabilised soil blocks used fbr masonry construction. Problems of mixing expansive soil and lime, and production of blocks using soil-lime mixtures have been discussed briefly. Details of steam curing of stabilised soil blocks and properties of such blocks are given. A comparison of energy content of steam-cured soil blocks and burnt bricks is presented. It has been shown that energy-efficient steam cured soil blocks (consuming 35% less thermal energy compared to burnt clay bricks) having high compressive strength can be easily produced in a decentralised manner.

AB In this paper I address the issue of incorporating environmental sustainability in project appraisal. I extend the results of Barbier, Markandya, and Pearce on 'operationalizing' a concept of sustainability into appraisal methods for practical decisionmaking. I generalize their results in two directions. First, I abandon their implicit assumption that benefits and costs of a given project in a given period depend only on the level of activity of the project in the same period. Second, I address the issue of which portfolio of projects to choose. My results show how to modify the net present value criterion for choosing a set of projects in the presence of a sustainability constraint.

AB 'Sustainable use' of wildlife resources and 'community based conservation' are two themes recurrent in contemporary statements of wildlife conservation policy, and their use is,in response to a perceived 'deep conservation crisis' which has;in part arisen from exclusionary and restrictive conservation practices. The extent to which the legal harvest of marine turtle eggs in Ostional, Costa Rica, is an example of sustainable use and community based conservation is evaluated in this paper. Field research using in-depth interviewing and a household questionnaire was undertaken in Ostional during 1994 and 1995, to investigate local perceptions of the egg harvesting project, both positive and negative. Socio-economic benefits from, and legal and administrative structures supporting, the project were found to be fundamental to community support for a limited egg harvest and allowed for community participation in, and control of, resource use. Participation and control were key to local support for conservation of nesting marine turtles and their eggs. Attempts to use wildlife sustainably must be considered on a case by case basis, to account for the biological nature of the wildlife resource and environment in question and for local socio-economic, political and historical conditions. Nevertheless, some of the lessons learned from the attempt to implement sustainable use and community based conservation in Ostional may be more widely generalized, and may help inform other efforts to reconcile wildlife conservation objectives with local development needs.

AB Common lands, being a significant form of natural resource endowment in many developing countries, play a vital role in maintaining the ecological balance, and more particularly in supporting the people, especially the rural poor, in eking out their livelihood. However, the contributions of common lands to the rural economy and ecology have remained unappreciated which has led to the depletion and degradation of these lands. In an attempt to examine the nature and extent of contribution of common lands to household economies, 432 sample households from eight sample villages across four ecological regions in Haryana, northwest India, were surveyed using a structured questionnaire during 1995. We found that common lands still hold an important place in the household economy of rural people of this state. A significant proportion of the sample households obtained substantial biomass resources, income and employment from common lands. The contributions of these lands in terms of variety and extent were many times higher in the households belonging to less developed than developed regions, and those households belonging to poor than wealthy classes. Hence, there is an immediate need to develop effective strategies for the regeneration and sustainable use and management of common lands.

DT Article
AB Humans have largely transformed the natural environment and there is scarcely an area of the world which has not been affected by human activity. Human domination of the environment, in particular by the creation of infrastructure, urbanization, and conversion to agriculture, has mostly proceeded in an unplanned and frequently destructive manner. Almost fifty percent of humans already live in cities and this proportion will continue to grow. However, issues of urbanization are little addressed in the environmental philosophical literature. I explore community and sustainability in an urban context, drawing on the work of the landscape architect lan McHarg who, I argue, may have more to offer an urbanized world than iconic figures such as Aldo Leopold.

TI Reversing desertification by using dam reservoir sediments as

SO EPISODES
LA English
DT Article
AB Bottom sediments from two reservoirs in South Portugal were subject to chemical, physical and mineralogical study to test their suitability for agricultural use. In spite of-large differences in geomorphic characteristics and lithology of-the drainage basin, they have high levels of total, exchangeable and soluble forms of nutritional elements much needed for sustainable food-fibre production Comparing our results with natural soils, we conclude that sandy sediments could be good agricultural soils on their own and the more clayey varieties, fertilizers for low quality soils. If sediment removal from the reservoirs becomes economically feasible, the suitability for agricultural use may eventually salve some classical problems such as: (I) the period of life of dam reservoirs filled with sediments, (2) the water quality and (3) the scarcity of-soils in some regions, turning a global problem into a global resource.

AB The fresh-water clam Polymesoda solida (Philippi, 1846) is the principal fishery resource in the Cienaga Poza Verde, Salamanca Island, Colombian Caribbean Sea. Between July 1995 and June 1996, samples were taken to study reproduction, growth, mortality, production and fishery aspects of this population. P. solida is monoecious (hermaphroditic) combined with protogyny. We found an arrhythmic reproductive cycle with several spawning events per year, which could be related to the salinity cycle. The growth parameters of the von Bertalanffy growth equation were: L-infinity = 47.3 mm and K = 0.204 yr(-1). The following mortality rates were estimated: total mortality, Z = 0.748, mean natural mortality, (M) over bar = 0.210 and fishing mortality F = 0.538 yr(-1). Somatic production of the population (in g AFDW m(-2) yr(-1)), and the productivity(P/(B) over bar) were 0.647 and 0.230 respectively. P. solida is exploited in an artisanal (small-scale) fishery by approximately 80 fishermen. During the study period, mean daily catch was calculated as 314.4 kg shell free wet weight, and mean effort as 42 fishermen per day. Maximum exploitation rate, corresponding to the maximum relative yield per recruit and calculated with the relative yield per recruit model of Beverton and Holt, was E-max = 0.445. The observed exploitation rate (E = 0.719), calculated from fishing mortality, F and total mortality, Z, indicates overexploitation. A reduction of the fishing effort therefore is strongly suggested, to achieve a sustainable exploitation. (C) 1998 Published by Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We present the hydrometeorology of eastern Asia during April 1995 simulated by the Regional Climate System Model. The amount and location of simulated monthly precipitation agrees well with observations. Soil water content variation was closely correlated with precipitation. Land-surface evaporation and the surface energy budget were strongly controlled by soil moisture content. A sensitivity test with reduced initial soil moisture content suggested that near-surface soil moisture spins up quickly after heavy precipitation events. However, variations in the initial soil moisture field may alter details of the simulated precipitation which can introduce further complexity in climate simulations. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

DE globalization; villages; urbanization; environment; migration
AB The discourse on habitat and human settlements is increasingly dominated by that of the global, mega city. If the aim of those of us in the human settlements held is to improve our understanding of, and action on habitat and human settlements, this, often exclusive, focus is a mistake. Our habitat is better understood and acted upon as a network of interwoven settlements and surrounding countrysides, large and small, themselves interwoven within our larger ecosystem. In this network the habitat of our smaller settlements (smaller cities, towns, villages) and rural areas - our global village - also plays a critical role.
   The assumption can be challenged that urbanization and the megacity are the critical issues of habitat and human settlements. Evidence suggests that with some urbanization there is also counter urbanization, the ruralization of cities, and, perhaps most important, a growing rurbanization as city - country interactions intensify. Habitat for all and habitat for a healthy, sustainable planet demands our openness to these new concepts and realities. It demands an integrated, balanced, approach which helps a wide range of living settlement nodes, large and small, to nurture each other. Global City and Global Village must go hand in hand. Our planetary and human health depends on it. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The beehive domed vernacular houses of Harran, Turkey were studied from the point of view of historical origin. The factors like climate, social and urban structure, spatial organization, construction and materials which effected the form of the buildings were considered. It has been discovered through this study that Harran houses can be built rapidly like tents, with burnt or sun-dried shallow bricks. Vernacular architecture of Harran illustrates the concepts of flexible building, climatic building design and re-usable building materials concepts. Possibilities of using this construction type in our times is discussed. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

SO HABITAT INTERNATIONAL

DE building materials; timber; wood markets; Mali
AB This paper investigates the supply networks, the structure and operation of the markets and the increasing scarcity of good quality construction poles and hewn construction timber in Mopti, Mall. Using a variety of rapid appraisal methods the research identified separate groups of agents performing retailing, transporting and wood cutting functions within the supply network. A survey of the retail sector of the open or organised wood market in Mopti found the market to involve lower than expected volumes of timber and higher than expected mark-up variability across retailers and products. It was found that some users of construction wood do not buy their wood in the open market. The paper discusses one alternative method of obtaining wood involving the formation of a rural-urban solidarity network in which wood is 'traded' for various forms of help and assistance. The paper concludes that the re-empowerment of local-communities so that they can manage and benefit from natural resources under their jurisdiction is probably a necessary condition for sustainable improvements in the supply of construction wood to Mopti. However, additional measures may be needed to replenish the stock of trees and human and institutional capital in the wood supply areas. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI The costs of hospital services: a case study of Evangelical Lutheran
   Church hospitals in Tanzania
SO HEALTH POLICY AND PLANNING
LA English
DT Article
AB The health care systems of many developing countries are facing a severe crisis. Problems of financing services leads to high patient fees which make institutions of Western health care unaffordable for the majority of the rural poor. The conflict between sustainability and affordability of the official health care system challenges both local decision-makers and health management consultants. Decisions must be made soon so that the existing health care systems can survive. However, these decisions must be based on sound data, especially on the costs of health care services. The existing accounting systems of most hospitals in developing countries do not provide decision-makers with these data. Costs are generally underestimated.
   The leadership of the 16 hospitals of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Tanzania is currently analyzing how the existing health care services should be restructured. Therefore, reliable estimates of the costs of hospitals services are required. A survey on 'Costing of health services of the Evang. Luth. Church in Tanzania' was prepared, which summarizes the results of seven months of field investigations in Lutheran hospitals. The major findings are that the costs of providing adequate services are much higher than expected. The most important factors determining these costs are the administrative efficiency of the hospital and the scope of services offered.
   The paper closes with some recommendations on how to improve the services in order to make them both affordable for the rural poor and financially sustainable for the Church. It is concluded that even the best improvement of technical efficiency will not safeguard the survival of the hospital-based health care services of the Lutheran Church in Tanzania. These findings call for a reallocation of health care resources to lower levels of the health care pyramid.

TI State-led transformation and economic growth in Central Asia: From plan
   to industrial policy
SO HITOTSUBASHI JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS
LA English
DT Article
AB The article explains differences of initial conditions between countries of Eastern Europe and the former USSR, and argues that: 1) the strengthening of sovereign states in the latter has objectively been the first priority since their independence, the speed and sequence of market reforms and the opening economy has been subordinated to this task; 2) the pace and character of the reforms depends on the specific circumstances in the country, but their respective economic and social costs is the main criteria; 3) economic growth both negative and positive in a new independent country is the cumulative result of various factors, and could not be explained as the sole outcome of transition. Analysis of reforms and economic growth in five independent states of Central Asia proves these arguments and gives evidence, that state-led gradual transition and integration to the world market in Uzbekistan has been the least costly and more fruitful in terms of economic growth and sustainable human development.

Farmers' options in responding to declining soil fertility or shortage of land vary from village to village and even household to household. Responses are conditioned by social relations with neighboring villages and the labor availability of individual households. The example from the Boulgou Province in Burkina Faso shows that some farmers have been able to expand their acreage in other villages' territories on a virtually permanent basis, thereby compensating for increased population pressure and for land degradation. Currently labor availability, social relations, and distance to the land seem to be the main constraints on land expansion. However the pattern of land use changes is expected to be increasingly influenced by; the existence of more formally established rights than at present. In the light of the empirical findings, the relevance of the "Gestion des Terroir Villagois" concept as a tool for planning for sustainable natural resource management at the village level is discussed. This approach seems imperfectly suited to address a reality in which social and physical environments are superimposed in a spatially complex way.

ID ASSURANCE
AB Community-based management is increasingly viewed as the most appropriate arrangement for promoting sustainable development of natural resources, A common assumption is that the values of community members, often assumed to be homogeneous, foster successful outcomes. However analysts often treat these values and their homogeneity as exogenous factors, ignoring the community's potential role in managing members' values. This study of community-based forest management in two southern Indiana sites examines how the members of the two communities created institutions to screen, maintain, and defend their values. Analysis reveals that different institutions shaped members' preferences and led to different levels of community stability, conflict management, and natural resource condition. We argue that understanding community-based management processes and outcomes requires careful attention to how institutions facilitate or hamper the construction of community members' values.

ID RECRUITMENT; STOCK; COLLAPSE; FISHERIES; CATCH
AB The spawning stock biomass of cod, Gadus morhua, in the North Sea has been in decline for many years. There is evidence that at low stock sizes recruitment is reduced. Using non-parametric methods, equilibrium spawning stock biomass and yield curves are constructed, which are consistent with annual observations that show the continuous decline in the spawning stock can be explained by high fishing mortality rates. A new reference point, G(loss), is defined, which corresponds to the stock replacement line at the lowest observed spawning stock size. Recent fishing mortality rates yield replacement lines with a high probability of exceeding G(loss) and therefore indicate there is a high probability of further stock decline and a possibility of collapse. The replacement line is very sensitive to fishing mortality rate which makes managing the stock at high rates of exploitation risky. A reduction in fishing mortality rate by approximately 30-40% is required to ensure the probability of collapse is small. (C) 1998 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.

AB An experiment was conducted during rainy and winter seasons of 1994-95 and 1995-96 at Karimnagar, to find out a suitable and profitable rainy-season maize (Zea mays L.)-based cropping system for sandy-loam soils of Sri Ram Sagar Project Command areas of Andhra Pradesh. The treatments consisted of maize-maize, maize-groundnut (Arachis hypogaea L.), maize-sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.), maize-Indian mustard [Brassica juncea (L,) Czerry. & Cosson], maize-sesame (Sesamum indicum L,), maize-greengram (Phaseolus radiatus L,) and maize-pigeonpea [Cajanus cajan (L.) Millsp.]. Pooled data revealed that maximum maize-grain equivalent was recorded in maize-groundnut cropping system (140.5 q/ha) and was significantly superior to that of remaining cropping systems. The lowest maize-grain equivalent (65.5 q/ha) was found under maize-sesame cropping system. Production efficiency based on 2 crops duration in a year was found highest with maize-pigeonpea, followed by maize-maize and maize-groundnut. The sustainable index based on yield and value, net return/ha, return/ha/day and benefit : cost ratio were found maximum with maize-groundnut cropping system. Therefore the rainy-season maize followed by groundnut was found the most profitable and viable cropping system.

AB A field experiment was conducted during the spring season of 1995 and 1996 at Baruipur, to study the productivity and economic profitability of sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.)-based intercropping systems on rice (Oryza sativa L.) fallow genetic alluvial land. Intercropping of groundnut (Arachis hypogaea L.) with normal planting of sunflower was found beneficial and sustainable over sole cropping of sunflower. Among the intercrop associations. normal row (45 cm) planting of sunflower with groundnut resulted in maximum sunflower-equivalent yield (26.05 q/ha), land-equivalent ratio (1.52), monetary advantage (Rs 6,238/ha), net return (Rs 9,130/ha), income-equivalent ratio (2.36) and indicated a modest aggressivity factor (+/- 0.16), competitive ratio (1.23 : 0.87) and gave a good value for the product of crowding coefficient (K 11.51) and area-time equivalent ratio (1.37), which proved most efficient system among ail the intercropping systems.

AB The information industry assumes that information is seen as a valued resource that enables organizations and individuals to improve their effectiveness, efficiency, and overall competitiveness. For the information industry to bridge rather than divide further the global economy to information rich and information poor, we need to understand how firms, particularly local firms, can pioneer or participate in the information industry in emerging economies that do not inherently embrace information as a valued business resource. This research examines how one local firm shaped the external environment to pioneer a local information industry in Mexico and how it competes in a newly opened local market against foreign competitors. In doing so, the paper extends the resource-based view of the firm to a developing country context. The dynamic capabilities of strategic foresight and flexibility, coupled with a core competency of trustworthiness, are found to be critical in effecting internal and external change in an unstable environment.

AB Problems with energy supply and use are related not only to global warming, but also to such environmental concerns as air pollution, ozone depletion forest destruction and emission of radioactive substances. These issues must be taken into consideration simultaneously if humanity is to achieve a bright energy future with minimal environmental impacts. Much evidence exists which suggests that the future will be negatively impacted if humans keep degrading the environment. There is an intimate connection between energy, the environment and sustainable development. A society seeking sustainable development ideally must utilize only energy resources which cause no environmental impact (e.g. which release no emissions to the environment). However, since all energy resources lead to some environmental impact, it is reasonable to suggest that some (not all) of the concerns regarding the limitations imposed on sustainable development by environmental emissions and their negative impacts can be in part overcome through increased energy efficiency. A strong relation clearly exists between energy efficiency and environmental impact since, for the same services or products, less resource utilization and pollution is normally associated with higher efficiency processes. Anticipated patterns of future energy use and consequent environmental impact (focusing on acid precipitation, stratospheric ozone depletion and the greenhouse effect) are comprehensively discussed in this paper. Also, some solutions to current environmental issues in terms of energy conservation and renewable energy technologies are identified and some theoretical and practical limitations on increased energy efficiency are explained. The relations between energy and sustainable development, and between the environment and sustainable development, are described, and an illustrative example is presented. Throughout the paper several issues relating to energy, environment and sustainable development are examined from both current and future perspectives. Finally, several conclusions and recommendations are drawn which may be useful to energy scientists and engineers and policy makers. (C) 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

DE industrial ecology; sustainability; analogies; innovative interfirm
   interactions
AB Industrial ecology is assumed as a conceptual tool emulating models derived from natural systems and it is aimed at developing fundamentally new approaches to the industrial system environmentally-oriented reorganization. It implies two essential elements of definition: it is a concept involving a systemic approach to changes in goods manufacture, use and disposal and it is a concept related to the organization of new interactions among the industrial system structural components. Starting from these assumptions, this paper opens three possible paths to the theoretical implications of such a perspective:
   (1) The need to conceive sustainable industrial growth as a process of co-adaptation between natural and industrial systems;
   (2) The need for a better definition of the 'environment' of a manufacturing system;
   (3) The possibility of designing innovative interactions for manufacturers, consumers and decomposers as structural components of the industrial ecosystem.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND WORLD ECOLOGY

DT Article
DE chainsaws; lumber; economics; forest sustainability
AB The structure, conduct and performance, and the environmental impacts of the chainsaw lumber production sector in Guyana are investigated. Chainsaws are a highly mobile lumber technology that is used to rip or produce lumber within the forest. Chainsaw lumbering operations have become the dominant lumber producer for the domestic market. Production costs are only 53% of wholesale lumber prices. On a m(3) basis, chainsaw operations' net profit is 80% of the gross price paid for logs at sawmills and more than twice the profit of firms engaged in the harvesting and transportation of logs to sawmills. Sawmills recognize this cost advantage and are increasingly using chainsaws in the production of lumber.
   The handling and transportation of chainsawn lumber within the forest is environmentally less damaging than log production. The log recovery rate is 10-15% for chainsaw operations, as compared to the sawmill average of 40-45%. Log residue from chainsaw operations is left within the forest which promotes faster forest regrowth, while that at sawmills is wasted. Chainsaw operations harvest immature trees, engage in the harvesting of selective species, over-harvest trees per unit area of land, and engage in frequent re-entry of the forest. Because of these practices, the chainsaw lumber sector is not environmentally sustainable and will require regulation. Policies that follow a non-market solution will be required in regulation.

AB In extolling the virtues of the city, it is often suggested that city life represents the highest and most tangible manifestation of our achievements as a society. It is the city, it is argued, that defines civilisation and yet, as we approach the new millennium, much of the world's urban population is still living in extreme poverty in the so-called Third World. Squatting has become the rule rather than the exception, highlighting the impotence of traditional planning paradigms as settlements spiral out of control in a state of what is sometimes referred to as over-urbanisation. In the past, planners have responded to the resulting problems by being too prescriptive, often attempting to enforce a regime of controls based on quite unrealistic development standards, when what is actually required is the implementation of more responsive, adaptive and technologically appropriate policies.
   This paper describes an attempt to produce such policies, and is based on a World Bank project to prepare a development plan for Mbabane, the capital of Swaziland. In an innovative approach to development control more appropriate to the needs of the rapid growth and sprawl so characteristic of Third World cities, the study team experimented with a hierarchy of area-specific controls, differentiated in implementation according to a particular locality's physical, social and economic characteristics. Whilst some areas were subject to the rigidities of traditional toning, others were subject to less restrictive constraints including some 'zero based regulation areas' which were almost completely permissive. The result was a far more flexible development code in which policy was guided by functionally related planning parameters rather than normative standards, enabling the planners to explicitly embrace the informal sector in a more inclusive and sustainable attempt to control the rate and pattern of urbanisation.

ID HUMAN APPROPRIATION
AB In this article the notions of 'societal metabolism' and 'colonization of nature' are used to describe the inter-relations between societies and their natural environment in order to operationalize the concept of 'sustainable development'. Metabolism refers to the material and energetic input-output processes of societies, i.e, the extraction of natural resources, their processing, storage within society, and finally their release as wastes and emissions. 'Colonization of nature' refers to activities which deliberately alter natural systems and keep them in a societally desired state. We empirically analyse the metabolism of five industrial countries. Their per capita material consumption is similar enough to support the notion of a 'characteristic metabolic profile' of industrial society, which can be viewed in a historical perspective against the metabolism of hunter-and-gatherer and agrarian societies, revealing an impressive increase. We then analyse the inter-relations between a society's energetic metabolism and the need as well as the limitations of its colonization strategies. For example, we discuss how the biomass productivity of plants limits the energy flow of agrarian societies and globally may limit population growth. Finally, we discuss how industrial societies might perceive their sustainability problems and respond to them.

SO INTERNATIONAL SOCIOLOGY

DT Article
DE global climate change; global environmental change; global inequalities;
   North/South relations
AB Global environmental change (GEC) carries serious implications for developing countries and for North/South relations. The article argues that global inequalities need to be understood against the background of structural adjustment and indebtedness that characterized the 1980s. Environmental policy priorities are largely concerned with Livelihood sustainability in the South, rather than the longer-term risks usually associated with GEC. However, the 'global' agenda of climate change, biodiversity loss and deforestation is intimately linked to the everyday livelihood concerns of poor people in developing countries. Looked at from the perspective of the South there are serious difficulties in agreeing to take measures to reduce atmospheric emissions when the 'problem' was not one of their making. The authors conclude that, for this reason alone, a real global contract will need to address underlying 'development' issues, principally poverty, before the global concerns of the North can be successfully met.

AB Geothermal energy is available at many locations on the earth's surface. This clean and reliable energy has enormous potential and can be used to partially replace the conventional fuels that are currently used; the total magnitude of this resource is much larger than the potential contained in all of the fossil and uranium reserves worldwide. Geothermal energy will become increasingly significant during the ne;uf century; enhanced thermal energy R&D is expected to lend to commercial development same time after 2010, depending on energy costs at that time.

SO JOURNAL OF ANIMAL BREEDING AND GENETICS-ZEITSCHRIFT FUR TIERZUCHTUNG UND

LA English
DT Article
AB Interest in molecular biology and cloning of animals is high. It is widely predicted that biotechnological improvements will revolutionize animal production on farms. The environment, as a constraint, is usually ignored. Yet, as organisms need environmental resources to live, there must come a point above which the genetically improved animals are no longer economically sustainable in farm environments. This recognition may be more important than ethical questions about biotechnology. This paper presents a fundamental theorem about natural selection and 'improvement' of organisms. This shows that, in evolution and on farms, the environment usually limits organisms and that, as a direct consequence, 'improvement of genotypes' beyond this limit is pointless, and does not occur in evolution.

AB Conservation and sustainable use of crop plant genetic resources are presently of great importance for global agriculture. The rapid spread of high-yielding varieties in the last decades has greatly narrowed the genetic diversity of all cultivated crops, among them cultivated barley (Hordeum vulgare L.). The preservation and use of the diverse germ plasm in ex situ and bl situ collections of wild barley species serve to safeguard genetic vulnerabilities caused by diseases, insects and abiotic stresses. Exotic germplasm in Hordeum species provides a huge presently existing genetic reservoir for breeding of cultivated barley.

AB Agri-environment schemes were first launched in England in 1987. A number of schemes are now operated by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food that invite farmers and landowners to enter formal agreements to change their management practices in order to achieve a range of nature, landscape and archaeological conservation objectives. Agreements are based on payments to compensate for loss of income incurred by adopting less intensive, low-input practices that offer potential benefits for biodiversity conservation within agricultural landscapes. The UK Government's response to the Convention on Biological Diversity has included producing a list of priority species and habitats for conservation action. Each of these has its own detailed action plan, including time-limited targets. A significant proportion of these targets can at least in part be met through the agri-environment schemes; the way this is being done is illustrated through examples of lowland heathland and a bird? the cirl bunting Emberiza cirlus. Linking of biodiversity and agri-environment objectives is an important step towards achieving a more sustainable agriculture.

AB 1. From an ecological and environmental point of view, livestock husbandry plays a very important role as there is a valuable interaction between livestock and natural resources. The objective of this paper is to demonstrate the implications of livestock production systems of mountain areas of Greece for conservation ecology and pastureland biodiversity.
   2. Overgrazing of some mountain pastures and undergrazing of others, due to the depopulation of these environmentally difficult areas, have resulted in degradation of these areas. The relationship between livestock production and nature conservation is, by its nature, complex, delicate and sensitive to local conditions. The particular combination of farming practices used can be crucial in determining the biological richness of different sites. Low-intensity livestock systems - with low use of nutrient and agrochemical inputs, relative abundance of semi-natural vegetation and relative stability of good management practices - can make a positive contribution to the nature resource base by enhancing soil quality and increasing biodiversity. Ecological studies to determine optimum stocking densities in each region should be carried out with parallel adjustment in pastureland management regulations and in incentives given to farmers, in order to facilitate sustainability, biodiversity and nature conservation.

AB Over the years, diseases and epizootics have caused significant production losses to the East-growing aquaculture sector and to the natural aquatic populations in the wild. As a result, disease control and health management have been considered as key contributors to aquaculture sustainability. The risk of diseases and pathogen transfer through trans-boundary movement of infected animals, risk of aquatic environmental pollution, risk to human health and environment due to excessive use of chemicals and drugs, underdeveloped genetic improvement and broodstock management programmes, and lack of adequate knowledge on the role of good nutrition in aquatic animal health management have been identified as key constraints to realizing the full potential of aquaculture. Implementation of the 'systems-approach' has been recognized as an effective means of overcoming such constraints, and strong international cooperation is required to achieve this and the Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries (CCRF) provides a platform for such cooperation. Guidelines for the implementation of CCRF are envisaged to provide a range of technical, legal, and economic options and tools to the concerned parties to assist rectifying the above shortfalls. However, such technical guidelines, which could be practically applied within developing country situations, can only be developed once adequate information and appropriate technologies are available, and all stakeholders agree to cooperate and collaborate closely. Therefore, considering (a) the need for the developed countries to cooperate on the health management for sustainable aquaculture development in developing countries and (b) the role that the CCRF can play towards achieving responsible aquaculture, this paper describes the possible investment opportunities, which are mutually beneficial to both the developed and developing countries. It emphasizes in particular the collaboration on investment for development and transfer of technologies appropriate for developing countries.

AB Traditional production systems rely on extensive management regimes that involve low stocking densities and input levels. In recent years, however, the aquaculture industry has evolved into a major force in the regional aquatic economy. As a consequence, a major structural change has occurred, leading to capital intensive production systems with high stocking densities and high operating costs. While this structural change has enabled many Asian countries to increase their aquaculture production multifold, it has not been without environmental and socio-economic impacts; among the most important are increasing fish health issues. Fish diseases are the major risk factor in commercial aquaculture, with millions of dollars lost annually. There is a tendency for epizootic outbreaks to spread to other areas; lack of knowledge on the aetiology and spread of these fish diseases requires much research. A case in point is epizootic ulcerative syndrome (EUS). Despite regional collaborative research efforts from Australia to India over the last 6 years, scientists have still not been able to establish the primary factor behind this disease. As this example shows, the lack of knowledge in fish health remains a major constraint in the development of the regional aquaculture industry. This paper identifies long-term measures that producing countries must implement to ensure the sustainability of the industry. These include quarantine systems to prevent the spread of exotic pathogens, together with diagnostic services. There is also an urgent need to improve husbandry techniques to reduce fish stress, and to train operating personnel adequately.

AB While-spot disease is a relatively recent but widespread epizootic of cultured shrimp in Asia. This epizootic probably began in China in 1993 and subsequently spread from there to Japan, Taiwan, and the rest of Asia as far as India. Pond-side losses in 1996 in Thailand alone reached approximately 70000 metric tonnes, valued at over half a billion US dollars. For all of Asia, the loss must amount to several billion dollars. The Asian science community reacted quickly to this disease outbreak. Within one year; the causative agent was identified as a bacilliform virus and within 3 years diagnostic DNA probes had been developed by several groups working in Japan, Taiwan, and Thailand. The virus has been included in the nonclassified virus group and is now generally referred to as white-spot syndrome virus (WSSV). Previous experience with another serious epizootic caused by yellow-head virus (YHV) helped to prime the science community for the advent of WSSV. Using the DNA diagnostic probes developed, many sources of WSSV were identified. The list now includes over 40 reservoir crustaceans and perhaps even aquatic insects. All of the commonly cultivated shrimp in Asia can be infected with the virus and for many, the infection can be deadly. In addition to noncultivated carriers, the postlarvae used to stock rearing ponds have also been found to be potential sources of rearing pond contamination. Knowledge of the virus and its host species has brought about revolutionary changes in hatchery and farming practice, in order to implement preventive measures. These include the use of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technology to screen broodstock and larvae, and the widespread adoption of closed or semiclosed cultivation. It is believed that without widespread application of these and other preventive measures, the losses in Thailand in 1996 would have been much higher. The WSSV epizootic has increased the awareness of the shrimp farming industry to the urgent need for further research and development work, if the shrimp industry is to become sustainable. Prime needs include domestication of broodstock leading to breeding programs; a better understanding of shrimp defences against disease; a better understanding of shrimp nutrition; and a better understanding of the shrimp pond environment so that growth can be optimized and negative impacts on the environment eliminated.

TI Allelopathic potential of Acacia confusa and related species in Taiwan
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL ECOLOGY

DT Article
DE Acacia confusa; allelopathy; phytotoxicity; phytotoxin; phenolics;
   flavonoids; herbicide; sustainable agriculture
AB Acacia confusa tan endemic species) and other introduced species, namely A. aulacocarpa, A. auricumiformis, A. cincinnata, A. crassicarpa, A. leptocarpa, A. margium, A. polystachya, and A. torfilis were evaluated for allelopathic potential. Among these, A. confusa is widely distributed on the hills and lowlands of Taiwn and often exhibits a unique pattern of weed exclusion under stands. Four study sites were selected. Field observations and measurements were carried out at sites that exhibited relatively pure stands of A. confusa. Although the diversity of understory species was comparatively higher in Acacia stands than in adjacent weedy sites, the total coverage and biomass of understory plants was significantly lower than in control sites. Aqueous extracts (0.5%, 1%, 2%, 3%, 4%, and 5%) of dry leaves and litter of Acacia confusa and other species collected from various sites and dates were bioassayed using lettuce, alfalfa, and Chinese cabbage to examine their phytotoxicity. Most extracts exhibited phytotoxicity even at a concentration as low as 0.5%. Inhibition of radicle growth of test plants varied with sampling sites and dates. Bioassay with 5% extracts or above produced more than 85% inhibition of test plants regardless of habitat. In addition, surface soils collected from the upper 20 cm layer of Acacia stands revealed significant inhibition as compared with adjacent grassland control soils. The most inhibitory compounds isolated from the ether fraction of aqueous extracts were identified as: ferulic, vanillic, caffeic, gallic, m-hydroxybenzoic, and m-hydroxyphenylacetic acids. Unidentified flavonoids were also found. Chromatographic bioassays of compounds isolated from both ethyl acetate and water fractions of methanolic extracts of Acacia leaves also showed significant phytotoxicity but none was found in the fractions of chloroform and hexane, suggesting the phytotoxic compounds present in Acacia plants are water soluble.

ID PANEL DATA; INDUSTRIES; POLICY
AB This paper provides an estimate of the production cost of losses in official working hours and of utilization-adjusted productivity growth using robust methods on a panel of industry-region data for Indian manufacturing in the 1980s. Time losses such as arise on account of power cuts and materials shortages appear to have cost the economy a sixth of its potential manufacturing output in 1979. Concomitant with deregulation and increased public investment in infrastructure in the 1980s, there was a significant recuperation of lost time. Although this contributed 25% of the observed acceleration in output, it has escaped notice so far. Recognizing the increase in factor utilization produces more modest estimates of productivity growth and casts doubt on its sustainability. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Income and employment effects of micro-credit programmes: Village-level
   evidence from Bangladesh
SO JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
AB Micro-credit programmes, having made their mark in providing credit and other development services to the poor in a non-traditional way, are able to make significant changes in a rural economy. This article attempts to quantify the village-level impacts of the three most important micro-credit programmes of Bangladesh, namely Grameen Bank, Bangladesh Rural Advancement Committee (BRAC), and Bangladesh Rural Development Board's (BRDB) RD-12 project. Descriptive and econometric analyses show that these programmes have positive impacts on income, production, and employment, particularly, in the rural non-farm sector Also, growth in self-employment has been achieved at the expense of wage employment, which implies an increase in rural wages. The article emphasises that an upward shift in the labour demand curve is required for both improved productivity and wage gains on a sustainable basis, which can only, be supported through a structural transformation of the rural economy.

TI The contribution of forums to rural sustainable development: a
   preliminary evaluation
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
DE forum; sustainability; networks; participation; vulnerability;
   evaluation
AB This paper assesses the contribution that forums have made in progressing sustainable land use policies and decisions within rural Wales. The examples of Cardigan Bay Forum and Wales Rural Forum are used to show how sustainability has been addressed within their overall agendas.
   The contemporary debate about sustainable development has provoked a new organizational response with forums visible in many activities and initiatives. The traditional adversarial approach between groups has been replaced by a more sophisticated and complex assemblage of bodies that together create the forum ideal. Consensus, partnership and mutual understanding form the language of this new discourse.
   However their presence raises certain key questions as to their role, purpose, representativeness and value in rural resource management debates. These questions have not been considered in the literature, and with the increasing proliferation of forums generally, there is a need to assess whether they are bringing about real and effective change.
   The two examples reveal clear evidence of forums as agents of change. However; there is considerable tension within both forums, within a climate of financial and membership vulnerability, between the need for involving all legitimate interests and the need to achieve meaningful outcomes for individual members. Such tension goes to the heart of who the two forums actually represent and their resulting actions. The way that these tensions have been reconciled lie at the heart of the forum phenomenon.

SO JOURNAL OF FORESTRY

DT Article
AB Women in Puerto Jimenez, Costa Rica, have emerged as leaders in local organizations to promote conservation and management of forest resources. Questionnaires and inter: views with a group of these women reveal that they understand the link between the state of the forests and water resources. Soil conservation, biodiversity, aesthetics, and ecotourism were important reasons for conserving the forests; timber was considered only moderately important. The women were motivated by the perception that no else had assumed responsibility for conservation-a perception that international foresters can use to enhance their ability to promote sustainability.

TI Management of orthopteran pests: a conservation perspective
SO JOURNAL OF INSECT CONSERVATION
LA English
DT Article
DE Orthoptera; insecticide; biological control; pest management
AB Although the vast majority of orthopterans are not pests, some species have the potential to cause serious damage to human interests. Management of pest populations frequently conflicts with conservation of orthopteran species and processes, particularly when the pest species or its ecological processes are susceptible to extinction or when the pest population is coincident with non-target orthopterans. With respect to chemical control, the greatest hazards are the broad-spectrum, highly lethal properties of most agents, which can be mitigated with formulation and application methods. Biological control risks permanent, large-scale changes to orthopteran species and processes which can be minimized with bioinsecticidal and other short-lived or selective formulations and reliable host-range testing. Cultural control may have large-scale, broad-spectrum impacts to non-target orthopterans, but these hazards can be diminished by appropriate testing and monitoring. Mechanical control methods may be impractically labour intensive, but they are highly target specific and therefore warrant further consideration. Social control measures such as education, insurance and compensation programmes appear to have little direct potential for harm to orthopteran conservation, but the complex socioeconomic and, ultimately, environmental consequences of such programmes have not been assessed. The melding of orthopteran pest management and conservation requires that we perceive these insects and their ecological processes to be vital elements of sustainable agroecosystems. Our management of orthopterans (both non-target and pest populations) must focus on keeping good stewards on the land.

TI Dr. Pangloss finds his profession: Sustainability, transport, and land
   use planning in Britain
SO JOURNAL OF PLANNING EDUCATION AND RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
AB In this paper, I look at the use of land use planning to promote global sustainability by reducing the use of fossil fuels in transport. The first theme of the paper is that land use planning is an inefficient instrument for this purpose and may actually increase the use of fuel. The second theme relates to land use planning in Britain, where sustainability has been seized upon as a justification for existing policies of urban containment. I argue that some of these policies, in particular the designation of greenbelts, actually increase car use and the length of journeys.

AB Background Risk factors for raised blood pressure include obesity, physical inactivity, high dietary salt intake, stress, and high alcohol consumption. Much less is known about the effects on blood pressure of modification of these risk factors for the purposes of disease prevention. A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was conducted to estimate the effects of various non-pharmacological interventions on blood pressure.
   Methods RCTs of single interventions aimed at altering these risk factors among adults aged 45 or older with and without hypertension, and with at least six months follow-up were included. MEDLINE was the primary source and the boundaries of the study were from 1966 to April 1995.
   Results The majority of RCTs were of short duration and did not provide guidance on the sustainability of effects and were excluded. Totals of eight RCTs of salt restriction, eight RCTs of weight reduction, eight of stress management, eight of exercise, and one of alcohol reduction of longer than six months duration were found. Net (i.e. intervention - control group) systolic blood pressure changes, mean mmHg (with 95 per cent confidence intervals in parentheses), in hypertensives were as follows: salt restriction -2.9 (-5.8, 0.0), weight loss -5.2 (-8.3, -2.0), stress control -1.0 (-2.3, +0.3), and exercise -0.8 (-5.9, +4.2). Smaller changes were found in normotensive participants: salt restriction -1.3 (-2.7, +0.1), weight loss -2.8 (-3.9, -1.8), exercise -0.2 (-2.8, +2.4), and alcohol reduction -2.1 (-4.1, -0.1). Some interventions (e.g. stress control in normotensives) were not examined in either hypertensives or normotensives. The majority of RCTs were of low methodological quality and bias often tended to increase the changes observed. Few of the trials controlled for the confounding effects of concurrent changes in other blood pressure risk factors.
   Conclusion These net changes are probably overestimates of the effects that might be achieved by non-pharmacological interventions. There is a need for large-scale, long duration trials of these non-pharmacological interventions in both hypertensive patients and normotensive people to determine effect sizes more accurately.

DE length-increment data; legal minimum length; stochastic Gompertz model
ID HALIOTIS-RUBRA; PARAMETERS
AB Stochastic parametrization of length-increment data was used to estimate the distribution of maximum length of abalone populations. The distribution of maximum length provides important information for establishing a legal minimum length (LML). Legal minimum length is commonly used to optimize yield and/or reproductive potential in abalone populations. Although choice of LML is generally based on deterministic estimates of average values of growth parameters, there is strong evidence in abalone growth data that distributions of maximum length in abalone populations have large variances and proportions of abalone that cannot attain the LML. However; deterministic estimates give no indication of the proportion of individuals that may or may not attain a specific LML. Consequently, deterministic estimates of growth can be misleading and may result in setting inappropriate LMLs. Length-increment data from tagged individuals in three H. rubra populations in Victoria, Australia were analyzed using new stochastic versions of the Gompertz model reparameterized for tagging data. Outputs from the stochastic Gompertz model for tagging data include distributions of I, that show the proportion of abalone in each studied population that were unlikely to attain the LML and enter the stock. It is presently unknown whether this lever of protection will ensure long-term sustainability. The proportion conserved may also be viewed as lost yield to the fishery. If the proportion of abalone required to provide sufficient egg production for sustaining a particular population is known, then the stochastic Gompertz model for tagging data provides additional information to select an appropriate LML that balances reproductive output against yield to the fishery.

DE Haliotis rufescens; density; abundance; refuge; young-of-the-year;
   recruitment
AB Two different approaches have been used for management of red abalone, Haliotis rufescens, in California. In central and southern California, use of compressed air has been allowed for both commercial and sport fisheries, permitting take of red abalone throughout its depth range. In northern California, commercial fishing has not been allowed, nor has use of compressed air by the sport fishery, resulting in refuge from take at depths below 8.4 m. The central and southern California fisheries were recently closed because of stock declines, while the northern California fishery continues to provide high yields. Commercial catch and stock density showed parallel trends of significant decline at two of three southern California islands (Santa Rosa Island and Santa Cruz Island, but not San Miguel Island) between 1983 and 1996. At Van Damme State Park, a highly fished northern California site, stock density increased threefold between 1986 and 1992. Dive survey data indicate major recruitment events are sporadic in northern California. Density of young-of-the-year (YOY) recruits at Van Damme in 1990 to 1992 averaged three times that at Santa Rosa Island in 1978 to 1982. The proportion of red abalone larger than the sport size limit was 43% at Van Damme in depths >8.4 m, but was only 16% at depths <8.4 m, and 15% at Santa Rosa Island at all depths. Refuge by depth at Van Damme apparently protected sufficient adults from harvest during protracted periods of low recruitment to allow sustainable harvest.

AB With the passage of the Magnuson-Stevens Fisheries Conservation and Management Act in the fall of 1996, significant new tools exist in the United States to protect and conserve the habitat of marine, estuarine, and anadromous finfish as well as key populations of mollusks and crustaceans. Over the following 24 months, all Fisheries Management Councils are required to amend their fishery management plans (FMPs, covering over 300 species) to identify for each species the essential fish habitat that are those waters and substrate necessary for fish spawning, feeding, and,growth to maturity. Threats to habitat and steps necessary to ameliorate those threats must also be identified.

DE sea urchin; fishery; review; aquaculture; production; imports; exports
AB It is more than a decade since there was an attempt to review sea urchin harvests and the status of sea urchin fisheries around the world. Much of this information resides in gray literature and unpublished reports, some of which are difficult to access. For many countries, only export figures are available, leaving uncertainty over total harvests and domestic consumption. Present world production is around 117,000 tonnes, most of which is imported into Japan, where local production has declined, and there are now attempts for this to be supported by stock enhancement methods. The world's major producers of sea urchins are the United States, Chile, and Japan. Catches of sea urchins in these and most other producing countries are declining or have reached their peak. Although several countries have underexploited sea urchin resources, these are insignificant in terms of world demand. The only countries with significant potential for expansion of sea urchin fisheries are perhaps the Russian Federation, Canada, and the two Koreas, but information from some of these regions is sparse, and there are a range of obstacles to sustainable and cost-effective exploitation. Given the general decline in fisheries in major producing countries and the continued strong demand for sea urchin roe, there are emerging opportunities for sea urchin aquaculture and roe enhancement in many countries.

AB Direct water recycling has become an important part of water conservation in the dry areas of the world and is now being seriously considered for the UK. This paper reviews current demands in large buildings and balances these against non-potable re-use. Work is also described on the development of a sustainable lon running cost treatment unit. Results are presented from a 75 l/day prototype biological process operated with a synthetic sewage, which achieved a near potable standard at a cost of 25 p/m(3). The design, performance and costings of a 40 'population equivalent' demonstration unit are also given.

AB On the Channel Island of Jersey a third of the total water requirements are obtained from groundwater sources. A reliable estimate of recharge is necessary for sustainable groundwater management. Past resource management has been limited, partly because the rate of recharge is uncertain.
   This paper describes the application of three independent methods of estimating recharge: (a) chloride balance, (b) stream baseflow analysis, and (c) rainfall-recharge-runoff simulation. All three methods produce reasonably consistent results, indicating that long-term recharge is 16-19% of average annual rainfall, and results of modelling indicate that groundwater abstraction may have exceeded recharge in 5 out of 28 years. These findings have important implications for the management of the island's water resources.

AB This article examines how key stakeholders are using the review of the regional planning guidance for the north-east of England to debate where to absorb future expected household growth. In particular concepts on how sustainable development can be operationalised at the regional level are compared with current government policies and ideas on best practice. The paper concludes that although there is considerable impetus amongst local authority planners to improve the sustainability of regional planning guidance they are constrained by the sectoral nature of government policies and the lack of political will in regions.

AB Recycling is considered to play an essential role in developing a sustainable economy. A restrictive environmental legislation has forced German economy into extensive recycling activities. Meanwhile, German society and German industry have more than six years of practical experience with recycling of postconsumer plastic waste from household packaging due to this Legislative situation. II is time to critically evaluate the situation. This paper summarizes the development in Germany and tries to show ecological impacts based on a life-cycle analysis and correlates these data with economical consequences.

I We decompose accounting earnings into permanent and transitory components and postulate that dividend policy is driven by sustainable permanent earnings. Two measures of permanent earnings are proposed. The first is a permanent earnings variable extracted from accounting earnings by a random-level shift ARMA model. The second measure is stock price times cost of capital. These two permanent earnings measures are employed in the Marsh-Merton (1987) model to explain corporate dividend behavior and their performance is compared. A generalized friction method is adopted for empirical estimation to account for stepwise dividend movements over time. Results show that the permanent earnings measure extracted from accounting earnings data explains dividend dynamic behavior better than stock price.

AB This paper presents an analysis regarding the causes of persistent rural poverty in Alaska Native villages. It discusses the background, structure, and function of PL 92-203, the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA), how the Act undermines Native polities and traditional natural resource utilization, and the Act's consequent contribution to persistent rural village poverty. The principal problem is seen to be difficulties and conflicts in achieving sustainable and equitable economic development under the corporate structure imposed by ANCSA, due to existing constraints of physical geography, biological resource characteristics, and traditions of governance and resource use. The paper augments earlier findings of the Rural Sociological Society's Task Force on Persistent Rural Poverty regarding the obstacles to economic development facing natural resource-dependent communities in rural America, and the need to consider spatial location as a critical factor in explaining rural poverty.

AB The development of more sustainable agronomic practices will benefit from detailed information on major components of the agroecosystem under various farming schemes. In this study, we focused on the long-term effects of different irrigation levels on the status of several macro- and micronutrients in the soil, and their relationship with ale nematode components of the citrus soil ecosystem. In addition, the relationship of chemical (nutrient) and biological (nematode) measures to indices of sustainability was examined. Several soil chemical measures (Ca, Mg, Fe, Zn, and pH) were affected (P = 0.05) by water treatments involving different levels of irrigation intensity over time. About 40% of all nematode genera and half of the nematode community indices were significantly correlated with the chemical soil measures. Some of the chemical and nematode indices showed consistent patterns (P = 0.05) related to several components of sustainability in citrus agroecosystems (yield, profitability, and water use efficiency). Since the "sustainability indices" reflect different aspects of sustainable agriculture, their usefulness in formulating recommendations requires prioritizing their relative importance. In our experiment, the relationships between omnivorous nematodes, the nematode maturity indices, and water use efficiency, and between irrigation level and profitability allowed us to suggest the optimum irrigation treatment (minimizing water overuse and maximizing profits), and to establish omnivorous nematodes and the nematode maturity indices as indicators of water management history.

ID TOTAL QUALITY MANAGEMENT
AB This paper provides deeper exploration of the attitudes and perceptions of senior executives reported in an earlier paper. In particular, it investigates two issues; (a) differences in TQM implementation practices due to organisation size and (b) inconsistencies between the senior executives' attitudes and perceptions and their organisations' practices. The method used is to compare the attitudes and perceptions from earlier work with actions, practices and behaviours,including the propensity for measurement and information management. The results underline the central role of data and information, and hence measurement, in successful TQM implementations. Further questions arise which suggest the need for still deeper investigation via in-company case research. The data did not support the interim prediction that TQM implementation is poorer in small firms. Moreover, the more optimistic perceptions of TQM reported in medium and large firms were not sustainable when compared with their actual practices, The paper also prov ides a foundation for the next phase of this longitudinal research programme, which will track this cohort of firms (n = 113) beyond the so-called "two year barrier" to see how many are still practising TQM thereafter, Finally the data shows TQM for this regional sample to be predominantly internally focused on cost reduction at operational levels.

ID GOAT
AB Current views underlying livestock research and development have to be reconsidered to understand the possibilities for a more sustainable animal production in resource-poor farming systems. Animal production systems are complex and dynamic and they provide more than just food through their versatile roles in supporting human welfare. The intangible products are important in areas lacking formal insurance and developed financial markets. The objectives of research, education and extension should be set in relation to this broad perspective on livestock keeping. Changes in land use and economic conditions are the driving forces for change in animal production systems. A systems approach is needed to assess disciplinary research focused on production levels of individual animals, and sustainability prospects of new technologies within the context of the farming system. This can help us to plan for the future.

LA English
DT Article
AB The article provides a critique of British environmental policy, focusing in particular on the role of sustainable development as an organizing principle, the use of cost-benefit analysis (CBA) and economic instruments, and the design of the institutions responsible for implementing policy. It is argued that, while considerable progress has been made in the theoretical literature to define sustainable development, successive governments in the UK have widened the definition to the point where it provides little guidance for policy. Obstacles to the use of CBA are discussed, as are the political constraints on implementing economic instruments-in particular, the income effect. Finally, it is argued that the institutional design of the Environment Agency and the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions partly explains the overwhelming reliance on command-and-control regulation.

TI Corporate power in the forests of the Solomon Islands
SO PACIFIC AFFAIRS
LA English
DT Article
AB IN THE FIRST HALF OF THE 1990s, Malaysian investors, backed by Japanese and Korean buyers, pushed log production in the Solomon Islands to more than three times higher than the estimated sustainable level. Japanese log purchases alone in 1995 and 1996 were greater than the sustainable yield in the Solomon Islands. If log production had continued to escalate at the mid-1990s rate, these aggressive investors and traders would have depleted the Solomon Islands of commercial trees in less than a decade. The crash in demand for tropical logs following the 1997-98 economic downturn in Asia has slowed this looming environmental catastrophe. Although this could well be a temporary respite, this does provide the government of Prime Minister Bartholomew Ulufa'alu, which took power in August 1997, an opportunity to reform timber management. This paper examines the most important issue and the greatest obstacle facing reformers: the environmental and economic impact of multinational companies on natural forest management.(1)
   Cheap forest resources that externalize environmental and social costs lure investors and traders, even into areas with little infrastructure. Once there, these corporations generally harvest logs as quickly and cheaply as possible. Logically, they do not function within the bounds of formal laws or policies but rather within the bounds of state and societal rules that are actually enforced, persistently trying to bend these rules in their favour. They strain state capacity to manage forest resources, pressure and entice state officials to develop policies that maximize corporate profits, construct complex corporate structures that reduce accountability and transparency, and evade taxes and timber royalties. Corporations also generate financial incentives that stimulate unsustainable production, harvest concessions illegally and destructively, break or distort obligations to communities and landowners, make informal deals that lower export prices, and construct trade chains that depress consumer prices and stimulate wasteful consumption. These practices seem to suggest that corporations in the Solomon Islands are mischievous or devious resource exploiters. In some ways they are. But often they are rationally responding to market signals, the viability, profitability and uncertainty of operations, and the extent of state and societal controls.
   The paper begins with a brief discussion of the theoretical literature on the environmental impact on natural resources of multinational corporations. The second section provides essential background on commercial forest resources, environmental policies and forest institutions in the Solomon Islands. The third, fourth, fifth, and sixth sections examine the actual impact of these policies and institutions on the behaviour of multinational investors. The seventh section analyzes the effect of corporate buyers. The conclusion reflects on the importance of the findings in the Solomon Islands for understanding the effects of timber corporations on environmental management in tropical regions.

AB Insecticides, fungicides and herbicides are critical to successful crop production, but the development of pesticide resistance is a continual threat, especially to many of today's selective toxophores with specific binding sites. In order to manage resistance effectively, an assessment of genetic, ecological and operational risk factors is required, which must then be translated into meaningful local strategies that can be implemented through appropriate labelling of products and education of end users. Assessing resistance risk is a fundamental part of the development process for new molecules and is increasingly becoming a requirement of registration alongside toxicological and environmental risk data. Laboratory studies, including elucidation of target sites and metabolic degradation pathways, mutagenesis, computer models and cross-resistance tests, and field studies, including establishment of baseline sensitivities and evaluation of anti-resistance strategies, all play a part in such assessment. The challenge is then to devise management strategies which are relevant to local practice and actually reduce selection pressure to a point where product life is preserved. A preventative strategy should be in place at time of launch and for most pesticides, regional co-operation between all interested parties, of the kind advocated by the Resistance Action Committees of GCPF (Global Crop Protection Federation), increases the chance of success. Implementation of strategies via a universal product labelling system, already practised in some herbicide markets, is seen as a key way to improve product usage patterns. Monitoring resistance levels in field populations after product launch enables any fine tuning of tactics over time, for example in response to new technologies such as transgenic varieties being introduced. The limited successes in resistance management in Australia, Zimbabwe, Europe and USA are not so easily achieved in small-holder farming in developing countries, as exemplified by continuing problems in parts of India and China. Emphasis must be given to the education of growers and dealers in IRM and IPM, and improved extension services, in order to bring about a more sustainable approach to crop protection.

AB The 1995-96 drought in north-west England was the most severe in the historic record. Its management presented a significant challenge to both the water company and the Environment Agency. Because of the severity of the drought it has been necessary to review the assumptions which form the basis of existing water resources plans for the region. A clear strategy will be needed to ensure the long-term sustainability of the water resources of the region to the benefit of public water supplies, the environment and other water users.

AB This paper examines the connections between uneven development and sustainable development, focusing on the British land use planning system where tensions are emerging between 'environment-led' and 'balancing' interpretations of sustainability. The key argument is that the spatial dynamics of uneven development are an integral component of these tensions, and their reconciliation, as sustainable development is interpreted through planning processes in different localities and at different levels of governance. This perspective is developed by examining British minerals planning policy and the conflicts generated by the Lingerbay superquarry proposal on the Isle of Harris. While the UK Government has sought to use the planning system to find a politically acceptable 'spatial fix' for aggregates production, rather than manage resource demand, presumptions about uneven development which apparently underpin this policy are being challenged, not least for their equity implications. Interpreting sustainable development in ways which are sensitive to different contexts and the connections between them remains a major challenge.

AB A resource depletion index can serve as a quantitative tool to evaluate the level of depletion for natural resources. This study introduces two types of resource depletion indices, the global resource depletion index and the local resource depletion index. Global resource depletion index mainly concerns global reserves and the annual consumption rate of these resources. The local resource depletion index not only considers global reserves and their annual consumption rate, but also considers the local factors such as local reserves, local recycling rates, and local resource import characteristics. This study considers the local resource characteristics of Taiwan and develops calculations for local resource depletion indexes for the resources of cobalt, molybdenum, tungsten, copper, aluminum, lead and zinc.

DE Chile; Antofagasta; fauna; inventory; biological diversity
AB The inventory of fauna at the II Region of Chile, Antofagasta was achieved as the elaboration of a dynamic data bank and graphic documenting the taxonomic composition and the spatial distribution of the different taxa. The field and cabinet work will allow to update and improve the taxonomy of diverse taxa such as terrestrial vertebrates and some invertebrates groups, (insects, mollusks and crustaceans). At the same time it will allow to account for their patterns of regional geographical distribution. The selection of taxa obeys to the interest for the taxonomic groups. The selection of the area of Antofagasta resides in its biological interest as it is characterized by its extreme aridity and its fauna adapted to the restrictions imposed by the prevailing desertic conditions. Another aspect to consider is the existence of large projects and future investments that require to be coordinated with the sustainability of this fauna. The used methodological approach was to carry out colecting expeditions and day and night observation of the species, establish their spatial locations by means of GPS (Geographical Positioning System) and to document with field protocols and photographs. According to the characteristics of the observed or collected animals it was appealed to available literature for their identification. Taxonomic keys or field guides were used to arrive at the lowest possible level in the taxonomic categorization of the individuals. With the sampled species a clustering analysis was performed grouping the ecosystems by taxonomic resemblance. The data bases were elaborated by means of Excel and dBase IV, incorporated jointly with the graphic documentation to the program BIOMA, a computational tool designed for the project. This program is designed to carry out the gathering, entering and analysis of data, starting from vectorial or raster formats of diverse geographical information systems, The program allows to generate Projects conformed by layers of geographical data that give the overall graphic expression of the distribution of species or group of species in a relational context, that is to say, associated to the physical or biological information of the study area. The information contained in BIOMA, is the base for systematic, ecological and biogeographic studies carried out by the project. The projection of this research will also include cues, either to environmental education and the management of the renewable resources of the region.

TI Transformation: Canadian social policy since 1985
SO SOCIAL POLICY & ADMINISTRATION
LA English
DT Article
DE social policy; social spending; Canada
AB This paper sets out to document and explain the major structural changes which have taken Place in Canada's social security system since the mid-1980s. Most major programs have been rut back one may OF. another in response to a combination of pressures. Foremost amongst these has been the commitment to reduce federal and provincial government deficits. In addition there have been the consequences of high unemployment and increasing job insecurity, demographic and social changes, and "tax fatigue" on the part of the public. The paper documents major recent changes of social policy both in general-with regard to the changed approach evident at federal level and its effect on social transfers to the provinces-and in respect of key programs, including unemployment/employment insurance, old age pensions/the Canada Pension Plan, and child benefits. The paper next identifies "currents and undercurrents" common to all of the developments commented on: the decline of universality, the practice of "social policy-making by stealth", the evidence of the contemporary Canadian public's "collective ambivalence and loss of memory" in respect of the major, historic social programs. It concludes by urging the case for social reinvestment in genuinely sustainable social policy, in the currently more favourable fiscal climate.

SO SOCIOLOGY OF RELIGION
LA English
DT Article
ID UNITED-STATES; ATTITUDES; SEX
AB Berger's (1967, 1992) views on plausibility structures suggest that a belief must receive a high level of support from group members if the belief is to be maintained over time. All alternative view holds that beliefs that are empirically unfalsifiable and that receive validation front sources external to the group (e.g., from the mass media) can be maintained without high levels of intra-group support. Using longitudinal data, we found that between the early 1970s and the early 1990s support for two unfalsifiable beliefs (traditional beliefs about gender roles and homosexual rights) declined among all Christian groups, including active conservative Protestants. in the early 1970s, support for these beliefs was relatively low among active conservatives as well as among other Christians. Throughout the time period studied, however, the active conservatives, compared to other Christians, had greater exposure to extra-group sources of validation for both beliefs. Thus. our findings do not support the view that unfalsifiable beliefs that have extra-group support structures are sustainable without high levels of intra-group support.

AB In a sustainable agriculture farming systems experiment; soils managed under organic farming practices had greater microbial abundance and activity, and higher numbers of bacterial-feeding nematodes during crop growth, than those managed under conventional farming practices. We tested rates of organic matter decomposition in the two soils and monitored the abundance and activity of soil biota during the decomposition process. Differences in soil biology between soils from organic and conventional farming systems did not persist when soils were amended with organic matter and maintained under similar conditions. Microbial communities in soil from the conventional system were sufficient and active enough to respond to organic inputs. There were minimal differences in the ability of the microbial communities of the two soils to decompose organic residues. However, when soils were removed from the held at different times, cover crop decomposition rates were more consistent in the organic soils, suggesting a greater abundance and diversity of the microbial community in those soils. Microbial activity was most suppressed when held soils were dry but responded to organic matter amendment very rapidly when favorable moisture contents were restored. The pattern of microbial activity in both organic and conventional soils following organic matter incorporation consisted of a 100 h activity phase and then a gradual decline to a relatively constant stasis phase.

AB A critical analysis on wind farms has been carried out to improve the performance and reliability of wind energy system. The effect of its improvement has been studied with the Optimal Renewable Energy Mathematical (OREM) model which is developed for sustainable generation in India. The performance and reliability of the wind turbine generators have been evaluated in a demonstration windfarm (6 MW) in India. The windfarm is situated in Kayathar, a village in the south of Tamil Nadu State. The average technical availability, real availability and capacity factor have been analysed from 1991 to 1995 and they are found to be 92%, 54% and 19% respectively. Fault analysis for grid failures has been done using pareto analysis. The analysis indicates that when grid drop failures are reduced by 50%, the overall reduction in the frequency of faults would be 35.2%, which is significant. The reliability analysis has also been done for the wind turbine generator. The failure rate is high to an extent of 6.7 x 10(-5) h(-1) in the case of a yaw control defect and the factor of reliability is found to be 0.5 at 10 000 h. The OREM model developed reveals that when the reliability factor of wind energy system is improved from 0.5 to 0.9 then the utilisation of wind energy would be increased by 82%.

TI Conservation implications of the use of vertebrates by Xhosa traditional

SO SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE RESEARCH

DE traditional medicine; vertebrate; conservation; resource utilisation
ID EASTERN CAPE
AB The demand for vertebrates by traditional healers in South Africa suggests that the use of these animals in traditional medicinal or cultural practices has major conservation implications. This is supported by the fact that 31% of vertebrates used in these practices are listed in South African Red Data Books, indicating that their conservation status is already a matter of concern. Of those vertebrates used, mammals (65%) constitute the largest proportion, followed by birds (22%), reptiles (11%) and amphibians (1.3%). Some of these vertebrates (more especially those with critical conservation status) are significantly less available in the market. We suggest that, whereas this form of resource use has been largely ignored in the past, it may represent a threat to the conservation of biodiversity if poorly managed. It may also provide an opportunity to aid the conservation and sustainable use of indigenous vertebrates if properly managed.

AB Working from the perspective of the resource-based view of strategy, this paper addresses whether academics, consultants, and other sources of general managerial prescriptions can affect firms' long-run rent streams. The answer is affirmative. To demonstrate this, I discuss the use of motivational techniques as a well-understood and common managerial choice that may affect a firm's chance of generating rents. This paper interprets extant Empirical research on goal setting and discusses the conceptualization of temporal rent patterns. I build upon an empirical finding in goal-setting research to compare the temporal patterns of rents for managerial choices embedded in path-dependent vs. path-independent processes.

AB The recovery of tropical ecosystems after disturbance is of interest for future programs of sustainable development. The dynamics of such processes was evaluated at 26 sites in Venezuela. Ant and plant diversity were compared between disturbed forests and surrounding savannas, different stages of recovery and nearby plots with primary vegetation. We estimated the species composition for ants, the number of species and equitability for ants and plants, and the plant coverage at each site. Of these indices, percentage of plant cover showed the most rapid return to pre-disturbance values. In a few cases, full return occurred after around 25 years in both savanna and forest. A multiple factorial analysis of ant composition showed that species structure in old recovered sites converged sometimes, but not always, to that in surrounding natural habitats. Therefore, ant diversity may be used to monitor ecosystem recovery. However, even small scale human intervention may have irreversible effects on tropical habitats. The estimated time constant for forest recovery could serve to calculate human carrying capacity of forest sites for eventual sustainable use of these ecosystems in the Neotropics.

TI From teaching to learning: Technological potential and sustainable,
   supported open learning
SO SYSTEMIC PRACTICE AND ACTION RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
DE learning; education; systems approaches; development; metaphors
AB The central theme of this paper is the current interest in most educational institutions in moving from teaching to learning as their main system model and the implications which technology media have for unravelling the debate and influencing the resulting practice (for example see Active Learning: Using the Internet for Teaching, Number 2, July, 1995). Our chosen strategy for dealing with the central theme is to consider how we use language, metaphor and models to describe systems for teaching and learning and what is the role of technology in these systems. In particular we describe how the Open University is moving from an analysis of individual technologies to a synthesis of the educational ideas into a sustainable system that conforms to the University's policy of supported open learning. This includes focusing on open and equal access to courses. considerable attention to staff development and training (specifically in core teaching areas such as face to face tuition, correspondence tuition, student support, telephone and other media supported communication) as well as the necessity and value of reflection on practice (e.g. see Baker, Tomlinson et al., 1996). In this first section, taking as our starting point the traditional linear view of educational structures, we build upon the notion of the learning system and describe this as an approach with a somewhat long and surprising history originating in the Socratic method. An eductive, cyclic learning model is introduced, and the historical impact of technology on this model is briefly reviewed in a global context by addressing the specific issue of access from the developing countries. Following from this, in sections two and three two types of teaching are described, under the labels of 'conventional' and 'distance'. It is argued that each has strengths and tendencies towards the eductive learning system introduced in section one. However, it is also argued that each has flaws which provide problems for the development of a learning system which can be sustained at distance. An analysis based upon metaphor is applied. In section four, it is then argued that in the conventional model there is a system with excellent learning potential but with an organisational structure which often does not encourage it whereas in the distance model there is the potential organisation for providing feedback but often little effective use made of it. That lack of use includes the new technologies which are now being focused on by the Open University, both in terms of the INSTILL initiative (Integrate New Systems and Technologies Into Lifelong Learning) and the 'Technology Strategy for Academic Advantage' (Laurillard, Christmas et al., 1996). These technologies are argued, in section five, to be capable of being tactically effective in stimulating and supporting the strategic aim of learning. Technology mediation is discussed both in terms of course-based teaching and in terms of research opportunities. In section six a range of problem/opportunity areas of immediate concern for the extension of this technologically mediated system to the developing countries are discussed, while policy implications for the extension of supported open learning are drawn out in section seven. These include policies toward co-learning, access to learning, quality standards and the authorship of educational material.

AB Critical geopolitics seeks to problematise the concept of environmental security and its relationship to social and political practices of dominance in local, national and international politics. While environmental problems do undoubtedly exist in the Indian Ocean, conflicting perspectives and future prospects for common security within and between countries, subregions and social groups, suggest that a better understanding of how ecological threats are described, prioritised, and globalised and how knowledge about environmental degradation and sustainable development is produced as a political resource, is possible only by contesting, or at least by going beyond, the conventional categories and typologies which privilege and protect certain actors, interests and priorities.

TI Sustainable development and Agenda 21: the secular bible of global free
   markets and pluralist democracy
SO THIRD WORLD QUARTERLY
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper provides a critique of sustainable development and Agenda 21 from a variety of standpoints. Agenda 21-forged in the Rio de Janiero 'Earth Summit' in 1992-was shaped largely by Northern elites (governments in close association with large transnational corporations). Much of the environmental movement was co-opted into this process and remains profoundly weakened by its continued involvement. Agenda 21 sells a vision of global ecology which defines the major problems of the Earth in Northern elite and scientific terms (global warming, population growth, species extinction) while largely ignoring the key environmental issues as defined by the majority of the people, both in the North and the South.(1) Agenda 21 has also been successful in selling a concept of sustainable development which continues to promote the Enlightenment goals of progress through economic growth and industrialisation at all costs. But it is worse than this: it also advances the globalisation of radical libertarian market systems, along with US style 'apolitical' pluralist systems of democracy. The paper concludes with the point that both sustainable development and Agenda 21 need to be rejected out of hand by environmentalists.

TI Mapping the prospects for regional co-operation in southern Africa
SO THIRD WORLD QUARTERLY
LA English
DT Article
AB This article examines the prospects for regional co-operation in southern Africa. It does this by 'mapping' southern Africa-that is, by revealing the extent to which Jive key preconditions far effective and sustainable co-operation are present. These five preconditions-each of whose inclusion is justified in the article-are: the distribution of power, sufficient homogeneity, and adequate regional orientation at economic, political and sociocultural levels. In light of each, the southern African region is explored, to determine the extent to which the precondition is satisfied in this part of the world. Finally, the article advances two key policy-related conclusions. The first is that regional co-operation among the 14 southern African countries will not come easily. The second is that co-operative arrangements that go up the spine of southern Africa appear more likely to yield success than those that cut across the region.

   AREA; DISORDERS; PREGNANCY; CRETINISM; EUROPE
AB Neonatal thyroid screening using serum thyrotropin (TSH) as the primary screening test detects not only permanent sporadic congenital hypothyroidism, whose incidence is about 1 per 4000 births, but also compensated or transient primary hypothyroidism, whose incidence can be as high as I in 10 neonates and whose main cause is iodine deficiency. Elevated serum TSH in the neonate indicates insufficient supply of thyroid hormones to the developing brain, and therefore, constitutes the only indicator that allows prediction of possible impairment of mental development at a population level, which is the main consequence of iodine deficiency. Therefore, the World Health Organization (WHO), United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund (UNICEF), and the International Council for Control of Iodine Deficiency Disorders (ICCIDD) included neonatal TSH as one of the indicators for assessing iodine deficiency disorders (IDD) and their control. In the absence of iodine deficiency, the frequency of neonatal TSH above 5 mU/L whole blood (or 10 mU/L serum) is less than 3%. A frequency of 3%-19.9% indicates mild IDD. Frequencies of 20%-39.9% and above 40% indicate moderate and severe IDD, respectively. Neonates exhibit elevated serum TSH more frequently than adults for a similar degree of iodine deficiency. Consequently, they appear hypersensitive to the effects of iodine deficiency. This characteristic is explained by a particularly low iodine content of the thyroid of neonates and, consequently, by an accelerated turnover rate of their intrathyroidal iodine reserves. This turnover rate is 1% in adults. It is 17% in the neonate in conditions of iodine repletion, but is as high as 62% and 125% in conditions of moderate and severe iodine deficiency, respectively. Such an accelerated turnover rate requires thyroid hyperstimulation by TSH that is morphologically evidenced even in moderately iodine deficient neonates. Neonatal screening using primary TSH is implemented in most countries with mild IDD where it detects the cases of sporadic, permanent congenital hypothyroidism and where it is also used as a monitoring tool for IDD evaluation and control. However, the implementation of such programs in countries affected by moderate or severe IDD is still insufficient because of lack of resources of the countries. This should be considered in the framework of the external support often provided to these countries for the implementation of programs of universal salt iodization. Monitoring of these programs in order to achieve the goal of sustainable elimination of IDD now constitutes an absolute priority.

TI Predictors of crop diversification: a survey of tobacco farmers in North
   Carolina (USA)
SO TOBACCO CONTROL
LA English
DT Article
DE tobacco farmers; crop diversification
AB Objective-To assess the attitudes and behaviours of North Carolina tobacco farmers around crop diversification.
   Design-Cross-sectional telephone survey. Participants-Active tobacco farmers in 14 North Carolina counties (n = 1236), interviewed between January and April 1997 (91% response rate). Outcome measures-Interest in, experience with, and perceived barriers to diversification.
   Results-Most farmers (95%) grew/raised a commodity other than tobacco (mean 2.8). A total of 60% of farmers expressed interest in trying other on-farm activities to supplement their tobacco and 60% reported taking action in the past year around supplementation. Younger age and college education were positively associated with interest. College education, off-farm income, and larger farm size were associated with the number of actions taken. For perceived external barriers to diversification, use of tobacco, percent income from tobacco, lack of college education, and younger age were most strongly associated with the number of barriers. For internal barriers (personal factors), percent income from tobacco, use of tobacco, and lack of college education were most strongly associated with the number of barriers.
   Conclusions-Most farmers were involved in diverse operations and expressed interest in continuing to diversify, although the breadth of diversification was narrow. Farmers noted many barriers to diversifing. If conventional production and marketing techniques are employed for non-tobacco alternatives, these alternatives may not provide the sustainable profitability that tobacco has afforded. Competition from foreign tobacco growers is the primary threat to the future of American growers and tobacco dependent communities.

AB Several emerging trends are pointing to the re-emergence of the bicycle as an important leisure and recreational transportation mode. Yet little research has been conducted into cycling within a tourism context. This paper examines the increasing phenomenon of bicycle tourism by defining bicycle tourists and bicycle tourism from a demand perspective, and describes the characteristics, infrastructure and travel behaviour associated with bicycle tourism through the examination of data collected on independent cycle tourists in the South Island of New Zealand, It illustrates through performance-importance analysis, the areas of major concern in the planning and management of bicycle tourism, and recommends that a demand side perspective is needed if the supply side of the industry is to be sustainable in the future. It makes recommendations for the future planning and management of bicycle tourism in New Zealand that may be of interest to countries currently developing cycle tourism.

DE unsustainable tourism development; developing countries; Turkey; Urgup
ID IMPACTS
AB The main aim of this article is to investigate and explain the roots of unsustainable tourism development at the local level in a developing country, with special reference to Urgup in the region of Cappadocia, Turkey. It was found that the factors that ushered in unsustainable tourism development are beyond the control of local people and authorities. They are largely related to issues at the national level such as the policy of political economy, prevailing national planning approaches applied to tourism, patron-client relationships between decision-makers and related business class alongside the role of international tour operators in the international tourism system. It concludes that achieving sustainable tourism development at the local level in a developing country requires hard political choices, a confident decision-making process and the collaboration of international tour operators and donor agencies.

AB This paper focuses on two roles of anthropology in the control of infectious disease. The first is in identifying and describing concerns and understandings of disease, including local knowledge of cause and treatment relevant to disease control. The second is in translating these local concerns into appropriate health interventions, for example, by providing information to be incorporated in education and communication strategies for disease control. Problems arise in control programmes with competing knowledge and value systems. Anthropology's role conventionally has been in the translation of local concepts of illness and treatment, and the adaptation of biomedical knowledge to fit local aetiologies. Medical anthropology plays an important role in examining the local context of disease diagnosis, treatment and prevention, and the structural as well as conceptual barriers to improved health status. National (and international) public health goals which respect local priorities are uncommon, and generic health goals rarely coincide with specific country and community needs. The success of interventions and control programmes is moderated by local priorities and conditions, and sustainable interventions need to acknowledge and address country-specific social, economic and political circumstances.

TI The impact of tourism on residential experience in central-eastern
   Europe: The development of a new legitimation crisis in the Czech
   Republic
SO URBAN STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
ID PRAGUE; CITIES
AB This paper argues that rapid and unfettered commercial tourism development in the historic core of Prague is playing a major role in the transformation of its social, spatial and cultural characteristics, changes which are encapsulating residential experience. Whilst recognising the potential positive economic benefits of tourism, we argue that the inherent pressures of commercialisation and touristification are creating new tensions which, if not addressed, are likely to contribute significantly to the creation of a new legitimation crisis in the Czech Republic, one epitomised by an inability to establish universal support for neo-liberal capitalist accumulation as a sustainable path for political and economic reform. Although largely impressionistic in method, this exposition seeks to offer, with the aid of comparative analyses of other European cities, observations which provide insights that may benefit a broader empirical investigation and debate on residential experience, one that is enhanced by the interdisciplinary links between housing and tourism. More specifically, it explores the complex interrelationship between residential experience and tourism, arguing that the former illuminates a deeper understanding of the power relationships driving developmental processes-in this case, tourist-driven regeneration. In their determination to achieve compatibility with neo-liberal accumulation regimes, the post-communist governments of the Czech Republic appear to be neglecting, at the macro level, the broader social and environmental objectives of minimising social exclusion and protecting the nation's cultural heritage. It is too early to assess whether the new administration has recognised the need to realign policies closer to the traditional Czech value of political consensus. However, despite the creation of a distinct planning system within Prague, which recognises the emergence of a new 'income elite' alongside the 'socially weak', state-driven political and economic policies appear to be exacerbating these new social cleavages and creating the incipient signs of a 'clone city'. We suggest the need for an alternative vision of 'capitalism', one that enables the inclusion of a broad range of interests in decision-making, if Havel's dream of a 'civil society' is to be realised.

TI Waste streams, costs and emissions in municipal solid waste management:
   a case study from Finland
SO WASTE MANAGEMENT & RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
DE municipal solid waste management; waste stream; recovery rate; cost;
   emission; source separation model; Finland
AB Municipal solid waste management (MSWM) is undergoing major changes due mainly to high recovery rate targets being set by the European Union and national Governments. These higher rates have been set as one measure to achieve the sustainable development required by Agenda 21 of United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED) in 1992. Increasing the recovery rates for municipal solid waste affects waste management systems, particularly the composition of waste streams, costs and emissions from treatment and disposal activities.
   A case study has been carried out in Finland to measure the effects of the increase in recovery rates using the Mimes/Waste computer model as a tool. In the case study, it was ascertained that when the recovery rate is increased from the present 21% to 64%, the total waste management costs are increased by 36%, Using the same parameters, it was found that the amount of waste being disposed of to landfill is reduced from 421 kg per person per annum to 195 kg per per son per annum.
   The effect on greenhouse gas emissions is to reduce the amount produced by landfill sites and traffic by 59%. Traffic emissions overall, however, are increased by 40% in the case study.
   The "New Mimes/Waste" version developed for Finland has proved to be a suitable tool for strategic waste planning. It offers the capacity to study a number of different strategies and the whole MSWM system as a single unit. It also facilitates and increases the understanding of the interdependence of the various waste streams and functional elements.

AB Water is the most important determinant of agricultural production in Oman. Remarkable public and private investments have been drawn into water resources development and into the modernization of the farming techniques in order to strengthen the contribution of agriculture to the national economy. In spite of these technological improvements and significant investments, water allocation remains a major policy issue. This paper discusses current water use and explores alternatives for improved allocation of agricultural water. Available data suggest that physical and economic returns to water are low. Improvement of returns to water resources could come from producing higher quality and higher value crops for domestic and foreign markets using improved irrigation techniques. This trend needs to be enforced by stringent water. conservation measures ill order to reach a long-term sustainable water use.

AB Western governments believe a quick Japanese revival is vital to contain economic 'contagion' from East Asia. But their prescriptions risk worsening Japan's depressive effect on the world economy and deepening its regional isolation. Despite a $195 billion stimulus package announced in November, a more sustainable rescue, recognising new collective consumption challenges, depends on curtailing a long-held faith in corporate citizenship, and trusting extra responsibility to the same state institutions discredited by the present slump.

AB Physical and chemical soil degradation hinder the introduction of mixed cropping systems on former tea lands in the Central Highlands of Sri lanka. For instance on two typical soil catenas soil properties such as texture, pH, acidity parameters, pedogenic oxides and available plant nutrients indicating fertility are presented. Obviously Al3+ occupies a larger part of the exchange complex and accounts for more soil acidity than H+. Al toxicity is hence a major restricting factor for plant growth in the area. The investigated data also permit an evaluation of soil erodibility and a soil fertility assessment according to the Fertility Capability Classification System (Sanchez et al., 1982). Agricultural measures to reduce soil acidity and cover the lime requirements of the soils are advised. Additional soil conservation measures should diminish soil erosion in order to improve the sustainability of the cropping systems.

AB A prerequisite for honest handicaps is that there are significant condition-dependent costs in the expression of sexual traits. In the wolf spider Hygrolycosa rubrofasciata (Ohlert), sexual signalling (drumming) is costly in terms of increased mortality. Here we investigated whether this mortality may be caused by increased energy expenditure. During sexual signalling, metabolic rate was 22 times higher than at rest and four times higher than when males were actively moving. Metabolic rate per unit mass was positively related to absolute body mass during sexual signalling but not during other activities. This positive relationship is novel to any studies of metabolic rates. :Indeed, it seems that the largest males can drum only 12 times per minute before reaching the maximum sustainable metabolic rate, whereas the smallest males may drum up to 39 times per minute. However, there is no relationship between body mass and drumming rate, indicating that larger males are able to compensate for the higher cost of drumming. There was a quadratic relationship between relative abdomen mass and overall body mass, which may provide a partial explanation fbr the increased energy expenditure of largest males while drumming. Altogether, our results indicate that sexual signalling is highly energetically demanding, which may be the main reason for the honesty of signalling in this species. In addition, the energetic costs are surprisingly strongly size dependent, which may compensate any disadvantage of small male size.

AB Soil water is the major limiting factor in dryland crop production in the Central Great Plains. No-till fallow management increases soil water storage and reduces soil erosion potential. Two experiments were initiated in 1969 and 1970 near Sidney, NE to compare effects of moldboard plow (Plow), sub-tillage (Sub-till) and no-tillage (No-till) fallow systems on winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) grain yield, grain protein, residue production, and soil water accumulation during fallow. The first experiment was established in 1969 on an Alliance silt loam that had been previously cultivated prior to study initiation. This experiment contained a nitrogen (N) fertilizer split of 0 and 45 (kg N) ha(-1) within each tillage treatment. The second experiment was established in 1970 on a Duroc loam that was in native mixed prairie sod. No fertilizer was applied at this site. At both sites, soil water storage was greatest with the no-till and least with the plow system. Winter wheat grain yields failed to consistently respond to increased soil water storage in the no-till system during the 24-26 years of the experiments. Grain yields with the plow system were 8% greater than with sub- and no-till systems at the Previously Cultivated site when N was not applied. The addition of N at this site eliminated yield differences due to fallow tillage systems. Grain protein averaged 13.8, 13.3 and 12.8% for all plow, sub- and;lo-till treatments, respectively. The addition of N at the Previously Cultivated site increased residue dry weights by an average of 5% in all tillage systems. Neither grain protein nor residue dry weights were affected by tillage system at the Native Sod site. Winter wheat-fallow is probably not a sustainable production system for the Central Great Plains, regardless of the fallow management system used. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The success of economic reforms depends on whether policy-makers can overcome both political and economic constraints. this paper focuses on a relatively neglected dimension of the Indian economic reform process - the institutional underpinnings of sate capacity. It has argued that state capacity, defined as the capability for political management of the reform process within a democratic system, is crucial for the sustainability of the re forms. Paradoxically, this is true even for the neo-liberal type of economic reform which aims at diminishing the role of government.

DT Article
AB The notion of 'sustainability' assumes spacial significance for settlements which survive amidst ecologically fragile upland conditions. This is exemplified by assessing the production and livelihood systems adopted by inhabitants of a settlement located in the northern mountainous tribal belt of Himachal Pradesh. The main finding is that traditional practices regarding livelihood systems (mainly agriculture and livestock-raising) were entirely subservient to ecological conditions. Historically speaking, the 'Rajah's' equitable land distribution policy and the resultant phenomenon of universal land ownership may have fostered these sustainable practices. A legacy of the past these practices are noticeable even today. Under these circumstances the question of sustainability assumes new significance.

AB The coastal forests of British Columbia have large accumulations of coarse woody debris, and information on this pool is considered essential in developing sustainable management practices. We characterized coarse woody debris (7-12 and >12 cm diameter) in forest chronosequences of four age classes located on the eastern and western sides of Vancouver Island. For three species (Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) France), western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla (Raf.) Sarg), western red cedar (Thuja plicata Donn.)) and unidentified samples, increases in decay class (I to V, assigned in the field) were associated with decreasing density, and small increases in concentrations of C, N, and P. Sulfur concentrations (0.6-2.4 g/kg) were higher than those found elsewhere for wood and did not show any significant changes with decay class. C-13 nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy with cross polarization and magic-angle spinning (C-13-CPMAS-NMR) was used to analyze organic components in a subset of samples >12 cm. Logs up to decay class III generally showed little change in composition or a slight increase in polysaccharide C. After this, polysaccharide was lost more quickly and logs of decay class V were composed almost entirely of lignin, a pattern consistent with decay by brown-rot fungi. However, two samples of western red cedar decay class III and IV showed accumulation of polysaccharide, the pattern expected from white-rot fungi. The results of the density, chemical and NMR analysis indicate that for management purposes, a system with fewer decay classes would suffice. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB The traditional harvest of non-timber forest products (NTFP) in Peten, Guatemala, provides a model for integrated conservation and development programs. Conservation International and El Cruce a Dos Aguadas (El Cruce). and agricultural community in the Maya Biosphere Reserve in Northern Peten, have created a new NTFP, called Gatherings(TM) which is a potpourri composed of seeds, flowers and leaves. Gatherings(TM) is promoted on international and domestic markets as a sustainably extracted natural product whose sale provides a direct incentive for local producers to conserve their forests. The purpose of this investigation is to test the ecological sustainability of extraction of the natural dyes used to color the potpourri ingredients and to present the following eight-step method for testing the sustainability of NTFP harvesting: (1) delineate current supply area; (2) determine current supply; (3) estimate the growth and yield of target species; (4) determine the current demand; (5) compare short-term supply and demand and evaluate management options: (6) assess secondary ecological effects of harvesting; (7) repeat the process for future time periods; and (8) summarize the analysis. Using this method, we found that two of the dyes are likely to be over-harvested within 10 years, and that the harvest of the third could be increased substantially without endangering the dye-producing species. When we summarized the analysis, we found no evidence to conclude that the current production of Gatherings(TM) directly benefits the forests of El Cruce. However, the goodwill created by this project has contributed to a new conservation initiative; a Land Management Area which has been proposed by the community to Guatemala's National Protected Areas Council (CONAP) and which contains a 13 273 ha forest reserve.

AB During the past decades, major changes have taken place with regard to the available policy instruments for food security and rural development. These changes are reviewed against the background of the structural adjustment programmes carried out in the agricultural sector. The linkages between agricultural policy and farmers' supply response are discussed, emphasizing the influence of macro-policy for decision-making at the micro-level of a farm household. An integrated bio-economic modelling framework is presented that allows a better understanding of the effects of macro and sectoral policy interventions for food security and sustainable land use at the farm and (sub)regional level. Critical areas where the understanding of macro-micro linkages is still weak are identified. Major conclusions regarding a suitable analytical framework for policy analysis and support are presented.

AB To support the different phases of a policy making process aimed at changing land use, distinct types of land use studies are required. This paper focuses on exploratory land use studies and their role in the phase of formulating strategic policy objectives. Exploratory land use studies contribute to a transparent discussion on policy objectives by showing ultimate technical possibilities and consequences of imposing different priorities to agro-technical, food security, socio-economic and environmental objectives. A methodology is presented in which science-driven technical information is confronted with value-driven objectives under given values of exogenous variables (e.g. regarding population growth and requirements for agricultural produce). Land use scenarios are generated showing consequences of different priorities for objectives by using natural resources and technical possibilities in different ways. Applications of such an approach are given for the global, regional and farm level, each addressing specific questions and target groups. The paper focuses on the type of results these studies produce and their role in the societal and political debate on strategic land use policy and planning. It is concluded that if exploratory land use studies are carried out in true interaction with target groups, they may well contribute to the debate and learning on sustainable land use options and a purposeful identification of effective policy instruments in a next phase of the policy making process.

ID BURKINA-FASO; HOUSEHOLD; COUNTRIES; MARKETS; FOOD
AB Interdisciplinary approaches to identify suitable incentives for enhancing sustainable natural resource use require an analytical framework that satisfies both practical purposes of policy support and disciplinary requirements regarding the specification of underlying technical and behavioural relations. Different approaches for agricultural policy analysis are distinguished according to the nature of problems addressed and the analytical procedures applied. Major drawbacks of more disciplinary analysis can be circumvented through functional integration of these approaches. The methodological foundations of an integrated bio-economic modelling framework for the simultaneous appraisal of agro-ecological and socioeconomic parameters are presented, and assumptions on farm household decision making regarding crop and technology choice, labour use, market exchange and price responsiveness are discussed. Implications of this integrated approach are analysed against the background of policy discussions on land markets, incentives for innovation, and public investment for agricultural intensification. Policy analysis for sustainable land use proves to be critically dependent on the specification of the linkages between decision-making procedures regarding resource allocation by farm households and their supply response to changes in the economic and institutional environment.

ID OVERLAPPING GENERATIONS MODEL; RESOURCES
AB International debates on food and agricultural policy increasingly endorse the principles of the free market and stress the responsibilities of national governments for active policies to manage development, to achieve food security and to safeguard the environment. This paper argues that consequently policy-oriented research needs to establish databases and develop models, in which both rural and urban households figure prominently and in a properly gee-referenced manner. This will enable the policy analyst to design policies and to monitor their effect on a regional basis. The paper emphasises that policy-oriented research should provide a nationwide perspective, because in relation to sustainability, as far as environmental economics is concerned, virtually all theory and theory-based policy guidelines have been formulated for national economies in their totality. With respect to the representation of agricultural production itself, we discuss a class of spatial estimation techniques that can deal with missing data and account for qualitative observations, and that can make full use of spatially explicit information on crop yield potentials as generated by agro-ecological models.

TI Agrarian policies for sustainable land use: Bio-economic modelling to
   assess the effectiveness of policy instruments
SO AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article
ID MARKETS; CREDIT
AB This article presents a bio-economic modelling approach for the assessment of the effectiveness of different agrarian policies to improve farm household income and soil fertility. Farm household decisions on allocation of land labour and capital resources for crop and production technique choice are simulated, taking into account resource availability, household objectives and prevailing market conditions. The modelling framework relies on a combination of three procedures: (1) farm household modelling, (2) linear programming, and (3) partial equilibrium analysis. These procedures are applied to evaluate the impact at farm household and regional level of technology improvement and a variety of policy instruments: improvement of infrastructure, price support, land policy and credit schemes. Regional aggregation allows prices to be determined endogenously on regional markets. The approach is applied to the Cercle de Koutiala in Mall, for which selected results are given as an example. Results indicate that technology alone cannot sufficiently induce farmers to adopt sustainable production systems. Additional economic incentives are necessary to foster technological change.

TI Siapton - An amino-acid-based biostimulant reducing osmostress metabolic
   changes in maize
SO AGRO FOOD INDUSTRY HI-TECH

DT Article
ID GLUTAMATE-DEHYDROGENASE; PLANTS; STRESS; CHLOROPLASTS; TOLERANCE;
   RESPONSES
AB The effect of Siapton leaf organic biostimulant on growth, water status and primary metabolic changes caused by moderate salt stresses was studied with young plants of Zea mays L. genotypes grown as water culture in growth chamber The osmostress changes were measured in relation to the following parameters: relative growth rate and water status; nitrate ((NO3)-N-15) assimilation rate; in vitro activity of nitrate reductase (EC 1.6.6.1) and glutamate dehydrogenase (EG 1.4.1.3); isozyme patterns (PAGE) of malate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.37); photosynthetic rate; chloroplast grana ultrastructure and chlorophyll delayed fluorescence. The data presented throughout this study show that the foliar spray with Siapton of the salinized plants brings the values of all measured parameters closer to the control values. The anti-stress action of Siapton is attributed to his specific composition as balanced mixture of free and short-chain peptide-bound amino acids. The beneficial effects of Siapton demonstrated at all studied levels suggest that this ecological product can interfere in the osmostress primary metabolic changes as a nan specific stress mitigating bioregulator. These results and the previously demonstrated wide spectrum of Siapton effects ameliorating growth and damaged performance of many crops under abiotic and biotic stresses makes this ecological product of paramount value for use in the sustainable agro-eco-systems.

TI Rhizoma peanut responses to harvest frequency and nitrogen fertilization
   on Louisiana coastal plain soils
SO AGRONOMY JOURNAL
LA English

ID ALFALFA; PERSISTENCE; ARACHIS; PRODUCTIVITY; REGROWTH; YIELD
AB Despite limitations in stand establishment, rhizoma peanut (Arachis glabrata Benth.) is the only sustainable, productive, high-quality, perennial, warm-season legume available for the Coastal Plain of the lower Gulf Coast Region. Management to enhance productivity could increase acceptance of this relatively unexploited forage. Yield responses of rhizoma peanut to harvest frequency and N fertilization on Louisiana Coastal Plain soils were evaluated. Nitrogen rates of 0, 85, and 170 kg ha(-1) were applied to a Dexter loam soil (Ultic Hapludalfs) in a greenhouse experiment. At three field locations, N rates were 0, 110, and 220 kg ha(-1) and harvest frequencies were 30 and 60 d. Soils were the Dexter loam, Tangi silt loam (Typic Fragiudults), and Bowie fine sandy loam (Plinthic Paleudults). In the greenhouse, N accumulated in herbage (30 g kg(-1) with 170 kg N ha(-1) vs. 20 g kg(-1) for the control) with a subsequent Linear yield increase. in the field, the only responses to N fertilizer were small increases in N concentration of rhizomes plus stubble. Interactions of harvest frequency and location on herbage yield indicated effects of weather. This effect is illustrated by the 790 kg ha(-1) advantage of the 30-d harvest frequency on the Tangi silt loam in May-June vs, the 1930 kg ha(-1) advantage of the 60-d harvest frequency on the Bowie fine sandy Loam in July-August, Thus, on the Louisiana Coastal Plain, yield of rhizoma peanut is not Likely to be increased by N fertilization, and harvest frequency or length of regrowth period is not a reliable determinant of yield.

AB Results from an assessment of greenhouse gas emissions during the life-cycle of the carrots and tomatoes consumed in Sweden are presented and discussed. The life-cycle was divided into storage, transportation from producer to retailer, farm production, and the production and transportation of fertilizers. Emissions from carrots were lowest when produced within or close to Sweden, whilst contrary results were obtained for tomatoes. For carrots, emissions during storage and transportation dominated. In the lifecycle of tomatoes, emissions were dominated by those from the combustion of the fuel required for heating greenhouses. The total emissions of greenhouse gases from present consumption patterns for fresh vegetables, in Sweden, were estimated and compared to an assumed Permissible Environmental Space for food consumption. The conclusion drawn is that present patterns of consumption and production for fresh vegetables are unlikely to be sustainable.

ID SAVANNA ECOSYSTEMS; ECOLOGY
AB The Earth's drylands are largely situated within Third World countries. Their essential property is dryness and the characteristic feature of the plant cover is low productivity. Differences in the ecological basis for grassland vegetation and woody vegetation and composition of the plant cover in dry climates with summer rain and winter rain, respectively, are emphasized. Future work to restore the plant cover of dry areas must be based on both sustainability and higher productivity for human needs. This work must include the restoration, as far as possible, of the natural plant cover as well as the rebuilding of the man-made plant cover, in a form better adapted to the hydrological resources, both surface- and groundwater. Extensive grazing of low-productive rangelands should be abandoned, in favor of more stationary feeding systems. The changes require simultaneous rural and urban development in the long term.

AB The boreal forest is the largest forest region in Canada, occupying approximately 315 mill, ha. Within this forest region long-term average annual area burned is 1.3 mill. ha, with extreme fire years being common, covering up to 7 million ha in a single fire season. Only 2% to 3% of those tires that cover more than 200 ha eventually contribute about 98% of the total area burned annually. Careful examination of fire statistics seems to indicate that fire occurrence is increasing in the boreal forest. Boreal forest tree species and ecosystems are adapted to the periodic passage of fire and some would disappear as natural components of the landscape in the absence of fire. Use of fire as a management tool recognizes the natural role of fire and is applied judiciously for ecosystem maintenance and restoration in selected areas. implications of possible anthropogenically generated climate change are examined within the context of sustainability of the boreal forest biome and the anticipated impact on fire regime and fire management.

AB The Lomie region, located east of the Dja Faunal Reserve, is characteristic of the Cameroon humid forest biodiversity. The ecosystem has a rich and diverse fauna and flora, notably tree species. Since the end of the 1980s, the use of biodiversity resources has been motivated for the creation of income. The current economic crisis and the Structural Adjustment Program that followed are the sources of this evolution. The IUCN/DJA Project, implemented at the beginning of 1996 by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and its partners, aims to conserve the Dja Faunal Reserve and promote sustainable use of biodiversity by local people. Meanwhile, data collected through the main tools of the Participatory Rural Appraisal method have shown that there is an aggravation of proverty and a serious erosion of biodiversity in the region. This paper gives a qualitative description of this context and opens up some prospects.

AB There are always many different futures available, depending on social choices. These choices involve various costs and benefits, so they often have different impacts on different individuals or groups. There will be significant problems in moving from the current development trajectory which clearly cannot be sustained, toward one that might be sustainable, as the changes will impose differential costs. Futures thinking provides a powerful way of considering our options and improving the chances that we will make rational, considered decisions. In particular it allows consideration of the needs of those who cannot participate in the normal decision-making process, such as future generations. The use of futures thinking in a range of teaching, research, and consulting activities is described, demonstrating the benefits of the approach.

AB Human Taenia solium cysticercosis is a major cause of epilepsy in developing countries, and porcine infection causes widespread economic losses because of infested pork. Recently, the use of oxfendazole (OFZ) for porcine cysticercosis provided, for the first time, an effective, single-dose treatment. We performed a controlled study to determine the time required between treatment with a single dose of OFZ and the death of cysticerci to define its applicability as preslaughter treatment or as a field control measure. Twenty naturally infected pigs were included in this study. Sixteen received a single dose (30 mg/kg) of OFZ, and were killed in groups of four at one, two, four, and 12 weeks after treatment. Four untreated controls were killed at week 12, No adverse reactions to OFZ were noted. A clear decrease in viability and number of cysts was evident after the first week after therapy, but even at week 4 some viable cysticerci were found in all samples. Twelve weeks after treatment, all meat appeared clear and only minuscule scars remained, except in one animal that had viable brain cysts. This study confirms the efficacy of a single dose of 30 mg/kg of OFZ for porcine cysticercosis but demonstrates that preslaughter treatment of pigs with OFZ will not be useful in controlling cysticercosis. The inclusion of porcine treatment with OFZ in mass cysticercosis control programs is, however, highly promising because it is a simple, ineffective, inexpensive, and potentially sustainable able method for decreasing the porcine reservoir of cysticercosis in disease-endemic countries.

AB The assessment of environmental sustainability of ecosystems, economic policies, productive processes requires an holistic approach, based on thermodynamic functions and able to consider all the complex mechanisms that are involved in a system. Many of the proposed indicators(1,2), focus their attention on single aspects, thus their use is not sufficient. In this study the emergy methodology is used(3), to assess the sustainability of three different process for production of DOC wine in the Siena Province (Italy): Chianti, Brunello di Montalcino e Nobile di Montepulciano. Emergy analysis is based on the concept of solar emergy that is the solar energy that is directly and indirectly required to obtain a,product; emergy represents the memory of all that the environment has supplied to support a process. Other indicators desumed by the emergy concept are use for a complete emergy analysis. The three farms appear to be very sustainable repect to the national average and the one in Montepulciano is the most sutainable one from a strict environmental viewpoint, while the one in the Chianti zone is more efficient for quantities of grapes and wine.

ID SULTANATE
AB Catastrophic floods and prolonged periods of drought are the main 'water' challenges facing Oman. So the inhabitants have had to resort to ingenious ways of utilising the available-water resources, such as through building falaj systems and the optimal selection of suitable crops, but nevertheless when exposed to extremely-dry weather conditions, temporary and even permanent migration is still the only option left to some of those adversely affected. The water problem has been compounded as a result of the rapid economic development of Oman since the beginning (in 1967) of the extraction there of crude oil in commercial quantities. During this period, the general health of the population has improved, the average family-size has grown, and the mean life-expectancy has increased. Also, as the economy has prospered, the number of immigrant workers has risen to become today approximately 25% of the total population. Thus the requirement for more reliable supplies of potable water has increased substantially and is still growing. The demands placed upon natural groundwater resources (i.e. fresh-water aquifers) have become excessive: seawater intrusion has occurred into some fresh-water aquifers as a result of the over-extraction of ground water and, in others, the aquifers have simply dried up. The Government has resorted to the use of desalination technologies for producing the additional potable-water supplies needed. However, desalination is relatively expensive and energy intensive! So a programme of better water-resource management is being implemented. This has required the collection of meteorological data for many regions of Oman. It is realised that the construction of darns across the wadi watercourses, to harness flash-flood water during storms, has the potential for reducing the need for the non-sustainable over-exploitation of underground aquifers. Also the possibility of utilising images taken from Earth-orbiting satellites for the exploration for ground-water fracture-zone aquifers is being considered in order to try to locate substantial resources, which have failed to be detected by conventional drilling methods, because such water is often at great depths (exceeding 1 km).

AB I examine a number of problems that need to be identified and accounted for when examining the relationships between diversity and ecosystem function. Among these are measures of diversity and complexity in ecosystems: species richness, diversity indices, functional groups, keystone species, connectance, etc, all of which may be difficult to relate to ecosystem function. Several important distinctions, when testing diversity-function relationships empirically, are discussed: Diversity of functional groups, diversity within functional groups vs, total diversity; manipulating variables such as body-size distributions vs. manipulating diversity per se; effects of diversity vs. effects of biomass; and diversity-function relations under stable vs. changing conditions or perturbations. It is argued that for the management and development of sustainable ecosystems, it is probably more important to understand the Linkages between key species or functional groups and ecosystem function, rather than focusing on species diversity. This is because there are possible mechanistic relations between what species do in ecosystems and ecosystem function. Diversity, being an abstract and aggregated property of the species in the context of communities and ecosystems, lacks such direct relations to ecosystem functions. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB A practical-scale solar-distillation-system (still) was developed which can yield fresh water from seawater without any consumption of fossil resources in the operation. The nominal performance is 100 kg day(-1) unit(-1) in summer at Yokohama, Japan. The still is a self-sustainable system which has 7.8 m(2) solar collector and 3.7 m(2) solar cells. It was constructed at the end of November 1996. The distillation performance showed it to be one of the best solar stills, although we tested it for only two months during the winter season, December 1996 and January 1997. A highest distillation performance of 73.6 kg day(-1) was obtained, which corresponds to 9.44 kg m(-2) day(-1) fresh water distilled at a solar radiation of 13.85 MJ m(-2) day(-1)(108.3 MJ day(-1)). The total latent heat of the distillation (178.8 MJ day(-1)) was 1.7 times the solar radiation. The power consumption by a vacuum pump was only 326 Wh day(-1) (1.17 MJ day(-1)) while the solar cells generated 952.5 Wh day(-1) (3.43 MJ day(-1)) at 12.25 MJ m(-2) day(-1)(45.33 MJ day(-1)) solar radiation.

AB Electricity generation worldwide is based on an energy mix in which water power and nuclear power with shares of 18 % each represent economic mainstays free from CO2 emissions and, consequentl, without negative impacts of the climate. The use of water power as a source of renewable energy is unlimited in time. Rut what about the use of nuclear power? According to recent estimates by the London Uranium Institute, global uranium reserves amount to 3,4 million t (at extraction costs of up to $ 80/kg of U). This would allow a park of LWR plants of 400 G We, with direct disposal as the back end of the fuel cycle, to be fueled for fifty ol sixty years. A closed fuel cycle with Mox recycling would extend the period to approx, one hundred years; if breeder recetors were integrated into the fuel cycle, it would grow sustainably to many hundreds of years, with the accompanying effect of preserving fossil resources for alternative rues. The new development of safety concepts for future reactors (EPR and BWR-1000) satisfying the German 1994 omnibus law is going to take the current safety philosophy (residual risk) into a new, vastly improved, quality of safety. Re search into plutonium burning and the transmutation of longlived actinides and fission products will show to what extent, and subject to which economic penalties, the long term radiotoxicity indices associated with final storage can be reduced to the level of the indices of natural uranium ores.

AB Agricultural geography has long been a predominantly economic field of inquiry. Recently, however, wider rural studies have incorporated more cultural approaches, and have considered the notion of discourse as a way of understanding the social construction of spaces and the social relations that are found in rural settings. Discourse is a useful medium for studying how gender is socially constructed within agriculture. Thus, this paper documents how Australian and New Zealand agriculture is gendered through media and organisational discourses. It draws on literature addressing discourse and gender in agriculture, and then documents how different understandings of gender are developed through contrasting narratives of masculinity and femininity. The narratives are shown to be circulating through agriculture at both farm and industry levels. Finally, this set of location-specific readings is outlined to indicate how discourses enable the maintenance or modification of gendered power relations that operate on farms and in agricultural politics.

TI Technological risk assessment in the field of agriculture
SO BERICHTE UBER LANDWIRTSCHAFT
LA German
DT Article
AB Technological risk assessment (TRA) is a concept for furnishing advice to decision-makers in the field of technological policy As a strategic concept, TRA is not based on a set-piece approach, but on flexible approaches adapted to the topic an the problem, the sponsor and the addressee, the context of application and the orientation of the decision, and public participation.
   In Germany, the concept of technological risk assessment has been applied to agricultural problems since the Eighties. This article furnishes a survey of current and past TRA projects in the field of farming (and food). The survey has been arranged to suit the complexity of the topic under study, i. e. according to TRAs for individual agricultural technologies, and for lines of development and their alternatives. The topic, the participating staff, the sponsor and the date of completion are given for each project addressed, together with a brief characterisation of the aspects investigated and the selected method of approach.
   The ideas for TRA projects arise from problem constellations and discourses both within and outside the agricultural field. The majority of TRA. projects have been conducted on the development and application of biotechnology and genetic engineering in farming and food production. In addition to this, more detailed studies have been conducted in the technological field of renewable raw materials and pollution of the environment due to farming. Finally, importance has also been accorded to projects related to alternative agricultural developments. In this respect, in recent years studies on the entire life-cycle of agricultural production, right up to the point of consumption, have been conducted with respect to sustainability. It is expected that posing questions regarding sustainable development for the future will furnish numerous ideas for technological risk assessment in the field of farming and food.

AB The brush-tailed porcupine (Atherurus africanus) is a hystricomorph rodent, which frequents the forests of West and Central Africa. With an average weight of 3 kg, it is a favourite source of meat for urban and rural populations of Gabon, Nigeria, Cameroon or Congo. Hunted in large quantities, its price is often higher than that of other game or domestic animals. Although its current productivity in captivity is limited to a single young per birth and two to three births per year per female, this species could be a good candidate for minilivestock programmes in African forest areas if its current reproductive potential in captivity could be improved. Further research should be encouraged on its biology and reproduction since the current level of hunting for this species is probably not sustainable. Captive breeding programmes could play a role in assessing a better knowledge of the species' biology, and in reducing the effects of intensive hunting in areas where this activity is no longer sustainable.

AB To evaluate whether rates of weathering of primary minerals are underestimated in watershed mass-balance studies that fail to include products of weathering accumulating in plants and in developing soil, changes in the calcium and magnesium content of vegetation and soil fractions were measured in large, monitored lysimeters (sandbox ecosystems) at Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest, New Hampshire. Weathering was evaluated over 4-8 yr in sandboxes planted with red pine (Pinus resinosa Ait.) and kept mostly free of vegetation (nonvegetated). Three mass-balance equations were used that cumulatively include (a) Ca and Mg in precipitation inputs and drainage outputs, (b) accumulation of Ca and Mg in vegetation, and (c) changes in products of weathering in soils. Soil products were evaluated with an extraction process designed to avoid removing ions from primary minerals. Relative to the input-output equation, the estimated rate of weathering increased 2.4 (Ca) and 1.8 (Mg) times when accumulation of Ca and Mg in pine biomass was accounted for, and 8 (Ca) and 23 (Mg) times when changes in soil products were also included. Weathering estimates that included accumulation in vegetation and soil products were 261 (Ca) and 92 (Mg) kg ha(-1) yr(-1) in the pine sandbox. These rates were 10 (Ca) and 18 (Mg) times higher than the rates in the nonvegetated sandbox, which were not significantly greater than zero. This study raises the possibility that weathering can play a significant role in the release of nutrients available to plants over short periods. Faster rates like this become extremely important where managers are trying to balance nutrients available to plants from precipitation and weathering release with outputs including harvest removals.

ID AFRICAN; FORESTS; MAMMALS; ECOLOGY
AB Conservation programs often implicitly assume that subsistence hunting by indigenous peoples using traditional hunting methods is ecologically sustainable. Indeed communal net hunts are less detrimental to wildlife than are the other principal hunting methods in central African forests, namely cable snares and firearms. However, research in the Dzanga-Sangha Special Reserve of the Central African Republic suggests that BaAka net hunters may overexploit primary game species including the blue duiker Cephalophus monticola and the bay duiker Cephalopus dorsalis. The method itself spares protected and endangered species, but overexploitation of game species results from increases in hunting intensity as BaAka populations grow and hunting ranges decline. Given the dynamic socio-economic conditions, subsistence hunting over the long-term is not ecologically sustainable. Wildlife management programs therefore must address not only hunting method and hunting area, but also must develop viable subsistence and economic alternatives for local residents.

SO BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION

DE endangered species; flooding; simulation model
ID SELECTION; NESTS; SITE
AB Up to 5% of the world piping plover Charadrius melodus population breed on the beaches of Lake Diefenbaker, Saskatchewan so reproductive success there is likely important to the future prospects of this species. We collected data on nest initiation dates, nest elevations, hatching and hedging dates, survival rates of chicks and causes of mortality. Study sites were located on beaches where concentrations of plovers were found during the 1991 International Piping Plover Census. In 1992, plovers fledged a mean of 2.0 chicks per pair (n = 30), higher than the mean of 0.1 chicks per pair in 1993 (n = 39) and one of the highest recorded for the species. The major reason for this difference in hedging success between years was due to the loss of unhatched eggs by flooding. Using 1992 and 1993 nest site elevations and reproductive data, we developed a simulation model to assess the effects of flooding on piping plover reproductive success over the last 30 yr. Our model shows that fledging success at Lake Diefenbaker has been below the level recommended for sustainability of the species, in 24 of the last 30 yr. To maximize reproductive success at this location, we recommend that lake levels be managed to prevent or reduce flooding during the breeding season. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB Has specialization of professional roles obstructed the holistic approach and sustainable development? A preliminary survey in Botswana involving construction professionals found that existing procurement systems have not integrated the efforts of the different project participants and also fail to fulfil the expectations of the users. A holistic approach involving the re-integration of construction disciplines by applying new procurement methods is proposed. An integrated, holistic way of working could provide a number of synergies through the consideration of the building project as an entire system. The implications include better decision making upstream, more efficient use of resources and the mitigation of negative environmental effects downstream.

AB Currently, there is interest in Western Canada in extending the grazing season using perennial and annual forages. Of greatest concern is the environmental sustainability of these grazing systems, with emphasis on their ability to withstand erosion. A study to examine the runoff and sediment yields of annual and perennial forages in central Alberta was initiated in 1994. Runoff and sediment yield were quantified under snowmelt and rainfall events for two seasons. Rainfall simulation was used to further examine runoff under growing season conditions. Four forage treatments (two annuals: triticale and a barley/triticale mixture and two perennials: smooth bromegrass and meadow bromegrass) and three grazing intensities (light, medium and heavy) were studied, each replicated four times. Total annual runoff was dominated by snowmelt. Generally runoff volumes, sediment yields, sediment ratios and runoff coefficients were all low. Bare ground increased with increasing grazing intensity and was significantly greater in annuals than perennials for all grazing intensities. Litter biomass decreased with increasing grazing intensity and was generally similar in all species for both years at heavy and medium grazing intensities. Results from the rainfall simulation corroborated those under natural rainfall conditions and generally indicated the sustainability of these grazing systems at this site.

AB Objectives. To explore possible enhancement of the mechanical properties of resin composites by aligning the filler particles.
   Methods. The resin for the composites consisted of urethane dimethacrylate (UDMA) and 1,6-hexanediol dimethacrylate (HDDMA) mixed in the ratio of 90 to 10; the filler was silica-zirconia in two particle sizes, 1.7 mu m (P50), which was mixed with the resin in the volume fractions of 29 and 48 vol%, and 0.7 mu m (Z100), which was mixed with the resin in the volume fractions of 37 and 57 vol%. Particle alignment was obtained by applying a 60 Hz AC electric field across the composite before the resin was photopolymerized. The stress-strain behavior and the elastic modulus of the hardened composite were measured along the alignment axis in compression.
   Results. The elastic moduli of the aligned composites increased by as much as 20%, and the maximum stress sustainable in compression before significant deformation occurred was elevated. An electric field strength of the order of 1 kV mm(-1) was required to obtain sufficient alignment.
   Significance. Besides conferring a structure to resin composites that is more like that of the natural tooth, particle alignment increased some of the mechanical properties and may have improved durability.

SO ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS

DE social sustainability; scale; intragenerational distribution;
   coevolution; ecological economic policy
AB There is no doubt that Daly's contribution of putting scale into the centre of discussion is fundamental for ecological economics. His central and well-known paper 'Allocation, distribution and scale...' [Daly, H.E., 1992. Allocation, distribution, and scale: towards an economics that is efficient, just, and sustainable. Ecol. Econ. 6, 185-193] is a landmark contribution. However, there are reasons for concern in respect of this paper which warrant further considerations. The first is that the arguments are potentially ambiguous and open to misinterpretation. Daly's paper could be read as suggesting that a strict hierarchy of goals is normatively desirable, that a target planning of 'optima' is independently pssible and that trade-offs between the goals are of minor significance. Although Daly himself may not intend such interpretations, they can be mis-read into his writing, with potentially serious consequences for the further development of ecological economic theory and appropriate environmental policy instruments. Secondly, the goal of 'economic stability' is neglected in the paper. Yet, this is one of the cornerstone criteria for public policy making. It is likely that Daly considers stability to be a 'meta-level' goal, which is an outcome from the achievement of several others which are considered in the paper. However, if this is the case, it is not made clear. Thirdly, it is likely that policies and instruments aimed at containing scale will have important effects on intragenerational distribution and on the allocative efficiency of markets. But these effects are not mentioned, although they are of crucial significance for societal stability. Hence, to be most useful in the development of a theory for economic policy, the original formulation of the arguments that Daly advances in his paper need to be clarified and supplemented. It is argued here that a thesis of interdependence (i.e, coevolution) of allocation, distribution and scale provides a means for achieving this clarification at the same time as offering a more adequate theoretical basis for a rational 'ecological economic policy' than comparative static approaches.

AB The author argues that ecological economics is developing a blind spot: an unwillingness to consider explicitly social and natural power relations. Following a review of the concept of power in neo-classical economics, ecological economics, political science and sociology, an ecocentric conception of power is developed. The author defines power as 'the production of (or the capacity to produce) effects' and examines some of the implications of this re-definition for natural and social relations. He argues that ecological economics must situate itself within a broader theoretical framework that recognizes the historicity of modern social structures and the need for a fundamental restructuring of social power relations to achieve strong sustainability.

ID HISTORY
AB Sustainability is defined as the use of the vital functions (possible uses) of our biophysical surroundings in such a way that they remain indefinitely available. This situation can be established scientifically. Consequently, sustainability is an objective concept to the extent that natural science is objective. The objective description of sustainable use of functions and the subjective preferences for such a use-the question whether or not we want to achieve such use-should be sharply distinguished.

SO ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS

   capacity; New Zealand
AB Sustainable development has become a primary objective for many countries throughout the world since the late 1980s. A major difficulty associated with sustainable development objectives, however, is the absence of reliable indicators to measure progress towards the goal of sustainability. The 'ecological footprint' provides an estimate of the land area necessary to sustain current levels of resource consumption for a given population. On an aggregate basis, the ecological footprint may be compared with the amount of ecologically productive land available to give an indication of whether consumption patterns are likely to be sustainable. This paper proposes the use of a modified form of input-output analysis to calculate the ecological footprint. The input-output approach provides a consistent means of calculating an ecological footprint using data collected as part of the system of national accounts in most developed countries. In addition, it makes explicit the link between the level of economic activity in a country and its corresponding impact on the environment. An application of this methodology to New Zealand indicates that it takes 3.49 has of ecologically productive land per year to sustain the average New Zealander's current level of consumption.

ID QUALITY; RENTS; LIFE
AB The goal of this paper is to provide an investigation of several approaches to valuing ecosystem services and to contribute additional techniques which may be used in evaluating 'green' GDP accounts. Our estimates focus on the ecosystem as a productive economic input, not a stock which is depreciated or depleted over time; as such, it differs with other concepts more frequently employed in green GDP accounting. Most of our results are derived from the analytical fiction that a single owner of the biosphere establishes a market for all ecological resources. This monopolist then appropriates all rents from the human population. The maximum amount the monopolist charges is first assumed to be world gross product less the global human subsistence level. In addition, we examine the excess rents available in factor markets using the assumption of weak complementarity between factor inputs and ecosystem services. We also provide more conservative estimates of the value of ecosystem services by investigating the sustainable price the monopolist could charge the global population and by exploring the effects of compensating wage differentials and a non-monopolist owner of the ecosystem.

   criteria
SO ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS

DT Article
DE environmental equity; sustainability; benefit-cost analysis
AB An implementable translation of environmental equity and sustainability is provided for use in benefit-cost analysis. As such, the approach builds on the underlying economic structure of benefit-cost analysis while trying to cause it to evolve in ways that take into account issues of greater concern to ecological economists. Environmental equity and sustainability are interpreted as imposing new decision criteria that require additional benefit-cost tests based on actual compensation to identified sub-groups of the population. This rejects the pre World War II compromise of economists regarding potential compensation embodied in the Kaldor-Hicks criteria. For environmental equity, a project is proposed to pass a benefit-cost test if the identified group either receives net benefits or is more than compensated for its losses. For sustainability, a project is proposed to pass a benefit-cost test if the compensation is larger than the net value of the resource, and the net value of the resource is reinvested.

   incubators
SO ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT QUARTERLY
LA English
DT Article
AB The latest report on the impact of business incubators distributed by the National Business Incubation Association (NBIA) suffers from severe shortcomings that undermine claims being made for it. Claims of methodological improvements are spurious, as are those for "added value" of the study results over previous incubator impact studies. It is likely that these claims, however; will be used by NBIA and other promoters of business incubator projects to appeal to sources of funding at all levels to support both capital and operating costs of such projects. Even though the latest study focused an a rather select subset of the incubator universe, 40 of the 50 incubators analyzed still have not been able to break even. NBIA still has a way to go before it can provide, or help others to produce, valid performance evaluations, performance benchmarking results, and management information that can help incubators attain financial self-sustainability as well as other performance benchmarks.

AB This paper deals with the present levels of CO, emissions from coal fired power stations of the Gangetic region which potentially enhance the impact of climatic change globally. The paper also focuses on the prospects for reduction of these CO, emissions. The discussion is based on the information gathered from two selected thermal power producers in India - the National Thermal Power Corporation (Government sector) and the Calcutta Electric Supply Corporation (Private sector), The paper also discusses the usage of renewable energy and coal cleaning policies to sequester greenhouse gas emission from the power plants along with the existing government energy policies of the country. The paper concludes that further assistance with energy conservation and renewable energy development is essential if India is to move towards a sustainable energy future.

AB The transition of Eastern Europe to Western-type liberal capitalism has by many observers been interpreted as an important step towards a more ecologically sustainable Europe. The main argument has been that the energy efficiency of the West-European economy will be imported to Eastern Europe and lead to lower energy consumption and lower pollution. This line of argumentation seems sound as far as the industrial sector is concerned. However, it does not take into consideration the energy and pollution bill of the lavish lifestyle of modern consumer-oriented societies. A shift away from the moderate private consumption of East-European Communism, towards the Western consumerist lifestyle may diminish or even abolish the positive ecological effects of the East-European transition to a competitive market economy. In order to shed empirical light on this problematique, this article explores energy consumption and pollution patterns of Eastern and Western Europe both as far as industrial and domestic end-user consumption is concerned. The article argues that these patterns are related to basic characteristics of the communist and capitalist systems and that pollution and energy-use, in other words, are fundamentally conditioned by the over all political economy.

AB This paper summarizes the information on the geology and natural resources of the Jordan Badia Research and Development Programme. The research focused on the issue of the environment in arid lands as an aid to provide practical options for sustainable development. This paper presents results of field studies in the following areas related to the sustainable development of the Safawi area in the northern Jordan Badia; geomorphology, including landform, soil, lands, processes and hazards, geology and physical resources and surface water hydrology. Tertiary-Quarternary continental basalt flows and tuffs cover approximately 11 000 km(2), the majority of the Safawi area. In addition to extensive basalt lava flows, the programme area includes a variety of geological outcrops and potential sources of economic products that include the following: tuff/Scoria, Zeolite/Olivine, Porcellanite, potential sources of aggregate/construction materials, ornamental stone, building stone, basalt for manufacturing of rock wool, and materials suitable for producing lightweight aggregate. The whole of the eastern Badia exhibits major fault systems, many of which were identified from landsat TM images. The system of wadis which drains the Badia is extensive, with the general flow from the north to the south and south-west. A noticeable geomorphic surficial deposit occuring throughout much of the Badia is fine-grained, water-lain sediments that vary in size and character. The local designation for the fine sediment deposits is Qaa. An MSS scene for the area under consideration has been studied. Twelve major geomorphic subdivisions or zones can be identified. Individual land system units have been identified by transversing the programme area. key sites have been visited based on Landsat TM image interpretation. To a large extent, key areas were subdivided after their initial identification on the landsat scene and corroboration in the field. The surface drainage of the Badia region can be broadly divided into wadi systems, areas of distinct channelized flow, and Qaa, predominantly fine-grained sedimentary basins of low relief. Spatial variability in infiltration rates across the wadi-Qaa system were determined from field experiments. Infiltration rates were found to be medium-high in the wadi channels but decrease rapidly for the Qaa materials. Apparently runoff from wadi side slopes will be high, and water storage occurs along the wadi channels while ponding occurs in the Qaa areas.

AB Toxkits are a relatively new generation of microbiotests developed by the research teams of Professor Guide Persoone at the University of Ghent, Belgium. They are an effective and cost-efficient way to perform, for example, regulatory acute aquatic toxicity screening tests of effluents, aimed at maintaining water quality and protecting biota of receiving waters. To date there are seven Toxkits on the market with different test species of different phylogenetic groups. The protocols for several of these kits (e.g., Daphtoxkit(TM) and the Algaltoxkit(TM)) adhere to national or international guidelines for toxicity testing. Supported by the Sustainable Management Fund (SMF) of the Ministry for the Environment (New Zealand), research into the development of ecotoxicity test protocols using native indicator species has been underway since 1995 at the National Institute for Water and Atmospheric Research Ltd. NZ (NIWA). The Resource Management Act of 1991 requires local authorities and industry to apply for consent to discharge effluent to water or land. Ecotoxicity testing is now being included in these consent requirements. Also supported by a grant from the SMF, Wellington Polytechnic has begun comparative sensitivity tests, using split effluent samples, with Toxkit organisms and native species. NIWA is contracted to carry out the toxicity testing with native species. Six Toxkit protocols and the IQ Toxicity Test(TM) (rapid microbiotest using fluorescing enzyme split substrate) marketed by Aqua Survey USA are being used in the comparison. In addition a round-robin intercalibration exercise will be carried out using selected Toxkits, in regional diagnostic laboratories. Information from the comparative sensitivity tests and the intercalibration exercise will be used to determine overall effectiveness and cost-efficiency of the Toxkits, under New Zealand conditions, and to make recommendations to regional authorities about their potential role as Tier I ecotoxicity screening tests in consents to discharge effluent. The research design is explained, preliminary results are presented, and an update of recent advances in Toxkit technology and their increased application in European countries is given, (C) 1998 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

TI Evaluation of the orphans reunification project in Eritrea
SO EVALUATION AND PROGRAM PLANNING
LA English
DT Article
AB As a result of the 30-years war of liberation with Ethiopia, Eritrea has been faced with a ruined infrastructure, devastated economy and damaged social fabric. A large number of children were orphaned (lp to 90,000) due to the war. Since 1994 The Orphan Reunification Project has assisted some 13,768 orphans and their extended families (6947) with economic assets to shore up their vulnerability. This article reports on some key findings of a major evaluation of the project, conducted jointly by the Government of the Slate of Eritrea, UNICEF and two international NGOs. The evaluation focuses on: (a) the impact of the main strategic intervention alternative of direct economic support to target families; (b) the psychosocial status or outcome of the reintegrated orphans; (c) the outcome of the project's capacity building component; and (d) the cost-effectiveness of the project.
   Findings from the evaluation suggest that direct economic support, particularly provision of livestock to farm households, has led to a further increase in assets. The evidence clearly shows that the status of assisted orphans compares favorably with that of non-orphans, thus indicating that the psychosocial integration between the host families and the orphans has been successful. Although orphan boys were indicated to be slightly better off, the gender differences were not dramatic. Substantial evidence also suggests that the project has built capacities of the relevant government ministry on a number of key areas-research skills and appreciation of the importance of solid operational research before social interventions, participatory planning, monitoring and management tools, community mobilization and advocacy for child protection. Finally, the reunification project is found to be significantly more cost-effective, psychosocially acceptable and sustainable than the alternative strategy of keeping the children in orphanages.

AB Single irrigation, compared to the conventional four or five irrigations, has been practised in northern China on winter wheat on a relatively large scale since 1991. In a field study, irrigation was reduced from normally four times (I-4, 4x75 mm) to one (I-1, 75 mm at the end of the second internode elongation) in an area with an annual rainfall of about 600 mm. A control without irrigation (I-0) was also included. Late sowing and early soil drying at seedling stage resulted in a relatively deep root system. Leaf area index, the size of upper leaves and the length of base internodes were also significantly reduced underI(1), but kernel number per panicle was not reduced, suggesting that the development of inflorescence was not disrupted. During the active grain-filling stage, it was found that leaf water potential under I-1 was maintained similar to that of I-4, while daytime stomatal conductance was substantially reduced. Leaf temperature was increased, indicating an inhibited leaf transpiration. Early senescence was induced in I-1 and I-0 crops and resulted in a substantially lower kernel weight. Although the grain yield of I-1 was reduced by about 15% from I-4, the water-use efficiency (WUE) for total water consumption was increased by 24-30%. Single irrigation can potentially make wheat cropping sustainable in this area in terms of water usage and prevent further depletion of the underground water resource. Explanations for the small or zero reduction in yield are: (1) the encouraging development of a deep root system that enabled the plants to use more water at depth (below 1 m), which is recharged annually by the relatively high summer rainfall. (2) A large portion of root system in the drying soil and its induced shoot physiological changes, that is, reduced leaf expansion and stomatal conductance, which helped the plants to establish a better canopy structure with a much reduced water consumption. (3) An improved harvest index. (C) 1998 Published by Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Lake Massaciuccoli catchment (Tuscany, Italy) suffers from many of the environmental problems associated with a typical shallow coastal lake surrounded by urban development and other human activities. Despite this, the fringing marshlands of the Lake maintain ecological resources of national and international value. This fact, combined with the Lake area being within the Natural Park has driven the development of a strategy for the restoration of the Lake principally addressing the problems of eutrophication and those associated with sedimentation of the Lake. Sustainability in policy and its implementation is the key to the management of the Natural Park.

AB A field study was conducted on a loam typic Udifluvent soil to determine the effects of tillage on NO3-N dynamics during the growing season, on soil profile residual NO3-N, on respiratory activity, on mineralization index on microbial biomass. The four tillage treatments examined were minimum tillage, shallow tillage, ripper subsoiling and conventional deep tillage. Soil samples were taken periodically in the third year after the introduction of alternative tillage practices. Results showed that the plot under minimum tillage maintained significantly higher NO3-N amounts both in 0-0.6 m depth. during the growing season and in 1 m depth after the harvest. Moreover, the minimum tillage showed a higher respiratory activity, mineralization index and microbial biomass; therefore, it seems to be an alternative management practice in accordance whit sustainable agricultural policy.

AB 1. Riparian zones hold a central place in the hydrological cycle, owing to the prevalence of surface and groundwater interactions. Ln riparian transition zones, the quality of exfiltrating water is heavily influenced by microbial activities within the bed sediments. This paper reviews the role of micro-organisms in biogeochemical cycling in the riparian-hyporheic ecotone.
   2. The production of organic substances, such as cellulose and lignin, by riparian vegetation is an important factor influencing the pathways of microbial processing in the riparian zone. For example, anaerobic sediment patches, created by entrainment of allochthonous organic matter, are focal sites of microbial denitrification.
   3. The biophysical structure of the riparian zone largely influences in-stream microbial transformations through the retention of organic matter. Particulate and dissolved organic matter (POM and DOM) is retained effectively in the hyporheic zone, which drives biofilm development and associated microbial activity.
   4. The structure of the riparian zone, the mechanisms of POM retention, the hydrological linkages to the stream and the intensity of key biogeochemical processes vary greatly along the river continuum and in relation to the geomorphic setting. However, the present state of knowledge of organic matter metabolism in the hyporheic zone suggests that lateral ecological connectivity is a basic attribute of lotic ecosystems.
   5. Due to their efficiency in transforming POM into heterotrophic microbial biomass, attached biofilms form an abundant food resource for an array of predators and grazers in the interstitial environments of rivers and streams. The interstitial microbial loop, and the intensity of microbial production within the bed sediments, may be a primary driver of the celebrated high productivity and biodiversity of the riparian zone.
   6. New molecular methods based on the analysis of the low molecular weight RNA (LMW RNA) allow unprecedented insights into the community structure of natural bacterial assemblages and also allow identification and study of specific strains hitherto largely unknown.
   7. Research is needed on the development and evaluation of sampling methods for interstitial micro-organisms, on the characterization of biofilm structure, on the analysis of the biodegradable matter in the riparian-hyporheic ecotone, on the regulation mechanisms exerted on microbiota by interstitial predators and grazers, and on measures of microbial respiration and other key activities that influence biogeochemical cycles in running waters.
   8. Past experiences from large-scale alterations of riparian zones by humans, such as the River Rhine in central Europe, undeniably demonstrate the detrimental consequences of disconnecting rivers from their riparian zones. A river management approach that uses the natural services of micro-organisms within intact riparian zones could substantially reduce the costs of clean, sustainable water supplies for humans.

AB The fertility rate for women and the related population growth rate, for numerous developing (transitional) countries, show a downward trend with increasing annual per capita energy use. On the assumption that such trends will continue, estimates are made for some simple cases of the energy demands required to stabilize the world's population in the period 2100 to 2150.
   An assessment is made of how these energy demands might be met, capitalizing as much as possible on the indigenous energy resources for each of the ten major regions of the world - North America, Latin America, Europe OECD, Former Soviet Union and Central and Eastern Europe, China, Pacific OECD, East Asia, South Asia, Africa, and the Middle East. Consideration is also given to the potential need to limit carbon emissions because of global warming concerns.
   The study highlights the crucial nature of energy efficiency improvements and the need to utilize all energy sources, including nuclear energy, if the world is to find a sustainable future with a much improved standard of living in the developing world.
   The deployment of more fission power can build upon the existing successes. The availability of fusion power will depend upon the pace of the development program and, in principle, fusion power deployment might start around the middle of the twenty first century.

AB Littoral areas of the British Isles present an array of properties and features which have long been exploited by human populations and have contributed to the wealth and the quality of life of the nation. Past and ongoing differentiation in uses of coastal zones has led to conflicts ranging from deleterious effects on supporting ecosystems to symbiosis with human activities. This paper aims to elicit the main forces influencing the development of coastal areas and the means available to assess the present use and manage future exploitation of the coastal zone, following the P-S-I-R Framework and an ecosystem function-based valuation methodology. A variety of pressures and their trends is analysed (climate change, population and tourism changes, port development, hydrocarbon and marine aggregate extraction and pollution). Al these factors are examined in the context of the sustainable use of coastal resources and on the basis of an interdisciplinary ecological economics approach.

AB Some 70 per cent of the world's shorelines are in recession (Bird, 1985). This is likely to be exacerbated if sea levels rise as a result of global warming; particularly in flat, low-lying regions. In recent years methods of coastal engineering have moved from 'hard' sea-wall type solutions toward so called 'soft' techniques, such as beach nourishment. These demand a much better understanding of the coastal processes that prevail. By acknowledging the regional scale of such processes, the benefits of a strategic approach to the provision of coastal works has been identified. This is now leading to a more integrated approach to shoreline management, which seeks to identify and resolve conflicts of interest. Within England and Wales, Shoreline Management Plans are now being implemented around the coast. These are beginning to raise a number of issues, particularly in the context of sustainable development, such as protection of isolated dwellings, or nature conservation interests. It seems that these can only be resolved through a closer integration of long-term coastal planning with engineered solutions. This paper briefly reviews developments to-date and begins to consider whether there is greater scope for coastal processes to be more closely integrated into current SMP practice. It also suggests some modifications to the existing institutional arrangements, which would further facilitate the now firmly established move towards strategic management of the physical assets on the coast.

AB Increased recognition of the importance of sustainable development is posing new challenges for industry. A systems approach provides a framework for reconciling the needs of sustainable development with all of the other demands on industry. The computer industry has been chosen to illustrate the application of a systems approach to green design in industry on account of both its increasing economic importance and the increasing role of computers in society. A brief discussion of the current environmental impact of the computer lifecycle is presented to set the context for the discussion of systems approaches to green design, and a survey of existing systems-based design approaches and discussion of their application to the computer industry is given. A number of examples are presented to illustrate the advantages and application of a systems approach to green design, and the principles as well as some of the main issues in a systems approach to green design in the computer industry are discussed.

AB In ATM Network. the VER (Variable Bit Rate) service category is used to accommodate TCP/IP traffic. In an international ATM network with large propagation delay, higher TCP throughput can be obtained by use of window scale option. In order to accommodate TCP traffic with window scale option effectively, it is required to select appropriate values of VER parameters. i.e. SCR (Sustainable Cell Rate) and MBS (Maximum Burst Size). and to evaluate the impact of UPC (Usage Parameter Control) function on TCP throughput. We have studied those technical issues for the conventional TCP. but the results cannot be applied to TCP traffic with the window scale option due to the TCP terminal performance and the large window size. In this paper, we proposed VER parameter determination method for TCP with the window scale option and evaluated the values in each condition. These results show that the determined MBS is much smaller than the burst length of TCP segments especially using low performance TCP terminals. Furthermore, we also discuss some experimental results of TCP throughput degradation due to UPC function. It shows that the throughput of TCP with large window size is degraded when the SCR and MBS values used in ATM switch are smaller than the determined values.

ID ORGANIZATION
AB This article evaluates the arguments regarding whether the development of township and village enterprises (TVEs) has been successful and whether TVEs can preserve their advantages and become a successful "third sector:'' After examining TVEs in three areas, this paper finds that TVE productivity growth has resulted from input augmentation, technological progress, and technical efficiency. Through a comparison with state-owned enterprises (SOEs), TVEs are found to be more efficient in terms of relative productive efficiency. Furthermore, as the level of urbanization in China is still low, the TVEs can and should continue to develop in order to both pursue urbanization and absorb the abundant surplus labor in rural areas. Thus this paper argues that the transitional role that the TVEs have played will not diminish soon. However along with the changes in the macroeconomic environment in China TVEs still need more market-oriented reforms, such as ownership reform, to allow their development to be sustainable.

TI Improvement of planosol solum. Part 10: Mixing of wheat straw and corn
   stalk into subsoil
SO JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL ENGINEERING RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
AB Based on field cultivation tests by Zhao and soil investigations by Araya, a one-to-one mixing of the second (Aw) and third (B) horizons was conducted to improve the planosol solum in China, leaving the first (Ap) horizon undisturbed by a three-stage subsoil mixing plough. This paper deals with the collection of wheat straws and corn stalks which are left on fields after harvesting by combines, how to mix them into the subsoil and the determination of the limiting length of wheat straw and corn stalk to mix into the subsoil. It was postulated that, if organic matter such as the wheat straw or corn stalk is mixed into the subsoil, where the Aw and B horizons are mixed, low soil hardness may be sustainable because of increased pores within the aggregated formation.
   The results showed that when a curved plate and a finger-wheel rake were combined, the required straw and stalk collection was obtained. The wheat straws or corn stalks on the soil surface were first collected by the finger-wheel rake and then, dropped by the curved plate, into the furrow at the rear of the third plough body. The collection rates of wheat straws and corn stalks decreased when their lengths were less than 200 and 300mm, respectively. For good mixing with the subsoil, the lengths of both wheat straws and corn stalks should be less than 300 mm. Cutting of the straws and stalks may be necessary to achieve this.

TI A solar-regenerated desiccant dehumidifier for the aeration of stored
   grain in the humid tropics
SO JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL ENGINEERING RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
AB In many tropical countries, high ambient humidity levels during the night pose di difficulties for grain storage. Typical problems are the formation of wet and hot spots within the stored grain mass, with mould growth and mycotoxin contamination. A prototype device that provides a supply of dehumidified air at night, using desiccant which is regenerated by solar energy during the day, has been built and tested in Kenya, where ambient conditions often demand dehumidification for 16 h out of 24 h. The desiccant was solid bentonite CaCl2, which is cheap and has a high moisture adsorption capacity, packed beneath a glazed cover for solar regeneration. Airflow was maintained by a small electric fan, powered by a photovoltaic panel and a 12V battery.
   Field measurements verified that the system is fully sustainable, with complete restitution of the effectiveness of the desiccant by day. A night;time airflow of 2 m(3)/min m(2) of the collector area, with a relative humidity of 40% below ambient levels, could be maintained continuously. Certain geometric and operational parameters remain to be optimized. However, it is concluded that a simple device, built largely from local materials, can significantly enhance conditions for crop storage in humid tropical regions. (C) 1998 Silsoe Research Institute.

DE grazing; cultivation; supplementary feeding; feed resource; dry area;
   rangeland; Syria
AB Changes in grazing areas and feed resources were described for a dry area of north-eastern Syria, from Map 1994 to May 1995, to identify the characteristics of flock movement and the seasonal changes in feed resource utilization, and analyse the main factors which regulate the system of livestock management. The patterns of grazing areas were classified into three main categories in the study area, namely, (1) harvested barley fields in summer, (2) a combination of both harvested barley fields and rangeland from summer to autumn, and (3) rangeland from autumn to spring. Changes in grazing area were regulated mainly by the time of barley harvesting, the scantiness and/or richness of feed resources in harvested barley fields and on rangeland, water pounds and cold weather in the rainy season, and governmental policy. The main feed resources were barley straw and stubble in summer, a combination of barley stubble and native plants on the rangeland from summer to autumn, native plants on the rangeland or cotton residue in autumn, supplementary feeding of barley grain and straw in winter, and native plants on the rangeland in spring. The subsistence systems of rangeland grazing and cultivation activities competed with each other for land use, but compensated for each other in feed supply for small ruminants throughout the year. From the viewpoint of grazing management throughout the year, integrated land use between rangeland and cultivated fields is an inevitable system in the study area. The contents of feed resources in the study area are still very simple, mainly because of the possibility of only barley cultivation by rainwater and the vast unarable mountainous rangeland. Information about the characteristics and the system analysis of the flock management in the study area could offer important information for sustainable land use planning in dry mountainous areas of northern Africa and western Asia.

TI From the business ethics course to the sustainable curriculum
SO JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS
LA English
DT Article
AB Universities want to prepare students intellectually so that they might eventually find successful, fulfilling work. Since work is synonymous with business - no work ever exists outside of business - one of the academy's primary goals is to help students enter the world of business, regardless of their majors. Many universities also declare within their mission statements a desire to cultivate a student body capable of making ethically informed decisions. Consequently we might conceptualize "business ethics" as not simply one field within the academic constellation, but rather the conceptual glue holding together the curriculum. And since the most significant new development in business within the past decade is arguably the emergence of theories of sustainable business practice, we would do well to consider the role business ethics can play in the creation of a new "sustainable curriculum."

AB Denitrification Is an important potential sink fur N in liquid manure and the amount of denitrification may affect sustainability of crops grown,vith liquid manure as a nutrient source. This study examined gaseous N loss by denitrification and the changes in soil N pools after liquid manure application, Liquid dairy manure was applied at four N rates (246, 427, 643, and 802 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)) to four quadrants of a center-pivot in a gear-round forage production system, Denitrification (using the acetylene block technique on intact cores) and soil N pools were determined before and for 2 yr after beginning liquid manure application. Nitrous oxide evolution from soil cores was compared to denitrification for a third year of the study. Denitrification rates and soil N pools increased after manure application at all rates of application. The two highest rates of manure had highest denitrification rates, although differences in soil moisture due to soil and drainage properties complicated the interpretation of manure rate effects. At the two highest rates of N application and two lowest rates of N application, the quadrant with higher soil moisture had higher denitrification, Nitrous oxide emissions accounted for about 29% of total denitrification, Denitrification ranged from 11 to 37% of total N applied in the manure. highest rates of denitrification and highest proportions of fetal N denitrified were found with the second highest manure application rate because these soils were wetter, Annual denitrification totals ranged from 32 to 114% of the excess N (application-crop uptake) available.

SO JOURNAL OF REGIONAL SCIENCE

AB I examine the sustainability of a spatial economy consisting of an advanced region and a developing region. The advanced region aids the developing region with technological knowledge on pollution abatement. The model is based mainly on that of van den Bergh and Nijkamp (1995) but differs in that the aids are determined through an optimal control method. The numerical simulation shows that the optimal control policy is thought to be effective in the sense that almost all trajectories of the welfare index of the advanced region are single-peaked with a fairly long duration of growth, and the policy favorably affects the welfare level of the developing region.

ID LANGUAGE
AB Hearth care in the United States has become an information-intensive industry, yet electronic health records represent patient data inconsistently for lack of clinical data standards. Classifications that have achieved common acceptance, such as the ICD-9-CM or ICD, aggregate heterogeneous patients into broad categories, which preclude their practical use in decision support, development of refined guidelines, or detailed comparison of patient outcomes or benchmarks. This document proposes a framework for the integration and maturation of clinical terminologies that would have practical applications in patient care, process management, outcome analysis, and decision support. Arising from the two working groups within the standards community-the ANSI (American National Standards Institute) Healthcare Informatics Standards Board Working Group and the Computer-based Patient Records Institute Working Group on Codes and Structures-it outlines policies regarding 1) functional characteristics of practical terminologies, 2) terminology models that can broaden their applications and contribute to their sustainability, 3) maintenance attributes that will enable terminologies to keep pace with rapidly changing health care knowledge and process, and 4) administrative issues that would facilitate their accessibility, adoption, and application to improve the quality and efficiency of American health care.

AB Chemical farming has damaged the environment and endangered the health of farmers and consumers, which led groups of people to assert the dissemination and practice of sustainable agriculture as an alternative farming. The government also recognized the impending crisis by chemical farming, and set up the Organic Farming Task Force in the Department of Agriculture and Forestry (DAF) in order to develop the plans for organic farming as a subject of agricultural policy. In 1994, Sustainable Agriculture Division was established in DAF and in 1995, governmental supports for farmers practicing sustainable agriculture started. It is mentionable that "Sustainable Agriculture Promotion Act" has been approved by the Congress on Nov 18, 1997, which will contribute to sustainable agriculture by providing lawful protection and support.
   Meanwhile, NGOs like Korean Organic Farming Association, Korean Natural Farming Association and so on have been founded for the dissemination and development of sustainable agriculture and Korean Society of Organic Agriculture was established in 1991, also contributing to the academic progress of organic farming.
   In the 1990's, a number of research projects have been launched by the colleges and governmental research institutes, and lots of symposia and seminars on sustainable agriculture were held. The government is also providing farmers with workshops and loans. Thereafter, farmers and areas of sustainable horticulture have been increased steadily, and now 3,856 farms from 4,039 ha of areas are participating in sustainable horticulture as of 1996.

AB Horticultural production, in general, may influence the environment in several ways. In Europe, much effort has been put into a more environmentally sound plant cultivation over the past ten years. Changes include the use and application of fertilisers and pesticides, the introduction of closed irrigation systems, the use of alternatives for peat and an improved waste management. Quire different objectives were set in the various European states. New and better growing techniques usually require higher investment costs, however, very often these are counterbalanced by considerable advantages for the growers.

AB In Japan, vegetables are often grown in continuous cropping. One of the important problems in this condition is the harm by the nematodes. Tare (Colocasia esculenta Schott.) is severely damaged by a root lesion nematode (Phratylenchus coffeae). Introduction of the new finding, "peculiar nematode maintained density", into crop rotations makes it possible to predict the efficiency of crop sequence in controlling nematodes and provides wider range in selecting crop combination. Tare is affected not only by P. coffeae bur also by root knot nematode (Meloidogyne incognita) while radish (Raphanus sativus L.) is attacked by root lesion nematode (Phratylenchus penetrans). The combination of these two vegetable crops and a third one, such as vegetable soybean (Glycine max), can minimize the injury of these three nematodes.

DE production system; sustainability; small farm; Thailand
AB The modern production systems for sustainability of horticultural crops in Thailand are featured on an ecology and resource dynamics with the emphasis on long term productivity and environmental compatibility. The land use systems as illustrated by diversified cropping patterns would attempt to mimic key characteristics of the natural ecosystem as they become more complex and well integrated. In practice, sustainable horticulture would advocate the lower use of inputs of energy and chemicals.
   "New Theory" proposed by His Majesty the King of Thailand in 1993, brought about an excellent concept in land use and management of crop production for sustainable development of small scale farming in rural areas of Thailand. The principles of this "New Theory" have been followed by many rice farmers. These farmers diversified their monocropping system by growing only rice crop to a multiple cropping of various horticultural crops sometimes including rice and aquaculture or animal production. The incomes and lifestyles of these farmers rose tremendously, with the maintenance of environmental stability. In this paper various systems in sustainable development of natural resources for horticulture production of small scale farming in Thailand as well as the concept of "New Theory" is discussed.

DE GIS; remote sensing; Ethiopian highlands; erosion; farm level; planning
AB The highlands of Ethiopia suffer much from environmental degradation. Funded by the European Union, an interdisciplinary team carried out research using geographical information and remote sensing technology to analyse degradation and to provide support for rehabilitation planning. The degradation was analysed on a subregional scale, using 25 x 25 metre grids, which was an innovative and challenging aspect of the research and did justice to the high spatial variability of the area. The universal soil loss equation (USLE) was employed to assess the potential and actual erosion risk. The factors for the erosion models were derived from the basic data using expert rules. The research illustrates how a geographical information system (GIS) can play an important role in supporting rehabilitation planning at both the farm and the subregional levels. The results show the locations where rehabilitation is most urgently needed. From the results, it can be concluded that different processes are of importance at different scale levels. At the farm level, attention should be paid to the erosion protection measures used by the farmer. However, on a higher scale, factors such as the presence of towns, accessibility of the area and the presence of malaria play a role. Further research is required to study and model the influence of these factors on the environment. (C) 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

ID INTERIOR ALASKA; CANADA
AB The dynamics of white spruce (Picea glauca [Moench] Voss) in a sparsely populated Alaskan valley were examined for management of subsistence firewood and house-log harvest. Site index, disturbance history, current productivity, and population age structure of white spruce were determined at 26 sites on five landform units. Human residents were interviewed to characterize local harvest patterns. Site index averaged 59 and was not significantly different among landforms. Current productivity, which ranged from 0.20 to 2.22 m(3)/ha/yr, was reduced by a 5-year old spruce beetle outbreak that killed up to 42 percent of the standing volume in some stands. Forests consisted of even-age stands initiated by deglaciation (20% of study area), wildfire (13%), and anthropogenic fire (26%), and mixed-age stands characterized by small gap-forming disturbances (41%). The latter stands exhibited old-growth characteristics. A demographic model based on age-structure in the old-growth stands showed that current recruitment was too low to maintain current tree density under conditions of natural mortality, and that removal of live trees by selective harvest or beetle outbreaks will diminish tree density. Current annual firewood demand of 61.5 cords/year is adequately supplied by beetle-killed spruce, but demand for live trees will rise as beetle-killed trees decay and become unusable. Small community wood-lots are suggested as a sustainable alternative to selective harvest.

AB In contrast to most of North America and Europe, numerous intact or lightly disturbed watersheds are present throughout southeast-Alaska These watersheds support abundant and diverse populations of anadromous salmonids. While the watersheds throughout the northern hemisphere have been exposed to human disturbance from millennia to centuries, significant human disturbance to the watersheds of southeast Alaska did not begin until the 1950's with the start of industrial logging. Although management of watersheds has evolved to reduce risks to aquatic habitat, the most intensive logging occurred during the first 20 years of limber harvest when few restraints were placed on timber harvest in watersheds. As a result, a legacy of streams with deteriorating habitat remains. While few salmon stocks in southeast Alaska appear to be in decline, escapement records on specific watersheds, particularly those most severely affected by management are non-existent or qualitative. The present status of salmon stocks may be attributed to abundant intact watersheds, high marine survival, and escapement levels that fully seed most watersheds. The numerous intact watersheds throughout southeast Alaska are a critical factor in maintaining sustainable salmon stocks in southeast Alaska.

AB This paper presents an empirical study of an 'expert' consultancy focusing on the changes that have occurred in the dominant mode of organizing over its 12-year history. From its inception, the firm was deliberately structured in such a way as to stimulate invention and innovation. The paper traces the changes that have occurred with specific reference to frameworks which emphasize modes of knowledge, knowledge communication and power. The research found that the organization had changed in ways not in keeping with that predicted for firms that are 'knowledge intensive', becoming formalized over time. Whilst explicit rules and procedures had not been implemented, dominant norms and values had emerged which shaped organizational arrangements and constrained processes of innovation. Thus, we question the sustainability of contemporary modes of organizing.

TI The zen of sustainable use of the planet: Steps on the path to
   enlightenment
SO POPULATION AND ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB At its best, the quest for sustainable use of the planet aspires to a harmonious relationship between human society and natural systems. At its worst, sustainable use is an assertion that human ingenuity and technology can free humankind from biophysical constraints and its dependence upon ecological life support systems. Although science guided by reason is essential to reaching informed decisions on sustainability, it must be accompanied by a new ethos, or set of guiding beliefs. Science can never reduce uncertainty on the complex multivariate systems called ecosystems to the degree that explicit legislation would be possible to protect the components on a species by species, habitat by habitat, ecosystem by ecosystem, and landscape by landscape basis without going to ridiculous extremes. This circumstance does not, however, invalidate attempting to define conditions appropriate to achieving sustainability. Some consensus must be reached on the broad, general conditions governing human society's relationship to the environment. A shared ethos would promote sustainable use and reduce the possibility of harsh penalties exacted upon species that do not respond adequately to alteration in their environment.

AB Background. Prostitution is the most important source of transmission of AIDS and sexually transmitted diseases in Asia. We developed and evaluated the sustainability of an intervention to increase condom use and reduce gonorrhea among brothel-based sex workers in Singapore. The intervention focused on developing sex workers' negotiation skills, educating clients, and mobilizing support from peers and health staff in promoting condom use,
   Methods. A pretest-posttest design with one intervention site (n = 124) and another comparable control site (n = 122) was maintained for 5 months followed by a time series design to follow up the intervention group for 2 years.
   Results. At 5 months, the intervention group improved significantly in negotiation skills and were almost twice as likely as controls to always refuse unprotected sex (adjusted rate ratio 1.90, 95% CI 1.22-2.94), Gonorrhea incidence declined considerably by 77.1% in the intervention group compared with 37.6% in the controls. Consistent refusals of unprotected sex in the intervention group increased from 44.4% at baseline to 65.2% at 5 months, 73.6% at 1 year, and 90.5% at 2 years with a corresponding decline in gonorrhea.
   Conclusion. Sustained condom use with a corresponding decline in gonorrhea was achieved by a behavioral and environmental intervention for sex workers. (C) 1998 American Health Foundation and Academic Press.

AB Studies to assess the growth in future passenger traffic at London Luton Airport have forecast that the current (1994) traffic of about 2 million passengers per year will increase to 20 million passengers per year by 2015. In view of this future expansion, London Luton Airport Limited has formulated a long-term development strategy which includes innovative integrated and sustainable transport links. The new access road is an important part of this development strategy. This paper describes the various stages of the new access road from its inception and planning through to final completion of construction and outlines how the informal partnering process, instigated after tender award, helped to ensure the project's successful conclusion.

TI Quality assurance in a psychiatric day hospital - A follow-up study
   using goal attainment scaling
SO PSYCHIATRISCHE PRAXIS
LA German
DT Article
ID SERVICE
AB Purpose: For the second time after 1990, a community mental health service questioned the outcome quality of its day hospital in rehabilitating primarily psychotic patients. Methods: In addition to the assessment of 66 persons at the beginning and at the end of an average of six months treatment in the years 1990-95, a psychologist who had not bren involved in the treatment interviewed 49 persons one year after discharge with the use of goal attainment scaling in five relevant fields. Results: Due to the economic recession the goal attainment decreased with regard to the job situation in the sense that it was difficult to find unsheltered jobs. By defining the goals in accordance with the needs of the patients, an improvement in the lodging situation was observed. As a result of the first study, quality monitoring led to an improvement of the structures that promote spore time interests. Social contacts and coping with everyday life showed sustainable achievements. Conclusions: These achievements can be interpreted as a result of the comparably long time of exposure to social learning within the therapeutic milieu of the day hospital. This hypothesis of a positive correlation between the sustainability of the outcome and the length of treatment must be validated by another study.

AB Biological diversity is the variety of life forms-microorganisms, plants, and animals including humans-at all levels of organization from genes to populations, species, ecological communities and ecosystems. Such diversity of life is a legacy of evolutionary processes. Tropical forests, including those occurring in Thailand, are rich in biological diversity. They are essential bioresources for human survival and wellbeing in terms of food, medicines, clothing and housing. These bioresources also provide us with novel genetic materials for development of modern biotechnology. Thai people have made use of these bioresources for their traditional ways of living for millennia. However, Thailand has lost innumerable life forms as a large percentage of tropical forest has been destroyed by human activities during the past four decades. Such loss of biodiversity is likely to have tremendous effects-often unpredictable-on the productive lives of all living things including ourselves. A basic knowledge of these living things is needed in order to facilitate conservation and management and to better understand how to use biological resources in a sustainable manner. Therefore, the Special Program for Biodiversity Research and Training (BRT) was established in November, 1995, under the joint sponsorship of TRF and BIOTEC, to support basic research in tropical biology as well as studies on policy development and management of biodiversity in Thailand.

AB Soil microbial diversity is important to sustainable agriculture because microbes mediate many processes that support agricultural production. The BIOLOG(TM) system for detection of specific patterns of substrate utilization by bacteria was used to investigate the effects of tillage and crop rotation on the diversity and community structure of soil bacteria. In each of 2 yr, soil was sampled (0-7.5 cm) in the wheat phase of different cropping rotations which had been established under zero tillage or conventional tillage on a Gray Luvisol in northern Alberta. Soil was collected from bulk soil at planting time and from bulk soil and wheat rhizosphere at flag-leaf stage of wheat growth. Tillage significantly (P < 0.05) reduced the diversity of bacteria by reducing both substrate richness and evenness. The influence of tillage on microbial diversity was more prominent at the Hag-leaf stage than at planting time and more prominent in bulk soil than in the rhizosphere at the flag-leaf stage. Microbial diversity was significantly higher under wheat preceded by red clover green manure or field peas than under wheat following wheat (continuous wheat) or summer fallow. The substrate utilization patterns of the bacterial communities also revealed that the bacterial community assemblages under conventional tillage had more similar structures than those under zero tillage. These results indicate that conservation tillage and legume-based crop rotations support diversity of soil microbial communities and may affect the sustainability of agricultural ecosystems.

AB Increasing use of N fertilizer for crop production necessitates more precise estimates of N provided by the soil in order to prevent under- or over-fertilization and their adverse effect on plant nutrition and environmental quality. Better laboratory tests and models of N mineralization are needed to better estimate fertilizer need. Long-term changes in N mineralization potential may also identify changes in soil quality that relate to favorable sustainable agricultural practices. We collected samples from the 0-20 cm soil zone of treatments in five long-term (30-60 y old) experiments to determine the effect of crop rotation, tillage, fertilizer and residue management on N mineralized during aerobic incubation, and compared results with N mineralized under field conditions where possible. Soil samples were incubated in glass bottles at 25 degrees C and -0.02 MPa for 0, 7, 14, 28 and 49 d. Soil N mineralization from wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)-summerfallow, wheat-pea and from wheat-wheat crop rotations were 32. 42 and 51% of that mineralized from non-cultivated pasture soil. Nitrogen mineralized, as a fraction of the total N present, increased with increasing N application, reduction in tillage intensity and higher frequency of cropping. Stubble-mulch soils mineralized 10-20% more N than did moldboard-plowed soils. The fraction of total N mineralized increased with increasing soil organic N content, indicating that organic N added through recent crop management practices is more labile than N in the native soil matrix. Nitrogen mineralization in situ increased linearly as a function of past N fertilizer application, which implies that a substantial portion of previously-applied N may be recovered slowly over time in subsequent crops and that fertilizer N needed for optimum crop yield may not be increasing as rapidly as expected. Nitrogen mineralized during laboratory incubation also increased linearly with increasing N application, but the rate of change differed significantly from that for in situ N mineralization (0.0042 vs 0.0112 kg ha(-1) per kg of applied N). The difference in N mineralization rate between laboratory and in situ experiments is not easily explained; perhaps soil processing for incubation altered physical access to organic N pools or caused a shift in microbial communities in soil. The difference in N mineralization rates implies that laboratory incubations do not accurately reflect N mineralization in the field, and strongly suggests that laboratory estimates of N mineralization be interpreted with care. Previous N fertilization, tillage and cropping patterns all affect N mineralization potential, and must be taken into consideration when estimating N fertilizer needs. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB Supplemental irrigation is expanding in the Northern Great Plains. Limited access to water of suitable quality for sustained irrigation and uncertainty about the impact of the use of marginal water on the soil resource will limit adoption of this practice. The objectives of this study were to determine the effect of irrigation water quality and amount on the infiltration rate, Q, at 50, 100, and 150 mm tensions, (h), and to relate the change in Q to changes in soil salinity and sodicity caused by irrigation. Tension infiltrometers were used to determine Q for soils at two sites in central North Dakota. Each site had 18 nonweighing lysimeters supporting alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) that had been irrigated at three levels of irrigation (1ET, 2ET, and 3ET) for at least 10 years with either good quality surface water [electrical conductivity (EC) 0.1 S m(-1), sodium adsorption ratio (SAR) 4] or poor quality simulated groundwater (EC 0.34 S m(-1), SAR 16), At the site having sandy soils, Q, averaged over irrigation levels, was greater [Q(50) = 5.34 mu m s(-1), Q(100) = 3.74 mu m s(-1), Q(150) = 2.96 mu m s(-1)] in soils irrigated with good quality water than in soils irrigated with poor quality water [Q(50) = 3.06 mu m s(-1), Q(100) = 2.31 mu m s(-1), Q(150) = 2.01 mu m s(-1)]. Level of irrigation had no effect. At the site having loam textured soils Q was lower under the two higher irrigation levels than under the 1ET level, likely the result of greater replacement of divalent cations with Na+ at the higher leaching rates. At this site Q, averaged over irrigation levels, were greater [Q(50) = 3.08 mu m s(-1), Q(100) = 2.55 mu m s(-1), Q(150) = 2.02 mu m s(-1)] in soils irrigated with good quality water than in soils irrigated with poor quality water [K(50) = 2.05 mu m s(-1), K(100) = 1.63 mu m s(-1), K(150) = 1.28 mu m s(-1)]. Reductions in Q were directly related to increases in soil SAR (e.g., at the 1ET level of irrigation, SAR = 3 in soil irrigated with good quality water and SAR = 6 in soil irrigated with poor quality water) resulting from irrigation. These results suggest that these sulfatic soils are sensitive to Na+ -induced deterioration. Soil physical deterioration was apparent at SARs much lower than the SAR 13 used to describe soils as sodic. Soil water compatibility in these soils is critical for sustainable irrigation.

AB Successful and sustainable semiarid dryland cropping depends on effective soil water storage and erosion control, which are influenced by surface soil aggregate size and stability. We hypothesized longterm tillage and cropping system treatments affect water-stable aggregate size distribution, aggregate water stability, and dry soil aggregation. A study on a Torrertic Paleustoll from 1982 to 1994 at Bushland, TX, involved tillage methods (no-tillage, NT; stubble mulch tillage, SRIT) and cropping systems for dryland winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and grain sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench] production. In 1994, mean percentages of >4-mm water-stable aggregates at 0 to 2 cm were 3.5 with NT and 1.0 with SMT in wheat, sorghum, fallow, rotation phase, or crop comparison plots. Mean percentages of <0.25-mm aggregates were 49.0 with NT and 37.8 with SMT. More small aggregates with NT help explain why infiltration was 90% greater with SMT than with NT during fallow after sorghum and 26% greater with SMT during fallow after wheat in a similar study on the same soil when surface coverage by residues was limited (25% with SMT, 57% with NT for sorghum; 73% with SMT, 86% with NT for wheat). Aggregate sizes differed due to cropping system, rotation phase, and crop, but aggregate water stability and dry aggregation differences generally were nonsignificant. Both NT and SMT are deemed suitable for dryland crops under conditions as in this study because neither resulted in unfavorable soil conditions or major yield differences.

AB This paper reflects upon the attempts by society to achieve environmental sustainability on the globe. It starts by considering the ways that the relationships between corporations and society are developing in view of the increasing economic power of the former relative to the latter and gives a brief overview of the nature of the perceived environmental crisis we face. Use is made of the metaphor of the 'tragedy of the commons' to illustrate this. Using systems thinking, the problem of the apparent conflict between individual self-interest and the needs of the community for long-term sustainability is explored and thoughts from this perspective about structural requirements for sustainability are developed. Concepts from systems thinking such as the need for autonomy to manage complexity, the parallel requirement for cohesion within recursive systems, the derived concept of citizenship to explore relationships with the community and finally levels of performance are all found to be of value in understanding this most pressing of human problems.

AB Increased recognition of the importance of sustainable development is posing new challenges for industry. A systems approach gives a framework for reconciling the needs of sustainable development with all the other demands on industry. The computer industry has been chosen to illustrate the application of a systems approach to green design in industry on account of both its increasing economic importance and the increasing role of computers in society. A plumber of examples are given to illustrate the advantages of a systems approach to green design, and the main principles and some of the details of a systems approach to green design in the computer industry are discussed.

DE environment; green marketing; industry standards
AB This paper discusses systems of good environmental management, adopted by industry, which go beyond (rather than replace) compliance with laws and regulations, as part of the quality revolution impacting both global and local companies and plants. From environmental auditing to environmental management systems, industry is increasingly focusing not just on compliance with laws-as important as that might be-but on continuous improvement in environmental practices as a marketplace demand. Movement has occurred in three directions: towards (1) enforcement strategies, (2) trade relations, including environmental cooperation, and (3) marketing of diligence as an attractive asset in environmental conduct. Consequently, the responsible green approach is also developing rapidly. That approach among management systems should be encouraged by industry, governments, environmental groups, and the public as a positive process that enhances sustainability as well as giving a competitive edge to local economies. Mexico's embrace of good environmental management as it responsibly develops is exemplary for, and evidence of, its leadership of other Latin American countries, and for other countries, such as China, that are making strides in achieving growth and environmental safeguards.

AB Sixty per cent of oncologic patients need radiation therapy for cure or palliation. In fact, in most neoplastic diseases, a better local control positively impacts on disease-free survival and overall survival. The efficacy of radiotherapy depends on several factors: while some are tumor-related, others are host-related.
   Radiobiological phenomena are also important: ionizing radiation is responsible for cell damage (double rupture of DNA chains), mostly an indirect mechanism with the formation of free radicals. Their toxic action is enhanced by the oxygen partial pressure at the cellular level.
   A number of studies have confirmed that good tissue oxygenation is a function of a high hemoglobin level in the peripheral blood (Hb greater than or equal to 13g/dL). Unfortunately, these values are rarely present in oncologic patients due to the disease-related toxicosis as well as to the therapy induced hematologic toxicity.
   The treatment of anemia is free of risk for the recent developments in technology which with gene cloning and the technique of recombinant DNA has allowed the production of human recombinant erythropoietin.
   Erythropoietin is produced by the interstitial cells of renal tubules in response to hypoxia. It prevents apoptosis and promotes erythroid proliferation and differentiation with consequent reticulocyte release and hemoglobin synthesis.
   It is not completely understood whether the efficacy of radiotherapy depends on hemoglobin values present at the start of irradiation (often less than 12-13 g/dL) or on the higher ones observed during and at the end of radiotherapy.
   Therefore, preventive systemic erythropoietin therapy in non anemic patients In terms of costs/benefits is at present non sustainable.
   To the contrary, in patients undergoing radiotherapy to extended fields or aggressive multimodal treatments, for the higher risk of anemia, the early use of this treatment can be hypothesized in case of initial anemia to improve therapy compliance and prevent negative conditioning of results.
   Keeping in mind that grade 1 minimum toxicity for red cells, according to the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) is equal to 11gHb/dL we think that this value can be considered as cutoff to start erythropoietin therapy.

AB According to recent official projections, 4.4 million new households will be formed in England between 1991 and 2016, These estimates are based on a detailed analysis of demographic trends, but fake no account of the effect of potential changes in economic conditions, particularly on the owner-occupancy rate. In this paper, we propose a new approach to modelling sustainable owner-occupancy which places less emphasis on demographics, but considers in more detail the role of market mechanisms through changes in house prices and rates of new construction.

AB Immunization prevents over 3 million child deaths from vaccine preventable diseases such as diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, measles and polio every year. New vaccines against respiratory and diarrhoeal diseases have the potential to prevent an additional 8 million deaths. Assuring that the existing and new vaccines are available to all children in the world is a global health priority. The health benefits of new vaccines like hepatitis B and Haemophilus influenzae type B (Hib) are indisputable. In the case of hepatitis B, over 1.2 millions deaths could be prevented each year if children and at risk adults were immunized with the hepatitis B vaccine. However, despite the clear health need and benefit, many countries have been unable to provide the 'new' vaccines, like hepatitis B vaccine, to their populations. For these countries, the limitation is not the delivery structure. Most countries now have immunization delivery structures which can provide immediate access to 80% of the country's newborns. Nor is it the vaccine availability as adequate capacity exists to meet the demand. The limitation has been the inability of governments to finance the vaccine because of a combination of factors including dependence on donors, donor policy, inadequate recognition by governments of the value of vaccines and, for some countries, the absolute price of the vaccines. The successes and failures in introducing a 'new' vaccine like hepatitis B vaccine into the world have clearly illustrated that it is economics and not epidemiology which dictates introduction of the vaccine into national immunization programmes. UNICEF and the WHO Global Programme for Vaccines and Immunization (GPV), have now developed and adopted a framework which differentiates countries based on their capacity to be financially self-sufficient for their vaccine needs. This framework forms the basis of strategies designed to co-ordinate the actions of governments, donors, agencies and vaccine manufacturers in order to ensure all countries have rapid access to affordable vaccines.

AB Weed science, like most sciences, has distanced itself from social and ethical discourse in theory and practice. This symposium illustrates my point. The 38th meeting of our society is the first time there has been a formal discussion of die ethical aspects of our work. Weed science, we often believe, is value free, as science ought to be. But neither basic nor applied weed science is value free; they are value laden. Operative values include meeting basic human needs through improved Food production, promoting the common good through abundant food, improving people's lives through efficient production of safe food, achieving agricultural sustainability, and increasing efficient food and fiber production and farmer profit. Truth pursued via the scientific method is valued and respected, as is belief in the goodness of scientific and technological progress. Most of these values rest on an ethical foundation known as utilitarianism. Most weed scientists and their colleagues in agricultural sciences are utilitarian in that they believe their work should be useful to humans and should promote the greatest good for the greatest number of people. What weed scientists believe and stand for and the validity of the ethical foundation of their utilitarian convictions ought to be central subjects of the weed scientist's research and teaching. Ethical reflection does not necessarily imply criticism or a need for reform, but it does demand intellectual clarity and an ability to affirm who we are, what we do, and what we value. Weed scientists should engage in an exchange about the ideas that are the end result of their experiences and discuss the experiences that give shape, substance, and depth to those ideas. In the absence of internal ethical reflection and value clarification, external distortions-including public criticism-will define the moral universe weed scientists must work in. Without embarrassment, weed scientists have to learn to ask about the ethical foundation of their science.

Four ways to view the origin of potentially conflicting values expressed in the five goals follow. In view of the five goals and differing value positions, the most pressing question for weed science is to what extent current methods of weed control are compatible with a more sustainable and environmentally sensitive agriculture.

AB In the field of agriculture animal production is at the core of AGENDA 2000. Milk and beef producers had according to the AGENDA to digest partly drastic losses of income which might be even higher in larger enterprises by the degression of premiums and the 90-animal limit with bulls. The premium system had to undergo considerably complicated changes. AGENDA 2000 tends to increase the environmental effects of agricultural policy. Especially losses of income would become a problem also in larger forage-growing farms.
   We want sufficient protection against these inconveniences, measures of quantitative control for market stabilization, reduction of support prices at most for beef, but then with full compensation. In the forthcoming negotiations the Federal Board of Agriculture will insist on basic amendments. The agreement on AGENDA 2000 will ultimately not fail owing to questions of the agrarian policy, since for superordinate reasons east expansion has priority.

AB Resistance to pesticides in arthropod pests is a significant economic, ecological and public health problem. Although extensive research has been conducted on diverse aspects of pesticide resistance and we have learned a great deal during the past 50 years, to some degree the discussion about 'resistance management' has been based on 'myths'. One myth involves the belief that we can manage resistance. I will maintain that we can only attempt to mitigate resistance because resistance is a natural evolutionary response to environmental stresses. As such, resistance will remain an ongoing dilemma in pest management and we can only delay the onset of resistance to pesticides.
   'Resistance management' models and tactics have been much discussed but have been tested and deployed in practical pest management programmes with only limited success. Yet the myth persists that better models will provide a 'solution' to the problem. The reality is that success in using mitigation models is limited because these models are applied to inappropriate situations in which the critical genetic, ecological, biological or logistic assumptions cannot be met. It is difficult to predict in advance which model is appropriate to a particular situation; if the model assumptions cannot be met, applying the model sometimes can increase the rate of resistance development rather than slow it down.
   Are there any solutions? I believe we already have one. Unfortunately, it is not a simple or easy one to deploy. It involves employing effective agronomic practices to develop and maintain a healthy crop, monitoring pest densities, evaluating economic injury levels so that pesticides are applied only when necessary, deploying and conserving biological control agents, using host-plant resistance, cultural controls of the pest, biorational pest controls, and genetic control methods. As a part of a truly multi-tactic strategy, it is crucial to evaluate the effect of pesticides on natural enemies in order to preserve them in the cropping system. Sometimes, pesticide-resistant natural enemies are effective components of this resistance mitigation programme. Another name for this resistance mitigation model is integrated pest management (IPM). This complex model was outlined in some detail nearly 40 years ago by V. M. Stern and colleagues.
   To deploy the IPM resistance mitigation model, we must admit that pest management and resistance mitigation programmes are not sustainable if based on a single-tactic strategy. Delaying resistance, whether to traditional pesticides or to transgenic plants containing toxin genes from Bacillus thuringiensis, will require that we develop multi-tactic pest management programmes that incorporate all appropriate pest management approaches. Because pesticides are limited resources, and their loss can result in significant social and economic costs, they should be reserved for situations where they are truly needed-as tools to subdue an unexpected pest population outbreak. Effective multi-tactic IPM programmes delay resistance (=mitigation) because the number and rates of pesticide applications will be reduced.

AB Many species survive in specialized habitats. When these habitats are destroyed or fragmented the threat of extinction looms. In this paper, we use percolation theory to consider how an environment may fragment. We then develop a stochastic, spatially explicit, individual-based model to consider the effect of habitat fragmentation on a keystone species (the army ant Eciton burchelli) in a neotropical rainforest. The results suggest that species may become extinct even in huge reserves before their habitat is fully fragmented; this has important implications for conservation. We show that sustainable forest-harvesting strategies may not be as successful as is currently thought. We also suggest that habitat corridors, once thought of as the saviour for fragmented environments, may have a detrimental effect on population persistence.

AB Tobacco use is a major cancer risk among minorities, as evidenced by their high cancer mortality rates compared with white populations. Prior public health prevention efforts have concentrated on affecting individual behavior change through education and smoking-cessation techniques. The American Stop Smoking Intervention Study (ASSIST) project, which is sponsored by the National Cancer Institute and the American Cancer Society, is a 7-year research and applications project designed to demonstrate the effectiveness of coalition-based policy interventions on smoking prevention and cessation. ASSIST places major emphasis on the involvement of minority populations in this project as well as all women and youth. Minority involvement is evident through 1) representation and leadership on all levels of ASSIST policy development and administration; 2) inclusion of minority components in all national ASSIST conferences, including minority recruitment, coalition development, and sustainability design; 3) provision of specialized technical assistance and training to the 17 states by the ASSIST Coordinating Center; and 4) incorporation of minority specific activities in the various ASSIST states. Outcome evaluation of the effectiveness of the ASSIST approach will be conducted after the project's completion in 1998. However, early indicators show a marked increase in minority participation. Between 1994 and 1996, there has been an almost four-fold increase in proposed activities to reach underserved and minority communities. Most ASSIST states have formed multicultural coalitions. These results show that 1) intervention models emphasizing community-based policy activities in cancer prevention can address multicultural concerns successfully, 2) linkages with groups with similar multicultural interests increase the likelihood and success of joint cancer control efforts, and 3) policy-based interventions are more likely to have a pronounced effect on decreasing smoking and cancer prevalence than education programs or individual smoking-cessation efforts alone.

AB The organic-rich (up to 35% TOC) lower and upper black mudstone members of the Bakken Formation (Late Devonian and Early Mississippian) accumulated in response to both increased productivity and enhanced preservation that resulted from unique palaeogeographic, palaeoceanographic and palaeoclimatic conditions. During Bakken deposition the semi-isolated Williston Basin was located close to the Equator (5 degrees to 10 degrees N) in a zone of prevailing east to west winds. A pattern of estuarine-like marine circulation between the Williston Basin and open-ocean conditions at the western craton edge of North America is proposed. Surface water discharged from the basin was replaced by nutrient-rich deeper water sourced from the equatorial undercurrent in the Pacific Basin. Undercurrent flow into the Williston Basin upwelled providing a potentially sustainable source of nutrients to enhance productivity in the surface photic zone during black mudstone deposition. Ln response to increased productivity, that led to a high rate of organic sedimentation, and quiescent, deep-water conditions, due primarily to the geographic isolation of the basin and the restriction of estuarine-like circulation to the upper water column, anoxic bottom water developed on the basin floor. As sea-level rose during lower and upper black mudstone deposition, anoxic bottom water expanded across the basin enhancing organic matter preservation. Conditions in the Williston Basin demonstrate that both increased productivity and improved preservation can be essential and complementary factors affecting organic-rich mud deposition. These results have potentially important implications for the accumulation of similarly organic-rich deposits across the North American interior during Late Devonian and Early Mississippian time.

AB The cost of electricity, the reliability of its supply, the impact on the environment, and the global sustainability, are all forcing the supply industry to make greater demands on the materials of construction of the generation, transmission, and distribution components. Not only is the performance being enhanced, but the requirements for durability, and the ability to identify potential failures, to estimate remaining life using non-intrusive methods, and to repair or replace quickly and effectively, are also subject to greater demands. Coatings play an important role in all of these aspects. In this paper, a very general summary of some of the more important issues is presented. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science S.A. All rights reserved.

   of sustainability
SO FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
LA English

DE sustainability; forest production; soil acidification; mass balances
ID WEATHERING RATES; MODEL; PROFILE
AB Data from the Swedish Forest Inventory was used to calculate mass balances for base cations Ca, Mg and K for Swedish forests, Using lysimeter and forest survey soil analyses to estimate present base cation leaching from the root zone reveals that weathering plus base cation deposition is not sufficient to support both, the present base cation leaching rate and the present rate of uptake caused by stem growth. Calculations suggest that 96% of the productive forested area may have higher rates of removal than supply for one or more base cation. Under a best-case scenario, assuming less pollution, the present growth rare and 100% efficiency in uptake of available nutrients, the area with more removal than supply would still be at least 30% of the total area. Forest soils are being depleted at a rate where the exchangeable reservoirs have high risk of being severely depleted in the next few decades in central and southern Sweden. During 1983-1985 the depletion rate is calculated to be, on the average, 0.33 keq ha(-1) year(-1). The weathering rate and present base cation deposition can sustain growth at a level where (80-85) x 10(6)m(3) stemwood year(-1) can be harvested. Any harvested growth beyond this volume must be sustained by artificial means,
   For whole-tree harvesting without base cation return, the calculations indicate that it would significantly increase the base saturation depletion rate to an average of 0.62 keg ha(-1) year(-1), and risk depletion of the soil in less than one-to-two rotation periods almost anywhere in Sweden.
   The calculations stress the importance that sustainable forest management must include the management of nutrient fluxes and reservoirs. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

TI Sustainability of rice-wheat based cropping systems in India -
   Socio-economic and policy issues
SO ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL WEEKLY
LA English
DT Article
ID PRODUCTIVITY; GROWTH
AB During the last three decades, the rice-wheat based cropping systems (RWCS) in India have significantly contributed in enhancing the foodgrain production and achieving the food self-sufficiency and food security. The production system now is under threat due to stagnating or declining crop productivity, and threatening the issues related to sustainability. This paper attempted to measure sustainability of the RWCS using the total factor productivity (TFP) approach. The paper also examines the role of legumes, if any, in improving the sustainability of this most important and productive production system in the country. The results suggest that the growth in TFP of dominant RWCS has either declined or stagnated. Legumes play important role in improving the sustainability of the system. Ironically, rice and wheat have replaced the principal legumes over a period of time. with the availability of high-yielding and short duration varieties of important legumes, there is a need to incorporate them in the RWCS to improve the sustainability of the system so as to meet the future foodgrain demands without degradation of the natural resource base.

AB At the roots of socio-economic and ecological crisis it: the Central American countries are development policies that have favoured agricultural production for export over production for local needs and intensive exploitation of natural resources for foreign exchange and short-term profit rather than for sustainable use. Such policies favoured large landowners, foreign corporations and banks over the majority of the people of Central America. The Central American development experience could provide a useful lesson for other third world countries.

ID CROP RESIDUE MANAGEMENT; PHOSPHORUS; FERTILITY; NITROGEN; YIELD
AB Yields from the rice-wheat cropping system in the Indo-Gangetic,plain ape declining despite the increasing use of chemical fertilisers, Crop residues are important components of soil fertility management, but are burnt in same areas such as Punjab state. Not only does this mean a loss of nutrients but also causes environmental pollution land the associated health effects); the production of substantial quantities of carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas cart adversely affect the environment. Limited published data suggest that rice-straw can be converted to high value manure of a quality better than that of farmyard manure (FYM). Its use along with chemical fertilisers should not only sustain present level of crop yields but also increase it. It would, however, require policy interventions perhaps both at the levels of the state and central governments.

AB In a sample of 105 firms in Spain, a relationship was found between strategic proactivity and approaches to the natural environment. The firms with the most proactive business strategies ("prospectors") employed both traditional corrective and modern preventive natural environmental approaches. Firm size had a major impact on the amount of training relating to the natural environment in the sample firms and on their corrective approaches but made no difference to their preventive approaches.

TI Erosion/productivity modelling of maize farming in the Philippine
   uplands part II: Simulation of alternative farming methods
SO AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article
AB A version of the Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM) capable of simulating the key agronomic aspects of intercropping maize between legume shrub hedgerows was described and parameterised in the first paper of this series (Nelson et al., this issue). In this paper, APSIM is used to simulate maize yields and soil erosion from traditional open-field farming and hedgerow intercropping in the Philippine uplands. Two variants of open-field farming were simulated using APSIM, continuous and fallow, for comparison with intercropping maize between leguminous shrub hedgerows. Continuous open-field maize farming was predicted to be unsustainable in the long term, while fallow open-field farming was predicted to slow productivity decline by spreading the effect of erosion over a larger cropping area. Hedgerow intercropping was predicted to reduce erosion by maintaining soil surface cover during periods of intense rainfall, contributing to sustainable production of maize in the long term. In the third paper in this series, Nelson et al. (this issue) use cost-benefit analysis to compare the economic viability of hedgerow intercropping relative to traditional open-field farming of maize in relatively inaccessible upland areas.

TI Agricultural activities affecting the functions and values of Ramsar
   wetland sites of Greece
SO AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
DE wetland functions; wetland values; Ramsar sites; sustainable
   development; Greece
AB Agricultural activities in the agroecosystems neighbouring wetland ecosystems are considered a major threat to the latter in all Mediterranean countries. This threat was investigated in thirteen internationally important wetland sites (Ramsar sites) of Greece. The effects of ten activities commonly practised in the surrounding agroecosystems on four wetland functions and four wetland values were evaluated. The functions were: nutrient removal/transformation, sediment/toxicant retention, flood flow alteration, and ground water discharge. The values were: biodiversity, fishing, hunting, and recreation. It was found that the Adamus' Wetland Evaluation Technique is useful even in the little studied Ramsar sites of Greece. Irrigation is the most decisive activity negatively influencing all functions and values, followed by cropland expansion and overgrazing. Coastal lagoons are the least affected by agricultural activities. It is concluded that in Greece the sustainability of wetland ecosystems depends to a significant degree on the sustainability of agroecosystems. The reverse is also true because wetlands provide irrigation water, crop pollinators, some frost protection, and predators of crop pests. The two ecosystem types are functionally closely linked. Therefore, a national policy for the sustainable development of the soil, water, and genetic resources of Greece must integratively consider both these ecosystems types.

DT Article
DE natural farming; sustainable agriculture; rice; Oulema oryzae; Parnara
   guttata; yield loss; Japan
AB Compared to modern, conventional agriculture, alternative agricultural production systems may rely on biologically different mechanisms (syndromes) to attain similar production goals. Yield loss to rice in conventional and natural farming rice paddies in Japan was evaluated by simulated injury (leaf-clipping) and monitoring plants damaged by insect herbivores. Rice grown under natural farming practices was more tolerant of simulated injury and injury from Oulema oryzae than rice grown under conventional practices. Natural farming rice retained proportionately more tillers and had a higher proportion of mature seeds than conventionally grown rice. In conventional paddies, the simulated injury may have made the rice plants more susceptible to plant pathogens than their non-injured counterparts, resulting in higher disease attack and proportionately greater yield loss. These results suggest that, pests may affect yield loss independently in natural farming, but in conventional paddies, multiple pest injury may interact synergistically, compounding yield loss.

TI Conflicts concerning South Korean forest utilization - a contribution to
   the present forest - political discussion with particular regard to
   forest burial
SO ALLGEMEINE FORST UND JAGDZEITUNG
LA German
DT Article
DE forest use conflict; forest burial; private forest owner; South Korea
AB Western media have pictured South Korea during recent years chiefly as a fast developing east-asian market economy. Geographical, natural as well as cultural and social particularities and problems concerning agriculture and forestry have been generally neglected. Little is known about South Korea's present forestpolitical problems. The author therefore endeavors to describe the forest-political background, the aims and the methodological implications of a current research project on the public forestpolitical discussion about South Korea's forest policy and forest owner's management habits.
   Although South Korea has largely adopted German federal forest laws, thus taking over sustainable multiple-use forestry as its own forest-political ideal, most South Korean private forest owners still cling to traditional management customs and forest products other than wood. A striking example for this is the customary practice of burying one's dead in the forests. Forest burial still today seems to be of major importance for both the private forest owners and South Korean public. Forest burial is said to be responsible for steadily increasing numbers of forest owners, princes for forest property, and a widespread disinterest in wood production and western forest-management practices.
   However, in recent years a public discussion has steadily heated up on the subject. Traditional forest-management practices have been accused of counteracting national forest-policies. South Korea - being dependant on imports of raw wood ever since the end of the Korean War - has been frequently accused of exploiting tropical rain-forests rather than using its own forest resources sustainably.
   The author describes the theoretical background, the aims and a first, limited selection of results of a written poll among South Korean private forest owners. The supposed conflict between South Korea's forest policy and its forest owner's management preferences is discussed.

TI Sustainable production: A proposed strategy for the work environment
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL MEDICINE

DT Article
DE pollution prevention; clean production; industrial ecology; toxics use
   reduction; occupational health and safety professional training;
   sustainable development
AB Background In the future, competitive industries will need to design for environment, health and safety as well as for productivity. Although the new areas of pollution prevention and clean production have evolved to address the design of production processes with concerns for the ambient environment, current pollution prevention models do not include explicit concerns for health, safety, and the work environment. The field of occupational health and safety has much to contribute to improve current pollution prevention approaches and solutions.
   Methods The application of work environment disciplines will need to be expanded fi om the conventional focus on "end-of-pipe" assessment and solutions, which take the production processes and resulting hazards as a given, to include a new focus on materials selection and process redesign. To make this shift, a new framework called "sustainable production" is proposed. The basic unit of sustainable production is the production process. The framework integrates a focus on the ambient and work environment along with a focus on productivity and the economic viability of the business enterprise in setting production process design parameters.
   Results By shifting the focus of occupational and environmental health and safety from exposure control to process design, sustainable production reduces the likelihood that concerns for health, safety, and the environment will be seen as antagonistic to productivity and economic development. To move a firm toward sustainable production, occupational health and safety professionals will need to participate in interdisciplinary workplace teams that design and build new production processes and that continuously evaluate and redesign existing processes.
   Conclusions This new strategy requires an expansion of the role of the occupational health and safety professional to include evaluation and redesign of processes that produce goods and services as well as the conventional evaluation of chemical, physical, and biological agents, work practices, and ergonomics. This expansion of occupational and environmental health and safety requires new research to develop the scientific and public policy basis of sustainable production. (C) 1998 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

DE firearms; gunshot wounds; stab wounds; surveillance
ID DEATH
AB Context: Surveillance data on nonfatal weapon-related injuries-particularly those treated only in the emergency department (ED)-have been largely unavailable.
   Objective: To develop a surveillance system for fatal and nonfatal gunshot wounds and sharp instrument assaults.
   Design: The Massachusetts Department of Public Health (DPH) developed an ED-based reporting system for weapon-related injuries. Inpatient discharges and mortality data were linked to ED data, and police data sources were evaluated.
   Setting: Statewide.
   Participants: All 84 acute care hospital emergency departments. Uniform Hospital Discharge Data Set (UHDDS), mortality, and police data were obtained from existing systems.
   Main Outcome Measures: System sensitivity, predictive value positive (PW), representativeness, flexibility, usefulness, acceptability, and sustainability.
   Results: The ED reporting system captured 82% of firearm-related injuries and 74% of reportable sharp instrument wounds from 1994 to 1996. Case reporting by demographic characteristics of the victim was representative and largely complete. Reporting by characteristics of the incident (e.g., type of gun) was less reliable. Police data were used to augment the system. From 1994 to 1996, ED-treated gunshot wounds dropped 41%, from 662 in 1994 to 393 in 1996. Unintentional and self-inflicted gunshot wounds showed no declines. For every firearm-related homicide, 4.7 nonfatal firearm assaults were treated; 85% of self-inflicted gunshot wounds were fatal.
   Conclusions: The system has proven timely (1996 ED data were available for release in March 1997), flexible (the reporting form has been revised several times), useful (DPH responds to 150 weapon injury data requests annually), acceptable (reporting is voluntary and no hospital declined participation), and sustainable (state funding is currently supporting the ED reporting system).

AB Context: Firearm-related injuries rank second only to motor vehicle-related injuries as a cause of injury death in Wisconsin.
   Objective: To evaluate the attributes of the Wisconsin Firearm-Related Injury Surveillance System.
   Design: A structured surveillance system evaluation using predetermined criteria.
   Setting: A passive surveillance system linking administrative data from existing state-funded inpatient hospitalization and mortality databases.
   Participants: State health department.
   Main Outcome Measures: Attributes assessed included simplicity, flexibility, acceptability, sensitivity, predictive value positive, representativeness, timeliness, resources, and data quality.
   Results: The use of two existing state databases simplifies data acquisition and linkage. However, hospital discharge and vital records databases are not sufficiently flexible to collect perpetrator and circumstance information. Acceptability is high because of state-mandated reporting to both databases. For firearm-related injuries requiring hospitalization, the system's predictive value positive is 97% when E codes are compared with data from chart reviews. The system is considered timely because annual data from the hospital discharge and vital records systems can be obtained, linked, analyzed, and reported by September of the subsequent pear. The system is sustainable largely because existing software is used for annual evaluations, which requires less than 2 weeks of staff time.
   Conclusions: With minimal resources and time, the Wisconsin Firearm-Related Injury Surveillance System uses existing state government databases to describe and report the burden of firearm-related injuries. Additional information on circumstances, perpetrators, and weapons involved are available but additional resources are needed to integrate this information with existing data.

AB The kinetic analysis of IAsys biosensor association data usually relies upon the assumption of constant ligate concentration. In certain circumstances this assumption may no longer be valid, In a similar vein, the analysis of the dissociation phase assumes the concentration of ligate to be negligible in the liquid phase-an assumption that may not be sustainable for high-affinity interactions. In this paper we derive analytical solutions of the second-order differential kinetic equations for the association and dissociation phases, together with a binding isotherm that also allows for changes in concentration of both the ligand and the Ligate. Using these equations it is possible to determine the conditions under which the pseudo-first-order assumption ceases to be valid. It is found that the effect of Ligate depletion on the association rate constant becomes significant only when binding low ligate concentrations to Ligand on surfaces with high binding capacities or high affinities, Similarly, the rebinding in the dissociation phase is dependent upon the affinity and the Ligand capacity together with the starting dissociation response compared to the capacity, Finally, depletion also affects the form of the binding isotherm, particularly in situations involving high matrix capacities for ligate and high-affinity interactions.

AB Domestic herbivores often utilize heterogeneous grasslands unevenly which can lead to resource degradation. However, uneven grazing can be beneficial for biodiversity. To fulfill multiple land use goals, prediction and management of spatial grazing patterns of livestock are essential. Simulation models based on optimal foraging theory have been useful for quantifying some underlying behavioral mechanisms. Controlled behavioral studies have shown that livestock have cognitive abilities sufficient to solve complex spatial tasks. Livestock appear to evaluate the tradeoffs between travel costs and forage quality and quantity. Recent studies of grazing behavior and spatial movement patterns of livestock have led to development and reevaluation of management tools to modify grazing distribution. Providing water, supplement, salt, shade and shelter can attract livestock to underutilized feeding sites. Selecting animals that are more willing to climb slopes and travel far from water may improve forage use in rugged terrain. To ensure the sustainability and productivity of heterogeneous grasslands, managers must be able to understand and manipulate livestock grazing patterns. Continued research at both theoretical and applied levels is needed. (C) Elsevier/Inra.

AB According to the situations encountered in extensified breeding farms, three important pieces of ecological knowledge allow to understand grassland ecosystem dynamics, in order to settle sustainable pasture management in both production and environmental aims. i) The interaction between vegetation and herbivores must be considered as well as the long term adaptation between vegetation status and stocking rate, or as the instantaneous modulation of grassland production and structure under herbivore predation. ii) The dynamics of botanical composition must be represented in terms of sensitivity and resilience to perturbations or to management changes, which condition primary phytomass production and accumulation. Extensifying grassland management induces reversible effects on the seasonal dynamics of the phytomass, but cumulative negative effects on botanical composition. Species strategies are involved in the dynamics of the spatial structure and diversity of the vegetation. iii) The management of the nitrogen cycle allows to manipulate in a long term the soil nitrogen supplying capacity, for improving the perennity of sowed swards, or making easier the control of the phytomass under low stocking rates. The implications for N leaching are discussed. (C) Elsevier/Inra.

AB Earthworm communities were studied in 72 different agroecosystems including vineyards and three types of orchards: apple, peach and kiwi. Orchards had different agricultural inputs, in particular copper (namely, copper sulphate applied as fungicide), and soil cultivation. Heavy metals were analyzed together with other soil parameters (nutrients, bacteria and fungi). No differences were detected regarding microorganisms in orchards subjected to different agricultural practices. Copper concentration was higher in vineyards. Total earthworm abundance and biomass were severely reduced both by copper input and soil tillage. Individual species gave different responses to agricultural practices. Aporrectodea caliginosa was negatively affected by both copper concentration and soil cultivation, while Allolobophora chlorotica was negatively affected only by copper input. Lumbricus rubellus and Lumbricus castaneus were nearly absent in tilled orchards but apparently they were not much affected by copper input. Octodrilus lissaensis and Octodrilus pseudocomplanatus did not seem to be reduced by copper input and soil tillage. Species number and biomass were reduced both by tillage and copper input. Negative effects of tillage and fungicide residues (Cu, Zn) are clear enough factors to promote more extensive use of earthworms as reliable bioindicators in the rural landscape.

AB A new method is presented for assessment of compositional changes in disturbed savanna systems and for identification of species susceptible to local extinction. Such information is urgently needed as a basis for management plans that aim at ensuring conservation and sustainable use of savanna vegetation. Size class distributions (SCDs) of trees and shrubs from a fire-disturbed savanna in Senegal are analysed and compared to observations provided by local people on declining species. Many species, particularly large trees, have few young individuals and therefore flat SCDs that deviate from the reverse-J shape SCD characterizing species with abundant and constant rejuvenation. Based on comparisons of SCDs with local information and historical records, it is concluded that most of the flat distributions analysed are effects of declining: population sizes caused by human impact, particularly fire. Results from the analyses certify that a change in species composition from a vegetation characterized by large trees to one dominated by shrubs takes place. Whereas most of the declining species are locally appreciated, this is not the case for the few species with good rejuvenation. Therefore, if the observed trend continues, it will have severe implications for the local communities.

TI The California fishery for market squid (Loligo opalescens)
SO CALIFORNIA COOPERATIVE OCEANIC FISHERIES INVESTIGATIONS REPORTS
LA English
DT Article
AB The California fishery for market squid (Loligo opalescens) was established over 130 years ago in Monterey Bay, central California. The fishery expanded into southern California after the 1950s, but remained relatively minor until the late 1980s, when worldwide demand for all squid species increased. Landings in California prior to 1987 rarely exceeded 20,000 metric tons. Since then, landings have increased fourfold, and squid is now the state's largest fishery in both tons landed and market value. The number of vessels participating in the fishery has also increased from approximately 85 to over 130.
   Industry members have questioned whether such high catches are sustainable. Unfortunately, the California Department of Fish and Game has a paucity of data to determine how best to provide for sustainable harvest. Knowledge and experience from other Loliginid fisheries around the world are sought to guide us in developing a state management plan for the market squid.

ID FLEET
AB Recent events in the fishery for California market squid (Loligo opalescens), especially the rapid increase in landings and participants, have raised concerns about its socioeconomic as well as its biological sustainability. As management options for the fishery are considered, it is essential to take into account the fishery's social and economic organization, including its structure; its temporal and spatial organization; the relationships among fishers, processors, and others involved in the fishery; and the informal and formal rules and strategies by which its participants operate. These factors will influence how different management options would affect-and be affected by-the fishery. We have begun to explore these aspects of the fishery in a Sea Grant-sponsored study entitled "Socio-Economic Organization of the California Market Squid Fishery: Assessment for Optimal Resource Management." This paper begins with an overview of fisheries social science and its application to fishery management elsewhere. We then provide an overview of the social, economic, and regulatory history of the fishery, followed by an introduction to our study and questions it will address toward contributing to consideration and implementation of management for the fishery.

TI Predicting germination capacity of Pinus sylvestris and Picea abies
   seeds using temperature data from weather stations
SO CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH-REVUE CANADIENNE DE RECHERCHE

DT Article
AB In Fennoscandia, both Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) and Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) often fail to produce mature seed, especially in the northern parts of their range. Therefore, cone and seed crop predictions are of major strategic importance for maintaining sustainable multipurpose forestry. We present functions for predicting germination capacity of Pinus sylvestris and Picea abies seed over a wide geographic area. The functions are based on germination analyses for 1297 Pinus sylvestris and 597 Picea abies natural stands in Sweden during 1971-1994. Meteorological data from 71 weather stations were used to calculate heat sums with threshold values from 4 to 10 degrees C and two durations of growing season (ending August 31 or September 30). Logistic regression was utilised for parameter estimates. Accumulated heat sum (threshold 5 degrees C) from start of growing season until August 31 in combination with number of days from estimated time of fertilisation until approximate time for embryo growth cessation gave the best function. The function shows that Picea abies has lower temperature requirements for producing mature seed than Pinus sylvestris. A germination capacity of 95% is reached at a heat sum of 875 degree-days for Picea abies and at 975 degree-days for Pinus sylvestris.

TI Ecological sustainability of the South Australian coastal aquaculture
   management policies
SO COASTAL MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
DE aquaculture; management; policy; South Australia
AB Coastal aquaculture in South Australia has been going through a period of unprecedented growth during the past seven years. The value of the South Australian aquaculture industry has increased from US$1.3 million in 1990-1991 to an estimated US$31 million in 1996-1997. This growth has led to the implementation of planning and management policies by the state government. South Australian coastal waters have been divided into regions, and regional aquaculture management plans have been prepared. These management policies have generated concerns among interest groups and the community. The recent coastal aquaculture planning and management policies are described and analyzed, focusing on their contribution to the development of an ecologically sustainable industry. The need for an integrated approach to management is emphasized, especially given the great interest of the state government on the development of the industry.

ID INFORMATION; RETURNS
AB In this paper, the author discusses recent improvements in the understanding of economic development, in particular the emergence of what is sometimes called the 'post-Washington consensus" He elaborate his remarks on two themes. Firstly, he focus on the idea that now we have a better understanding of what makes markets work well. The Washington consensus held that good economic performance required liberalized trade, macroeconomic stability and getting prices right. Given so. private markets would both allocate resources efficiently and generate robust growth. However, these policies are not complete and they are sometimes misguided. Making markets work requires more that just low inflation: it requires sound financial regulation, competition policy and policies to facilitate the transfer of technology and to encourage transparence, to cite some fundamental issues neglected by the Washington consensus, nle second theme refers to what can be conceived as a wider set of objectives of development. These include targets different from economic growth, such as sustainable development egalitarian development and democratic development. The author describes the complementary strategies that can advance these goals simultaneously and points out several warnings about the difficult tradeoffs that ha vs to be faced to pursue them. Finally, two principles emerging from these ideas are presented. The first states that whatever the new consensus Is going be, it cannot be based on Washington, If policies are to be sustainable, developing countries must claim ownership of them. The second principle of the emerging consensus establishes that a greater degree of humility is called for as an acknowledgment of the fact that we do not have all the answers.

AB The strategy of managing for "natural" patterns towards ecological sustainability of forests is currently limited to simple spatial attributes of landscapes. Yet, there is general agreement that landscapes are highly dynamic entities suggesting that temporal patterns may also be important. This study used historical estimates of 20-yr disturbance rates, and a spatially explicit, stochastic landscape model to create multiple possible landscape mosaic scenes for three different landscapes in the foothills of Alberta. The results were summarized as frequency distributions by age-class, and the distributions compared to the percentage of area in the current, and the pre-commercial landscapes. Results indicated that aside from one age-class in one of the landscapes, both current and pre-commercial age-class distributions were well within the historical ranges suggested by the simulations. More generally, the simulations indicated relatively high, but landscape specific, levels of historical temporal variability. This implies that there are patterns to temporal variability which may be captured, quantified. and emulated as alternatives to single age-class management targets. The research also demonstrates a method of assessing age-class distributions within the context of historical ranges of distributions.

AB One may understand the Joint Comprehensive Programme to restore the ecological balance of the Baltic Sea, which was initiated and has been signed by the Baltic Littoral States and the European Community, as confirming the target of environmental sustainability. The paper seeks to answer three questions and proposes a program for participatory action. The first questions it broaches are: (a) is the target of environmental sustainability socially feasible; (b) how can ecological economics support decision making processes in complex systems such as the Baltic Sea and its watershed area, where uncertainty is an important process variable; and (c) how can a program be designed so as to combine environmentally and socially based targets. In other words, how should social processes be designed to make 'sustainability' into a regulatory principle for policy making. This paper proposes one conceivable way of organizing processes in which the social players can participate in the decision making process. It also supports the idea of designing input-output scenarios for economic sectors and subregions for supporting target setting on the local, subregional and watershed scales and to monitoring such processes. Finally, the paper suggests a system for applying the polluter-pay-principle in the Baltic Sea region. (C) 1998 Published by Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Despite growing manifestations of global warming and the commitment of most nations to move towards reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, a simple device that can be effective in reducing GHG emissions continues to be overlooked or even rejected. This is to acknowledge the fact that carbon emissions inflict global costs that are not borne by emitters. This paper advocates that all activities emitting or saving cat-ban emissions should internalize the carbon cost inflicted or avoided by new projects involving CO2. Considering the current wide range of carbon cost estimates, the paper recommends that a two-stage approach be adopted. Firstly, incorporate carbon costs in project analysis only theoretically in order to differentiate objectively among alternative designs involving carbon emissions of varying degrees. Different estimates of the costs of a ton of carbon would be used in order to test the sensitivity of rates of return to alternative carbon castings. While this process would have the effect of screening the allocation of scarce investment funds among projects that affect global warming in different degrees, it should be viewed as only a first step. Secondly, we advocate a rigorous process of passing through estimated carbon costs to the ultimate users of the services of carbon-emitting projects and processes. It is this ultimate process that will secure the urgently needed transition from the current dependence on fossil fuels to more benign sources of energy that would reduce climate-change risks. Since the time available is limited, the paper points out the urgency of these proposals that are crucial for sustainability. (C) 1998 Published by Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The relationship between agricultural ecological engineering and farming systems is discussed in this paper with a theoretical analysis and case study. The theory and approach of fanning system design is implied in agricultural ecological engineering. Thus, farming system as a theory and approach of agro-ecological engineering plays a very important role in the management of agricultural systems. Fanning systems are the bridge between agroecological engineering and agricultural systems. More comprehensive advanced research on fanning system theory and approaches employing ecological principles are needed to achieve more productive sustainable agricultural systems. New terms on eco-economic unit and eco-economic niche are explained in the paper. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Sustainable agriculture is commonly accepted in China and is practised by means of agro-ecological engineering. Large scale agricultural production, supported by advanced technology and the dissemination of eco-agricultural knowledge, will be more important in the future. With the development of integrated pest management, increasing evidence suggests that, large- and very-large-scale ecological engineering techniques must be developed and used. Also, computer-aided techniques such as geographical information systems and expert systems offer a more effective way to resolve new problems in pest management. As a pilot investigation using computer-aided technology for regional pest management in China, a vegetable production information and decision system, BJ-CABBAGIS, has been developed. Design of the system, supporting software and hardware for its development, and its function and preliminary application are presented in detail. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

DE aquatic macrophyte utilization; grass carp farming; shallow lake
AB Ecological engineering can be applied to macrophyte management in shallow lakes by converting aquatic macrophyte to fish through grass carp farming. It can not only produce large amounts of valuable fish, but can also protect the lake from silting-up by over-growing macrophytes, and, in some cases can inhibit lake eutrophication. Whole-lake grass carp grazing is the easiest pattern. It can effectively control macrophytes and give very limited fish productivity, but may destroy aquatic vegetation and promote eutrophication in the whole lake. Large-pen grass carp rotational grazing can use macrophyte resources sustainably, but gives relatively low fish productivity and has a high cost for building large pens. The small-pen high stocking density grass carp cultivation is a sustainable pattern with high fish productivity and economic benefits, but may cause remarkable water pollution in the area surrounding the pens. Pond fish farming in polders can give high fish productivity and economic efficiency in a sustainable way. It can also remove large amounts of bio-nutrients from the lake through macrophyte harvesting, thus inhibiting secondary pollution and eutrophication. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Wastes have been rightly referred to as resources out of place. Since household wastewater often intermixes with effluents from industries and agricultural runoff, multidimensional approaches have been made towards maximizing protein production through rational exploitation of available resources. Sewage-fed aquaculture is a unique system and has manifold advantages in developing tropical countries acting as a major source of nutrients for crop farming and aquaculture, economical for sustainable production and helps to combat environmental pollution. The use of municipal wastewater fed to fertilize ponds began in Calcutta in the 1930s; the city now has perhaps the largest wastewater-fed aquaculture system in the world. A large number of people derive their livelihood from the sewage-fed aquaculture using the principles of systems ecology and applying it through ecological engineering. The subject of sewage-fed aquaculture is reviewed in terms of source, chemical nature, diversity pattern, recycling practices, production potential of aquaculture, environmental issues and safety measures for ecofriendly sustainable environmental management strategies.

DE eco-construction; eco-village; sustainability
AB Eco-construction refers to the application of ecological principles to the development of human ecosystems in order to achieve sustainability. It consists of three components: ecological engineering, ecological institutional reestablishment and ecological cultural remolding. Since 1980, a vigorous campaign for demonstrating eco-construction has appeared in China and many ecopolis, eco-counties, eco-villages as well as eco-families have sprung up all over the country. Among such examples is a demonstrative project 'The Construction of Grand Shandu Eco-Village System (GSES)' in Jiande city of Zhejiang Province, which was launched in 1988. The construction of GSES includes the following crucial actions: (1) implementing ecological engineering in environmental protection and the comprehensive utilization of local resources; (2) planning and designing village development ecologically; (3) establishing social institutions to manage man-environment relations; (4) remaking local culture in its dimensions of behavior, i.e. psychology, intelligence and consiousness. The practice of GSES presents a successful case study for achieving village-level sustainability in China. (C) 1998 Published by Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Reestablishing a sound environment in rural areas has become one of the most important environmental issues in Japan, not only in rural policy but also in national land policy. Physically speaking, regeneration of natural ecosystems, reestablishment of sound material flows, and the design of rural landscapes are important areas of research and practice. Another important issue in the management of rural areas, particularly in the mountainous areas that cover similar to 61% of the country, is the preparation of the landscape for urban dwellers. This paper considers methods for improving rural environments. The modeling of ideal eco-villages with sound natural environment, low input and sustainable material flow, and maintenance of villages through urban and rural interaction is considered. Three different types of typical eco-village models are designed in urban fringe areas, in typical rural areas and in remote mountainous areas. Further, a case-study for the search of reality in adopting such models is surveyed in Chosei-gun, Chiba prefecture as a case of an eco-village in a typical rural areas.

AB Grounded in human ecological philosophy, ecological engineering in China seeks to find an alternative way to realize sustainable development at ecosystem level through total metabolism of resources, systematic coupling of technologies and cultivation of people's behavior. Here the key is integration of 'hardware', 'software' and 'mindware'. Eight design principles of ecological engineering based on eco-cybernetics are discussed, which fall into three categories: competition, symbiosis and self-reliance. The fundamental tasks of ecological engineering are to develop a sustainable ecosystem through the integrative planning of its structure, function and processes by encouraging totally functioning technology, systematically responsible institutions and ecologically vivid culture. A campaign of ecological engineering development in China is introduced, including 29 national comprehensive experimental communities for sustainable development, 51 pilot studies of eco-county development, and 100 ecological demonstration districts. Some fruitful theoretical and applied results have been gained and the case of Dafeng eco-county development is introduced. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Emergy flow in a compound agro-ecosystem in the Taihu Lake area of Jiangsu province, China, is studied with a set of numeric models. Model parameters are based on 11 years of records. Results show that total emergy production of two producing subsystems will decline although emergy input into the two subsystems and emergy production of the fish subsystem are growing. Emergy efficiency of the producing subsystems, both gross and net, will decrease, while emergy efficiency of the compound ecosystem will grow up first and then gradually decline. Net emergy production of the producing subsystems will gradually decline, but that of the compound ecosystem will firstly increase and then decrease. Net emergy allocation per human capita in the compound ecosystem will slowly inecrease, but it will decrease if the animal subsystem is removed from the ecosystem; this shows that the animal subsystem is a necessary part of the compound ecosystem. Relative to buffering capacity, emergy efficiency of the compound ecosystem, and recent living quality of local people, sustainable development of the ecosystem is discussed.

AB In this paper we describe an assessment of ecosystem health that is both comprehensive in that it is based on a series of common trends associated with the process of ecological succession, and operational in that the indices capable of quantifying these trends can be easily calculated given appropriate simulation model output or estimates of material exchange. We developed a simulation model which generated output characteristic of an ecosystem advancing through the various stages of succession to test the ability of a suite of systems-level information indices to quantify these trends. Our regression analyses suggest that these indices may be able to capture the trends associated with ecological succession, hence the reversal of many of these trends characteristic of ecosystem response to anthropogenic stress. We further argue that indice performance could be enhanced with the use of more dynamic modelling techniques. In addition, we introduce a methodology for the valuation of non-marketed ecosystem components which could be easily included with our assessment of ecosystem health. We conclude that this measure of ecosystem health in combination with the valuation technique may provide an informative compliment to many past and future regional modelling projects aimed at better understanding and managing the impacts of anthropogenic stress on our regional ecosystems.

AB The IEA was established after the 1973 oil shock as an independent international organization to safeguard energy supplies through collective actions between countries. One of the most important tools for doing this is the IEA technology program, which currently includes some 40 multilateral collaboration projects, called Implementing Agreements, covering most relevant technology aspects of energy supply and end Else.
   The present IEA World Energy Outlook forecasts a continued growth in world energy demand and a continued dependence on fossil fuels as the primary fuels. projected greenhouse gas emissions in 2010 are thus 35-50% above the 1990 level Increased use of renewables will be necessary to change this negative trend and to reach the long-term goal of a sustainable energy system. The development of many renewables is promising but R&D efforts and market experiments must continue in order to increase their shares of total energy supply.
   Geothermal energy(1) plays an increasingly significant role in many countries However, there is still huge untapped potential in both developed and developing countries. The new IEA Implementing Agreement on Geothermal Energy Research will be a vital new tool strengthening international cooperation in geothermal energy research and thus in the development of geothermal energy as a commercial environmentally sound energy source.

AB In this paper I examine the process through which different claims to 'development' and 'sustainability' were made during a recent public inquiry into an application for a coastal superquarry at Lingerbay, Isle of Harris. On the one hand, a modernist discourse of sustainable development was claimed by a corporation which attempted to frame the debate in terms of jobs versus environment, exploiting rhetorically a difference between islander and incomer. Sustainable development here became the front for an extension of corporate interest and private property. On the other hand, members of the local community drew on historically resilient symbols of collective identity, crofting, the Gaidhealtacht, and observance of the Sabbath, to claim an alternative discourse of sustainability.

AB This paper critically reviews the concept of sustainability, especially as it has come to be applied outside of environmental goals. It suggests "sustainability" should not be considered as a goal for a housing or urban programme - many bad programmes are sustainable - but as a constraint whose absence may limit the usefulness of a good programme. It also discusses how the promotion of "sustainability" may simply encourage the sustaining of the unjust status quo and how the attempt to suggest that everyone has common interests in "sustainable urban development" masks very real conflicts of interest.

AB This paper analyzes harvesting and timber bequest behavior in a two-period overlapping generations model where the government uses site productivity, yield and inheritance taxation. The ceteris paribus effects of forest and inheritance taxes are derived first, then the paper discusses the optimal design of forest and inheritance taxes by assuming that intergenerational externalities are either absent or operative. In the absence of intergenerational externalities, it is optimal to use only the site productivity tax, and not to introduce yield and inheritance taxes at all. In the presence of intergenerational externalities the situation changes. The paper demonstrates that the externality can be internalized by introducing either a yield tax or an inheritance subsidy, or both. If the government is able to use both at the same time, it is desirable to use the yield tax to 'punish' excessive harvesting and an inheritance subsidy to 'bribe' to give bequests.

DT Article
AB Many kindergarten (K) through twelfth grade fisheries education materials exist but have not been inventoried or reviewed to determine whether they meet the needs of fisheries professionals and educators. To identify instructional resources and guide curriculum developers, the Youth Education Committee of the American Fisheries Society Education Section (1) developed a fisheries education framework of 8 issues and 55 concepts, (2) identified and selected appropriate youth fisheries education materials, (3) reviewed the content of 51 materials based on the framework, (4) summarized results in a user-friendly guide, and (5) developed recommendations to fill gaps in information. Coverage of biodiversity (Issue 3) and some of the concerts associated with building sustainable fisheries (Issue 4) and promoting stewardship (Issue 6, 7) appear especially limited. Materials that target students in kindergarten to third grade and ninth- to twelfth-grade levels, that focus on global or marine fisheries, and that provide multicultural perspectives also are needed. Recommendations include revising or developing fisheries education materials based on our framework, using results from this assessment to avoid duplication, and developing partnerships to improve fisheries education materials for youth.

AB Yellowfin tuna may sustain an industrial fishery indefinitely if managed by conventional models, but northern cod perhaps cannot. This may be a generality for tropical and cold-water fish. In their core habitat, yellowfin spawn continuously, year-round and from an early age, while northern cod mature only at middle-age and spawn only during a brief season. The resulting natural age structure of each species is well-adapted to the characteristic recruitment variability imposed by its habitat. Industrial fisheries managed by stock assessment models seem unavoidably to modify the age structure of cod so that very few spawning year-classes remain, though this does not seem to happen in yellowfin managed in a similar way. It is axiomatic that the natural age structure is that best fitted to the long-term survival of any species, and this fact implies that cold-water species exploited by an industrial fishery may be unable to sustain a viable population across periods when environmental stress is strong and recruitment weak: population collapses of cod and other cold-water fish under industrial fishing pressure may therefore be unavoidable.

AB There are increasing calls to base farming and agricultural research policy on ecological principles. One such principle, the relation between crop species diversity and stability, is reviewed, Parallels are drawn between species-poor early successional vegetation and the management of annual crops by traditional farmers. Traditional management is based on the central of succession, and the exploitation of the competitive strategies characteristic of early-successional species. The existence of apparently stable pure stands in natural vegetation confirms the sound ecological strategy of simple and productive annual cropping. Farmers' ecological knowledge also encompasses the value of introduced crops and varieties. Changes are recommended in international agricultural research policy, with the need to redefine sustainability and to adopt ecological principles more relevant to annual crop production. Suggestions are made to apply specific traditional ecological knowledge of farming to agricultural research and policy. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Issues surrounding the management of solid waste have moved to the front of the public agenda in recent years, with levels of concern and activity! by, citizens and governments worldwide reaching unprecedented levels. New waste management techniques are being developed in response to this concern, but many are in their infancy and are not proving to be economic in the UK. This situation will need to be addressed and remedied if scarce landfill resources are to be preserved and if the focus of the waste industry is to shift towards mole environmentally friendly (or sustainable) waste management strategies
   This article describes some of the policies and strategies that have shaped waste management practices in the UK and by drawing on the opinions of professionals in the Public and private waste industry (collected in the summer of 1996), assesses the impact of these on the industry's future development and direction.

ID GREEN GEOGRAPHY
AB The concept of sustainable development has dominated the environmental agenda in the 1990s and has been embraced by governments at all levels, most notably since the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio. The term lends itself to many interpretations, making the implementation of strategies for sustainable development fraught with difficulties. We argue that the environmental, socio-economic and political contexts of national strategies will largely, determine the responses to Rio and illustrate this argument by exploring the key themes that have shaped the UK strategy for sustainable development We conclude that despite political rhetoric and some important advances in policy, the political style of the present Government and its approach to economic management ensure that moves to instigate commitment and a continuing political process towards sustainable development remain limited to particular policy initiatives. The publication of a revised strategy on sustainable development for the UK in late 1998 will be the benchmark for how far the Government's position has moved in favour of a holistic approach to sustainable development.

AB The structural framework of soil mediates all soil processes, at all relevant scales. The spatio-temporal heterogeneity prevalent in most soils underpins the majority of biological diversity in soil, providing refuge sites for prey against predator, flow paths for biota to move, or be moved, and localized pools of substrate for biota to multiply. Just as importantly, soil biota play a crucial role in mediating soil structure: bacteria and fungi aggregate and stabilize structure at small scales (mu m-cm) and earthworms and termites stabilize and create larger-scale structures (mm-m). The stability of this two-way interaction of structure and biota relations is crucial to the sustainability of the ecosystem.
   Soil is constantly reacting to changes in microclimates, and many of the soil-plant-microbe processes rely on the functioning of subtle chemical and physical gradients. The effect of global change on soil structure-biota interactions may be significant, through alterations in precipitation, temperature events, or land-use. Nonetheless, because of the complexity and the ubiquitous heterogeneity of these interactions, it is difficult to extrapolate from general qualitative predictions of the effects of perturbations to specific reactions. This paper reviews some of the main soil structure-biota interactions, particularly focusing on soil stability, and the role of biota mediating soil structures. The effect of alterations in climate and land-use on these interactions is investigated. Several case studies of the effect of land-use change are presented.

TI Blurring or shifting of policy frames?: Institutionalization of the
   economic-environmental policy linkage in the European Community
SO GOVERNANCE-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF POLICY ADMINISTRATION AND
   INSTITUTIONS
LA English
DT Article
ID PACKAGING WASTE
AB This article investigates how "policy frames" have shaped the way European Community actors perceive the policy linkage between market integration and environmental policy. The article contends that there are three Community policy frames: conditional, classic, and sustainability. They form alternative "packages" of policy ideas defining the relationship between economic and environmental policy. The article provides an analysis of how actors embed these frames in the Community's institutional framework. To illustrate the general impact of policy frames on the environmental arena, the article explores two cases: waste management policy, and the integration of environmental concerns into the Community's agricultural policy. The article concludes by highlighting the different factors that promote and undermine the formation of "thick" institutional structures likely to integrate environmental and economic policy objectives.

ID SCIENCE; LAKES
AB One objective of the International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme is to provide a scientific basis for sustainable development policies. Land use change and ecohydrology are important components of this scientific basis, but predicting change is difficult because of the scale and complexity of the interactions between non-linear ecohydrological and socio-economic processes at different spatial and temporal scales. A systems framework, the Ecosystem Approach, has been developed to conceptualize these interactions for the purpose of providing information for sustainable development policy. The Ecosystem Approach combines the dynamics of the Holling figure-eight model - a conceptual model of dynamics that stresses discontinuous change and destruction as an internal property of the system - and the properties of self-organizing systems with the socio political aspects of decision making.
   The Ecosystem Approach highlights the problems of managing change in complex systems when that change may involve unpredictable shifts to a different attractor. Although there are methods available to detect the occurrence of such shifts, both detection and modelling are complicated by the presence of semi-stable attractors. When a model or an ecosystem is on a semi-stable attractor, it may appear to remain stable for an extended period prior to changing as a consequence of inherent instabilities. When the shift to a new attractor occurs, it is quite sudden and unpredictable. A technical discussion on prediction under conditions of semistability and chaos is included because it enhances our understanding of the role of surprise in ecosystems, as well as the utility of simulation models.
   The principles of the Ecosystem Approach are derived from the theoretical discussion and an example of a land use policy in the Huron Natural Area in south-western Ontario. These principles provide a clear role for scientific research, and particularly simulation modelling, within the larger context of policy and land use management. (C) 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Large quantities of sediments leave the Himalaya through its rivers. These rivers are charged with sediments depending on the types of land use in the watersheds. Land use/cover change and hydrology was studied in a watershed in the Sikkim Himalaya. The land use change from forest and agroforestry to open agriculture has increased by 11% from 1988 to 1992. During the same period substantial areas of dense mixed forests have been converted to open mixed and degraded forests as a result of high pressure on natural resources. Stream flow was highest in the rainy season and lowest in summer season in all the streams and all the three years (1994-1997) of the study. The water quality of streams from different microwatersheds varied significantly between seasons and streams. Sediment and nutrient loss was estimated in microwatersheds and soil loss from the total watershed ranged from 4.18 to 8.82 t ha(-1) yr(-1) during the three-year period of study. The annual total nitrogen loss estimated at the watershed outlet was at a rate of 33 kg ha(-1), organic carbon 267 kg ha(-1) and total phosphorus 5 kg ha(-1). This study suggests that the upland microwatersheds can be hydroecologically sustainable only if good forest cover and dense forests with large cardamom-based agroforestry are maintained.

DT Article
AB Financial and economic deregulation in Indonesia since 1983 has encouraged the growth of microfinance institutions (MFIs). Combined with sustained economic growth, this has resulted in drastic reductions in poverty The article analyses the performance of Bank Shinta Daya, a private rural bank in Java, in terms of outreach to the poor and nonpoor, financial viability and sustainability, resource mobilisation, and sound (best) micro-finance practices. Bank Shinta Daya combines individual and group-lending technologies. The experience indicates that the latter cover their costs and greatly increase the bank's outreach to the poor as a new market segment, but initially add little to the bank's overall profitability. The case study shows how viability and sustainability can be attained in banking with the poor and the non-poor to conclude that only financially viable institutions can sustainably reach the poor in significant numbers.

TI Financial sector liberalisation - Should the poor applaud?
SO IDS BULLETIN-INSTITUTE OF DEVELOPMENT STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
AB Increasingly micro-finance is being encouraged to reformulate its primary focus from explicit antipoverty work to concentrate instead on financial sustainability. Much of this approach is predicated on neoclassical theory which calls for liberalisation of financial markets. It is asserted that, apart from prudential supervision, liberalised markets would create an enabling environment for better financial servicing of the poor; and ii is time that micro-finance programmes became financially self-sustaining, and therefore free of subsidies.
   Empirical testing of these views remains inconclusive, indicating the underlying fact that in many cases financial markets, even after liberalisation, have not behaved entirely as modelled. Though pro-poor interventions in financial markets often have been unsuccessful, they were motivated by valid concerns about the poor being under-served. The main contention of this article is that the current wisdom overestimates what liberalisation can achieve for greater market competition in serving the poor. This is because of its exaggerated faith in the role of interest rates in market clearance, and its inadequate account of informal financial service providers. Stronger, rather than reduced, focus on the poor and poorest, even if via subsidised micro-finance programmes, would help develop financial markets. As in other areas of economic reform, selfish motives of the market may require a helping hand to sustain poor-friendly innovations in service provision.

AB This article faces the problem of sustainable development from a double perspective; the sustainability of human activities marketing (Green Marketing) and the development of enterprise strategies that preserve its sustainability.
   Considering present macroeconomic ideas about growth and development the author reflects on their consequences on social cohesiveness and enterprise strategies. A parallelism is established between the globalization-diversity tension, present in modern societies, with succesful companies patterns. In both cases professionals roles are challenged and nt the same time their formation and permanent updating.

AB Although vertical transmission of HIV-1 can occur through breast-feeding, little is known about the effect of colostrum, duration of breast-feeding, mixing feeding, and nipple pathology. We used retrospective cohort data to examine the association between breast-feeding-related factors and transmission of HIV-1 from mother to child in Sao Paulo State, Brazil. Information on maternal and postnatal factors was collected by medical record review and interview. Infection status was determined for 434 children by anti-HIV-l tests performed beyond 18 months of age or diagnosis of AIDS at any age. Among 168 breast-fed children, the risk of transmission of HIV-1 was 21%, compared with 13% (p = .01) among 264 children artificially fed. Breastfeeding was independently and significantly associated with mother-to-child transmission of HIV-1 after controlling for stage of maternal HIV-1 disease (odds ratio [OR] = 2.2; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.3-3.8). A trend was shown toward an increased risk of transmission with longer duration of breast-feeding, a history of bleeding nipples, and introduction of other liquid food before weaning, but these associations were not statistically significant. History of colostrum intake or cracked nipples without bleeding were not associated with transmission. Most of the women who breast-fed were unaware of their HIV-1 infection status at the time of delivery. Avoidance of mixed feeding and withholding of breast-feeding in the presence of bleeding nipples should be considered in further research as strategies to reduce postnatal transmission of HIV-1 in settings in which safe and sustainable alternatives for breast-feeding are not yet available.

AB This paper revisits the tragedy of the commons and examines the conditions under which externalities contribute to livestock cycles. Using a stylised intertemporal model capturing the main characteristics of African livestock producers, we shout that externalities magnify livestock cycles triggered by occasional droughts. This is true even when producers are fully rational. Two forces fuel such cycles: producers' concerns with consumption smoothing; and expected capital gains when demand for livestock products is inelastic. Implications regarding African livestock production are discussed.

AB 1, The long-term effects of small-scale spatial heterogeneity of livestock grazing on vegetation dynamics were studied with a grid-based model of major life forms of savanna vegetation. Based on southern Kalahari ecology, the model includes stochastic life-history variables, resource competition for soil water, and biomass production for annuals, perennial grasses and shrubs.
   2, Grazed at individual severities, the model's 25 m(2) grid cells defined the spatial scale of heterogeneity. Different scenarios of grazing heterogeneity were generated by modifying distributional and behavioural features of the grazing model. Simulations were run over 50 years under moderate to high constant stocking rates.
   3, Results confirmed a previously reported threshold response of shrub cover increase: under moderate grazing pressure, little change in shrub cover occurred; when grazing pressure exceeded a threshold, shrub cover increased drastically.
   4. Under moderate or high stocking rates, grazing heterogeneity did not modify grazing effects. However, within an intermediate range of stocking rates, small-scale heterogeneity determined the long-term impact of grazing. In particular, utilization intensity at the threshold of shrub cover increase was 60% less under high compared to low local grazing heterogeneity.
   5, Sensitivity of vegetation dynamics to local grazing heterogeneity was also exemplified under a landscape-scale grazing gradient as observed at watering points: at a given utilization intensity, a wide zone of increased shrub cover occurred under large local grazing heterogeneity, while under the least heterogeneous grazing only a narrow zone of slightly increased shrub cover occurred.
   6. Because of the slow progress of shrub cover increase, a mismatch of management and ecological time scales was diagnosed and its implications for management are discussed.
   7. We conclude that knowledge of local grazing heterogeneity is crucial for correct assessment of livestock impact on vegetation dynamics, Consequently, management aiming at sustainable land use should account for spatial grazing aspects. These poorly understood aspects form a gap to be filled by both empirical and theoretical studies.

AB This paper reviews the experience of 174 of Canada's largest 1500 public and private sector corporations which have begun to incorporate sustainable development management and reporting as part of their operations. Answers are provided to three main questions: Why have they implemented this initiative! What progress has been made in terms of sustainability audit practice - frequency, focus, organization of the audit team -, internal communication, and external reporting! And where has, and will the leadership for the sustainability audit movement come from as why? Sustainable development auditing and reporting in Canada is voluntary. Practice varies from an elementary level to a sophisticated integrated assessment of social, environmental, labour, sourcing and trading, and governance issues. The depth of practice and experience in this area depends on several factors, including: corporate commitment, the degree of public perception of sector-wide environmental issues, exposure to legal liability, and the extent of dialogue and transparency associated with the auditing process. Differences of opinion about accounting and auditing standards as well as whether all, or parts of, audits should be independent are explored. The sources of data used for this paper include the EthicScan Corporate 1500 DataBase, The Corporate Ethics Monitor,(1) various reports prepared by EthicScan Canada, and the consultancies of both authors.

DE savings; growth; Chilean economy; social security reforms
AB In the last 10 years, Chile's overall economic performance has been remarkable in many respects, including a significant and sustained increase in domestic savings, to figures around 26% of GDP. This paper empirically assesses the reasons behind such notable behavior of savings by applying co-integration models to check for long-run relationships and error-correction models to verify short-run adjustments. The emphasis is on annual private savings (data span from 1960 to 1995) which, as it turns out, depend more than proportionally on an adjusted measure of GDP and less than proportionally on foreign savings and public savings. Private savings are also positively affected by economic growth and a dummy reflecting the effect of pension funds. Most of the adjustment between short run and long run is completed in less than 3 years, where the variable representing income bears the bulk of such adjustment. In comparing two episodes of good economic performance in the last 20 years (1976-1981 and 1986 till present), it is found that three basic differences arise concerning private savings: sustainability of growth, different access to foreign savings during the recovery from recession, and different scenarios with respect to the development of long-run capital markets. In particular, a relevant role played the move to a fully-funded social security system in the early 1980s. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This note offers a general proof of the converse of Hartwick's rule, namely that - in an economy with stationary instantaneous preferences and a stationary technology - an efficient constant utility path is characterized by the value of net investments being zero at each point in time. In a one consumption economy with two stocks - a stock of a natural resource and a stock of man-made capital - this means that if consumption remains constant at the maximum sustainable level, then the accumulation of man-made capital always exactly compensates in value for the depletion of-the natural resource.

TI Economic incentives for farmers in the Philippine uplands to adopt

ID MAIZE; GROWTH; MODEL
AB Land degradation in the Philippine uplands is severe and widespread. Most upland areas are steep, and intense rainfall on soils disturbed by intensive agriculture can produce high rates of soil loss. This has serious implications for the economic welfare of a growing upland population with few feasible livelihood alternatives. Hedgerow intercropping can greatly reduce soil loss from annual cropping systems and has been considered an appropriate technology for soil conservation research and extension in the Philippine uplands. However; adoption of hedgerow intercropping has been sporadic and transient, rarely continuing once external support has been withdrawn.
   The objective of this paper is to investigate the economic incentives for farmers in the Philippine uplands to adopt hedgerow intercropping relative to traditional open-field maize farming. Cost-benefit analysis is used to compare the economic viability of hedgerow intercropping, as it has been promoted to upland farmers, with the viability of traditional methods of open-field farming. The APSIM and SCUAF models were used to predict the effect of soil erosion on maize yields from open-field farming and hedgerow intercropping.
   The results indicate that there have been strong economic incentives for farmers with limited planning horizons to reject hedgerow intercropping because the benefits of sustained yields are not realized rapidly enough to compensate for high establishment costs. Alternative forms of hedgerow intercropping such as natural vegetation and grass strips reduce establishment and maintenance costs and are therefore more economically attractive to farmers than hedgerow intercropping with shrub legumes. The long-term economic viability of hedgerow intercropping depends on the economic setting and the potential for hedgerow intercropping to sustain maize production relative to traditional open-field farming.

ID MANAGEMENT
AB Ecosystem management is a still-developing concept. The version developed for federal lands in the interior Columbia River basin region includes unreasonable assumptions and outcomes, according to SAF foresters in the region. One of ICBEMP's goals, maintaining ecosystem health and integrity, defies clear definition and quantification, and yet this overrides the goal of achieving sustainable and predictable outputs. The management alternative recommended by ICBEMP portends negative socioeconomic impacts for many communities. A less divisive approach is closer federal cooperation with states in using existing processes and standards to protect aquatic habitats.

TI Crop rotation, residue durability, and nitrogen fertilizer effects on
   winter wheat production
SO JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION AGRICULTURE
LA English
DT Article
AB Alternative rotation crops and residue surface cover are needed for sustainable cropping systems. In two large-scale field trials near Genesee, ID,'Gisilba' condiment mustard (Sinapis alba L), 'Columbia' dry pea (Pisum sativum L.), and 'Crimson' lentil (Lens culinaris Medik.) spring crops were evaluated for their agronomic effect on subsequent 'Madsen' winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) during 1994-1995 and 1995-1996. After harvesting the spring crops, a chisel (applying 55 Ib N/acre, 30 Ib P/acre, and 20 Ib S/acre) and two passes with a field cultivator with a harrow attachment prepared the seedbed for planting with winter wheat. Crop residue level and retention was measured over winter as the wheat crop became established. In the spring of each second year, incremental levels of N fertilizer (from 0 to 200 Ib/acre) were applied to the winter wheat on a small plot section of each large plot using a split-plot arrangement. Residues from the three spring crops showed very little winter decomposition. Mustard residues maintained a surface cover above 50%, greater than the 30% for per and 25% for lentil. Winter wheat yields were 109 bu/acre following pea, 109 bu/acre following lentil, sind 102 bu/acre after mustard in 1994-1995, but no significant differences were found in 1995-1996. Winter wheat test weight was statistically higher following lentil, but no differences in grain protein content or seed weight were observed. There were no significant differences in residual soil inorganic N among the spring crops and N fertilizer response regression equations of the subsequent winter wheat were not significantly different among previous crops. This information shows mustard, pea, and lentil can be beneficial rotational crops prior to winter wheat. Mustard is superior in residue production and could be a valuable alternative crop to pea and lentil in sustainable cropping systems that optimize crop production while reducing problems of soil loss.

TI Engineers' role in sustainable development: Considering cultural
   dynamics
SO JOURNAL OF PROFESSIONAL ISSUES IN ENGINEERING EDUCATION AND PRACTICE
LA English
DT Article
AB In 1994, the American Association of Engineering Societies (AAES) issued a statement titled "The Role of the Engineer in Sustainable Development'' which proclaimed that sustainable development requires "dramatic changes in the culture of engineering.'' In this paper, the writers examine some ideas about sustainable development and consider the implications for the culture of engineering. Specifically, we argue that, because the future is uncertain, promoting a variety of approaches to sustainable development would seem to be a prudent means of spreading the risks associated with uncertainty. Engineers in the United States appear to favor approaches that emphasize developing more efficient and effective technology through free enterprise, as expressed in the AAES statement. We think this tendency reflects some of the values, assumptions, and culture of the engineering profession. We consider the limitations of this approach and present arguments in favor of simple technology and low consumption lifestyles. Engineers will likely be in a better position to lead and collaborate with others in fostering sustainable development if they understand and appreciate a variety of different perspectives and practices of people of different ethnic and disciplinary cultures. To promote this, we suggest that engineers develop an understanding of and appreciation for goals, strategies, and values that are complementary to the goals, values, and strategies that have been central to the profession.

AB This paper explores interpretations of globalisation, sustainability and labour processes in the context of New Zealand's apple industry. Theoretical critique centres on the notion of emergent food regimes and how it may inform the restructuring geographies of the world economy's 'fresh fruit and vegetable complex'. Empirical investigation is based on comparative localities research involving Hawkes Bay and Nelson - New Zealand's two largest apple producing regions. Analysis of the Integrated Fruit Programme (IFP) provides a focus for evaluating key conceptual questions in food regimes research. Intensive interviews with growers help contextualise theoretical debates and provide important insights into the nature of the third food regime 'from the orchard'. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB This paper describes the design, implementation and use of an effective web-based software visualization environment for use within a computer science curriculum. Initial design issues focused on providing an environment tightly integrated with other learning resources and carefully considered the needs of the target population. The first example system built in the Internet Software Visualization Laboratory is currently being used on a Master's level programming course, though the generic architecture is able to present a range of visualizations for a number of languages. Our work has led us to devise 11 design principles for effective web-based software visualization which cover teaching requirements, sustainability, ease of use and remoteness.

SO JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT
LA English

DE habitat characterization; Ictinia mississippiensis; Mississippi kites;
   Mississippi River floodplains; Missouri; nesting sites; reproductive

AB The Mississippi kite (Ictinia mississippiensis) is considered rare in Missouri and occupies a habitat in the state that is being fragmented and converted into unsuitable habitat. To enhance our understanding of its habitat requirements and population status, we examined the characteristics of Mississippi kite nesting habitat and reproductive success at 33 nest and random sites in 1990 and 26 sites in 1991 in the floodplain forests along the Mississippi River in southeastern Missouri. Forest tracts containing Mississippi kite nests (n = 7) were larger ((x) over bar = 683 ha) than randomly sampled forest tracts ((x) over bar = 7 ha, n = 7). Trees containing nests were taller than trees at random, and nests were positioned within the tree so that nests were above the surrounding forest canopy. Overstory and midstory tree diameter at breast height (dbh) were greater at nest sites than at random sites. Overstory tree density was less at nest sites than at random sites. Eastern cottonwood (Populus deltoides), American sycamore )Platanus occidentalis), and shagbark hickory (Carya ovata) were the most common trees at nest sites, whereas black willow (Salix nigra), green ash (Fraxinus pennsylvanica), and silver maple (Acer saccharium) were more frequent at random sites. The modified Mayfield nest-success estimate for 10 successful and 14 failed nests was 22%. We conclude that Mississippi kites select patches of atypically tall trees surrounding an even taller nest tree for nesting sites within the Mississippi River floodplain forests in southeastern Missouri. Preserving the larger forest tracts in the region, particularly those currently used as nest sites, and assuring the sustainability of the tallest growing trees like cottonwoods would have long lasting, positive effects on Mississippi kite habitat in this region of its range.

AB This paper examines the interest in the development and promotion of mixed farming in sub-Saharan Africa. For over 70 years mixed farming has been a dominant model for agricultural development despite the limited success of many of the programmes which have specifically promoted it. It is suggested that the establishment of mixed farming as a strong development theme is related to its promise to address a range of environmental and social concerns, and in so doing, help create order out of a 'chaotic' African countryside, Mixed farming is again being highlighted with the more recent interest in sustainable, environmentally friendly agricultural systems. However, there is considerable evidence that African farmers have adopted a flexible principles-based approach to the use of component technologies commonly associated with the mixed farming model. This must be fully acknowledged, and the seduction of unitary models avoided, if agricultural research is to contribute efficiently to the development of more sustainable farming systems.

AB Sustainable development is an issue which has exercised the public mind for some years, even if few have a clear understanding of it. At one level, it is one of those fuzzy ideas that everyone is in favour of, because it means all things to all people. At another, it has a more concise connotation: it is about taking better care of the environment while ensuring economic growth. It is where ecology meets economics. But at its deepest level, it can be argued that sustainable development is not a motherhood issue at all, it is a subversive issue.

AB There is no practical tradition of ridge tillage in Hungary, but attention has been drawn to this method by the fact that the literature clearly defines it as a soil-protective system for use in sustainable crop production. Another point of interest is the possibility of applying the method on slopes. Ridge tillage can be regarded as 7a special version of the seedbeds perpendicular to the slope, used for wide-rowed crops on sloping sites requiring protection. Experiments were set up in Godollo in 1995 in order to determine whether the method could be adapted for small fields on brown forest soil under conditions where soil protection is a prerequirement for crop protection according to EU regulations.
   The effect of traditional and ridge tillage systems on soil status, yield and weed cover was studied in a comparative experiment. The traditional system involved autumn ploughing and two phases of seedbed preparation. The ridges were formed on a ploughed area perpendicularly to a 3 % slope, with a width of 440 mm and an interrow distance of 460 mm. The height of the ridges during the vegetation period was 200-220 mm. The ridges were treated as described in the literature using simple machinery adapted for the purpose. Maize was grown in the experiments without rotation.
   The most important conclusion reached in the first three years was that the soil status required by maize could be achieved by either traditional or ridge tillage, but that this status could be maintained throughout the vegetation period in the ridges.
   In the case of ridge tillage three soil environments evolve: the ridge itself, which is free of stubble residues, and the interrows containing stubble residues, which may be compacted or non-compacted. In the third year of the experiment the soil penetration resistance of the ridges and non-compacted interrows was less than or equal to 1.0 MPa in the 0-20 cm layer and 1.0-2.0 MPa in the 20-40 cm layer. Even that of the compacted interrows was less than the critical 3.0 MPa value. The trends in soil moisture content over the whole year were similar in the two tillage systems, but in spring a considerable difference was observed. The soil was more moist in the interrows covered with stubble residues, drier at the top of the ridge, due to its favourable heat cycle, and on the sides, and driest in the traditionally tilled treatment. This latter proved to be unsuitable for the retention of rainwater, so little water seeped into the soil.
   The yields achieved with ridge tillage were 10 % higher over a three-year average than in the traditional tillage treatment. However, this difference was nor significant in any of the years. It should be noted that the soil-protective effect of the method is of greater importance at the given growing site than an increase in yield. The effect of erosion on the area used for ridge tillage was 85 % less than on traditionally tilled areas.
   Neither of the tillage systems proved to be disadvantageous as regards weed cover. Annual dicotyledonous late summer weeds occurred in the greatest numbers on the experimental areas, but the weed cover was only significant in the first year, being 33 % in the traditional system and 37 % in the ridge tillage system. Integrated weed control fits in well with the ridge tillage system, consisting of correctly-timed interrow cultivation and a single treatment with post-emergent herbicide.
   The experiments will be continued in the areas indicated. It can be concluded from the first three years of results that the ridge tillage system can be well adapted to sloping growing sites in Hungary provided the technology is strictly adhered to. It will be of importance in widening the range of soil-protective cultivation systems available.

AB When making a choice between alternatives, in whatever field, it is essential to have regard for the complete set of costs and benefits, in the widest possible sense, that will result in each case. The preferred option should be that which confers the maximum benefit, although relevant objectives will often conflict and its identification may be far from straightforward. Life cycle assessment (LCA) is an environmental accounting tool for measuring the inputs and outputs of an option, whether a product, a process or an activity. This paper Explains the principles and methodologies involved in LCA, its application to the nuclear sector, and to electricity generating options and sustainable development.

The field sites included an unfertilized, semi-arid rangeland with low N(2)O fluxes in eastern Colorado, USA; two fertilizer treatments (urea and nitrate) on a fertilized grass ley cut for silage in Scotland; and two fertilized, cultivated crop fields in Germany where N(2)O loss during the winter was quite high. The models used were daily trace gas versions of the CENTURY model, DNDC, ExpertN, and the NASA-Ames version of the CASA model. These models included similar components (soil physics, decomposition, plant growth, and nitrogen transformations), but in some cases used very different algorithms for these processes. All models generated similar results for the general cycling of nitrogen through the agro-ecosystems, but simulated nitrogen trace gas fluxes were quite different. In most cases the simulated N(2)O fluxes were within a factor of about 2 of the observed annual fluxes, but even when models produced similar N(2)O fluxes they often produced very different estimates of gaseous N loss as nitric oxide (NO), dinitrogen (N(2)), and ammonia (NH(3)). Accurate simulation of soil moisture appears to be a key requirement for reliable simulation of N(2)O emissions. All models simulated the general pattern of low background fluxes with high fluxes following fertilization at the Scottish sites, but they could not (or were not designed to) accurately capture the observed effects of different fertilizer types on N(2)O flux. None of the models were able to reliably generate large pulses of N(2)O during brief winter thaws that were observed at the two German sites. All models except DNDC simulated very low N(2)O fluxes for the dry site in Colorado. The US Trace Cas Network (TRAGNET) has provided a mechanism for this model and site intercomparison. Additional intercomparisons are needed with these and other models and additional data sets; these should include both tropical agro-ecosystems and new agricultural management techniques designed for sustainability.

AB During the past four decades the authors perceive that an increasing non-sustainability (Disintegration) within the agriculture, human nutrition, waste management complex has occurred both in Germany and the European Union. Compared to the basic needs of the population for nutritive energy, fat and protein, we estimate that the production and consumption of food and feed is more than 50% higher than necessary. Using nitrogen (N) input into German agriculture in 1991/92 as an example, we estimated that the N input of 191 kg ha(-1) was 2 to 3 times too high. This high N input resulted in the net biomass production of 45 kg ha(-1), a 25% efficiency. This inefficiency causes emissions of reactive N and other nutrient compounds into the hydrosphere and atmosphere that were 2 to 8 times too high. For example the contributions of agriculture to the total annual N2O-N emissions of Germany (during 1990-1992), Europe (1990) and of the world (1989) were 110, 691 Gg and 6.7 Tg or 52, 62 and 41%, respectively. The authors demonstrate that emissions of N and P from Germany and EU waste water management systems are also higher than necessary because nutrient recycling is not practiced extensively. Excessive food production and consumption has made the agriculture/human nutrition/waste and waste water complex, like the energy/transportation complex, a main cause of new transboundary environmental damage such as soil and water acidification, hypertrophication of near-natural terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems and climate change.
   We propose that a sustainable food production/consumption system can be developed that is based both on need-oriented production and consumption with no net exports and on recovery, recycling and more efficient use of nutrients. Using N as an example, the authors show which short and long term action aims must be set and realized by the year 2015, to meet environmental, economical and social sustainability requisites. The suggested, assumed sustainable N balance for German agriculture is characterized by a critical annual input and surplus maximum of 80 and 45 kg N ha(-1) respectively, which should almost double biomass production efficiency for N utilization. This estimate is based on reducing animal stocking rates to 0.5 gross weight unit ha(-1) to attain no net mineralization or immobilization of N in the soil.

AB Four species of the avian family Cracidae were studied in the Pacaya-Samiria National Reserve in north-eastern Peru. These large-bodied birds are an important source of protein for local communities on the periphery of the reserve. An estimated 425 kg of Cracidae biomass were harvested over a I-year period by three communities. Pipile cumanensis was the most frequently hunted bird, both in terms of individuals hunted and biomass extracted. Mitu tuberosa and Penelope jaquacu also made up a substantial amount of the biomass extracted, but were hunted less frequently. Densities of all species of Cracidae within 5 km of the villages were substantially lower than in the interior of the reserve. Our results suggest that M. tuberosa and P. cumanensis are overharvested and P. jaquacu and Ortalis guttata are harvested within the maximum estimated sustainable levels. In this study hunting grounds were along waterways and adjacent to protected populations, which created a source-sink arrangement. If sink areas are overhunted, the unhunted populations inland of the waterways could be acting as source populations that replenish overhunted areas.

AB Traditional location literature concludes that firms will optimally differentiate in order to alleviate a tendency toward competitive pricing. However, it has recently been shown that firms will minimally differentiate if they (correctly) anticipate an absence of price competition. This paper examines the relationship between product location and the sustainability of cooperative pricing, in horizontally and vertically differentiated markets. Further, it describes equilibrium locations when firms are able to choose their locations jointly and when they must choose independently.

AB Packaging steel has been recycled at a 47 % rate in France (in 1997), due to the organization of recycling schemes that start at the municipal waste treatment plants and at drums and cans recycler works. The scrap is used in EAF as well as in BOF shops, where it complies with the same level of quality as conventional obsolete scrap. It is shown here that, under the French conditions, tinplate recycling is sustainable.

AB The mistletoe Erianthemum dregei (Eckl. & Zeyh.) V. Tieghem produces a woodrose type haustoriurn on host trees. In some rural areas of southern Africa woodroses are harvested for their unique ornateness and prepared for sale as curies. Concern for the sustainability of mistletoe populations led to this study. Sclerocarya birrea (A. Rich.) Hochst hosts were artificially inoculated with hand-excised mistletoe seeds and post-harvest recovery of mistletoes on 12 S. birrea trees were investigated a year after disinfection. E. dregei exhibited 25% germination after 5 days but no seedlings survived a month in the field. Seventy-eight living E. dregei removed in 1994 were replaced one year later by 68 'new' plants probably through resprouting from internal, longitudinal cortical strands which allow for rapid vegetative recovery after removal. Poor seedling establishment and the occurrence of new recruits on branches between 0.0002 to 0.025 m(2) cross-sectional area could indicate resprouting rather than recruitment from seed. The growth rates of 22 E. dregei woodroses growing on S. birrea were assessed over a 12 month period during 1994/5. These woodroses varied in size from seedlings to individuals with a diameter of 25 cm. Absolute growth rate increased linearly with woodrose size, with most growth occurring during the first 6 months (August-February) relative to the second (February-August). Relative growth rates declined (negative In function) from very high rates for very small woodroses to fairly similar slow rates of growth for all other sizes. Woodroses of diameter 10 cm and 25 cm are typical size classes sold as curies. Using the growth data, it is estimated that woodroses of these sizes are 40 +/- 25 (S.D.) and 56 +/- 35 years old respectively. These slow rates of growth must be taken into consideration when determining sustainable harvesting limits.

TI Predation by West Coast rock lobsters (Jasus lalandii) on two species of

DT Article
ID SEA-URCHINS; PREY INTERACTION; SPINY LOBSTERS; SELECTION; CONSUMPTION;

AB Rock lobsters, Jasus lalandii, may play an important role in structuring the communities on shallow reef ecosystems and have recently increased in density in the area between Cape Hangklip and Danger Point on the southwest coast of South Africa. This has probably resulted in increased predation on natural populations of smooth turban shells (Turbo cidaris) and pink-lipped topshells (Oxystele sinensis), both of which are proposed targets for small-scale commercial fisheries. This study examines the size selectivity, prey species preferences and consumption rates of rock lobsters feeding on these two winkle species. Rock lobsters showed a strong preference for small O. sinensis, and were limited to taking a maximum (or critical) size of prey, which increased linearly with rock-lobster size. By contrast, rock lobsters of all size classes tested were able to crack and consume a full size range of T. cidaris, and no size preferences were evident. When the two gastropods were offered simultaneously, rock lobsters preferentially consumed the thinner shelled O. sinensis. Consumption rates increased linearly with rock-lobster size. Population consumption rates indicate that rock lobsters will have a profound effect on winkle stocks in the area, even if winkles constituted less than 1% of the diet. This in turn suggests that commercial exploitation of these stocks is unlikely to remain sustainable.

TI Alternative energy strategies for the United Kingdom revisited - Market

SO TECHNOLOGICAL FORECASTING AND SOCIAL CHANGE
LA English
DT Article; Proceedings Paper
CT International Congress on Challenges of Sustainable Development
CY AUG 22-25, 1996
CL AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS
AB Energy and electricity demand forecasts for Britain made in the late 1970s by a research team from the International Institute for Environment and Development (IIED), under the leadership of Gerald Leach, are assessed with the benefit of hindsight. These researchers broke the energy market clown into some 400 end-use, fuel, and appliance categories. They then assessed the potential for energy saving in physical terms, using available technical fixes, for each category. The resulting "bottom-up" projecitons of energy consumption departed from the historic correlation with economic growth, or "top-down" approach. It enabled the IIED team to postulate an alternative, low energy strategy for the United Kingdom to 2025. This study subsequently had a great influence on energy planning elsewhere in the industrialized world, although it was not without its detractors.
   The IIED energy demand projections are reviewed in the context of both the greatly increased market competition in the UK from 1979 onward, and the need to achieve sustainable development. It is shown that, although total primary energy consumption in the mid-1990s was much in line with the forecasts in the Leach report, the reasons for this and the structure of the newly competitive energy market are quite different from that originally postulated. However, the critics of the IIED team did little better. Long-term energy projections (25-50 years) as one-off, static exercises appear to be of little value for energy planning purposes. They can, as in the case of the Leach report, be a great source of data and ideas, as well as stimulating debate about new strategies. It is argued that rolling projections using a rather broad, sectoral approach that is continuously updated at not greater than five-year intervals, in a similar manner to econometric forecasts, are more useful for energy planning purposes.

AB In the limited number of analyses undertaken on tourism development and post-socialist processes of restructuring in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE), most attention has been paid to the more advanced societies of Central Europe. By contrast, Europe's less developed and relatively unstable south-eastern corner, where tourism development issues may take on a different complexion, has been relatively neglected. Within this context, tourism's role in post-socialist restructuring in Central and Eastern Europe is examined, reflecting on issues of mass tourism and niche segregation. Rural tourism is examined as a vehicle for sustainable development in South-eastern Europe, and some of the paradoxes facing issues of sustainability in tourism development are examined in relation to recent development processes. With a dynamic mix of mass and niche markets to target, the potential of rural tourism development in South-eastern Europe continues to be constrained by regional instability.

TI How to treat one's mother - Considerations about the relationship
   between man and environment in the Andes
SO TROPENLANDWIRT
LA German
DT Article
DE mother earth; erosion; traditional farmers' conception; Andes
AB Throughout nearly 10,000 years, Andean peoples created an agricultural civilization that was able to respond adequately to most constraints that an extremely difficult natural environment imposed on them. Despite the destruction of original political (macro)systems by colonization, a good deal of their tradition and knowledge has survived until our days. Rituals related to "mother earth" still play an important role. For this reason several European and Andean authors consider that indigenous Andean farmers live in harmony with nature, and especially with agricultural soil. On the other hand, ecosystem destruction, with soil erosion as a major problem, is obvious all over the Andes. The author argues that indigenous peoples, since they depend in a very direct form on nature's productivity, can not conceive nature as a value per se. Only a productive landscape is "beautiful" from their point of view. Ecologically well adapted traditional agricultural techniques have developed through a long process of trial and error. If they were the result of an attitude of respect towards nature, peasants would be able, or at least trying to find ecologically sound responses to changing conditions, as e.g. population growth. This, obviously, is not the case. It is suggested that "mother earth" does not refer to soil, but to a female deity that gives fertility to soil. To achieve its good will, rituals are required, but not terraces, manuring or crop rotations. To promote sustainable agricultural practices, ecological or historical arguments seem to be very week. Only direct economic benefit from this kind of practice will be convincing for farmers.

TI Sustainability of farming terraces
SO TROPENLANDWIRT
LA German
DT Article
AB Building and maintaining terraces has generally been believed to be the most advanced technique to promote the stability of sloping agricultural land. Bench terraces especially are considered to be able to reduce erosion, increase infiltration, and make the land more easily manageable during normal agricultural operations. This is why constructing terrace systems has become a popular soil conservation measure during this century within any soil and water conservation programme, especially in projects funded by foreign aid. But in many instances it could be observed that the terrace technology is rarely adopted by the land users after project funds dry up.
   This paper briefly describes the functions and components of terrace systems as well as the conditions and limitations of their construction. Based on these facts this paper trys to show and emphasise that the conditions which lead to the farming of terraces in a sustainable way should not be considered as being static. It is a fact that terrace systems are man made technical systems. They are the product of their natural, social, political and economical environment. Changes of these environmental conditions may therefore result into changes in sustainability of the terrace system as part of a production system. Furthermore reference is made to the importance of human institutions as a key factor to sustainability of terrace systems.

AB In the intensive cropping systems of Nepal, concern for sustainable soil productivity has emerged as an urgent issue. Farmer participatory on-farm research was carried out for two years (1993 and 1994) at two intensive cropping sites in the Western Hills of Nepal to investigate whether relay-planted green manures of Dhaincha (Sesbania aculeata) and rice bean (Vigna umbellata) can replace inorganic fertilizers in the lowland rice (Oryza sativa L.) intensive cropping system, and whether the relay-planted green manures affected the grain yield of the companion maize (Zea mays L.) crop. The two green manures were compared with the inorganic fertilizers applied at 60 kg N:30 kg P2O5:30 kg K2O ha(-1), and compost applied at 10 t ha(-1) as a local practice (control). The results of the two locations over two years showed that both green manures resulted in grain yields of rice equivalent to those obtained where inorganic fertilizers were applied and did not reduce the yield of the companion maize crop. Straw yield of the rice was significantly higher with the chemical fertilizer compared to the other three manure treatments. Rice bean was superior to Dhaincha in low soil moisture conditions. The practice of relay planting of green manures appears to be an alternative technology for sustaining rice yields in the intensive cropping systems and in low external input subsistence farming.

AB The drug supply system in the North-west Province of Cameroun differs from 'simple' health financing projects in three important respects. Firstly, the system does not promote drug sales for cofinancing purposes but aims at supporting the prescribers to provide better medical care, and patients access to the most essential drugs at fair prices. Secondly the project guarantees equal prices and services throughout the Province regardless of distance from the central warehouse and sales at a given location. Thirdly, along with the revolving fund-financed drug supply system, a community-based legal framework has been established. Built-in management alert mechanisms helped the project resist common causes of collapse such as uneconomic behaviour and political interference. The drug supply system has gained full independence from subsidies and external authorities. its strong community participation promotes good governance.

AB In order to balance the impact of agricultural development on land around coastal lagoons with the protection of aquatic resources, knowledge of the role of the sedimentary phase in the entrapment or availability of nutrients in the water column in areas affected by agroindustrial outlets is important. The Ensenada del Pabellon coastal on the Pacific coast of Mexico was chosen to be analyzed. The input of ammonium and orthophosphate from sediment using semicontrolled benthic chambers near a sugar cane factory outlet was compared to non altered sediment. Phosphate and ammonia loading from agroindustrial outlets has been the primary cause of eutrophication. The inputs of ammonium and orthophosphates from the sediment to the water column depend on their concentration in the agroindustrial outlet's waste water, the local morphology, the tide, and biotic assimilation, in order of importance. Sediment in non-altered revealed maxima of 7.8 mg m(-2) d(-1) of NH4+ and 1.4 mg m(-2) d(-1) of PO4-3, whereas in one outlet that greatly transfigures the environment, maxima of 223 mg m(-2) d(-1) of NH4+ and 67 mg m(-2) d(-1) of PO4-3 were recorded, which represent an increase greater than 20 times the normal diffusion; These figures varied markedly in space and time. Results from the study indicated that existing levels of nutrient could endanger the future of this ecosystem, including its sustainable fisheries.

AB The accumulation of organic matter (OM) was investigated after two and five years in a series of four gravel-bed constructed wetlands supplied with different hydraulic loading rates (21, 26, 46 and 72 mm d(-1)) of farm dairy wastewaters. At these hydraulic loadings, mean wastewater loadings of particulate OM (determined as volatile suspended solids) to the wetlands ranged between similar to 1.7 and 5.8 g m(.)(-2)d(.)(-1) Vertical and horizontal gradients of OM accumulation, measured by "loss on ignition", were sampled by stratified coring at 18 sites in each wetland, and their impact on wastewater residence times investigated in three of the wetlands using bromide as a conservative tracer. Mean accumulations of OM in the wetlands after five years operation ranged between 6.8 and 14.9 kg m(-2), increasing with wastewater loading rate. The annual rates of accumulation during the first two years were 1.2 to 2-fold higher than those in the subsequent three years. Around 50-60% of the OM occurred within the gravel substratum, the remainder forming surface sludges, commonly exceeding 50 mm depth over much of the wetland substratum. OM accumulation in the wetlands considerably exceeded that contributed from applied wastewaters, with wetland plant derived detritus supplying substantial additional quantities of OM. The effective void space of the wetland substrata was markedly reduced in the highest loaded wetland, with mean wastewater retention time reduced to similar to 50% of its theoretical value (corrected for evapotranspiration losses). In contrast, the lowest-loaded wetland exhibited retention times close to theoretical values. There was, however, no direct relationship between OM accumulation and the effective retention times of the wetlands, suggesting other factors, such as differences in OM bulk density, spatial patterns of accumulation and plant root growth, and inorganic accumulations, were also influencing their hydrology.

DE tribology; efficiency; durability
AB In the United Kingdom, the Technology Foresight Programme [HMSO, Progress Through Partnership 1 (1995) 126 pp.], through its Transport Panel, revealed the requirement for key generic technologies and scientific research in relation to automobiles. One of the 'three major development opportunities which will help accommodate increased demand in a sustainable way' was identified as 'vehicles with greater efficiency and reduced environmental impact'. In addition, further studies in 'fuel efficiency' and 'simulation and modelling' were recommended. The total scope of tribological considerations with regard to the above prospective research themes is immense and the present paper will focus upon the major frictional components of the automobile engine, that is, the bearings, the valve train and the piston assembly. In particular, the current position surrounding the modelling of these components will be reviewed and future possibilities identified. Prediction of overall engine friction will be addressed and the specific issues of modelling of lubricant behaviour and the role of surface topography touched upon. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science S.A.

ID CREDIT; DESIGN
AB Six microcredit organizations of 19th-century Europe are compared to identify what institutional designs were conducive to success and sustainability. Organizations that depended on charitable funding were more fragile and tended to lose their focus more quickly than those that obtained funds from depositors. An ability to adjust interest rates also appears important in sustainability. Examining historical microcredit is particularly useful since it offers an opportunity to explore the characteristics of organizations which were sustained over many decades, a perspective which is rare in modern microcredit banks and programs, most of which are less than 15 years old.

AB Numerous renewable resources have been exploited beyond limits for sustainable and economic development. At times over-exploitation has been observed even in cases where management regimes have been in place. Thus, it seems pertinent to search for explanations beyond the theory of the commons. An experiment is performed where subjects set reindeer quotas in a district where lichen has been severely depleted by preceding overgrazing. All subjects err on the side of overexploitation. Behavior seems to be dominated by inappropriate, static mental models and inefficient heuristics. Hence, a subtle information problem is revealed. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

DE Bqua; industrial and household water production; pretreatment;

AB Water Supply Company Oost-Brabant intends to supply, in addition to drinking water, a second water quality called 'Bqua' for use in households and for industrial purposes in a newly built urban and industrial area near the City of Eindhoven. The project is initiated by the need for the use of surface water for the production of drinking water, since in the area the maximum amount of groundwater that is allowed to be withdrawn, is limited. In addition, it is a hot topic in The Netherlands whether the use of household and industrial water contributes to a sustainable development of urban areas. When locally available surface water from the Beatrix Canal is used and treated with ultrafiltration, a capacity of 1 Mm(3)/y is needed to make supply of Bqua economically feasible. In order to reach this capacity minimum, the project is combined with the production of industrial water in the same area. One basic quality is produced and distributed that serves both purposes. The production costs of Bqua will be about $0.25 per m(3). Pilot plant research was focused on the direct treatment of canal water with ultrafiltration. Three different UF membranes where compared on membrane performance: and permeate quality. It turns out that ultrafiltration of canal water is technically feasible and results in an excellent permeate quality, although the fluxes obtained are relatively low (net flux of 50 1/m(2)h) in comparison with the treatment of backwash water of rapid sand filters (about 100 1/m(2)h). Differences between UF membranes are small. A pretreatment consisting of preoxidation with potassium permanganate is suggested to reduce the manganese content. In addition it will be studied if regrowth during distribution must be prevented by reduction of the AOC-content. The concept will be elaborated further in a demonstration project in which the treatment of canal water will be optimised and in which it will be evaluated in which cases supply of Bqua is attractive both from an economical as from an environmental point of view.

TI Sustainable production: The ultimate result of a continuous improvement
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION ECONOMICS
LA English
DT Article
DE sustainability; production; improvement
AB To fulfil market requirements, companies have introduced cost awareness, quality programs and techniques to become flexible. These items should be handled as a continuous process of improvement. The cost awareness implies that e.g. material waste is avoided during production, the quality programs take care that non-qualified products are avoided, while flexibility results in avoiding waste of time. It is argued that a continuous improvement of efficiency, quality and flexibility will bring a company closer to a state of sustainable internal production. However, as a sustainable production can be defined as an industrial production resulting in products that meet the needs and wishes of the present society without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their needs and wishes, all phases during the lifetime of a product have to be considered. From a company's view this means that product design, internal production and product, parts and material recovery have to be considered in relation to the usage of materials and the quality of products, processes and systems. As is shown, then concurrent engineering techniques are related to shop-floor improvement techniques regarding efficiency, quality and flexibility. It is concluded that companies using sustainable production techniques will have an advantage over their competitors because of reduced costs, improved quality and better organisation of the shop-floor, while a market share increase may be expected as a result of the costumer's sympathy for 'green' products.

AB The water desalination problem in Tunisia is reviewed. A detailed historical background is given and current as well as previous efforts in the domain of desalination research and development are presented. This paper covers a number of ambitious initiatives, which tackled the water shortage problem in Tunisia through the adoption of original programs and solutions adapted to the local environment. Such programs put forth effort to take advantage and harness the abundant and readily available renewable energy sources toward the production of fresh water. Presented are also the prospects of water desalination in Tunisia, which is currently pursued as a major component of an overall strategy to meet future water demand and enhance the quality of drinking water in various parts of the country. Current and projected water demand and water availability figures are given along with potential renewable energy sources. Strategic studies along with facts and statistics on the regional development show that brackish and seawater desalination is becoming a must for the growth and the sustainability of the socio-economic progress in the Mediterranean region.

AB An appreciation of the natural processes in forests is essential in order to propose rules for both conservation of wildlife and sustainable management. This paper proposes the use of the word 'naturalness' or 'authenticity' (i.e. the vegetation owns its features strictly to natural factors and not to the action of people) rather than biodiversity, in the senses published in Peterken (1996) and Bucking (1997).
   The study analyses a concrete case in an intensively managed landscape of low altitude (300 m), in the Vosges, eastern France. Regeneration, structure and natural cycles are described from small unmanaged stands of the region. In spite of human impact on the reserves, significant results were obtained for an assessment of the level of naturalness in the present landscape, for a model of succession of the pre-settlement forests of the region, for an estimation of the minimum area in future strict reserves, and for proposals for more sustainable management, which would ensure enhancement of stability and conservation of authentic biodiversity in the managed ecosystem.
   These results are compared with observations made in Romania, in a pure old-growth Beech forest of the natural reserve of Nera, Banat mountains. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Questions have been raised about the ecological consequences and economic sustainability of exclusive reliance on chemical fertilizers for the rapidly expanding maize production across sub-Saharan Africa. Alternative agroforestry-based natural resource management technologies have been developed for farmers. This paper applies the policy analysis matrix (PAM) to analyze the social profitability of agroforestry-based technologies for maize production in the highland savanna zone of Cameroon, and the impacts of policy shifts on the financial competitiveness of maize production under these technologies. The paper shows that maize production under agroforestry-based systems has high comparative advantage. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Pasture taxes and agricultural intensification in southern Mali
SO AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS

DT Article
DE technical change; sustainability; crop-livestock interactions
AB This study integrates biophysical simulation data with a farm household model of intertemporal optimization, to investigate changing crop-livestock management practices in the Sudano-Guinean zone of Mall. Over a 15-yr time horizon we find that free grazing on the commons remains more attractive to the representative household than adopting more labor- and capital-intensive confinement systems, but that a relatively low level of pasture tax (around US$3 per livestock unit per year) would be sufficient to induce intensification. Because confinement raises output, the net cost of the tax to the household is only about US$1 per unit per year. Imposing pasture taxes to induce intensification could raise community welfare, if the value of commons resources liberated by reduced grazing pressure exceeds that level.

AB To identify appropriate interventions that support sustainable land use, a farm household modelling approach is applied to analyze micro-economic supply reactions to various policy measures. The modelling framework links agro-technical and economic data, and takes both production and consumption decisions into account, allowing land use and production technology adjustments in accordance with farm household objectives. Different types of farm households are distinguished on the basis of their resource endowments, savings coefficients and time discount rate. Actual and alternative (sustainable) cropping and livestock activities for different weather regimes are defined for southern Mali. The effects on sustainable land use and expected farm household welfare of adopting alternative technologies and modifying prices, transaction costs, access to credit and land taxes are demonstrated. Even with full information on sustainable technologies, strong policy interventions are required to halt soil degradation. Structural policies proved to be more effective than price policies to reduce soil degradation while maintaining positive income effects. When prices are determined endogenously, structural policy loses some effectiveness as an incentive for sustainable land use due to the effect of additional supply on local cereal and meat prices.

   theory

   economic growth; natural resource sustainability
ID ECONOMIC-GROWTH; FACTOR DEMAND; TECHNOLOGY; MODEL
AB Using a simple neoclassical type growth model including both man-made and natural capital as inputs to production, the theoretical basis for a U-shaped relationship between agricultural intensification and farm household investment in renewable resource capital is established. As development of technology, infrastructure, or markets increase the relative return to investment in man-made capital over natural capital, resource depletion occurs as man-made capital is substituted for lower return natural capital. Once return are equalized, both man-made and natural capital are accumulated. If labor and these forms of capital are complementary, the output effects outweigh the substitution effects in the long run, leading to net accumulation of natural as well as man-made capital as a result of such technological or market development. Population growth also induces investment in both man-made and natural resource capital in the long run by increasing their marginal products. However, population growth causes declining per capita levels of both natural and man-made capital and production per capita in the long run, if technology is fixed and decreasing returns to scale. The model thus supports the Boserupian argument of induced intensification and resource improvement, as well as the Malthusian argument of the impoverishing effects of population growth. However, population growth may also induce development of infrastructure, markets, and technological or institutional innovation by reducing the fixed costs per capita of these changes, though these developments may not occur automatically. Government policies can play a large role in affecting whether these potential benefits of population growth are realized. In addition, credit policies may reduce resource degradation caused by substitution of man-made for natural capital, by allowing farmers to accumulate man-made capital (such as fertilizers) without depleting their natural capital. Policies to internalize the external environmental costs of using man-made capital will reduce both types of capital and production, indicating a clear trade-off between addressing environmental concerns on the one hand and reducing poverty and promoting resource conservation investments on the other. By contrast, internalizing the external benefits of investments in resources increases wealth and production per capita in the long run. The 'intertemporal externality' due to a higher private than social rate of time preference does not justify interventions to promote investments in resource capital; rather it argues for the promotion of savings and investment in general.

AB Forests continue to fall for agricultural purposes throughout the humid tropics, with immediate and potentially large consequences for climate change and biodiversity loss-issues of key interest to the international community. Some of the actors directly responsible for forest conversion fell trees to meet food security needs and alleviate poverty-issues of urgent interest to them and also to national policymakers. This multiplicity of groups with differing (often conflicting) interests in the multifarious goods and services produced by tropical forests complicates the search for alternative agricultural activities for forest margins since these alternatives must satisfy such divergent objectives. This paper sets out a conceptual framework for comparing the impacts of different land use systems and agricultural practices at the margins of tropical rainforests in terms of the concerns and objectives of two key interest groups: small-scale farmers seeking livelihoods at the forest margins and the 'international' interests in the global public goods and services supplied by tropical rainforests. This framework should be useful to a third key group, the national and regional policymakers who must consider these and other policy objectives and then decide on courses of action. The paper identifies data needs and analytical methods capable of supplying an empirical base for this conceptual framework, based on quantifiable indicators. It then presents preliminary results of the application of this conceptual framework in Indonesia and Brazil in association with a global, collaborative, multidisciplinary research program. Even using preliminary order-of-magnitude estimates (to be replaced by more precise measurements as they become available), this conceptual framework presents results in ways that allow researchers and policymakers to select clear 'best bets' for development, when they exist, and to assess tradeoffs and options for complementary policy action and research efforts, when they do not.

TI An analysis of commercial vegetable farms in relation to sustainability
   in the uplands of Southeast Asia
SO AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article
ID SOIL
AB Commercial vegetable production systems in the uplands of Southeast Asia are important to supplement the demand for fresh vegetables in lowland Asian cities. A farm survey and soil sampling was done to characterise and identify major factors limiting vegetable productivity in the uplands of the Manupali watershed, Mindanao, the Philippines. Large yield differences were found among the four most common crops: tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum), cabbage (Brassica oleracea var, capitata), potato (Solanum tuberosum), and Chinese cabbage (Brassica pekinensis). The most closely correlated factors with crop yields were: nitrogen application rates for tomato and cabbage; topsoil per cent sand and fungicide usage for potato; and reliance on family labor for Chinese cabbage. Following multivariate data analysis, two vegetable farming systems were identified: the higher external nutrient (HEN) and the lower external nutrient (LEN) systems. To enhance their sustainability, both systems should adopt more appropriate soil conservation practices, cropping sequences, and plant protection techniques. Additionally, the LEN farmers should increase nutrient application, while the HEN farmers would benefit from labor saving technologies, crop diversification, and more judicious fertiliser application.

TI Cost of providing sexually transmitted disease services in Bangkok
SO AIDS
LA English

DE health-care economics; Asia; sexual transmission
ID IMPACT
AB Objective: The main purpose of this study was to assess the economic costs of sexually transmitted disease (STD) treatment and to identify opportunities for sustaining Bangkok's STD clinics.
   Design: A cost analysis was used to assess the resources required to provide (i) STD services, (ii) additional services at STD clinics during the evening, and (iii) outreach activities with commercial sex workers. The cost analysis included a review of opportunities to increase sustainability through cost recovery and institutional restructuring.
   Results: The study revealed that the cost of providing services does differ significantly across the five clinics analysed, with recurrent costs of day-clinic STD care varying from US$13-37 per patient reached. An analysis of expanded evening hours at STD clinics suggested that an investment of US$62 000 per year allowed an additional 2000 patients to receive STD treatment and that evening hours appear to offer greater convenience to patients. It was also found that outreach activities initiated by the STD clinics and carried out in brothels have been used inexpensively (US$0.20 per woman reached) to reach commercial sex workers with critical information on STDs, including HIV. An analysis of opportunities for cost recovery at public STD clinics indicated that although some resources can be recovered, government support will continue to be required. The cost recovery option believed to be most feasible for promoting sustainability was a proposed charge of US$2-4 for STD clinic attenders. This charge was projected to allow each clinic to recover between 11% and 22% of their recurrent costs.
   Conclusion: This study concluded that there are numerous opportunities for promoting the financial sustainability of STD services at public clinics. It was also concluded that the existing outreach program is extremely inexpensive and is reaching people who are in need of the services that are being offered. However, this study was not able to determine if it would be worthwhile to reopen public STD clinics during evening hours. (C) 1998 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

AB Objective: To present a theoretical and practical means for the evaluation of organizational and institutional development (capacity building) in HIV/AIDS prevention programmes in developing countries.
   Methods: Multiple frameworks, methodologies and paradigms for the evaluation of organizational and institutional development were reviewed and synthesized, resulting in this proposed pluralistic model for the measurement of capacity building efforts. Traditional forms of capacity building evaluation (self-assessment, case study outcome, and impact evaluation) are presented and a framework for their integration at the level of interpretation and inference is provided. The review is based on experiences in measuring capacity building in more than 20 countries and 200 projects, ranging from communications and behavior change initiatives to condom social marketing to sexually transmitted disease/HIV clinical interventions with a range of international and local non-governmental organizations and ministries of health.
   Results: From this experience, we have found that conducting a mixed method evaluation of capacity building efforts allows for a more insightful assessment of capacity building and a more comprehensive evaluation of HIV prevention programmes.
   Conclusions: The capacity building conceptual framework developed (linking strategies, variables and outcomes) provides an instructive paradigm for the evaluation of HIV prevention interventions worldwide. (C) 1998 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

AB An integrated GIS was developed as the core of a research project which provided the foundation for regional economic planning in a semiarid area in northern China. The GIS was composed of a regional geographical database and a collection of spatial models. The regional geographical database contained data sets from terrestrial-based sources including thematic maps and statistical records, and remotely sensed data. A series of spatial models has been developed by experts in various disciplines such as soil erosion, economics, rural development and arid-land management. These models were then implemented into the GIS and a series of thematic maps were produced. The results provided useful assistance for regional planning that aimed to balance demands from different land-use interest groups with the aim of achieving an optimum, environmentally sound economic development plan.

AB This article presents the change of habitats for red-crowned crane (Grus japonensis) due to anthropologic activities in Yancheng Coastal Zone Biosphere Reserve, Jiangsu Province, China. As a result of large-scale human exploitation in tidal lands, the habitats of red-crowned crane were significantly influenced and the original wetlands were gradually altered to form artificial wetlands. In the process of rapid economic development in China, an important question that the Reserve and local governments are faced with, is how to lead development activities in a direction that will take into account the contradiction between habitat protection and sustainable economic growth.

TI The MAB Mushroom Study: Background and concerns
SO AMBIO
LA English
DT Article
ID FOREST
AB Pacific Northwest planners and economic developers have worked hard the past decade creating new jobs to offset steadily declining incomes from timber harvesting and processing industries. Among these new jobs are increasing harvests of nontimber or special forest products such as floral greenery, medicinal plants, and edible mushrooms. But some land managers, biologists, and conservation groups believe that increased harvest of nontimber forest products is not sustainable and threatens long-term resource productivity. The US Man and the Biosphere (MAB) Program funded a USD 51 000 competitive research project from 1993 to 1996 to determine the impacts of nontimber harvests on human and natural systems in the Pacific Northwest of North America. Integrated and interdisciplinary approaches were used to accomplish three :study objectives: i) determine spatial and temporal productivity of chanterelle (Cantharellus sp.) mushrooms on the Olympic Peninsula for two harvest seasons; ii) build socioeconomic profiles of commercial, recreational, and subsistence harvesters; and, iii) link biological and socioeconomic information in order to conserve, maintain, or enhance chanterelle resource stocks on public and private lands. Reasons for starting the research study are outlined and include the major resource concerns identified by regional scientists, land managers, and conservation groups in the 1990s. How to address these concerns provided the framework in which to conduct the biological, socioeconomic, and managerial modules of the MAB Mushroom Study. The five accompanying articles in this Ambio Special Report explain fieldwork, analyses, and synthesis activities completed in each module.

TI The MAB Mushroom Study as a teaching case example of interdisciplinary
   and sustainable forestry research
SO AMBIO
LA English
DT Article
AB The MAB Mushroom Study was designed to promote sustainable natural and human communities and to involve multiple stakeholders having widely varying styles and knowledge of forest management. It used an interdisciplinary and collaborative research approach that united biologists, social scientists, land managers, and nonprofit volunteers from academic, federal and state government, and commercial sectors. Because of the cooperative and interdisciplinary nature of the project, study developers were awarded another competitive grant to summarize their work as one of four academic teaching case examples for Oregon State University's Sustainable Forestry Partnership. This second grant produced three products. First, a Narrative, which includes the theoretical basis and definitions of sustainability, how the MAB Mushroom Study operated within a sustainability framework, how stakeholders were chosen and worked in the study, and five key elements of sustainability research. Second, a Teaching Notes packet, which explains how students, resource managers, scientists, and others can use the case study to develop their own interdisciplinary and sustainabilty studies. Third, a set of 64 slides with captions illustrates examples of nontimber product resources in the Pacific Northwest. The case study example can be taught either as a formal university course or a 1-day continuing education workshop.

AB This article summarizes an approach for improving the indoor air quality (IAQ) in a building by providing feedback on the performance of the ventilation system. The delivery of adequate quantities of ventilation to all building occupants is necessary for the achievement of good IAQ. Feedback on the performance includes information on the adequacy of ventilation provided, the effectiveness of the distribution of this air, the adequacy of the duration of operation of the ventilation system, and the identification of leakage into the return plenum, either of outdoor or supply air. Keeping track of ventilation system performance is important not only in terms of maintaining good IAQ, but also making sure that this system continues to perform as intended after changes in building use. Information on the performance of the ventilation system is achieved by means of an automated sampling system that draws air from multiple locations and delivers it to both a carbon dioxide monitor and dew point sensor. The use of single shared sensors facilitates calibration checks as well as helps to guarantee data integrity. This approach to monitoring a building's ventilation system offers the possibility of achieving sustainable performance of this important aspect of good IAQ.

DE livestock production systems; rangelands; pastoral development
AB Management interventions in arid zone livestock production systems have generally failed to provide long term improvement in sustainability. The reasons fur this are discussed. The differences between livestock production systems and rangeland development are also discussed and the management implications elaborated. The importance of a participatory approach to improvement of livestock-based systems in the arid zone is emphasized. This paper reviews the recent history of pastoral production systems and considers the prospects for successful management interventions in the light of the constraints under which they operate and the effect of the shift, in almost all of the world's pastoral regions; to a cash or market economy. By drawing on the mistakes of the past and putting technology in the context of people's real needs, our thinking is on track to produce some really effective solutions.

AB This review scans through the attributes of feed resources prevalent in the arid and semi-arid zones (ASAZ). The merits of the various biological and chemical attributes of feeds are discussed with a view to suggest those that could yield suitable and reliable indices for selecting potential feedstuffs among forage legumes. The review contends that besides protein content. the rate of degradation and bulk density are two other legume factors that determine the extent of substitution of the basal roughage diet which will vary in direct proportion with roughage quality. The appropriate combinations of roughage and supplements have been advocated for sustainable livestock production in the ASAZ Whilst most legumes contain more protein than is required to balance the fermentable energy in them and thus are suitable as supplements, their ability to supply both rumen degradable protein and escape protein is varied. The review argues that the slow uptake of supplementation strategies among others is due to unsurmountable logistics which can be eased by creating feed or protein banks. In relation to Issues on feed availability the authors suggest that the use of feed resource on a regional scale could be maximized by (1) integrating weather information and satellite images to forecast feed distribution patterns and (2) encouraging the establishment of communal silage pits. Pertinent researchable issues were highlighted.

AB Nowhere in nature are species so densely packed as in soil communities. A large number of animal phyla and a diverse microflora are represented and these comprise a considerable part of any country's biodiversity. There are three main reasons for protecting soil biodiversity, (i) Ecological reasons: Decomposition and soil formation are key processes in nature and represent 'ecological services' for the rest of the ecosystem. Soil organisms also represent the base for several above-ground food chains and the majority of terrestrial insects are soil dwellers for at least some stage in their Life cycle, (ii) Utilitarian reasons: Soil biodiversity form the basis of agriculture, some medicines, and research in ecology and other disciplines and (iii) Ethical reasons: All life forms can be said to have an inherent value. Many groups of soil organisms are very old in evolutionary terms. Soil biodiversity must be included in the national strategies for long-term preservation of biodiversity to be developed following the Rio-Convention on Biodiversity. This implies both pure conservation measures and sustainable use of soils. Conservation measures must include identification and protection of sites with unique, endemic or threatened soil communities. Other targets could be rare soil types or intact soil profiles. Soil biodiversity is generally high in forests which may represent 'hot spots' in agricultural landscapes. Measures for sustainable use must aim at keeping the biodiversity of agricultural and forest soils as high as possible. Chemicals and other treatments, which reduce soil biodiversity, should preferably be avoided. Conservation of soil biodiversity is a new and challenging held, for soil biologists, conservation biology, and local, national and international authorities. There is a great need for strengthening both basic and applied soil biology, including taxonomy and soil biologists should start the process by publicising the role, great complexity and threats to soil communities.

TI Establishing a reserve network for waterfowl in Denmark: a biological
   evaluation of needs and consequences
SO BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION

ID DISTURBANCE
AB Denmark is of major international importance for a number of waterfowl populations during migration and in winter. As part of the revision of the Danish Hunting and Wildlife Management Act, 1992, it was decided to establish a network of reserves by creation and extension of reserves in 46 EU Special Protection Areas for birds (SPAs). This paper summarises an overall, biologically-based strategy for a reserve network in Denmark, as a basis for sustainable development of wetlands for migratory and wintering waterfowl. As well as securing the future for vulnerable populations, the reserve network should improve conditions for waterfowl staging and wintering in Denmark. The groups potentially most exposed to disturbance from hunting and other leisure activities, i.e. in greatest need of a reserve network, are the geese and the dabbling and small diving ducks. Swans, seaducks, sawbills and coots have less need for such a network. On this basis, deficiencies in the existing system of reserves are identified. Human recreational activities are considered compatible with sustainable development if the use by waterfowl of important wetlands is primarily limited by available food resources. Within each of the principal waterfowl migration routes and wintering areas identified, there should be a network of reserves which provides adequate opportunities for the birds to feed and rest. The proposed network will amount to a total shooting-free refuge area of ca. 650 km(2), representing almost a doubling of the refuge area in Denmark. The shooting-free area will be supplemented by ca. 870 km(2) with regulation of recreational activities or certain hunting methods. The extension is expected to result in a considerable increase in the numbers of dabbling ducks and geese, with the potential of holding back substantial parts of some populations at a more northerly position on their flyways than before. The area available for hunting in SPAs will be reduced but hunting opportunities in adjacent areas could be expected to improve because the numbers of birds there will also increase.

AB Self-stimulation (SS) rewarding experience induced structural changes in CA3 hippocampal and layer V motor cortical pyramidal neurons in adult male Wister rats has been demonstrated. In the present study, whether these structural changes are transient or of a permanent nature was evaluated. Self-stimulation experience was provided for 1 h daily over a period of 10 days through bilaterally implanted bipolar electrodes in the lateral hypothalamus and the substantia nigra-ventral tegmental area. Following 10 days of SS experience, the rats were sacrificed after an interval of 30 and 60 days for the quantitative analysis of the dendritic morphology in Golgi stained CA3 hippocampal and layer V motor cortical pyramidal neurons. The results revealed a significant increase in the dendritic branching points and intersections in apical and basal dendrites in both types of neurons in 30 days post-SS group compared to sham control. The total number of apical and basal dendrites were significantly increased in both 30 and 60 days post-SS groups of rats. This study suggests that SS experience induced structural changes are sustainable, even in the absence of rewarding experience. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Inc.

AB Life history characteristics of 54 Ontario lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) populations Vary with differences in lake area (range 25-450 000 ha) and total dissolved solids (TDS) (range 15-180 mg . L-1). Populations from large lakes exhibit greater maximum sizes, greater ages and sizes at first maturity, lower natural mortality rates, and lower sustainable yields. Populations from high-TDS lakes exhibit higher growth rates in early life, lower ages at first maturity, larger sizes at first maturity, and higher natural mortality rates. Angler catchability increases significantly at low population densities. With these relationships included in an age-structured population model, we found that the fishing mortality rate at maximum equilibrium yield ranges from 0.12 . year(-1) for a 100-ha, low-TDS lake to 0.37 . year(-1) for a 10 000-ha, high-TDS lake; the fishing effort level at maximum equilibrium yield ranges from 6.6 angler-h . ha(-1) year(-1) for a 100-ha, low-TDS lake to 4.0 angler-h . ha(-1). year(-1) for a 10 000-ha, high-TDS lake. Populations from small, low-TDS lakes are more sensitive to overexploitation than populations from large, high-TDS lakes. Easily measured, environmental correlates of life history characters may be common among fish species and are useful in developing exploitation guidelines for populations that are not well studied.

DE sustainable development
AB A five-year study of four resource extraction projects indicates that:
   articulating a clear, honest, transparent and defensible vision of the values that lie at the heart of resource extraction projects is crucial to building public confidence in resource extraction industries.
   commitment to principles of sustainable development has an important role to play in reducing conflict and building public confidence and trust in companies proposing or engaged in resource extraction activities.
   These two observations provide a key to discerning the way ahead for the mining industry They also pose significant challenges. Mining is widely seen as an unsustainable industry. Historically, the industry has nourished this perception by defining its environmental social and economic responsibilities narrowly. These observations, however, are not insurmountable obstacles. Mining is not, in principle, incompatible with environmental social and economic sustainability. Defending this view is the central task of this paper.

ID GPS
AB The mine of the year 2020 will need to be based on a new way of mining, it will employ technology in a paradigm that assumes responsibility for sustainable development: taking account not only economic bur also ecological and social issues. This will require a holistic approach to mine design and planning, considering all controlling factors and impacts (technical, economic, environmental and social). A national collaborative strategy is required to address the several options that exist for the development and application of 2020 mining technology. Key issues in implementing 2020 mining technology will also relate to human resources, in terms of employment, skills and education. A need exists to proactively prepare for 2020 through development of a comprehensive education and training strategy.

SO CROP PROTECTION

DE insect pest control; integrated pest management; no early insecticide

ID RICE
AB Over the decades, rice farmers have become dependent on chemicals to control insect pests. Farmers perceive that all insects are harmful and that insecticide is very effective in controlling them, aside from being very convenient to use. Empirical evidence shows that farmers' perceptions about insects and consequently their control practices can be changed through experiential methods. Experience can be achieved either through learning-by-doing a simple on-farm experiment, or through learning-by-using the knowledge gained from a season-long integrated pest management training course, which is a knowledge-intensive technology. Both approaches seemingly indicate to effect minimal damage on the environment and farmers' health. The IPM approach, however, is inferred to pave the way for more sustainable rice production, a better environment and healthier lives for the farmers and their families, and the consumers.

AB A physiologically based population dynamics model of a renewable resource is used as the basis to develop a model of human harvesting. The model incorporates developing technology and the effects of market forces on the sustainability of common property resources. The bases of the model are analogies between the economics of resource harvesting and allocation by firms and adapted organisms in nature. Specifically, the paper makes the following points: (I) it shows how economic and ecological theories may be unified; (2) it punctuates the importance of time frame in the two systems (evolutionary versus market); (3) it shows, contrary to prevailing economic wisdom, how technological progress may be detrimental to resource preservation; (4) it shows how the anticipated effects of high discount rates on resource use can be catastrophic when synergized by progress in harvesting technology; (5) it suggests that increases in efficiency of utilization of the harvest encourages higher levels of resource exploitation; and (6) it shows the effects of environmental degradation on consumer and resource dynamics. The model leads to global implications on the relationship between economic growth and the ability of modern societies to maintain the environment at a sustainable level.

ID POLICY
AB Defining of a 'socio-environmental system' is a critical and inevitable step on the path towards achieving sustainable development for specific parts of the world. In this paper we discuss some important, and problematic, aspects of such a definition. We propose a definition of socio-environmental systems that is based on the hierarchical organisation of human activities, is structural as well as functional, and focuses on the constraints and conditions of development. It has at least the following four parts: (i) Identification of the socio-environmental system, by which is meant the first, tentative designation of the system; (ii) Assessment of the people involved. Ideally, all these people should be represented in the decision-making. At the very least, their interests should be kept in mind by responsible decision-makers; (iii) Delimitation of the system in space and time. The spatial extent of the system, the time-horizon of the developments, the grain of the information, and the context of the system should be clearly defined; and (iv) Descriptions of the system. This should include a description of the subsystems, the values, and constraints of the system, and the relations between the subsystems, values, and constraints. Defining the system is aimed at clarifying the debate on the development of a socio-environmental system, but it will also facilitate the collection of information and the building of computer models.

AB This paper analyzes and tests the hypothesis that political and economic equality result in lower levels of environmental degradation. Based on formal statements of the argument put forward by Boyce, R., 1994, Ecological Economics, ii, 169-178, I show that equality may or may not be necessary to minimize degradation. Under some plausible conditions, greater inequality may even be conducive to lower degradation. Actual results depend primarily on the intersection between the distribution of preferences across groups and the institutional rules. Two cross-national empirical tests tend to support the contention that distributional issues do not systematically explain variations in environmental quality. The results reinforce the conclusion that assumptions about the structure of preferences and workings of social choice institutions ignore complex interactions which influence the relationship between degradation and equality.

ID ENVIRONMENTAL VALUATION; SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
AB The main argument of this paper is that weak comparability of values should be seen as one characteristic feature of ecological economics. The formal properties of the concepts of strong comparability (implying strong or weak commensurability) and weak comparability (implying incommensurability) will be clarified. Multicriteria evaluation offers the methodological and mathematical tools to operationalize the concept of incommensurability at both macro and micro levels of analysis. The concept of incommensurability of values already has a long tradition in economics; moreover, we will show that analytic philosophy, theories of complexity, post-normal science and the recent theories of rationality lead with different trajectories to a non-algorithmic approach which, in our view, could be implemented by some forms of multicriteria evaluation.

TI An approach to sustainable water management in Southern Africa using
   natural resource accounts: the experience in Namibia
SO ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS

   Southern Africa
AB Namibia is highly dependent on its natural resource base-mining, agriculture, fishing, and wildlife-based tourism. Natural resource accounts (NRA) have been constructed to improve resource management. As the driest sub-Saharan African country, subject to frequent droughts and with no perennial rivers within its borders, Namibia's rapidly increasing demand for water is being met in some instances by mining fossil groundwater and appropriation of surface water that may pose a threat to fragile ecosystems. This paper uses the NRA to examine water policy as an example of the kind of analytical perspective that NRA can provide to policy makers. It describes the use of water in the Namibian economy and compares user fees, costs of delivery, and the economic contribution of water in different sectors of the economy as a first step towards estimating the opportunity cost of water. An analysis of two of the largest and most heavily subsidized users of water-commercial crop irrigation and rural subsistence production-has important implications for agricultural policy and rural development strategy in Namibia. Sound water management requires better understanding of the opportunity cost of water and greater coordination of sectoral strategies, especially agriculture, energy, mining and trade. There is also a need for similar coordinated work to be carried out in other countries in Southern Africa, since water is a shared resource which transcends national boundaries in this region.

AB The beech Fagus crenata forest on Mt. Jippo in southwestern Japan has been reduced to small fragments by past human activity. The forest floor is covered by dense dwarf-bamboo, Sasa, which is an inhibitor of beech regeneration. One of the ecological features of Sasa is that it withers synchronously over a large area once every several decades. An individual based model (IBM) was developed to evaluate the sustainability of such a fragmented beech stand considering the dynamics of Sasa. The model has three submodels for beech individuals: growth, mortality and seed production. The parameters of these submodels are estimated from field measurements. By using this model together with Sasa dynamics, we can evaluate the adverse effect of Sasa on enhancing the risk of extinction of a single fragmented beech stand over 500 years. The results obtained by Monte Carlo simulations are: (1) Sasa has a strong impact on the sustainability of a isolated beech stand; (2) the effects of two parameters for Sasa life history, the longevity and the recovery time, can be statistically separated from each other; and (3) the probability of extinction of a beech stand depends much more strongly on the parameters of beech mortality than those of growth rate.

AB Various kinds of no-take areas (refuges, reserves) are gaining attention as conservation tools. The efficacy of reserves can be considered from the perspectives of providing baseline data sets, protecting the stock, maximizing yield to the fishery, or some combination of these. Regardless of the measure of effectiveness of a reserve, practical application requires the development of techniques for settling operational and policy questions such as how large a reserve should be. A simple model, involving population growth and harvest, is used to explore how the fraction of habitat assigned to a reserve affects the sustainability of a take and to frame the trade-off between control of harvest outside of the reserve and the size of the reserve. This exploration also leads to the discovery of a robust conservation invariant for reserves.

AB This paper employs cointegration and multicointegration analysis to explore the issue of external solvency in the small open economy of Australia. Results indicate that in the fixed exchange-rate era exports and imports are multicointegrated while in the more recent floating exchange-rate period the series do not share a conventional long-run equilibrium relationship. The results are consistent with intertemporal external solvency in the early period and insolvency more recently. Sustainability criteria are reviewed. Indications are that low saving and investment rates may inhibit Australia's ability to sustain persistent external imbalances, however, recent fiscal adjustments may work to abate this problem.

AB Technical-economic and geographical opportunities for energy efficiency and renewable energy in Russia are enormous - cost-effective investments are possible in district heating systems, buildings, and industry, and for wind, biomass, solar and geothermal energy. Market-level energy prices, privatization, and the possibility of independent power production all favor investments in these technologies and technology transfer with other countries. But many transaction barriers limit such investments and transfers, especially barriers that are related to capital, information, infrastructure, market institutions, human resource capabilities, and institutional incentives. Market intermediation and joint ventures are important in overcoming these transaction barriers. International policies, for example by bilateral and multilateral agencies, should facilitate market intermediation. Capacity building should target skills in economic analysis, management, and finance; information services; regulatory development; new market intermediation institutions; stronger legal and market institutions; and implementation mechanisms supporting independent power producers. Policies that encourage and support energy service companies are especially important. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Sustainability and public choice: a theoretical essay on urban
   performance indicators
SO ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING B-PLANNING & DESIGN
LA English
DT Article
AB Liveable, endurable, and governable cities are sustained by a delicate balance of laws and policies that protect the interests of individuals, households, and firms at the same time as meeting the collective consumption needs of existing and future citizens. A general equilibrium model is developed in order to articulate some of the important theoretical features of this problem of urban management. Central to the model is the idea that sustainable policies and actions have themselves to be sustainable and that this is possible only if they reflect the preferences of citizens. Starting from a household utility-maximisation problem the model yields an equilibrium urban public goods matrix, designated the urban management matrix Gamma*, which may be viewed as a socially efficient urban management objective function. It contains quantities of environmental goods, social infrastructure, and regulative services that are socially optimal in the sense that any deviation from them will make some citizens worse off. These are used to derive a set of urban system performance indicators that represent a realistic specification of a sustainable city from the current perspective of citizens. The degree of environmental sustainability implicit in the indicators depends on the preferences of existing citizens for prudent collective action. The indicators represent the optimal prescription of sustainable-city policies for present application. If pro-sustainability education and propaganda are successful in changing preferences over time, then a comparative static use of the model charts a socially and politically sustainable path towards longer term environmental sustainability. The essay is a theoretical one intended to explore the nature of collective and individual consumption trade-offs in a sustainable city.

AB Post-Fordist urban growth is characterised by ever-increasing dispersal and polycentricity. The transformation of urban spatial structure has profound implications for sustainable development. There is now a substantial literature both on confirming the existence of polycentricity through equilibrium and evolutionary theories and on empirical identification of subcentres. However, more research is needed to explore the generically polycentric urban growth. A microscopic simulation approach is thus applied to study how stable subcentres, measured in terms of population density, can be established. In this study, an experiment carried out in an artificial cellular city is reported. One innovative feature of this simulation is that the state of the cellular automaton comprises a quantity variable (population density) as well as a binary state variable (selected or not selected). The two are interlinked through the evolution of the city. The experiment suggests that the combined forces of accumulative population density and local interactions can lead to the formation of stable subcentres. In such a regime, subcentres are first established through stochastic 'errors', for example, clusters of local developments. Thereafter the clusters continue to capture development opportunities through reinforced local interactions. With the evolution, however, disutilities, such as congestion, are accumulated from the concentration of local development. The growth of disutilities changes the relative attractiveness between formed (sub)centres and other areas. When significant disutilities are accumulated, another stochastic change may overturn the dominance of(sub)centres and drive developments to other locations. The subcentre formation is validated under the general discussion of 'goodness of fit' of possible urban automata, and population density surfaces are measured through various 'signatures'.

TI Things change: So whither sustainability?
SO ENVIRONMENTAL ETHICS
LA English
DT Article
AB Two broad metaphysical perspectives deriving from Parmenides and Heraclitus have implications for our notion of sustainability. The Parmenidian defends a deep-seated orderliness and permanence in things, while the Heraclitian finds only chance and change. Two further outlooks, the nomic (or the big-picture scientific) and the prudential, present differing accounts of our place in the world. While the nomic outlook accepts nothing privileged about the human perspective or even life itself, the prudential outlook is obviously welfare-centered, It is argued that nomic views, whether Parmenidian or Heraclitian, fair to provide any rationale for sustainability measures or concerns. The only such rationale comes from Parmenidian prudentialism, which, I argue, can operate only if it disowns at its peril the nomic point of view and couches sustainability entirely under the rubric of maximizing certain preferred opportunities drawn from collective self-love. But doing so merely evades rather than answers the tension imposed by the nomic Heraclitian for whom nothing lasts and nothing human counts specially in the measure. The liabilities of Parmenidian prudentialism are examined and found to be too great for any consistent notion of sustainability to bear.

ID MODEL
AB In modern intensive animal farming the disposal of a large amount or waste is of great concern, as, if not properly performed, it can cause the pollution of water, mainly because of the high content of nitrate and phosphate. This paper presents the results of a study intended to assess the environmental sustainability of animal waste disposal on agricultural soils in the alluvial plain of the River Chiana (Tuscany, Italy), a particularly sensitive area because of the high vulnerability of the shallow aquifer and of the intensive agricultural and breeding activities. With this aim, a strategy has been employed, that consists of the integrated use of a management model and GISs. The consequences on groundwater of applying animal waste to different kind of soils and crop arrangements have been simulated by means of the management model GLEAMS (Groundwater Loading Effects of Agricultural Management Systems, ver 2.01). As the huge amount of data required by such a sophisticated model does not allow applications at a scale larger than the field size, IDRISI and GRASS GIS packages have been used to divide the study area into land units, with homogeneous environmental characteristics, and then to generalize on these units the outputs of the model. The main conclusions can be synthesized as follows: The amount of animal waste produced in some of the investigated areas (i.e., municipal territory) is greater than that disposable on their own agricultural soil with no risks to the groundwater; consequently a cooperative approach among municipalities is necessary in order to plan waste disposal in a comprehensive and centralized way.

AB This paper examines the effects of uncertainty on the relationship between comprehensive NNP and sustainable-equivalent consumption. It is shown that the classical identity continues to hold, in expectations, when the discount factor is a stochastic diffusion process taking the form of geometric Brownian motion with drift, Such a result may be useful as a point of departure for classifying the effects that various forms of uncertainty have on the welfare significance of national product.

AB Many governments are striving to implement sustainable development programs. While there are many definitions of 'sustainability', most agree that a more comprehensive information infrastructure including economic, social,environmental, and cultural measures is required to assess courses of action and evaluate progress. Also critical is the development of information about the structure and behavior of the systems in which decisions are made. Must of the efforts toward the identification of information to support sustainable development decision making have focused on developing measures of progress toward sustainability. The Pressure-State-Response framework has been suggested as a method fur capturing perceptions of causality. This framework fails to capture important information about complex causal relationships and system behavior. A systems approach to identifying decisive information is discussed as an alternative. This approach supports the identification of relationships among the indicators, learning about the behavior of the system, and provides a common language for interdisciplinary communication.

   forest strategy; policy development; public consultation; sustainable
   forests
ID SUSTAINABLE FORESTS; COMMITMENT
AB Canada's national forest strategies (NFS) advance a commitment to maintain the diversity of social, economic, and ecological values throughout the nation's forests. This paper tracks and compares four major events in the progression of Canada's national forest policy: (i) the 1981-1987 forest sector discussion paper; (ii) the 1987-1992 forest sector strategy; (iii) the 1992-1997 NFS; and (iv) the 1998-2003 NFS.
   The 1987 NFS consisted of recommendations, whereas the 1992 NFS presented commitment statements. Unfortunately, the 1992 strategy did not reference the Canada Forest Accord nor vise-versa. Further, the Accord signatories simply endorsed a set of national commitments - these were not binding on the provinces. The 1998 NFS strengthened the connection to the second Canada Forest Accord, but connection is still not complete, as the second Canada Forest Accord does not reference the 1998 NFS. Nonetheless, both 1998 documents direct signatories to produce measurable action plans by 1999, thereby determining their specific responsibilities and deadlines. Together, the 1998 Canada Forest Accord and NFS accommodate regional differences while instilling a level of responsibility to achieve sustainable forests nationwide.
   The process to develop the NFS has improved through each iteration due to the greater range of discussion topics and wider spectrum of participants, especially Aboriginal people. The flexibility in allowing additional time to consult stakeholders and draft better strategies has also strengthened the 1998 NFS, as the 1998 National Forest Congress was delayed.
   Maintaining wide consultation to address-key stakeholder values, retaining flexibility while encouraging a significant level of commitment, and keeping strong connectivity between the Canada Forest Accord and the strategy are components for developing successful national forest policy in the future.

AB A survey in 1996/97 in the eastern German states yielded 3,682 answers by small forest owners concerning their problems, motives and expectations in foresrry. In the present paper results of this inquiry are presented and confronted with the principle of sustainability. Management options in small forest properties are discussed. The European criteria for sustainable forest management are likely to be met in areas of sufficient extension if the owners are free to act individually and no state intervention takes place.

AB At present, forestry in Germany is undergoing a period of change. Both the ecologically orientated transition of the forests and the extension of services based on the various forest land resources represent new concepts. Subsequently, the main task of forest management planning is to develop methods for the implementation of these concepts using a wide range of inventory, planning and control data. The type-oriented sample inventory presented here is able to provide reliable characteristics of the growing stock in survey units like forest districts or typical site classes as well as area-based information needed for planning and managing in each forest stand. For qualified decisions on the non-timber output of forests, well-founded information about demand and benefit is essential. By means of continuous visitor registration using reflection light barriers and additional questioning, the forest enterprise well obtain data on visitor use and forest-based recreational activities as well as ideas on visitors preferences.

AB The sustainability of land management was assessed for a sugar cane plantation using soil chemical and physical properties as indicators. The plantation (6000 ha) was established in 1979 on a broad alluvial plain and the majority of the soils are classified as Eutric and Mollic Fluvisols (73%) and Eutric Vertisols (23%). Average annual rainfall is about 2000 mm with a dry season from May to November. The sugar cane is not irrigated and receives only N fertilizer (90 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)). Detailed soil maps were used to make a selection (186 samples) of the existing soil chemical database (1979-1994) and for selecting sample sites in 1996. The pH of the topsoils had decreased from about 6.5 to 5.8 in both Fluvisols and Vertisols accompanied by a decrease in CEC acid exchangeable K. Between 1979 and 1996, organic C contents declined from about 5.5 to 3.2 g kg(-1). A significant decline in available P was found in Fluvisols (40 to 32 mg kg(-1)) and Vertisols (37 to 25 mg kg(-1)). Significant changes in soil chemical properties were mostly confined to the topsoil and differences between Fluvisols and Vertisols were relatively small. Changes in soil physical properties were assessed by measuring bulk density and infiltration under sugar cane and adjoining natural grassland areas. Bulk density and water intake were similar under natural grassland and within the sugar cane rows, The interrow had a significantly higher bulk density due to wheel traffic, which caused very low water intake. Bulk densities at which infiltration rates were severely reduced were slightly higher in Fluvisols than in Vertisols but for both Major Soil Groupings an increase of only 0.2 Mg m(-3) was critical. Changes in soil chemical and physical properties indicated that land management is not sustaining the resource base for sugar cane cultivation in the long-term. Threshold values in soil chemical properties were not reached and they were in 1996 still favourable for sugar cane cultivation. The soil compaction, however, directly affect the sugar cane as it seriously reduce rooting. It is concluded that routine soil analytical data combined with data that can be easily collected suffices to make a general assessment of sustainable land management at a plantation scale.

SO HABITAT INTERNATIONAL

DE infrastructure; urban standards; carrying capacities
AB Assessment of urban carrying capacities with respect to their basic infrastructure provisions like water supply and sanitation helps to determine the relative potentials of individual urban centres across regions for sustainable growth and also provides a framework for rational sectoral and spatial allocations of resources for infrastructure development. While carrying capacities should be assessed against acceptable norms and standards for provision of the basic services, there is ample scope for further development of minimum standards for urban water supply and sanitation in India. There has been a multiplicity of recommendations of standards with wide disparity across them and the rationale behind these recommendations are not explicit. The paper develops an array of indicator measures through which the natural and man-made resources and assimilative capacities of urban areas with respect to water supply, sewerage, drainage and solid waste disposal can be assessed in quantitative and qualitative terms. Another set of indicators have been developed to assess the financial and managerial capacities of various local institutions in the provision of these utilities. A framework for the use of these urban carrying capacity measures in spatial planning has been suggested. The author suggests further research to test the applicability of these indicator measures through real-life case studies of Indian cities based on available environmental information base.

TI Short-term results: The litmus test for success in China
SO HARVARD BUSINESS REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
AB Despite concerns about the continuation of China's economic boom and the country's political future, multinationals are flocking to China. Why? Because China may soon be one of the world's most important economies. Companies that don't consider exploring this vast market may be overlooking a tremendous growth opportunity.
   Investing in China now to build sustainable long-term positions is a credible strategy. Some companies, however, have taken the long-term argument too far. They tolerate poor short-term results in the mistaken belief that such results are a trade-off for future profitability. But underperformance in the short term is a good indicator that a company's strategy or practices may not measure up over the long run.
   Drawing on the examples of multinationals already competing in China, the author finds that success is more a factor of managerial capability, critical mass scale, and product portfolio than it is length of stay. Although some early movers are market leaders, being number one requires more than longevity. Take Coca-Cola, for instance. To see it: as a passive player that "waited it out" is to misunderstand the company's aggressive strategy: Coca-Cola planned carefully for success and executed a series of smart short-term moves to make it happen.
   In the final analysis, players that want to be around over the long run had better make the right moves today. One mistake won't seal a company's fate, but organizations need to learn from their mistakes quickly and use their new knowledge to build winning strategies. Companies that fail to adapt to the fast-paced market will never enjoy long-term success in China.

ID DRACUNCULIASIS ERADICATION; DISEASE; LESSONS
AB Although various attempts have been made to eradicate infectious diseases, only smallpox has been eradicated to date. Polio is targeted for eradication in 2000 and already planning has begun for the eradication of measles. However, before we commit to a measles eradication effort, we must examine the lessons to be learned from polio eradication. Of particular importance is the debate over whether resources should be invested in 'horizontal' or 'vertical' programmes. The outcome of these debates will have a very deep and lasting impact on global health development in years to come. Collaboration between targeted programmes and the primary health care sector through polio and measles eradication efforts will help bring about the necessary balance between goal-oriented programmes, which are subject to quality control and can be evaluated by measurable outcomes, and broader efforts to build up sustainable health infrastructure.

ID DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES
AB This paper introduces a conceptual framework which can be used to study the sustainability of health services in developing countries. A health service is considered sustainable when operated by an organizational system with the long-term ability to mobilize and allocate sufficient resources for activities that meet individual or public health needs. The framework includes three clusters: (1) contextual factors, which outline the task and general environment of the services; (2) an activity profile, which describes the services delivered and the activities carried out to deliver them; and (3) organizational capacity, which shows the carrying ability (capability) of the organization in broad terms.
   In this framework, health care provision is seen as an open system model where five main factors determine how inputs are converted to outputs, linking them through feedback loops. These factors are aims, technology, structure, culture and process.
   The framework has proven useful in analyzing factors critical to sustainability, and in describing structures and processes both in basic public services and in private not-for-profit services. It should also be tested on more complex systems, such as national health care.

DE globalization; health determinants; healthy public policy; public health
AB Poverty, other forms of social inequality and human impacts on the environment are increasingly recognized as important, perhaps fundamental, health determinants. These determinants, in turn, are largely conditioned and constrained by economic practices, and by government legislation that regulates such practices or seeks to mitigate inequalities that arise from them. Over the past two decades the ability of national governments to intervene in economic practices has been reduced by two interrelated phenomena: the dominance of a neoliberal economic orthodoxy, which emphasizes free (unregulated) markets and a 'minimal' welfare state, and the growth in regional and global free trade and investment agreements. There is mounting evidence that policies based on neoliberal economic theory, including free trade/investment agreements, may seriously undermine public health by increasing social inequalities, depleting natural resources and increasing environmental pollution. This evidence has sparked a call among many public interest non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and policy 'think tanks' for appending strong 'social clauses' to global trade and investment agreements to ensure that such agreements are socially just and environmentally sustainable. This paper proposes creation of a strong public health lobby, both nationally and internationally, to join with of her public interest NGOs in,the social clause campaign. It begins by defining and critiquing some of the basic tenets of neoliberal economic orthodoxy which underpin the push towards global free trade and investment agreements. It then describes the current status of these agreements, and provides examples of how such agreements might imperil public health. The paper then discusses the social clause initiative, and concludes by advancing a proposal for a public health lobby presence at those fora where trade and investment agreements are negotiated and monitored.

TI Owner occupation, employment and welfare: The impact of changing
   relationships on sustainable home ownership
SO HOUSING STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper is concerned with the changing relationships between owner occupation, employment and welfare that increasingly present a challenge to sustainable home ownership. While the discussion centres on the emerging position in Britain, the potential significance of the issues for a number of other countries is noted. The paper first identifies the conditions for sustainable owner occupation and then traces out the impact of three illustrative aspects of labour market change on sustainability. The three issues discussed are the growth of job instabilities, the rising incidence of unemployment and the growth of low paid employment. The extent to which the impact of the changing relationship between the housing and the labour market is already visible will be discussed--potential indicators include deteriorating physical conditions, changing attitudes to home ownership and financial difficulties, mortgage arrears and possessions. The latter form the focus for the discussion. This is set in the context of the changing pattern of safety net provision and the limiting of state welfare provision. Recent evidence questioning the likely success of the proposal to ensure the sustainability of owner occupation via the development of a private safety net will be presented.

ID MANAGEMENT; COMMONS; TRAGEDY
AB Kombu is a kind of seaweed growing in northern Japan. In Hidaka District Hokkaido Island, it comprises an important source of income. In the harvest of wild kombu, competition among the harvesters tends to be intense because of its high price and the fact that it is a limited resource. About a century ago, severe competition caused resource depletion and decline of kombu quality. Today, however, the resource is used sustainably by the villagers, who observe complex communal regulations for the use of common property. This study examines the ecological role of these regulations in the management of kombu as common property, and demonstrates that these regulations facilitate equal access to the resource, maintaining the unity of the focal community, as well as efficient resource use.

AB American farmers experience disenfranchisement in occupational and health status that places them at excess risk for injury and disease. Cancer morbidity and mortality investigations have documented excess rates of specific cancers among agricultural workers, and occupational pesticide exposure is thought to be a contributing etiologic agent. We report on a qualitative investigation of dairy farmers' awareness of cancer and their perceptions of pesticide associated cancer risks. A focus group of twelve participants and eleven elicitation interviews were conducted with dairy farmers residing in six Wisconsin counties. Leading themes that emerged from the narratives were farm sustainability concerns, time and stress contributing to pesticide exposure risks, and personal explanations of cancer causes. Prevention program recommendations stemming from these findings call for farm community approaches that target the multiple influences affecting pesticide safety. Such approaches should both originate from and foster collective community wisdom rather than expert models to achieve diffusion of health innovations and to ultimately reduce farm health risks.

ID CALL ADMISSION CONTROL
AB This paper describes a real-time connection admission control scheme for supporting multiple service categories. The scheme is based on a real-time cell-loss ratio evaluation algorithm for VER based on peak/sustainable cell rates and maximum burst size. The algorithm is based on a notion of Allan variance of VP utilization. The most remarkable characteristics of the admission control scheme are that it terminates within constant time, a few milliseconds, and that its time is independent of both the number of VCs and the capacity of a cell buffer.

Stuntz],based intercropping system under rainfed conditions. The economic analysis revealed that intercropping of pearlmillet and redgram [Cajanus cajan (L.) Millsp.] in 2 : 1 row proportion with application of 60 kg N/ha gave significantly higher net returns, followed by intercropping of pearlmillet + redgram in 2 : 1 row proportion with 30 kg N/ha during both the years. The sustainable value index was also higher with intercropping of pearlmillet + redgram and application of 60 kg N/ha, followed by the same intercropping system with 30 kg N/ha.

DE wheat-based cropping; productivity; economics
AB A field experiment was conducted during 1988-93 on sandy-loam soil (Torripsament) to study productivity and economics of 5 different cropping systems under upland cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.)-wheat (Triticum aestivum L. emend. Fiori & Paol.), mungbean or greengram (Phaseolus radiatus L.)-wheat, mungbean-Indian mustard [Brassica juncea (L.) Czernj. & Cosson], pigeonpea [Cajanus cajan (L.) Millsp.]-wheat and clusterbean [Cyamopsis tetragonoloba (L.) Taubert]-wheat, under various levels of irrigation. Upland cotton-wheat gave the highest wheat-equivalent yield (84.76 q/ha/year) and monetary net return (Rs 15,613/ha/year) with 12 irrigations, followed by pigeonpea-wheat (73.91 q/ha/year and Rs 14,718/ha/year) with 11 irrigations during rainy and winter seasons. However, the highest wheat-equivalent yield (15.97 q/ha/year/irrigation) and net return (Rs 2,225/ha/year/irrigation) we re recorded under mungbean-Indian mustard crop sequence. Mean net returns of Rs 13,859/ha/year from upland cotton-wheat and of Rs 13,158/ha/year from pigeonpea-wheat were at par and significantly superior to the mean net returns, obtained from all the sequences. The highest mean sustainability value index (0.52) was recorded under pigeonpea-wheat. The highest mean values in terms of wheat-equivalent yield (75.55 q/ha/year), land-utilization efficiency (87.1%), production efficiency (23.7 kg/ha/day) and consumptive water use (1,046 mm) were recorded with upland cotton-wheat. But the maximum water-use efficiency of 8.9 kg/ha/mm was recorded in mungbean-Indian mustard.

TI Fishery resources in the Indian EEZ: Recommendations for deep-sea
   fisheries development
SO INDIAN JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCES
LA English
DT Article
AB The marine fishery resources potential is estimated to be 3.92x10(6) tonnes. The data collected through the exploratory surveys conducted by the Fishery Survey of India (FSI) have not only been the basis of this estimated potential but the source of knowledge on the types of resources and their distribution in time and space. Considering the current level of annual marine fish production, 2.69x10(6) tonnes, the potential entails additional harvestable yield of about 1.3x10(6) tonnes. This additional yield will be mainly from the deep-sea and oceanic sectors. For further development of fisheries in the Indian EEZ, application of a number of fishing techniques viz. bottom trawling for deep-sea fin-fishes, cephalopods, deep-sea shrimps and deep-sea lobsters; mid-water trawling for columnar species and tuna longlining for oceanic stocks of tuna and allied species should be considered. These techniques used in exploratory surveys were proved to be effective. The effectiveness of these techniques and the availability of the resources were further confirmed by the deep-sea fisheries vessels operated under various deep-sea fishing schemes. However, some of the commercial techniques such as mid-water trawling for columnar resources and purse-seining for oceanic tunas need to be experimented for recommending its commercial scale application in the Indian seas. In the present scenario of fisheries development, there is need for adapting suitable strategies for rational development aimed at sustainable exploitation and conservation of the fish stocks in the Indian EEZ.

AB Is it possible to satisfy the growing demand for food taking care oTthe environment and of the resources? To answer this question an analysis of the future demand of food and of the potential capacity of agricultural production is made for different regions.
   A well fed population through a sustainable use of resources is possible. Human population will stabilize in the incoming century and the planet has a great potential for food production, many times greater than the future stabilized food demad. Moreover, the amazing technological developments is providing tools unthinkable a few years ago.
   To reach the goal strong investments in agricultural research and extension, in education and in rural development are needed Thus, the solution from the technical point of view is highly feasible.
   Starvation, serious nutritional problems and severe soil degradation are taking place in parts of the world: and the perspectives for these areas are not encouraging, This is not because Malthus was right; it is because egoism and lack of solidarity prevail. The key question is not whether Ice can feed mankind, it is whether we want to do it.

TI Nuclear fuel: recycle or dispose? how? where? when?
SO INTERDISCIPLINARY SCIENCE REVIEWS
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper considers the broad issues raised by the increasing inventory of stored used fuel from nuclear power stations worldwide. It reviews nuclear waste disposal, concluding that deep geological disposal can be safely achieved, but will depend crucially on simple transparent processes and the achievement of consensus. As the technology is now available, there is every reason to proceed with disposal as soon as the consensus can be achieved. The effects of recycling by reprocessing on the disposal task are examined. Reprocessing always reduces the volume of high level waste for disposal, usually reduces the high+intermediate volume, and, given recycling of uranium and plutonium, also decreases the total waste volume. As the quantifiable risks from reprocessing are very small, reprocessing is a viable waste treatment and recycling process, and it is for the nuclear utilities to determine whether it fits their strategic and commercial needs. Certainly recycling by reprocessing has a valid place in the programme, particularly in the UK. The sustainability adage that 'recycling is good' and the imperative that 'the polluter pays' are both relevant to the nuclear industry. Both can be furthered by a continuation of reprocessing in the world in general. In the UK in particular, only the continuation of reprocessing can provide the income stream which can both fund and motivate the safe, timely cleanup of much of the UK's historic legacy of nuclear waste.

AB Health and work are two central components of sustainable development. A total of 2.6 billion people constitute the global labour force, 80% of which is in the developing world. A significant part of the working population in both developed and developing countries is employed in so-called small-scale enterprises (SSEs). This is the under-served working population which does not fully benefit from available knowledge and experience related to health and safety at work. The focus of this paper includes common features of SSEs, with some key WHO documents and publications on chemical hazards, safety, and emergency measures, as well as the WHO concept on Occupational Health for All, and the WHO Global Strategy.

AB For those persuaded that present societal behaviour and individual behaviour are unsustainable, the risks of continuing the present course of action seem loud and clear. However, any new undertaking has uncertainties, which include hidden risks as well as the risks associated with any major paradigm shift as yet untried. This paper provides a preliminary examination of some of the risks and focuses on the need of examining sustainable use of the planet more carefully in terms of risks and uncertainty of outcomes. A shift to sustainability will be greatly improved by an examination of the risks associated with any paradigm shift, since no undertaking has zero risk.

AB There are competing views on sustainability which mainly stem from differences in assumptions upon which each of these views is based. Perhaps the most debated assumption is the extent to which manufactured capital and natural capital are substitutes. Neo-Malthusians, the Club of Pome, and other Stationary-State theorists fill the ranks of the legion of pessimistic economists who fear any negative changes in the total stock of natural capital. Diametrically opposed to these doomsayers stands Solow (1986) and other optimistically inclined neoclassical economists who look favourably on the 'Backstop TechnologyTheory' of resource use. Falling inconspicuously between the polar extremes, there is a third group of theorists who incorporate certain aspects of each of the other two groups in addition to employing the principles embodied by Hartwick's Rule.
   The term sustainable development (SD) is also subject to considerable debate. This paper examines various concepts of sustainability and SD. Policy makers need operational guidelines to help them determine the degree to which these concepts are useful in specific situations. The paper addresses this need by focusing on forest resources in general and those of California in particular. A simulation/linear programming forest resource assessment model was applied to California's private forests td demonstrate that strict decade-to-decade 'even-flow' stability of production may result in lower aggregate levels of output over a prolonged planning period, with ending levels of the stock resource that are scarcely greater than when output is permitted to vary over the planning period. The model was also used to show that greater levels of output and ending stocks are possible when the land base for sustainability assessment is not a restrictively small geographical area or a single class of ownership. The application of the concepts becomes significantly more complex when amenity values and public ownership are considered.

AB Efforts towards sustainable development are now being undertaken at ail levels and the concept has increasingly entered the consciousness of the average person. For many Costa Ricans however, it is not just an abstract concept but a matter of survival as input costs increase, natural resources diminish and the soil loses fertility or is washed away. This paper reviews three case studies representing different approaches towards achieving sustainable development by different types of organization which are each innovative in preventing further destruction of tropical forest resources.

TI From resource crisis to sustainability: the forest transition in Denmark
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND WORLD ECOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
DE sustainability; forest transition; crisis-response model; Denmark
AB After prolonged deforestation, the Danish forest area had shrunk to under 5% of the land area by the beginning of the nineteenth century. Contraction then halted, and expansion began, to the extent that the forest area has now more than doubled. The transition from shrinking to expanding forest area is outlined, and is explained in terms of a crisis-response theory in the context of the operation of a combination of 'necessary' factors. The occurrence of a forest-resource crisis triggered a shift to a trajectory of sustainability only when these 'necessary' conditions were satisfied. At the same time, the Danish forest transition appears to have been achieved at less social cost than in many other countries. The implications of the Danish case for transitions to forest sustainability in the modern world are considered.

TI The cost of tuberculosis to patients in Sierra Leone's war zone
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TUBERCULOSIS AND LUNG DISEASE
LA English
DT Article
DE tuberculosis; Sierra Leone; economic factors; patient's perspective
AB OBJECTIVE: To evaluate how the extreme poverty of the patients and the poor salaries of the staff combined to increase the cost of treatment to patients within the subsidised national tuberculosis programme in Sierra Leone.
   DESIGN/SETTING: From September to December of 1994, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 72 patients and 17 staff of the National Leprosy and Tuberculosis Control Programme of Sierra Leone, a screening and treatment programme funded by international donors.
   RESULTS: Although some extra costs were indeed incurred within the subsidized national tuberculosis treatment programme, they were much lower than those incurred during the pre-programme period when the patients sought intermittent help from a wide range of traditional and biomedical sources within the plural healing continuum. The national politico-economic crisis, and the consequent poverty of most patients, impeded compliance with and sustainability of treatment, even within the formal subsidised treatment programme.
   CONCLUSIONS: More money was spent by patients on treatment in the months/years preceding entry into the national tuberculosis programme. Many factors retarded entry, including poor communications, misinformation, malpractice by health professionals, and displacement resulting from chronic internal warfare. The war intensified all factors that predispose to tuberculosis and retarded access to treatment. Supra-programme cost, or 'corruption,' was minimal due to the poverty of health professionals, with a few salient exceptions.

TI New Solid State Fuel Cells - Green Power Source for 21st Century
SO IONICS
LA English
DT Article
AB The exhaustion of the major fossil energy sources on earth in near future and the serious environmental pollution from the fuel combustion processes in the presently applied technologies are the most important problems of modem society. The sustainable development of mankind requests strongly to develop "green" power devices characterized by high fuel energy conversion efficiency, less pollution to the environment and convenience to use.
   Fuel cells have been commonly accepted to be a kind of clean, safe and convenient power source with high energy efficiency and are on the verge of revolutionizing the electric power industry by offering better ways to produce electricity and to deliver it to the consumers.
   Among all the advanced fuel cells being developed, which one might be the better choice for ideal green power generators in the 21st century? The answer is solid state fuel cells, particularly the solid oxide fuel cells(SOFCs) but not in the present stage of development. The new generation of SOFCs will certainly be based on all the results and experiences achieved so far in the fuel cell field and a lot of R & D work has to be performed furthermore.
   This paper attempts to present the current status of the R & D work on fuel cells, especially SOFCs, new concepts and trends, problems and possible measures which may initiate further discussion.
   The present article includes the following sub-topics:
   The best electric power plants for the 21st Century
   R & D on SOFCs: current status, problems and new trends
   Intermediate temperature SOFCs - what do we need to do?
   Fabrication techniques - soft chemistry routes
   What to do for coming up with "green" power plants ?

AB Genetic improvement is inherently a long-term process in which progress in the future is built upon improvement in the past. Discounting of future returns is often used in deriving economic values of traits under selection, but this gives a shortterm perspective that is in conflict with the long-term nature of genetic improvement. Changes in management, market environment, and genetic potential over time can negatively affect the attainment of breeding goals. Nonlinear optimization techniques can be used to find optimum economic weights each year over any time horizon. Nearly optimal solutions can be found by deriving economic weights for a single, specified future date. Uncertainty about future production and marketing environments creates risk that might be lessened by maintaining or selecting for diverse genetic stocks that could be used in the future. Such programs may need to be coordinated internationally because they may be too expensive for individual companies to undertake. Consideration of risk and careful analyses of future technical and environmental conditions are needed to define multiple trait objectives for long-term genetic change.

ID CONSERVATION BIOLOGY
AB Livestock producers using public lands in the West were once concerned primarily with efficient systems for livestock production. Historically, this concept began in 1934 with the passage of the Taylor Grazing Act. Management activities on public lands continued to focus on sustainable livestock production until the 1970s, when the public began to demand enforcement of the Multiple Use Act and the National Environmental Policy Act. During this time, species listing under the Endangered Species Act became more active. Unfortunately, so many species are listed or are being considered for listing that it becomes impossible to develop biological information on causative factors for listing or recovery plans for each one. Peer-reviewed science that addresses management needs is often unavailable, and articles from the gray literature have been used in management plans for both threatened and endangered species and for public land. Personal biases of both scientists and land managers can influence the development of land management plans, especially in cases in which scientific information is minimal. The Land Grant System is well positioned to develop research applicable for public lands. Animal scientists need to be involved in interdisciplinary teams. Livestock producers need to overcome the stigma that livestock grazing is not a sustainable use. Rangeland in poor condition, whether public or private, should be improved if livestock managers are to change the public perception that grazing degrades rangeland. To accomplish this, education and peer pressure should be used. Another approach needed is activism on the part of producers and animal scientists. The public is demanding a voice in public land management. Working groups seem to be the emerging pathway to cooperatively develop management plans.

TI Weed communities in Andean cropping systems of northern Peru
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED BOTANY-ANGEWANDTE BOTANIK
LA English
DT Article
AB A phytosociological survey was performed in 1995/96 and 1996/97 in the northern Peruvian Andes in view of assessing the indicator value of weeds for land use sustainability. The survey, carried out in the agro-ecological zone of potatoes,Andean tubers and small cereals between 3200 and 3600 masl, used the method of BRAUN-BLANQUET. At all sites soil samples were taken, the geographical coordinates determined with GPS (Global Positioning System), and topographic features derived from the DEM (Digital Elevation Model). Data evaluation used the VAN DER MAAREL transformation and TWINSPAN classification as well as ordination by correspondence analysis using the software CANOCO 3.1.
   In total, 165 weed species were found. Six major phytosociological groups could be distinguished, characterized by the following species: 1. Rumex acetosella, 2. Lachemilla pinnata, 3. 'Central group' (no obvious character species), 4. Calandrinia ciliata, 5. Anagallis arvensis / Bidens pilosa, and 6. Equisetum bogotense. Of 36 environmental variables considered, altitude, pH, calcium carbonate, exposition, organic matter and clay resulted to be most influential for species distribution. The Anagallis arvensis / Bidens pilosa group separates alkaline, calcareous sites at lower altitudes from all other phytosociological formations on acid soils at higher altitudes.
   A small survey of the traditional knowledge of local farmers qualified the site requirements of 39 species according to the farmers' appreciation. By synthesizing the phytosociological classification and the results of the regression curve analysis, 31 key species were selected as candidates for their indicator qualities.

TI Stable states in relation to grazing in Patagonia: a 10-year
   experimental trial
SO JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS

   thresholds; Patagonia

AB A 10-year sheep grazing experiment was conducted in southern Patagonia to test the hypothesis that high stocking rates would promote transitions from open grasslands to dwarf shrublands. Treatments included three stocking rates and an exclosure. Total aerial vegetation cover grew in all treatments, but especially under low stocking rates and exclosure. Short grasses and herbaceous dicots increased significantly in these last treatments. Bunchgrasses increased under low stocking rates, but decreased in the exclosure. Cover of dwarf shrubs did not change in any treatment. Diversity of the community, measured in Shannon-Wiener and species richness index, increased in the exclosure, and species richness was reduced under high stocking rates. Transitions were explored by means of PCA. While all treatments moved along the axes of the multivariate space, we detected no thresholds and found no indications of having induced transitions to alternate states with the grazing treatments imposed.
   The open grasslands at our experimental site could be considered stable states induced by a century of domestic grazing, and they withstood 10 years of grazing at 0.60 sheep ha(-1) without unfavourable transitions. Even though, loss of palatable species and diversity could indicate that moderate, variable stocking rates (average 0.40 sheep ha(-1)) would be closer to 'sustainable' in the long-term. Vegetation seems to retain the ability to build up cover and diversity after a stocking rate reduction. (C) 1998 Academic Press.

AB This article examines the traditional relationship between the houbara bustard (Chlamydotis undulata macqueenii) and desert falconry in the Middle East and reviews the factors causing the decline of houbara populations. Hunting with falcons, industrial development, changes to traditional agriculture, political instability, subsistence hunting, and wars are important factors combining to threaten this species throughout its range. Many initiatives to conserve the houbara bustard in the Middle East are supported by Arab falconers. The role of national wildlife conservation agencies in the Middle East in establishing captive breeding and restoration programs, habitat protection, ecological studies, biomedical research, local hunting organizations, falcon research groups, sustainable use in range countries, public awareness programs, rehabilitation projects, and international agreements to conserve the houbara bustard are described.

ID LONG-RUN GROWTH; MODEL
AB The possibility of sustained long-run growth is typically associated with the presence of some endogenous 'engine of growth'. It may allow the economy to grow without bound despite the use of some non-reproducible resources. Such situations can lead to dynamic models combining the features of sustainable growth and decreasing returns. One-sector models of this kind have recently attracted much attention in macroeconomics applications. Their approximate linearity for the purposes of long-run analysis has been noted. This paper is aimed at establishing the general fact: dynamic models (one- or multisector) which are characterized by sustained endogenous growth with non-increasing returns display the patterns of optimal growth asymptotically equivalent to those generated by models with linear technology. I consider a neoclassical growth model with heterogeneous capital, develop its linear counterpart, and prove their asymptotic equivalence in terms of long-run optimal growth rates and cross-sectoral profiles of consumption, real interest rates and relative prices. This result also implies the 'non-substitution' theorem for the neoclassical dynamic model of sustained growth: optimal input profiles, relative prices, and interest rates are asymptotically independent of intertemporal preferences.

TI Harbour resource management in Cowes, Isle of Wight: an analytical
   framework for multiple-use decision-making
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
DE harbour management; common-pool resources; institutional analysis;
   Oakerson Framework; decision-making
AB The management of common-pool resources (CPRs) has gained increased attention in the debate about sustainable environmental management. Research on CPR management has mainly concentrated on single-use resources. Since CPRs develop over time to include new extractive and non-extractive users, a multiple-use perspective on their governance is needed.
   In 'multiple-use CPRs' co-ordination and monitoring of the various activities is an integral part of resource management; decision-making processes play a key role in this collective management. This paper develops a heuristic framework for the analysis of decision-making processes in multiple-use CPRs. The framework is based on a case study of three selected harbour uses in the port of Cowes (UK): (1) the oyster fishery; (2) the yachting industry. and (3) cargo shipping, and draws heavily on an analytical framework for single-use CPRs developed by Oakerson. The Oakerson Framework has been re-developed by adapting it to 'vertical' and 'horizontal' multi-level analysis, including 'multiple-levels of decision-making arrangements' and 'multiple users: as integral variables.
   The paper also examines the extent to which user groups can influence the management of a multiple-use CPR as a whole. In cases where such governance remains with an 'umbrella authority: the users' ability to influence decisions by the umbrella organization is strongly related to the historical, socio-economic and organizational characteristics of the specific resource use and on the users' strength at the organizational level. While the presence of an umbrella authority may facilitate CPR management, under-representation of specific user groups in decision-making may serve as a catalyst for institutional change for that particular use, in an attempt to find other means of control.

TI Nutrient retention by multipond systems: Mechanisms for the control of

SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY

   LAKES; SOILS
AB The processes of the multipond system in an experimental agricultural watershed located in southeastern China were studied during a 2-yr period (1994-1995), with the purpose of the research being the reduction of nonpoint nutrient pollution at its sources. The mechanisms studied included water storage capacity, sedimentation, denitrification, and removal of nutrients by the harvest of macrophytes from ponds and ditches. The results showed that the retention of both water and nutrients depended on the water storage capacity of the ponds, the total pond volume, rainfall, surface runoff, and irrigation amounts. For the years of 1994 and 1995, the water retention rate was 85.5%, while the nutrient retention rate reached 98.1 and 97.8% for total N (TN) and total P (TP), respectively. Sediment deposit was another important mechanism. The average sedimentation rate was 30.0 mm yr(-1) (from 1985-1995). For the whole multipond system (35 ha), the average retention amounts reached 9800 kg of N and 2800 kg of P by sediment accumulation per year. The results demonstrated that denitrification in ponds and ditches was an important mechanism for removing N from the watershed. The highest possible rate was more than 0.17 mg N g(-1) soil during the summer season. The results suggested that the multipond system, which kept water in balance, benefited the water, nutrient, and sediment recycling in the terrestrial ecosystem, as web as helped to reduce agricultural nonpoint pollution at its sources. Therefore, the multipond system, with its low cost in construction and maintenance, is recommended as a good practice both for the control of nonpoint pollution at its sources and for sustainable agricultural development.

AB The purpose of this study was to document the development of a consortium to lead a school-based nutrition program and to evaluate consortium effectiveness in guiding and implementing program activities and consortium sustainability The overall program objective was to provide nutrition education to elementary school children in a low-income rural community and to provide reinforcing messages to parents via the school; the Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children; the Food Stamp program; and the Expanded Food and Nutrition Education Program. A new consortium of representatives from these agencies and the community was developed. Memoranda of agreement were developed between the primary organizations involved. Operation and sustainability of the consortium were evaluated by types of members, participation of members, group activities, interviews with key staff, and member satisfaction. Project activities were implemented essentially as planned, the consortium operated effectively, and members were satisfied with the consortium and project, but sustainability of the consortium as it existed during the project is questionable. A major barrier to sustainability of the consortium was members who were already overcommitted due to interest in community initiatives. Leadership of the collaborative would be better fostered ii duties within agencies involved were redistributed to include consortium involvement. Consortium members must feel that their efforts are valued by the community and employers.

AB The purpose of this study was to examine the feasibility and effectiveness of a nutrition education intervention for elementary school children, grades K-6 called the Cookshop Program. It Ras designed to increase preferences for and consumption of minimally processed whole grains and vegetables through cooking these foods in the classroom along with multiple exposures to the same foods in the cafeteria and parent involvement It emphasized haw rating a plant-based diet was not only important for personal health but lt;as also resource conserving or more ecologically sustainable,This outcome evaluation study compared cooking as an educational strategy with the more usual active participatory educational methods,The study used a quasi-experimental, pre/post intervention-comparison group design with 39 classes (590 students) assigned approximately equally, through matching, to four conditions: cookshops plus food and environment lessons (CS + FEL),cookshops only (CS), food and environment lessons only (FEEL), and comparison condition (Com), receiving neither cookshops nor lessons. Data were analyzed using a 2 x 2 factorial design using analysis of covariance. Class was the unit of analysis. Main positive effects were obtained for CS on preferences, knowledge, and plate waste in both younger and older children and on behavioral intention in younger children and cooking self-efficacy in older children. Main positive effects were obtained for FEL in knowledge for both age groups. The results suggest that actual cooking experiences and eating food with peers, accompanied by cognitive learning, may provide a promising approach to nutrition education, especially for younger children, Lack of random assignment of classes to conditions was a limitation of the study, Further research is needed to evaluate this approach using randomized designs.

AB This article argues that the strictly pragmatic, step-by-step approach of Oslo has reached a dead end and that cajoling the parties into signing an agreement is now irrelevant To move the peace process to a successful conclusion the parties must now commit themselves to a principled solution whose key elements include prior commitment to a genuine two-state solution as the endpoint of the final status negotiations, provision of meaningful citizenship to the Palestinians of the territories and the refugees, and mutual acknowledgment of the other's nationhood and humanity Such a proposal, though seemingly utopian, represents the most realistic option at the present juncture.

   fishery; sustainable yield
AB Blue crabs support the most important commercial and recreational fisheries in the Chesapeake Bay. They have been harvested and cultured for local consumption since colonial times; the directed commercial fishery began in 1880. Maryland and Virginia historically harvested and marketed more blue crabs than any other North American region. Baywide landings in 1995 totaled 33.5 x 10(6) kg; value averaged $53.1 million between 1990 and 1994. With recent declines in other bay fisheries, more recreational and commercial emphasis has been placed on Chesapeake blue crabs. Historical (1945-1995) harvest and effort data for pots, trotlines, dredges, scrapes, and pound nets were examined. Data for the commercial hard crab fishery were more complete and consistent; peeler/soft crab landings and effort data were severely underestimated. Survey estimates of the Maryland recreational harvest in 1983, 1988, and 1990 were 78.6, 49.5, and 25.9% respectively, of the reported commercial harvest; no other recreational landings data were available. Blue crab landings were inherently variable among years. Three periods of low apparent stock abundance since 1929 were indicated: 1930 to 1945, 1951 to 1960, and 1968 to 1980. High commercial harvests occurred in 1981 and 1983 (similar to 47 x 10(6) kg). The crab pot has been the dominant gear, accounting for 40 to 80% of the landings from 1945 to 1995, and 70% since 1981. Trotline landings were 6 to 38% of the total since 1945, averaging 21% since 1981, as compared to 5 to 25% and 9%, respectively, for the dredge fishery. Scrapes and pound nets contributed <1% of the total. Hard crabs historically were >90% of blue crab landings by weight. Soft crabs were more valuable, averaging $1.25/kg versus $0.29/kg for hard crabs. Harvest and effort data for 1982 to 1995 revealed no evidence of a decline in Maryland pot and trotline fisheries. Mean kg/pot/month for the pot fishery increased from 10 to 19 from 1982 to 1984 and declined to 10 in 1994. Trotline mean kg/trotline-h/mo increased between 1982 and 1985 from 21 to 35 and remained fairly constant thereafter. Maryland and baywide total yield has varied without trend since 1982 and 1945, respectively. Baywide nominal directed effort displayed a near fivefold increase in 1945, resulting in sharply declining catch per unit effort (CPUE) in the commercial fisheries. The majority of this decline occurred by the late 1960s. Baywide CPUE has been noisy but without trend since 1970. The exponential decline in CPUE reflected a decline in the catchability of the gear (gear saturation) rather than a decline in the stock The Chesapeake Bay blue crab fishery is overcapitalized, with relatively constant harvest divided among increasing gear units and number of participants. Market category data revealed that Maryland female harvest is 8% above the 1982 to 1995 average; Virginia winter dredge female landings in 1993 to 1994 were 29% below the 1982 to 1992 average. Baywide female blue crab harvest was slightly below the long-term average from 1982 to 1995. The Baywide commercial fisheries have realized yield at approximately the value of maximum sustainable yield (MSY; 37-39 x 10(6) kg) during the last 15 years. Total yield approximated or exceeded MSY in the mid-1960s and after 1980. Current yield was slightly below MSY. The Chesapeake Bay blue crab population is maintaining recruitment to the stock, and levels of exploitable and spawning stock biomass at near long-term average levels of abundance.

ID MODEL
AB This stock assessment stemmed from concerns about declines in Chesapeake Bay blue crab commercial yield, survey abundance indices, and economic performance in the 1990s. Blue crab vital rates and life-history characteristics were described. A risk-averse approach was adopted for parameter estimation. Extant (50 y) fisheries-independent and dependent data were compiled. Current spawning stock biomass was at moderate levels, as compared to historical maxima; total stock biomass was at long-term average levels since 1956. Juvenile recruitment has been variable since the 1950s. The stock is in long-term dynamic equilibrium, demonstrating variable abundance as expected in a strongly r-selected species. No evidence of a persistent stock decline was found. The decade of the 1980s was a period of above average abundance; the population modulated to average levels thereafter. Maryland commercial catch per unit effort (CPUE) has remained fairly stable from 1982 to 1995. Baywide yield varied without trend since 1945, cycling around the long-term mean with peaks in 1950, 1966, 1981, and 1993 and troughs in the mid-1950s and late 1970s to early 1980s. Baywide data since 19-15 demonstrated a fivefold increase in directed effort (f) and an exponential decline in CPUE: rapidly from 1947 to 1967, and without trend since 1970. The stock has supported maximum sustainable yield (MSY) = 37-38.5 x 10(6) kg since 1935 with no observed change in the ability of the stock to replace itself or to provide historical average yield. We judged the stock to be moderately to fully exploited at average levels of abundance. Stock-recruitment (S-R) analysis revealed weak relationships. Density-independent effects accounted for little of the variability in the S-R model. Exploitation rates for 1956 to 1996 ranged from 30-40% for peeler/soft crabs and 40-55% for hard crabs. Fishing mortality (F) ranged largely between 0.8-1.0 (F < 1.20) since 1956 within +/- 20% of the long-term mean; fully recruited F in 1996 was 0.87. Current F was below the threshold reference level of F-10% = 1.21, where F-REP = 1.17. Yield per recruit (YPR) modeling estimated F-0.1 = 0.36 and F-MAX = 0.64. The stock is strictly growth overfished with a 26% reduction in F-10% required to maximize (+2% gain) YPR. Longevity was established at 8 y. Tagging studies showed that blue crabs live considerably longer than curren convention (3 y). A life-table model reconciled the apparent disparity between this convention and the life-history parameters used in the assessment. At current total mortality (Z)approximate to 1.3, the mean age of the observed stock would be 1.5 y (153 mm CW [carapace width]; 97.3% of all individuals would be greater than or equal to 3 y of age. The dramatic rise in f since 1945 with the accompanying decline in CPUE was not associated with an increase in F. Catachability (q) has varied with f from 1956 to 1995 as a result of gear saturation. Moderate reductions in f would not result in a proportional reduction in F because of nonconstant q. The blue crab fishery is severely overcapitalized in terms of total effort.
   As a result of gear saturation, marginal decreases in fishing effort would not realize proportional gains in CPUE, %MSP, or YPR. Substantial economic displacement would be required to maximize YPR. Increases in %MSP and YPR could be realized through increased size limits and regulating the taking of mature female crabs, without the displacement costs associated with effort reductions alone. We recommend a risk-averse management strategy: maintain current F below F-10%. Management should be particularly averse to increases in effort that would exacerbate current economic inefficiencies, or to increases ih gear efficiency. The latter concern acknowledges the delicate interplay between F and f in the fishery. Management should be proactive: stabilize and enhance the economic viability of the fishery and provide protection for the stock through maintenance of greater than or equal to 10% maximum spawning potential (MSP). It should consider adopting strategies which increase YPR (e.g., size limit measures on both sexes) and spawning potential (e.g., limit directed fisheries on mature female crabs).

AB To investigate responses of selected soil characteristics to vegetation changes in high-country soils, samples were collected from under unburned Chionochloa rigida grassland, burned C. rigida, 12-year-old Pinus radiata trees and from glades within pine forest where trees had failed to grow. Under P. radiata there were lower soil pH and exchangeable Ca, Mg, K and Fe, while lower microbial C, N and P in the plantation confirmed other findings that P. radiata reduces C, N and P pools in mineral soil. Relatively small differences in microbial biomass C and P between tussock >25 and <14 years since burning suggest that burning has a lesser effect than P. radiata on these properties. Burning, however, affected biomass N. Numerical abundance of megascolecid earthworms was greatest in tussock-grassland and in glades; they were least abundant under P. radiata. However, the heaviest individual earthworms occurred under P. radiata and in glades. Indices suggest a less stable or more rapidly reproducing nematode fauna under P. radiata; nematode generic diversity was lowest under P. radiata. Although the four vegetation types affected soil properties in various ways, most properties under the P, radiata plantation were most different. The decline in microbial biomass C, N and P and the microbial C: organic C ratio under P. radiata suggest lower organic matter inputs into the soil, and as such could be regarded as a decline in ecological sustainability. The associated shift in the structure of the biotic community observed in this study emphasizes the role of biotic factors as independent variables for monitoring soil organic matter dynamics under different land-uses.

DE desertification; policy; landuse; dryland; United States of America
AB Desertification in the United States of America is very complex and difficult to combat on a continuing basis and on a large scale. It can be due to improper agricultural practices, livestock grazing, mining, fire management, recreation practices, deforestation, urbanization, and introduction of exotic species. Thus, national, state, and local policies must deal with a wide range of circumstances and land uses, and they must be comprehensive and dynamic, providing flexibility as issues, knowledge, and needs change. The United States can demonstrate many causations, but also successes, in combating desertification. However, much more work is needed to assure sustainable use of millions of hectares, particularly in the drylands of the western United States. A vigilance on policies and their implementation is required to assure that efforts to combat desertification are effective. Over time, some policies outlive their purpose and require change, but that is not always easy to achieve, and many times it takes a concentrated effort over several years or more to bring about, especially if that policy has its basis in law. Although this process sometimes seems slow, new laws continue to be enacted and policies are adopted that address land uses and the difficult task of combating desertification. Several examples are offered to show the variety of actions taken and processes used in the United States. (C) 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB In this paper, we examine the exploitation of single population modeled by time-dependent Logistic equation with periodic coefficients. First, it is shown that the time-dependent periodic Logistic equation has a unique positive periodic solution, which is globally asymptotically stable for positive solutions, and we obtain its explicit representation. Further, we choose the maximum annual-sustainable yield as the management objective, and investigate the optimal harvesting policies for constant harvest and periodic harvest. The optimal harvest effort that maximizes the annual-sustainable yield, the corresponding optimal population level, the corresponding harvesting time;spectrum, and the maximum annual-sustainable yield are determined, and their explicit expressions are obtained in terms of the intrinsic growth rate and the carrying capacity of the considered population. Our interesting and brief results generalize the classical results of Clark for a population described by the autonomous logistic equation in renewable resources management.

AB Fears have arisen among many scientists that bigleaf mahogany populations throughout Central and South America are in danger of possible extinction. This article investigates the validity of those fears through analysis of the current threats to mahogany populations and offers several different strategies for protecting the species. Ultimately, little progress will be made without considerable international cooperation among several different groups including policy makers, consumers, the logging industry, and producers of mahogany merchandise. The case of bigleaf mahogany becomes increasingly important when one considers that it may prove to be the test case for sustainability in tropical lumber production.

ID FARMING SYSTEMS; ACCUMULATION; MANAGEMENT; LIVESTOCK
AB In this paper, heavy-metal flows (cadmium, copper, lead, and zinc) of arable, dairy and mixed farming systems in the Netherlands are studied. Farm-gale and field-scale balances are calculated. On the field-scale, static and dynamic balances are distinguished. By determining the characteristic metal flows, it becomes possible to differentiate between farming systems and to select the most viable options for sustainable heavy-metal management. The crop relation and the choice of fertilizers clearly influence the heavy-metal balance of arable farming systems. In dairy farming systems, the role of feed management is very important, but the effects on the heavy-metal balance are not always straightforward. Mixed farming systems compare favorably with specialized (arable or dairy) farming systems with regard to heavy-metal accumulation. Due to the internal cycling of feedstuff and manure, less inputs are required and thus the import of heavy-metal containing raw materials and products is minimized. Uncertainties related to the calculation of heavy-metal balances are discussed.

ID FARMING SYSTEMS
AB The development of less intensive crop management systems is being increasingly recognized as the long-term objective for arable crop production. Such systems must be economically sound, environmentally acceptable and sustainable in the long term, with the flexibility necessary to meet the varying requirements in different agroecosystems. The Less-Intensive Farming and Environment (LIFE) Project builds upon a sound base of ecological research aimed at understanding and optimizing the ecological interactions within the system, with effort focused on the need to resolve the conflicting requirements for control of pests, diseases and weeds and to minimize the environmental impact of crop production. The major consideration in this approach is the stepwise replacement of 'off-farm' inputs by integration of natural regulation processes, on-farm alternatives and management skills, in order to maintain species diversity, minimize pollution and losses, provide a safe and wholesome food supply, and to sustain income.

ID MAIZE; YIELD
AB One of the biggest challenges in the tropics is to develop organic matter technologies (OMT) which increase production, reduce risk and are taken up by farmers. An interdisciplinary team of researchers, extension staff and farmers addressed this challenge in southern Malawi. Two watersheds were identified as the primary unit of research, extension and development to test OMTs. This landscape-based approach provided the platform for interdisciplinary research and farmer-participatory, community based assessment of OMTs. The on-going process involves testing a menu of farmers' OMT recommendations and closely linked process research conducted in the field. The OMT with promise in the maize-dominated cropping system of the watersheds was relay intercropping of agroforestry species (Sesbania sesban and Tephrosia vogelii). Evaluation of OMT performance involved farmer assessment and biological evaluation. Farmer participatory methods included village group and individual semi-structured questionnaires, linear transect walks, and farmer-managed, researcher-designed trials. Biology included monitoring cropping system production, linked with soil nitrogen dynamics and watershed nutrient budgets to assess sustainability of OMTs. Nutrient budgets indicated that system productivity can be enhanced almost two-fold by addition of 30 N kg/ha N as an organic or inorganic source, and nutrient losses will be lowest with a combined OMT plus inorganic fertilizer technology. The poorest farmers with access to small, infertile fields tended to have sandy soils with low nitrate levels and limited growth of Sesbania. This reduced the benefit from relay OMT systems. These farmers may be candidates for more intensive use of grain legume intercrops and rotations, as benefits from the grain are needed by these food-insecure households, and will complement soil fertility amelioration.

AB In a previous study on the effects of N-supply on leaf cell elongation, the spatial distribution of relative cell elongation rates (RCER), epidermal cell turgor, osmotic pressure (OP) and water potential (Psi) along the elongation zone of the third leaf of barley was determined (W. Fricke et al. 1997, Planta 202: 522-530). The results suggested that in plants receiving N at fixed relative addition rates (N-supply limitation of growth), cell elongation was rate-limited by the rate of solute provision, whereas in plants growing on complete nutrient solution containing excessive amounts of N (N-demand limitation), cell elongation was rate-limited by the rate of water supply or wall yielding. In the present paper, these suggestions were tested further. The generation rates of cell OF, turgor and Psi along the elongation zone were calculated by applying the continuity equation of fluid dynamics to the previous data. To allow a more conclusive interpretation of results, anatomical data were collected and bulk solute concentrations determined. The rate of OF generation generally exceeded the rate of turgor generation. As a result, negative values of cell Psi were created, particularly in demand-limited plants. These plants showed highest RCER along the elongation zone and a Psi gradient of at least -0.15 MPa between water source (xylem) and expanding epidermal cells. The latter was similar to a theoretically predicted value (-0.18 MPa). Highest rates of OP generation were observed in demand-limited plants, with a maximum rate of 0.112 MPa.h(-1) at 16-20 mm from the leaf base. This was almost twice the rate in N-supply-limited plants and implied that the cells in the leaf elongation zone were capable of importing (or synthesising) every minute almost 1 mM of osmolytes. Potassium, Cl- and NO3- were the main inorganic osmolytes (only determined for demand-limited plants). Their concentrations suggest that, unlike the situation in fully expanded epidermal cells, sugars are used to generate OP and turgor. Anatomical data revealed that the zone of lateral cell expansion extended distally beyond the zone of cell elongation. It is concluded that leaf cell expansion in barley relies on high rates of water and solute supply, rates that may not be sustainable during periods of sufficient N-supply (limitation by water supply: Psi gradients) or limiting N-supply (limitation by solute provision: reduced OF-generation rates). To minimise the possibility of growth limitation by water and osmolyte provision, longitudinal and lateral cell expansion peak at different locations along the growth zone.

AB It is commonly hoped that technological innovation will sustain development and obviate the need for extensive socioeconomic change. Historically, free markets have increased the quantity of technological innovation, which has in turn enhanced economic growth. This article shows that market selection probably will not produce the technological innovation required to sustain development. Social structures and habitual practices also inhibit technological change, and market choices of technology could prevent ecologically efficient technological innovations. Only political direction of science and technology will optimize the contribution of technology to sustainable development. However, there is no theory or experience to act as a guide to policymaking. In addition, in the medium to long term, technology is indeterminate, selected by local process perturbations. This article suggests some policy directions for science and technology and argues that models borrowed from the life sciences may permit more effective government direction of the technology system.

AB Objectives. This study investigated factors related to the perceived sustainability of 189 heart health promotion interventions initiated by a public health department or research initiative and implemented in a variety of organizations across Canada.
   Methods. Data were collected in a telephone survey of key informants from schools, restaurants, grocery stores, health care facilities, and sports facilities that had implemented a heart health promotion intervention (risk factor screening, courses for smoking cessation, healthy eating or physical activity, support groups to promote healthy lifestyles, environmental modification, dissemination of information) in the past 8 years.
   Results. Overall, 43.6% of 189 interventions were perceived to be very permanent, 34.8% were somewhat permanent, and 21.5% were not permanent. Independent correlates of perceived sustainability included intervention used no paid staff (odds ratio (OR) 95% confidence interval (95% Cl) = 3.7 (1.8, 7.5)), intervention was modified during implementation (OR (95% Cl) = 2.7 (1.4, 5.0)), there was a good fit between the local provider and the intervention (OR (95% Cl) = 2.4 (1.2, 5.0)), and there was the presence of a program champion (OR (95% Cl) = 2.3 (1.2, 4.4)).
   Conclusion. Consideration of these factors by health promotion program planners could increase the potential for sustainability of health promotion interventions implemented in the community. (C) 1998 American Health Foundation and Academic Press.

AB Ever since the days of the horse-drawn carriage there has been concern about the consequences of traffic growth. But the arrival of the private motor vehicle, together with the expanding population, has created traffic problems on a vastly increased scale. Congestion, pollution, sustainability and safety are the problems which urgently require new solutions. However, there is no simple, uni universal answer and the problems have to be tackled in several different ways. One of the ways, as with the problems of the horse and carriage, will be the application of new technology and it is the emerging technologies on which this paper concentrates.

AB The Asia Alternative Energy Program (ASTAE) is a World Bank-donor initiative to support renewable energy and end energy efficiency investments in Asia. This article summarizes ASTAE's review of Solar Home System program experience in Indonesia, Sri Lanka, the Philippines and the Domiltican Republic. Successful photovoltaic (PV) market development for rural electrification requires removal of financial and institutional barriers. The authors emphasize the need to overcome the initial cost barrier Of Solar Home Systems, establish responsive and sustainable infrastructure and ensure quality products and services. This article also identifies the economic niche for PV use in comparison to traditional options, such as kerosene lanterns and extension of the grid. Major obstacles to the diffusion of off-grid electrication via PV ape discussed, along with recommended solutions and best practices. The authors have sought to apply these recommendations in design of the World Bank-assisted Sri Lanka Energy Services Delivery Project and the Solar Home Systems Project in Indonesia.

SO PROGRESS IN PHOTOVOLTAICS
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper describes the recently developed photovoltaic (PV) rural electrification programmes in the southeastern it stare of Minas Gerais, from their R&D and demonstration phases to the larger-scale applications projects. The PV technology potential in Minas Cer ais is consider able, based on the Inr Se population of consumers in rural and remote areas who are not, and cannot be, supplied from the state utility (CEMIG) grid even iir the long term. Based upon several successful demonstration projects, which have shown photovoltaics to be reliable and cost effective in rural areas, CEMIG;, together with the state and federal governments, has developed a PV rural electrification programme that is driven by quality-of-life improvement for the users. An important element of the programme is the access of low-income, rural consumers to essential electricity and potable water. Another feature is the inclusion of the users into the project at its inception to or der to foster, consumer buy-in/acceptance and to ensure the effectiveness of the programme. Added benefits of this approach have been the improvement of system design to specifically meet the consumers' needs, and the training of participants to guarantee sustainability, of the PV technology. The model for installation and maintenance is discussed including the social, legal and financial obstacles to deployment of the technology.
   Following the experience with these demonstration projects, a larger-scale PV rural electrification programme has been launched However, the sustainability of a successful PV rural electrification programme in Minas Gerais depends significantly oil the adopted model and strategies. The challenge for those working with the PV programmes is identifying all the interrelated aspects of market, technical, social and economic issues, as well as building up both the government and the user confidence in this new technology. Throughout this paper, the importance of community organization and inherent need of training is stressed for a successful programme. (C) 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Defining the extent to which environmental chemicals affect the functioning of the endocrine system and thereby contribute to adverse health effects in wildlife is a complex issue. This article provides an overview of case studies in invertebrates and vertebrates demonstrating alterations in aspects of growth, reproduction and development which have been attributed to exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs). The diversity of responses seen with these :studies highlights that there will be no single approach applicable to investigating endocrine disruption in wildlife and that understanding the cause and consequence of responses,in wildlife is complicated. There is uncertainty in a) making the link between measures of exposure to suspected EDCs and physiological effects, b) interpreting biochemical and physiological effects in relation to whole organism fitness, and c) relating the relevance of responses in the individual to ecologically significant measures such as population sustainability. There will be no short cuts when it comes to defining the risks posed by EDCs. This will be achieved by developing an increased understanding of the biology and physiology of wildlife sentinel species and utilizing epidemiological methodology applied to field monitoring and increased reliance on in vivo testing strategies.

AB The goal of sustainability in buildings can only hope to be realised if buildings are designed to both conserve and generate energy. The Solar Office at Doxford International is designed to minimise the use of energy while its external fabric is designed to replace such energy that is used. The recently completed building is now subject of a comprehensive monitoring programme. The programme covers both the performance of the 73 kW(p) photovoltaic installation and the environmental conditions within the building as a whole, Hour by hour findings are posted on a dedicated web site. Photovoltaics could have the same impact on building form and layout as the invention of the passenger lift at the end of the last century. (C) 1998 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB The paper deals with a problem that has been crucial in teaching and practising architectural design since the XVIII century, when the separation between the Academies and the Polytechnics denied the integration between art and science in architectural design. The question becomes more crucial today with the demands arising from the energy saving, environmental awareness and sustainability achievements. An analysis is proposed for focusing the reasons of such a separation and some interventions are suggested in order to improve the efficiency of a design process that composes architectures by means of architectures.

AB Women are the main producers of energy in developing countries and households are the main user of energy. Because gender roles and traditions have been largely ignored in energy, the global potential for renewable energy has been negatively affected. However, microcredit lending could fund sustainable development technology. This paper argues that renewable energy, gender roles, and microfinancing should be inherent pans of sustainable economic development programs. The relevant activities of pertinent development organizations and potential synergies are briefly described, the plans of the U.S. National Renewable Energy Laboratory to explore the gender issue are summarized, and the evolution of gender and energy as a field is addressed.

DT Article
DE tradition; patterns of design; climatic effects; geographical context;
   local/recyclable materials; built form; appropriate modernity
AB This paper discusses and analyses new buildings, inspired by traditional models of architecture, that propose energy savings and the use of local material revalidating the urban image of Chilean cities. However, as this paper demonstrates this adoption of traditional models, with their subsequent emphasis in ecological measures, such adoption is still intuitive and not a major principle of design. Therefore, isolated examples of modem buildings deal in an appropriate manner with their climatic and geographical context.
   This kind of urban development contradicts the image of the country, which has been perceived by the international community as one of the most emergent economies. Consequently, central and local governments know that they have to aim a more environmental development in order to balance an explosive, and sometimes uncontrolled, way of building our cities.
   The conclusions stress the importance of creating common patterns of design for achieving better performances of buildings, owing to the fact that traditional models have been inherited and already exist as valid references. Especially, if Chile is to pursue both economical and sustainable development. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Building is the end product of a design decision making process that starts at the board of an architect. Therefore, in order to make this process responsive to ecological context, which is the theme of this paper, the process must become scientific. The process presented in this paper developes a logical approach based on quantitative assessment leading to qualitative design decisions. A design tool, enabling decision making both at the conceptual and final stages of design, is developed and presented as a decision making matrix.
   Following the process, contemporary solutions in the form of designs for some projects designed by the author are presented.
   This approach is by no means inhibiting to architectural creativity and expression. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Located on "Bartolome Maso" municipality on the north part of "Sierra Maestra" in "Granma" province, the Scholar City "Camilo Cienfuegos", represents a paradigm of the real ideals of the Cuban Revolution related to education. The paper presents the results of a work developed by a team of professors and students of the Faculty of Architecture and Mechanic Engineering in the Polytechnic University of Havana (ISPJAE) in 1997, which includes a diagnosis of its current situation as a consequence of its historical development, and an strategy for its transformation into a sustainable city.
   The proposed strategy deals with economic and social sustainability, preservation of natural resources, energy conservation and appropriate technology, considered in 3 main concepts: Habitat city, Cultural city, and Sustainable city, which are finally integrated into a Solar City as a symbolic term. As part of the proposal, a Master Plan, urban and architectural design criteria and steps for the future development are presented. (C) 1998 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd-All rights reserved.

DE UK Landfill Tax; waste management
AB The UK Government in October 1996 introduced a Landfill Tax to ensure that landfill waste disposal is properly priced so as to reflect its environmental cost and to help promote a more sustainable approach to waste management in which less waste is produced, reused or recycled. The UK Customs and Excise have recently reviewed the tax and the report indicates that there has been a modest reduction in waste going to landfill by industry but not households. It is submitted that for there to be a significant move towards a more sustainable approach to waste management to meet the targets set in the National Strategy the tax should be higher and the money raised by the tax should be invested to make alternatives to landfill cheaper and more readily available. It is also submitted that the Tax Credit Scheme, introduced as a means of enabling some of the tax to be invested to promote better waste management, is inadequately funded and the money is inappropriately focused. Following an examination of the projects and contributions made under the Scheme it is found that most of the contributions are not made towards projects which will fulfil the UK Government's perceived purposes. It is further submitted that there needs to be a more rational approach to waste management and legislation in Philadelphia forms a good case study of such an approach. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

TI Gendered elements of the alternative agriculture paradigm
SO RURAL SOCIOLOGY

DT Article
ID LOCAL KNOWLEDGE; FARM; ADHERENCE; SCIENCE
AB The alternative agriculture paradigm has been a useful device to both define and direct a social movement toward a more sustainable agriculture. But because that paradigm was defined by male movement leaders, it reflects their gendered perspective and may be lacking elements that make it more useful for both women and men. In-depth interviews of women involved in sustainable farming organizations and on family farms experimenting with new practices validated the elements of the Beus and Dunlap paradigm: independence, decentralization, community, harmony with nature, diversity and restraint, but also suggested the addition of two other elements that the women identified as part of an alternative agriculture vision: quality family life and spirituality. The highly gendered nature of agriculture in the U.S. and Canada, where male identity is highly conflated with the role of farmer in the conventional paradigm, may make it more difficult for men who have just joined the movement to articulate the aspects of quality family life and spirituality which the women saw as critical.

TI Civil society and agricultural sustainability
SO SOCIAL SCIENCE QUARTERLY

ID DEBATE
AB Objective. We show how the civil society perspective can be used to understand the dynamics associated with agricultural sustainability. Methods. Using data from the 1987 and 1992 Censuses of Agriculture, we identify two groups of counties based on their changes in farm profitability, chemical resource use, and farm numbers. One group of counties shows increased profitability, decreased resource use, and stable or increasing farm numbers. The other group of counties falls on the opposite end of these dimensions. Residualized regression techniques and discriminant analysis are used. Results. Variables derived from civil society are related to agricultural sustainability, net of controls on farmer characteristics, farm location, and commodities. Over 85 percent of the counties in our study were correctly classified as sustainable or nonsustainable by using six civil society measures. Conclusions. Civil society posits that the pathway to agricultural sustainability is found in the size, scale, and organizational characteristics of farms and the social matrix in which these farms are embedded. Middle-size, family operations are more conducive to sustainable agricultural development than large-scale, corporate farms. Agricultural sustainability is more prevalent in areas with high levels of civic engagement.

AB What factors affect the design of an institutional framework for stakeholder management to promote sustainable outcomes for ports in urban settings? In examining this research question, we characterize urban harbors as complex common property resource systems (CPRs). Complex CPRs differ from simple CPRs in several ways that highlight the need for, but also the difficulties of, integrated management that promotes sustainable outcomes. We review the literatures on locational conflicts, corporate social responsibility, and comanagement for insights that bear on this problem. We then examine the port on the Otago Harbour as a case study in shifting institutional arrangements in a complex CPR, focusing on long-standing conflicts between the port company and the local community. Finally, we draw implications for the design of effective comanagement arrangements for ports located in dynamic and diverse communities.

AB Formation of low permeable crusts on Alfisols of semi-arid tropical India significantly affects runoff and erosion processes during rainstorms. The management options commonly used to reduce runoff are tillage and/or application of organic amendments. Daily runoff data from a field experiment conducted at International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics, Hyderabad, India, were analyzed to quantify the benefits of two different types of tillages (shallow tillage to a depth of 10 cm and deep tillage to a depth of 20 cm) and application of amendments (farmyard manure at 15 Mg ha(-1)yr(-1) and rice straw (Oryza sativa) at 5 Mg ha(-1)yr(-1)) using a no-till, unamended system as a control. The no-till system is discussed in detail in Part I. Runoff from tilled plots declined sharply after tillage operation and reverted back to that from an untilled plot after a few storms totalling about 150 mm of rainfall. Consequently, the effective period of tillage varied from 5 days in 1989, when a single storm of 115 mm rain occurred 5 days after tillage, to about 60 days during 1993 and 1994. Quantitative rainfall-runoff relationships were developed by dividing 633 rainfall-runoff events over 6 years into three groups, depending on time of occurrence: fallow period, from time of tillage operation to receipt of 150 mm of rain, and the remaining events during the cropping period after 150 mm of rain to crop harvest. More than 73% of the variation in runoff from bare and farmyard manure plots could be explained by either rainfall amount or by the product of rainfall amount and 30 min intensity. In addition, soil cover was important during the fallow period. Using the 5 min rainfall intensities, we found that runoff of tilled systems may be reduced from 35% to 10% of rainfall by adding straw. The implication is that organic amendments (such as straw or farmyard manure, if available) offer a sustainable way for Alfisols to maintain a high infiltration rate and, thereby, both reduce runoff and increase the amount of water available for crop production.

Considering water volumes less than or similar to 30 m(3)/day, appropriate disinfection methods include chlorination, slow sand filtration, ultraviolet (UV) radiation and pasteurization. Pretreatment with a coarse roughing filtration is generally used with the first three of these technologies to reduce turbidity and maintain high effectiveness. Cysts and worm eggs are resistant to chlorination and UV but can be filtered relatively easily. Chlorination is widely used and inexpensive but requires a continual supply of chemicals. Slow sand filtration is lowest in cost but requires high investment in labor. Household filtration using indigenous devices requires little capital investment but is relatively ineffective and difficult to properly maintain. Batch treatment with solar UV is very easy to implement but effectiveness in practice is uncertain since temperatures above 50 degrees C should be attained. UV lamp devices are inexpensive and easy to use but require power and access to maintenance infrastructure. Boiling of water requires no initial expense but fuel and labor costs are very high. Solar pasteurization devices (batch and flow-through) are effective and relatively maintenance-free, but existing products yield high treatment cost. Flow-through systems with selective Rat plate collectors become cost-competitive with UV technology at costs of about $380/m(2) and $80/m(2) for home-scale and village-scale use, respectively. These cost goals might be attained with polymer thin film designs if durability issues are adequately resolved. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB Geographic Information System is today a standard in different geodetic, geologic, energetic, geographic, ecological, arheologic, sociologic, building, military and even economic scientific researches. Well-developed countries of Western Europe, North America, Japan, Australia as well as the others, have accepted GIS as a modern basis of management and planning. In paper, the numerous examples of application of remote sensing implemented in GIS. The importance of creating active information system of natural resources, multidisciplinary approach to making decision on moves in managing the environment and importance of making central organisation for implementing the lasting management are being emphasised in the paper. The importance of application of geoinformation technologies is proved by a high confidence of tools for analysis of complex ecological features and by possibility of modelling - correlating the ecological data with the management. Special attention was paid to the definition of terms from the area of geoinformation technologies and ecological and economic terms, that are being used in sustainable environmental management. Two basic problems of applying geoinformation technologies in environmental management in Croatia are also mentioned initial investment and the lack of professionals. These principles will present basis for the future research and application in practice.

AB Background and Purpose-Previous research studying ablative lesions has suggested that functional use may exacerbate brain injury. If true, this would have considerable ramifications not only for the mechanistic understanding of neuronal injury but also for the clinical use of physiotherapy. In this report the hypothesis that behavioral use of brain tissue exacerbates ischemic hippocampal injury was tested.
   Methods-Gerbils were subjected to sham operation or 5 minutes of normothermic ischemia. To produce borderline hippocampal CA1 injury and enhance susceptibility to exacerbation, 2 of 3 ischemic groups were cooled (>48 hours) beginning at 6 hours after ischemia. Increased use of the hippocampus was produced by a battery of tests involving 3 novel small mazes, a T maze, and an open field. One hypothermic group was not tested and served as a control.
   Results-Behavioral testing failed to worsen ischemic damage since neuronal loss in the behaviorally tested and untested hypothermic groups was 12% and 8%, respectively, while that in the untreated ischemic group was 81% at a 1-month survival. Accordingly, protected CA1 cells tolerated the neuronal activity associated with behavioral testing. Concomitant with marked CA1 neuroprotection, a significant reduction in behavioral deficits with the hypothermic treatment was observed. Importantly, behavioral testing was found to transiently elevate brain temperature.
   Conclusions-CA1 neuronal survival was unaffected by behavioral testing or the associated mild fever. Hypothermia delayed for 6 hours provided sustainable CA1 neuroprotection.

AB Modern agriculture is unsustainable, largely because our overemphasis on production, and on its achievement through inappropriate physical, chemical and biological manipulation, has resulted in the neglect of maintenance functions within agroecosystems. This blind spot is one of a number that are indicators of our undeveloped and distressed psychosocial state. Only by including such factors in our systems analyses will it be possible to establish a truly sustainable agriculture and food system. (C) 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI World population growth and the role of annual energy use per capita
SO TECHNOLOGICAL FORECASTING AND SOCIAL CHANGE
LA English
DT Article
ID DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES; SUSTAINABILITY; DECLINE
AB Is there a sustainable solution for the world and the resources it needs to maintain a decent standard of living for everybody, at a population very much higher than today's? Clearly, there cannot be both a permanent growth in the use of materials and a sustainable future. In this article, the focus is on the possible coupling of the annual energy use per capita and the population growth rate for each region; and the consequences of such a connection if the world's population is to stabilize. Energy is used as a factor because it is a proactive agent in facilitating increases in the standard of living and changes in the social conditions which are believed to influence the fertility rate. Historical trends and near-term projections for energy use and population growth rate are used to indicate a possible path in the future for developing regions. Improvements in the efficiency of energy use and modest cultural changes are invoked in an example projection of coupled energy use and population growth For each decade, the incremental increase in annual commercial energy use per capita and a corresponding decrease in population growth rate are chosen to continue the historical trends for developing regions of the world. This approach leads to population changes following closely the projections of the World Bank for the period up to 2150. The world energy use is projected to rise from about 9000 million tonnes of oil equivalent today to 15,000 to 21,000 Mtoe/a by the time the world's population has risen from 6 billion to around 12 billion people in the 22nd century. The energy demands of each developing region are compared with potential, indigenous energy sources to see whether each developing region might be able to cope with its increased energy demand, without massive energy imports. It seems that the availability of easily moveable, cheap fuels, requiring the use of all energy sources, will be important to allowing the developing world to make the transition to a stable population with a decent standard of living.

TI Telelearning in health: A Canadian perspective
SO TELEMEDICINE JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
AB Objective: This project identified telelearning projects associated with the 13 established Canadian telehealth centers in order to describe the nature of their activities, outline enablers and barriers to these activities, and present key action plans to move the Canadian agenda on telelearning in health forward.
   Materials and Methods: Data were collected by a one-page questionnaire sent to the Canadian telehealth centers. Recipients were asked to identify current partners in such activities and to indicate if such partners should complete a separate questionnaire. Forty-nine questionnaires were distributed. Reported enablers, barriers, and action plans were placed in categories and analyzed. Data from 37 questionnaires, referencing 101 projects, formed the basis of the analysis.
   Results: More than half of the telelearning programs were developed for health providers, approximately one third for undergraduate or graduate students, and a small percentage for patients or the private sector. The most frequently used communication mode was two-way audio/video conferencing. Enabling conditions were grouped into four categories: Canada as a country, timing, infrastructure, and collaboration and support. Five categories of barriers were cited: lack of sustainable funding, insufficient infrastructure and resources for sustainable programs, absence of the required culture change, lack of standardization and defined policies, and unavailability of valid and reliable evaluation frameworks. Eight broad constructive action steps were suggested.
   Conclusions: The reported enablers can create momentum to carry telelearning into a position of prominence. The Canadian telehealth community recommends action steps that could facilitate the removal of barriers and maximize current opportunities.

SO TIME & SOCIETY
LA English
DT Article
DE commodification of time; long-term rationality; nonstop society;
   sustainable development; time as a resource
AB Through the ages, rime has been considered a gift from God - though it has always had to be used in an economical way. In the modern era, time came to be seen increasingly as the resource par excellence, and the equation 'time is money' was established. During the industrial revolution, this approach led to an enormous leap in growth and acceleration, brought about by the large-scale exploitation of carbon deposits accumulated over millions of years. Thus the conditions were created which enabled humans both to ignore the rhythms of nature and to attain the 'perpetual motion' and 'rest-lessness' of the nonstop society. Still, this 'theft of time' cannot be carried on endlessly since, in spite of technological progress, it undermines the conditions of possibility for future economic activity and is therefore not 'rational' in the long term, even from an economic point of view.

TI Excess or wasteful commuting in a selection of British cities

DT Article
DE excess commuting; urban form; British cities; linear programming;
   sustainability
ID URBAN
AB This research considers the application of an urban zonal travel optimisation model to the actual commuting patterns between residences and workplaces in a selection of large British cities in 1981 and 1991. The model produces an estimate of the average commuting distance required if individuals could exchange residences and workplaces to minimise distance travelled. The proportion of the actual commuting distance above the optimum is defined as excess or wasteful commuting. The existing literature has pointed to some reservations about this methodology. This research fuels this debate and for the first time the importance of inward commuting into the designated city is highlighted. The results indicate that it is the changing form of urban areas, which is exerting the strongest influence on the increasing length of work journeys. It is important to distinguish between intra-urban changes (where trip lengths have increased only slightly) and those outside the city boundaries. Within some cities, recent changes show that workplaces and residences have, on average, moved closer implying greater potential efficiency. Yet, comparing actual travel distance change with change in the theoretically optimum travel distance, it is clear that excess commuting has increased by reasonably significant fractions. On the other hand, when a wider view of the daily urban system is taken, it becomes apparent that the dominant role is being played by the wider decentralisation of employees. This results in increases in average travel distances but these can be shown to be less than the increases in the theoretically optimum average distances which result if travel distances are minimised. The clear effect is for excess commuting to decline in almost all cities over the decade, and sometimes by significantly large amounts. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The form of a city has a major impact on the lifestyles of its residents. As urban centers grow, careful strategies are required to ensure that the regional quality of life is not adversely affected by this growth. An important strategic consideration is transportation planning. Questions regarding the sustainability of dispersed car dependent urban forms have led to a renewed interest in public transportation. This paper examines access to public transportation and discusses approaches for improving such access. Examples from the South East Queensland region of Australia will be used for illustration.

TI Institutional capacity building for water sector development
SO WATER INTERNATIONAL
LA English
DT Article
AB Capacity building is foremost a global concept and a strategic element in the sustainable development of the water sector. This is a long-term continuing process that needs to permeate all activities in the sector. In developing countries, experience shows that institutional weakness and malfunctions are a major cause of ineffective and unsustainable water services. Urgent attention needs to be given to build institutional capacity at all levels. Pressure for improved local delivery of water services suggests that development of institutional capacity should be more demand-responsive. The need to better manage overall water resources coherently and to facilitate allocation of water among all users requires an expansion of national integrated planning. The critical institutional challenge is the development of policies, rules, organizations and management skills which address both needs simultaneously without constraining the major aims of each. It must be recognized that each country and region has its specific characteristics and requirements with respect to its water resources situation and ifs institutional framework Therefore, operational strategies for water sector capacity building must be tailor-made. Such strategies should be long term, having the main objectives of improving the quality of decision making, and sector efficiency of managerial performance in the planning and implementation of water sector programmes and projects. This paper covers the capacity building issue for wafer resources development and management. The institutional and human resources issues as well as building marginal capabilities in developing countries receive particular emphasis.

   EARNINGS
AB The Bolivian Social Investment Fund (SIF) is a financial institution that promotes sustainable investments in the social sectors, principally in the areas of health, education, and sanitation. This article shows how to use preintervention data collected for evaluating the SIF to improve the targeting of a program, to test the quality of the evaluation design, and to define corrective measures if necessary. It finds that among SIF interventions the benefits in education are distributed relatively equally over the population, while the investments in health and sanitation favor better-off communities.
   The article contributes to the methods used to evaluate social investment funds and similar programs. It compares two types of evaluation designs to assess social investment fund interventions in the education sector. The authors demonstrate that a simple matched-comparison design introduces a bias in the estimate of the program effect, whereas an experimental design based on random assignment does not. With preintervention data, the analyst can select a quasi or indirect experiment, where the choice of the indirect experiment coincides with the selection of valid instrumental variables. The availability of preintervention data makes it possible to compare the two types of evaluation designs as well as to test the validity of the instruments and to determine the loss of efficiency due to the use of quasi-experimental techniques instead of random treatment assignment.

TI Sustainable agriculture or sustained error? The case of cotton in
   Kirinyaga, Kenya
SO WORLD DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB Ignoring historical information is one of the major sources of error in development planning. Much can be learned about what works and what does not by examining unsuccessful interventions. This paper uses archival and ethnographic data to examine the very troubled history of cotton in Kirinyaga District, Kenya. It compares the crop's introduction and failure during the 1930s under British colonial rule with its later disappointing promotion by the independent Kenyan government in the 1960s and 1970s. The paper seeks to analyze how and why errors can arise, become embedded, and proliferate in agricultural development efforts. The paper also explores why planners sometimes have difficulties appreciating lessons from the past, especially those from colonial times. The paper calls for planners to redouble their efforts to learn from historical information. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. ALL rights reserved.

AB Membrane technology is a still evolving technology that finds more and more applications in food and non-food processing. Compared with food industries, the introduction of membrane technology in other branches is relatively slow. This slow introduction may be related to the special requirements in this particular industry. However, newly developed membranes and process engineering breakthroughs will facilitate the further incorporation of membrane technology in industry. The need for sustainability gives rise to an extra driving force for further developments. In combination with bio technology, integrated 'membrane-biotechnology', so far unattainable, products can be manufactured. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. AU rights reserved.

ID MALAYSIA; FORESTS
AB In East Kalimantan (Indonesia), impacts of conventional (CNV) and reduced-impact logging (RTL) on forest ecosystems were compared on the basis of pre- and post-harvesting stand inventories. There was a positive and significant correlation between the proportion of trees damaged by felling and the density of trees felled. Logging intensity ranged from 1 to 17 trees ha(-1) (9-247 m(3) ha(-1)) and averaged 9 trees ha(-1) (86.9 m(3) ha(-1)). The study has shown that with RIL techniques, logging damage on the original stand can be significantly reduced by 50% compared with conventional logging. However, this 50% reduction in logging damage, was dependent on the felling intensity. With a felling intensity of 8 stems ha(-1) or less, RIL techniques only damaged 25% of the original tree population whereas 48% were damaged with conventional techniques. Above this felling intensity (i.e. 8 stems ha(-1)), the effectiveness of RIL in limiting forest damage was significantly reduced, mainly because of the increasing felling damage. Moreover, the removal of all harvestable timber trees, leaving only few potential crop trees, will result in a seriously depleted residual stand. Because of the high damage involved by high felling intensity, leaving few potential crop trees, and the yield capacity of the remaining stand, acceptable harvesting volume will not be reached within the felling rotation of 35 years. It is concluded that silvicultural system based on diameter limit alone, as is the Indonesian system (TPTI), cannot be compatible with sustainability and more sophisticated harvested-selection rules are needed.

AB Caddo Lake, USA, a Ramsar Wetland of International Importance, is a lacustrine wetland complex consisting of stands of flooded baldcypress intermixed with open water and emergent wetland habitats. Recently, concern has been expressed over a perceived increase in the beaver population and the impact of beaver on the long-term sustainability of the baldcypress ecosystem. We used intensive beaver lodge surveys to determine the distribution and relative abundance of beaver and the amount, type, and distribution of beaver damage to mature trees and seedlings at Caddo Lake. A total of 229 lodges were located with a combination of aerial and boat/ground surveys. Most lodges were located in open water and edge habitats. About 95% of the lodges were occupied by beaver or nutria. Some form of damage was exhibited by one or more trees near 85% of the lodges. Intensive damage assessments around 35 lodges indicated that most damage to trees, baldcypress in particular, was restricted to peeling or stripping of bark which is believed to have minimal effect on tree survival. Surveys of regeneration indicated that baldcypress seedlings were very abundant; however, over 99.9% were less than 30 cm tall. The lack of recruitment into the larger size classes appears to be a result of high stand densities and water management practices. At this time, the young age and density of the baldcypress forests suggest that recruitment is not a major concern and herbivore damage appears to be having a minimal effect on the forest.

DT Article
AB Sustainable use is a current theme of prime importance for better utilization of natural resources, through rational and responsible multiple-use management. Synoptic and repetitive coverage provided by orbiting satellites have opened up immense possibilities in terms of resource mapping, monitoring and management. The present study deals with the application of Remote Sensing and Geographic Information System (GIS) technologies in the study of coastal ecology with special reference to mangroves. The coastal wetland ecology of Muthupet and Pichavaram has been studied by considering the changes in wetlands. Wetland maps were prepared on 1 :25,000 scale using high resolution SPOT (for the year 1989) and IRS LISS II data (for the years 1990,and 1996), Changes in coastal wetland ecology were studied by integrating remote sensing data with GIS. In Muthupet, about 86.77 m(2) of the mangrove forest have been reduced over a period of 7 years (1989 to 1996). Digital analysis of 1986 Landsat TM and 1993 IRS LISS II data showed that 0.36 km(2) area of mangrove in Pichavaram was lost over a period of 7 years. Ground-based spectral measurements of different mangrove species using field spectroradiometer showed highest spectral radiance between 0.7 and 1.1 mu m using radiometer of MSS bands and highest spectral reflectance in 0.69-0.86 mu m regions of IRS and TM band which could be used in identifying mangrove forest from other vegetation. In Andaman and Nicobar islands the total mangrove area is about 762 km(2) and degradation occurred only in very small pockets (up to 2.379 km(2)).

DT Article
AB The sustainable forestry programmes implemented through micro-level planning have been gaining momentum showing a transition from traditional forest management to people's participatory programmes. The critical evaluation and assessment of the existing resources at the micro-level demands a high degree of spatial accuracy and consideration of causative factors. To ensure perpetual supply of forest produce in meeting the growing demand of the local people, primarily for fuelwood and fodder, a careful planning is essential. The planning and evaluation has been achieved by spatial integration with the non-spatial attributes obtained through remote sensing and other sources, The joint forest management area identification and progressive growth aspects, both in terms of supply potential and demand on resource, have been ably modelled in geographical information system. The scenarios for the next 25 and 50 years forecasting the fuelwood and fodder sustainability have also been assessed. The study brought out the use of Spatial Resource Dynamic Growth Model in micro-planning for sustainable forestry.

AB The Twenty-One project brings together environmental organisations, technology providers and research institutes from several European countries. The main objective of the project is to make documents on environmental issues-in particular, on the subject of sustainable development-available on CD-ROM and on the Internet. At present, these documents exist on different media (paper, electronic documents, audio-visual material), in different formats (HTML, word processor) and in different languages. This diversity impedes the distribution of documents through normal channels, and makes it hard to search for and retrieve targeted material on specified subjects. The project is developing search engines that can locate required information, and uses automatic translation tools to make foreign-language texts available. Authors and editors gain economic advantages by the increased distribution of their documents, and users find documents more readily available and easily accessible. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

ID DIVERSIFICATION
AB Rural development has received renewed attention, particularly in the West, where there are opportunities for enhancing tourism in communities once reliant on extractive resources. The historical focus of rural development has been on economic growth, with little concern about the sustainability or socioeconomic impacts of such growth. This study analyzes and discusses the employment dynamics of rural economies with varying employment bases to illustrate some possible impacts of targeting specific employment sectors as part of a rural economic development strategy. The empirical research focuses on the rural counties of Utah, where the trade and service sectors associated with increased tourism and retirement communities have been rapidly expanding throughout the past two decades.

AB This review describes household dietary strategies to improve the content and bioavailability of zinc in predominantly plant-based diets and the implementation of these strategies in a community-based dietary intervention study in rural southern Malawi. The strategies involve increasing intakes of foods with high bioavailable-zinc contents, absorption enhancers, or both and using germination, Fermentation, and soaking: to reduce intake of phytic acid, a potent inhibitor of zinc absorption. The strategies were implemented at the household level in Malawi through a participatory research process that focused on building relationships with the community and involving them in the design, implementation, and monitoring and evaluation processes. In this way, community participation and awareness of zinc deficiency might be enhanced and the dietary strategies planned will be appropriate and sustainable.

AB Because trace minerals are important not only for human nutrition but for plant nutrition as well, plant breeding holds great promise for making a significant, sustainable, low-cost contribution to the reduction of micronutrient deficiencies in humans. It may also have important spinoff effects for increasing farm productivity in developing countries in an environmentally beneficial way. This article describes ongoing plant breeding research that could increase the intake of bioavailable zinc from food staple crops in vulnerable populations in developing countries. The 3 most promising plant breeding strategies toward this goal are as follows: Ij increasing the concentration of zinc, 2) reducing the amount of phytic acid (a strong inhibitor of zinc absorption), and 3) raising the concentrations of sulfur-containing amino acids (thought to promote zinc absorption) in the plant. The agronomic advantages and disadvantages as well as the potential benefits and limitations of each approach for human nutrition are described. Research is currently underway to identify the optimal combination of these approaches that will maximize the effect on human zinc nutrition.

TI Economic complexity as network complication: Multiregional input-output
   structural path analysis
SO ANNALS OF REGIONAL SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
ID ACCOUNTING MATRIX FRAMEWORK; MULTIPLIERS; TRADE; SYSTEMS; GROWTH
AB This paper presents a description of some fundamental properties of networks of economic selfinfluence and transfer of economic influence within hierarchies of economic sub-systems using structural path analysis within a multiregional input-output system. In this fashion, exchange between sectors, activities and regions is viewed as a network that can be decomposed hierarchically; economic complexity is viewed as an emerging property of the process of network complication that accompanies the augmentation of inputs and the growing synergetic interactions between regional sub-systems. For the reasons of clarity, the cases of two and three regions are considered in detail. The treatment of the general case of n regions and the graph-theoretical description of the global augmentation process of the network complication is presented in two appendices, where the mathematical proofs can be found. It is expected that this analysis will provide a methodology that will be useful in understanding regional economic sustainability (i.e., spatial and temporal invariability), structural stability and structural changes in economic networks as well as providing insights into the role of internal and external trade between regions. To support this expectation,the detailed theoretical analysis of the block structural paths in the social. accounting system is presented supplemented by economic analysis of the Indonesian social accounting matrices for 1975, 1980 and 1985.

AB The cultured freshwater crayfish Cherax destructor Clark has the largest distribution of any freshwater crayfish species in Australia. This study presents preliminary data on intraspecific variation in reproductive traits of C. destructor obtained from three populations under indoor hatchery conditions. Clutch size, measured as pleopodally attached eggs, and brood size, measured as newly independent juveniles, were positively correlated with crayfish weight. ANCOVA indicated significant differences between populations and between clutch and brood size. Based on size adjusted means, clutch size ranged from 360.6 to 593.4 and brood size from 311.4 to 384.5. Average brood size was 22.6% lower than average clutch size, Development time also differed amongst populations and was negatively correlated with temperature. Temperature adjusted mean development time ranged from an a minimum of 33.4 days to a maximum of 42.2 days. A strong inverse relationship between clutch/brood size and development time further highlighted the extent of life history differences amongst the crayfish populations. The implications of the increasing evidence for significant intraspecific variability within commercial species of Cherax in relation to aquaculture research and sustainable aquaculture are discussed.

AB This study reports results from a randomized controlled intervention trial, focusing on: (1) the identification of successful consumer strategies for increasing fruit and vegetable intakes to the recommended levels of more than five (80 g) portions per day and (2) impact on overall diet and nutrient intakes. Adult men and women (n 170) fulfilling the main recruitment criterion of eating less than five fruit and vegetable portions per day but contemplating increasing intakes were recruited. Complete valid dietary data was provided by 101 intervention (fifty-nine estimated fruit and vegetable intakes, and forty-two simultaneous weighed total dietary and estimated fruit and vegetable intakes) and twenty-four control subjects (weighed total dietary intakes). Intervention advice included the specific association of high fruit and vegetable intake with reduced risk of disease, practicalities, and portion definition with a target intake of greater than five 80g fruit and vegetable portions per day for 8 weeks. There were significant effects (P < 0.001) on weighed intakes of fruit and vegetables in the intervention group, rising from 324 (SE 25) to 557 (SE 31) g/d and reflected by validated portion measures at 8 weeks intervention. Successful strategies chosen by 'achievers' of the target intake (65 % of subjects) were conventional (fruit as a snack, vegetables with main meals etc.) and favoured fruit. There were significant increases in percentage energy from carbohydrate (from sugars not starch), vitamin C, carotenes and NSP and there was a significant decrease in percentage energy from fat for subjects who had high fat intakes (>35 % energy) at baseline. Follow-up self-reported measures at 6 and 12 months indicated mean intakes of 4.5 and 4.6 defined portions/d respectively, suggesting some sustainable effect. In conclusion, the intervention led to significant increases in fruit and vegetable intakes largely via conventional eating habits, with some desirable effects on macro- and micronutrient intakes.

AB This paper shows that the Hartwick rule for sustainable utility with depletable resources still applies to the case of the greenhouse effect from fossil fuel carbon emissions. Although a carbon tax is necessary, for sustainable utility it is sufficient that the sum of net energy rents and carbon tax revenues is invested in reproducible capital. Examination of recent savings rates and energy cost shares suggests that this may be difficult to achieve with current global savings rates.

AB Mortality caused by harvesting can select for life history changes in the harvested stock. Should this possibility be taken into account in the management of renewable resources? I compare the performance of different harvest strategies when evolutionary change is accounted for with the help of an age-structured population dynamics model. Assuming that age of first reproduction is the only evolving trait, harvesting of only mature individuals selects for delayed maturation and results in increased sustainable yields. Unselective harvesting of both mature and immature fish selects for earlier maturation which causes the sustainable yield to decrease. Constant stock size and constant harvest rate strategies perform equally well in terms of maximum sustainable yield, both before and after evolutionary change. The maximum sustainable yield for fixed-quota strategies is lower. All those strategies have similar evolutionary consequences given a similar average harvest rate. Coevolutionary dynamics between fish stock and the stock manager indicate that the evolutionary benefits of selective harvesting are attainable without incurring yield losses in the near future.

AB The Environmental Policy Integrated Climate (EPIC) model is an important support tool for environmental management. Previous tests of the model have determined that it is suitable for long-term yield estimation, but it is less precise in assessing annual yield variability. To determine the reasons for the discrepancies between estimated and measured yields, we tested the ability of EPIC version 5300 to predict soil water and soil nitrogen dynamics, using data from a long-term spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) rotation experiment in the semiarid prairie region of Canada. Potential evapotranspiration (PET) estimates varied among methods tested: Priestley-Taylor and Penman-Monteith methods resulted in PET means that were about twice those obtained with the Hargreaves and Baier-Robertson methods. The higher PET means were associated with an excessive estimation of net radiation. We used the Baier-Robertson method to generate the other estimates reported herein. EPIC generally overestimated total soil water, but it still allowed clear differentiation among rotation phases and times of the year, and provided adequate estimates of water during the critical shot-blade stage. Water estimates by soil layer were also generally overpredicted, especially at depths from 0.15 to 0.60 m, but we were able to differentiate among rotation phases and times of the year. Precision of these latter estimates was generally low, accounting at most for 27% of the variability, and varied by soil layer, rotation phase and time of the year. Nitrate-N estimates. tended to be lower than measured values, especially at depths below 0.3 m and during vegetative growth phases. However, the estimates also allowed us to distinguish among the rotation phases and times of the year. Total N and organic C were satisfactorily estimated by EPIC. In general, EPIC provided adequate long-term estimates of the environmental quality indicators tested.

TI Sustainable development and the global economy - Rhetorical implications

SO COMMUNICATION RESEARCH

DT Article
AB The discourse of sustainable development represents a consensus between environmental conservation and industrial use. The United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED) that was held in the summer of 1992 attempted to initiate sustainable development policies aimed at improving the quality of human life. The major focus of UNCED was on the 400-page Agenda 21 and its initiatives for sustainable development practices and quality-of-life improvement. This article looks at the language contained in Agenda 21 and analyzes the quality-of-life phrase used throughout the text. The analysis follows insights of Burke's theory of dramatism, which contends that language functions symbolically to reinforce and maintain political power. The analysis illustrates how Agenda 21 both uses the quality-of-life phrase to promote consumerism and consumption and neglects to profile serious environmental protection.

DE GPS; guidance; simulation; agricultural implements
AB High quality and sustainable agricultural production in the open field will be supported by centimetre-precision guidance of agricultural implements. In this paper, a complete guidance system is proposed and simulated using real sensor data obtained from a real time kinematic (RTK) differential global positioning system (DGPS). This type of the satellite navigation system became available commercially in 1997 and is claimed to reach cm accuracy. It uses real time kinematics to improve the accuracy df a position fix by phase comparison of the carrier signal. The simulation primarily aims to investigate the accuracy of the guidance system that can be obtained with RTK DGPS. Using real DGPS measurement errors the simulated system showed a tracking error less than 0.005 m when the PLD-controller had settled. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Food produced in ecological agriculture becomes popular more and more. In the interest of consumers (to protect against deception) and of producers (to contrast with conventionally produced food) it is necessary to define the conditions and circumstances when products can be declared as ecological. Up to now definitions of housing and feeding animals in organic agriculture only are set up by private organizations and associations, but in the future we will have a direction of the European community (Nr. 2092/91 EWG), extended by directives and restrictions focussed on animal husbandry and feeding. Aim of this contribution is to give information on special restrictions on feeds and feeding of food producing animals in organic agriculture (preconditions in the case that labelling as,,ecologically produced" is intended). Conventionally produced feed-stuffs are restricted, common complete diets and some special feed additives (for example growth promoters) are not allowed. Feeding according to species specific requirements (herbivorous animals) as well as according to age and development (for example minimum duration of suckling periods) is intended. On the other hand there is a conscious renunciation of maximizing animals' performance (and plant yields). Consequences, risks and conflicts of different aims in feeding in accordance with ideas of organic agriculture are discussed. Various efforts at sustainability of conventional agriculture are influenced markedly by ideas and concepts established in organic agriculture primarily.

AB A wide range of ecological and human crises result from inadequate access to, and the inappropriate management of, freshwater resources. These include destruction of aquatic ecosystems and extinction of species, millions of deaths from water-related illnesses, and a growing risk of regional and international conflicts over scarce, shared water supplies. As human populations continue to grow, these problems are Likely to become more frequent and serious. New approaches to long-term water planning and management that incorporate principles of sustainability and equity are required and are now being explored by national and international water experts and organizations. Seven "sustainability criteria" are discussed here, as part of an effort to reshape long-term water planning and management. Among these principles are guaranteed access to a basic amount of water necessary to maintain human health and to sustain ecosystems, basic protections for the renewability of water resources, and institutional recommendations for planning, management, and conflict resolution. "Backcasting" a positive future vision of the world's water resources as a tool, for developing rational policies and approaches for reducing water-related problems is also discussed in the context of the Comprehensive Freshwater Assessment prepared for the United Nations General Assembly in 1997.

AB The ecosystems of South Florida are unique and highly valued by society. Explosive population growth this century has made the Everglades one of our nation's most endangered ecosystems. The dominant anthropogenic stressor is hydrological modifications instituted to provide flood protection for land selected for agriculture and urban development. Thus, major redesign of the hydrologic system is essential if the Everglades and associated coastal ecosystems of South Florida are to be restored and sustained. Following conceptual frameworks developed for ecological risk assessment, ecological sustainability, and ecosystem management, the U.S. Man and the Biosphere Human-Dominated Systems Directorate has conducted a project on ecosystem management in South Florida. An extremely complex hierarchy of federal, state, and local governmental activities presently underway is directed toward a sustainable South Florida. The scientific community is playing a significant role in this process, but the success or failure of ecosystem management for South Florida is still uncertain. If ecosystem management can result in a sustainable South Florida, this will be a prototype for environmental decision making through the next century.

AB Education is most effective when coupled to discovery, and discovery is most rewarding when coupled to education. To integrate these with decision making, a strong and flexible feedback loop should be nourished between the generation of information and its use. Scientific uncertainty is only one of many drivers and limits to freshwater decision makers. Freshwater decision makers need interdisciplinary, transferable, comprehensive-scale studies. The expense of these studies, and institutional barriers, tip the balance of work toward smaller studies that must be integrated after the fact. A number of ongoing efforts hold promise for the integration of research, education, and decision making.

AB Commercial fishing is one of the most important human impacts on the marine benthic environment. One such impact is through disturbance to benthic habitats as fishing gear (trawls and dredges) are dragged across the seafloor. While the direct effects of such an impact on benthic communities appear obvious, the magnitude of the effects has been very difficult to evaluate. Experimental fishing-disturbance studies have demonstrated changes in small areas; however, the broader scale implications attributing these changes to fishing impacts are based on long-term data and have been considered equivocal. By testing a series of a priori predictions derived from the literature (mainly results of small-scale experiments), we attempted to identify changes in benthic communities at the regional scale that could be attributed to commercial fishing.
   Samples along a putative gradient of fishing pressure were collected from 18 sites in the Hauraki Gulf, New Zealand. These sites varied in water depth from similar to 17 to 35 m and in sediment characteristics from similar to 1 to 48% mud and from 3 to 8.5 mu g chlorophyll alpha/cm(3). Video transects were used for counting large epifauna and grab/suction dredge and core sampling were used for collecting macrofauna. After accounting for the effects of location and sediment characteristics, 15-20% of the variability in the macrofauna community composition sampled in the cores and grab/suction dredge samples was attributed to fishing. With decreasing fishing pressure we observed increases in the density of echinoderms, long-lived surface dwellers, total number of species and individuals, and the Shannon-Weiner diversity index. In addition, there were decreases in the density of deposit feeders, small opportunists, and the ratio of small to large individuals of the infaunal heart urchin, Echinocardium australe. The effects of fishing on the larger macrofauna collected from the grab/suction dredge samples were not as clear. However, changes in the predicted direction in epifaunal density and the total number of individuals were demonstrated. As predicted, decreased fishing pressure significantly increased the density of large epifauna observed in video transects. Our data provide evidence of broad-scale changes in benthic communities that can be directly related to fishing. As these changes were identifiable over broad spatial scales they are likely to have important ramifications for ecosystem management and the development of sustainable fisheries.

AB The economic development path favoured by mainstream politicians and economists is one of 'business land consumption) as usual', albeit with increased efficiency in resource use and with regulation and market-based incentives to temper undesirable environmental effects. Such technocratic environmental intervention is an inadequate tool for achieving sustainability and fails to recognise that environmental problems are an ethical, as much as an institutional, issue. Their solution lies in changing personal moral values as much as in institutional action. The sustainable development debate focuses attention on the need for modern society to adopt a new metaphysical attitude to match ecological reality in its promotion of human progress. Cultural heritages may be a starting point for the task of cultivating an ethical obligation towards the natural environment. Different cultures embody alternatives to modernist ways of interacting with social and natural environments. If cultural heritages have a role in establishing an environmental ethic for today, it is necessary to examine whether particular cultural traditions are conducive to ecologically sensitive behaviour and to what extent there is congruity between traditional cultural prescriptions and actual current behaviour. To do this, the paper contrasts European and Chinese heritages. A persuasive thesis has been developed that modern environmentally destructive tendencies in science, economics and public policy have deep historical roots in Western religious and philosophical tradition, suggesting that recourse to traditional ethics in the West would do nothing to mitigate unsustainability. By contrast, there is much in traditional Chinese culture which suggests a relationship between people and nature resonant of contemporary environmental ideals. Yet, the link between cultural tradition and current economic behaviour is clearly not a robustly deterministic one, since destructive processes are now taking place against this cultural background despite its clear behavioural norms aimed at harmony and moral well-being rather than at more utilitarian goals. If the European cultural heritage is ecologically insensitive and others are not resilient to Eurocentric materialism, what are the economic implications? Most optimistically, there is a clear emergence of a Leopoldian 'land ethic' in the West, which combats the current promotion of irresponsible technological civilisation inspired by an obsolete world view, sets up a moral challenge to the legitimacy of the currently dominant view of economic development, is changing public policy and popular culture and, in time, promises a new ecologically benign postmodernism in economic policy making.

AB In order to understand the context for sustainable development policies it is necessary to understand the different rates of evolution and velocities of change within social and ecological systems. These different rates of change are important for the interaction and co-evolution of these systems. Only when we understand the sustainable development of not only separate, interdependent or nested systems in a global hierarchy, but their very different but interrelated rates and paths of development and evolution,will sustainable development policy be fruitful.

DT Article
AB Lotteries, casinos, and other forms of gambling are being promoted by state and local governments as painless ways to raise revenues. Supporters often rely on economic studies sponsored by the industry. Critics contend that gambling is problematic and not a substitute for sustainable economic development, and the public remains ambivalent. Bills currently pending in Congress would establish a national commission to study the impact of gambling. Long-term health of communities requires the promotion of well-researched and well-reasoned policies on legal gambling and economic development.

TI 'Struggling with sustainability': weak and strong interpretations of
   sustainable development within local authority policy
SO ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING A
LA English
DT Article
ID PLANNING SYSTEM; ENVIRONMENT
AB In recent years there has been a growing interest in sustainable development as a guiding principle to allow the integration of economic development and the environment within policy and strategy. At all levels of policymaking a major emphasis has been placed upon the local scale as the most appropriate for the delivery of such policies and initiatives, with a particular stress upon local authorities as the major delivery mechanism. Though it is often assumed that this integration is relatively unproblematic, this paper indicates that this is not the case. The paper draws upon research with urban local authorities in England and Wales, which reveals that there are varying interpretations of the environment within local authorities, reflecting environmental and economic development perspectives. In each case, however, these are effectively interpretations which tend towards the 'weak' end of a sustainability spectrum and it is suggested that such divergent interpretations of sustainability are hindering integrative activity and the potential for introducing 'strong' sustainability measures.

ID SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT; CONSUMPTION; MEANINGS; VALUES; AGENDA; MEDIA
AB This paper presents a comparative analysis of how representatives from the public, private, and voluntary sectors of two cities [Nottingham (United Kingdom) and Eindhoven (The Netherlands)] responded to the challenge of communicating more effectively with citizens about issues of sustainability. The analysis is set in the context of literature about the need to widen participation in the determination of Local Agenda 21 policies, and the drive for more inclusionary forms of communication in planning and politics. Workshop members discussed the results of surveys and in-depth discussion groups with local residents which had revealed considerable scepticism and mistrust of environmental communications and environmental expertise. Three themes are explored. First, there is consensus in attributing responsibility for public alienation and resistance to environmental communications to the content and styles of media reporting. Second, there are contrasting discursive constructions of the 'public', which reflect different political cultures-with the Nottingham workshop supporting a strategy to share power and knowledge more widely than hitherto, whereas the Eindhoven strategy proposed greater rigour, clarity, and authority from the local state. Third, responding to evidence of public resistance to calls for more sustainable practices, workshop participants in both cities focused on what institutions themselves can and should do to progress environmental goals. Workshop participants in both countries acknowledged the urgent need for public, private, and voluntary sector organisations to match their own practices to their environmental rhetoric.

SO ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING C-GOVERNMENT AND POLICY

ID POLICY
AB Urban policies which include energy and environmental objectives are seen as potentially effective instruments in the quest for urban sustainability, Recent consensus is that the modern city region forms an important focal point for assessment and implementation of energy strategies, facilitating practical solutions to local problems as well as providing beneficial additions to national policies. Reducing the carbon intensity of economies both prevents environmental degradation and supports the regional economy in the medium to long term. The authors look at the construction of a CO, inventory for the Greater Manchester region, an urban conurbation set for economic growth after recent restructuring and diversification. The authors argue that, by providing an indication of the localised carbon flows specific to the region, it is possible to target problem areas, prioritise carbon-reduction strategies, and recommend policies that will ease the transition to a more sustainable urban settlement. The increased focus on finding 'local' solutions to the reduction of carbon intensity has coincided with privatisation of much of the energy industry. The newly competitive energy market conflicts with the shift to local-scale evaluations and has resulted in energy details at the regional level becoming increasingly harder to obtain. The problems experienced in the construction of this inventory will be common to other cities in the United Kingdom and will have to be addressed if the 'local' approach is to be as effective as is hoped.

AB Holmes Rolston's case for holding that it is sometimes right to let people starve in order to save nature is argued to be inconclusive at best; some alternative responses to population growth are also presented. The very concept of development implies that authentic development, being socially and ecologically sustainable, will seldom conflict with saving nature (sections 1 and 2). While Rolston's argument about excessive capture of net primary product is fallacious, his view should be endorsed about the wrongness of 'development' in areas where sustainable development is impossible, but not unqualifiedly endorsed about those areas where it is feasible (section 3). Important as policies promoting sustainable levels of population are, representing population growth as a cancer is misguided, and could engender indifference to suffering (sections 4 and 5). The neo-Malthusian paradigm (which makes population growth the cause of both poverty and environmental degradation) appears to conflict with a considerable body of empirical evidence; the kind of policies needed in Third World countries are ones which enlist people's energies for producing food and preserving nature alike (section 6).
