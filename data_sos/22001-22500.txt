AB Various deterministic mathematical programming models were developed to evaluate single objective or multiple objectives planning alternatives for municipal solid waste management. The common objective of minimizing the present value of overall management cost/benefit was extended to deal explicitly with environmental considerations, such as air pollution, traffic flow limitation, and leachate and noise impacts. But uncertainty plays an important role in the search for sustainable solid waste management strategies. This paper proposes a new approach - a fuzzy interval multiobjective mixed integer programming (FIMOMIP) model - for the evaluation of management strategies for solid waste management in a metropolitan region. In particular, it demonstrates how uncertain messages can be quantified by specific membership functions and combined through the use of interval numbers in a multiobjective analytical framework.

AB The ability to predict long-term plant-availability of soil P provides an additional management tool for sustainable agriculture. Our objective is to present a methodology using P fractionation data for predicting long-term plant-availability of soil P. Soil samples were collected (0-30 cm) in 1975, 1985, and 1992 from two continually cropped field trials. Soils were a Norfolk loamy sand and a Davidson clay loam, two Ultisols from North Carolina, USA. Four rates of P were applied from 1975 to 1986, and subsequently discontinued. The relationships between the resin and inorganic NaHCO3 fractions, and between the inorganic NaHCO3 and NaOH fractions, indicated that some level of equilibrium appeared to exist between these three fractions of soil P. Given this equilibrium condition, removal of resin P, as the most plant-available fraction, would subsequently reduce the levels of P in the inorganic NaHCO3 and NaOH fractions. Conversely, adding P as fertilizer would increase P in the resin fraction with a subsequent increase in the inorganic NaHCO, and NaOH fractions. Although P applied as fertilizer was not completely accounted for in crop removal or net change in soil P, estimated numbers of crops based on our model for predicting available P reflected trends in yields at these two field sites. Sixteen and five crops were estimated for the Norfolk and Davidson soils, respectively. Both corn and soybean yields continued to be high on the Norfolk soil through 1992, while corn yields had declined after 1985 on the Davidson soil. Quantifying the long-term availability of soil P provides some measure of potential return on a capital investment of P fertilization in low-input agriculture. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB The centrality of the sustainability principle to the international agendas on environment and development raises serious research problems and opportunities. The problems are manifested in such societal objectives as 'sustainable development' and a history of human-environment relationships, suggesting that the objective constitutes a paradox. The opportunities follow from the fusion of sustainable development and global environmental change research fostered by the principle. This fusion is particularly pronounced in the study of land-use/cover change in the tropical world, a subject elevated to the forefront of the research and practitioner communities. The international agendas addressing this change, such as the IGBP-IHDP core project on Land-Use/Cover Change, promise long-term, sustained research activities that join the natural and human sciences with the research and practitioner communities. They do so, however, by requiring a scale and type of interdisciplinary and inter-perspective cooperation and coordination not typical of all human sciences, including geography. The divisive character of competing approaches and explanations of land-use/cover change illustrate this situation.

AB This paper describes how local farmers and village institutions have exploited raised water levels in the Sourou River in south-east Mali to clear some 6088 hectares for flooded rice cultivation during the period 1990 96. The paper analyses the social and economic contexts for this transformation particularly the absence of direct involvement of government agencies, and identifies issues that need to be addressed for the ecological and social sustainability of the newly-transformed production system.

AB While the general image of much of the Andes is one of poverty, environmental degradation and out-migration, and of rural economies that refuse to develop self-reinforcing and inclusive forms of growth, islands of sustainable intensification of rural land use and livelihoods can be found. Analysing how these 'islands of sustainability' have emerged can help us understand how far policy and development intervention might encourage similar successes elsewhere in the Andes. This paper considers six localities in the Ecuadorian and Bolivian Andes, four of which are characterized by such success, and two, though located nearby, which are not. Common to the cases of successful intensification is the manufacture of high-value products for middle class and elite markets. Another critical factor is the existence of base and federated local organizations, and of external actors who have networks of contacts with non-local institutions. These two dimensions of local 'social capital' - organizations and networks - play a critical role in helping these localities renegotiate relationships with the market, state and other civil society actors. This renegotiation can generate new resources, entitlements and opportunities that, when linked to local social capital, facilitate local processes of socially-inclusive intensification that can ameliorate both poverty and environmental degradation. For this to be successful also requires a wider enabling context: in particular the existence of appropriate technologies, strong support institutions and significant levels of market demand.

AB This paper considers the environmental transformations that occur within cities as they get larger, wealthier and better managed - and the environmental implications these bring both for the city inhabitants and for people and ecosystems outside these cities. One reason why the environmental quality of wealthy cities can improve is the capacity of the consumers and producers they concentrate to transfer some of their environmental costs to other people, other regions or into the future. The paper also suggests that the tt nn 'environmental problems' is too broad, and that discussions of such problems have to distinguish between different categories in order to be able to understand how such problems vary between different cities and how they change within each city over time.

AB Historically, northern governments prefer a model of international environmental regulation based on legally binding international Conventions, treating direct UN involvement warily. UNCED however saw a reshaping of old southern objections to international regulation in favour of a positive alternative strategy combining 'soft law', alternative and community based forms of action, the participation of nongovernment actors at national and international levels, and voluntary reporting. This is the strategy embodied in Agenda 21 and in the Commission on Sustainable Development, which monitors its implementation. At Rio, this strategy was particularly attractive to the South's middle sized newly industrializing powers, interested in using the UN to set limits to the competitive pressure of different northern based trading blocs. It was also acceptable to countries in Africa and small island states faced with a combination of economic threats end the prospect of climate change. At the Commission, however, governments and their new allies are finding the change harder to implement in practice than it was to agree in theory. The result is that the old model of negotiations designed to produce an ever increasing number of barely enforceable new international environmental agreements, has been rearing its head within the Commission, even as the existing Convention on Climate Change threatens to fail to provide an answer to the problems of reducing northern energy consumption.

AB Increasing pressure on the tropical environment requires a more thorough understanding of hydrological processes as part of reconciling the conflicting demands of economic development vis-a-vis sustainable land management. Using TOPMODEL, a physically based semi-distributed topohydrological model, we test its validity in modelling the stream flow dynamics (hydrograph) in a 1 ha tropical rainforest catchment in French Guiana. Another objective is through field validation of TOPMODEL to ascertain possible runoff generation mechanisms. The field validation of the temporal and spatial hydrodynamics across a rainfall-runoff event reveals that TOPMODEL may be suited for applications to this particular tropical rainforest environment; in fact, this is possibly the first successful application of such a model within the humid tropics. The main reasons why the model was successful are the presumed low hydraulic conductivities of the subsoil, coupled with the absence of an additional deep groundwater body, the contribution from which has caused difficulties in application of topographically, 'physically' based runoff models elsewhere in the humid tropics.

AB The author discusses the current political, social and environmental situation and the possibilities of promoting sustainable development in the State of Amazonas, which should have special ethno-cultural and environmental considerations not taken into account in other regions of Venezuela and other Amazon countries.
   The Venezuelan State of Amazonas, which is covered in 90% by different kinds of tropical forest and soils and has a population of only 100.000 inhabitants (50% indigenous), still remains guite undisturbed and far from the socio-economical development of the country. It comprises 20% of the country but contains 65% of its water resources, 30% of the forest and it has a very high potential in biological diversity and indigenous knowledge and technologies. Additionally, it has big reserves on mineral resources. Thus, the state has a high geostrategical significance for Venezuela.
   The author analyzes the main problems and some important initiatives which if lead and applied properly could be an adequate strategical basis to promote sustainable development in the State of Amazonas.

DE nitrogen recovery rate; growth rate of micro-organisms
AB To minimize the nitrate stress derived from agricultural production on the environment, especially on the groundwater system, the total amount of nitrogen (chemical fertilizer nitrogen and organic waste manure nitrogen) applied per unit area should be restricted within the range of the nitrogen environmental assimilating capacity (NEAC) of the soil-plant system. We define NEAC as the yearly average rate of total nitrogen applied per year or in one cycle of cropping system, and NEAC satisfies not only productivity requirements but also environmental preservation requirements. We developed criteria to estimate NEAC, and using lysimeter test data, we estimated that the NEAC of a volcanic ash vegetable field in Japan was about 250-350 kg ha(-1). The environmental management standard for zinc (Zn) concentration in soil (120 mg kg(-1)) seems to restrict the beneficial use of organic waste compost on cultivated land in Japan. Monitoring by using the method of evaluating the activity of soil micro-organisms may be useful to review the strict environmental management standard for Zn concentration in soil. Even when we applied sewage sludge and ZnSO4 to some kinds of soil samples up to a level above 120 mg Zn kg(-1), the growth of soil micro-organisms was not inhibited in volcanic ash and alluvial soil samples. The environmental management standard for Zn concentration in soil should be determined for each kind of soil.

AB Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi, which have often been designated as vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal (VAM) fungi, symbiotically inhabit plant roots. The promotion of phosphorus uptake and plant growth of host by AM fungi is now well recognized. Therefore, it is anticipated that AM symbiosis could be applied for sustainable agriculture. The author investigated the regulation of the symbiosis with emphasis placed on nutrient exchange, namely phosphorus transfer from AM fungi to host plant and reverse transfer of carbon. The following results were obtained: 1) The growth of AM fungi in host roots was regulated by the supply of photosynthates and the growth of both partners in the symbiosis was well harmonized. 2) A new method for the isolation of intraradical hyphae from host root tissues was developed. The characteristics of enzyme activities in the isolated intraradical hyphae suggest that alkaline phosphatase activity is localized in arbuscular hyphae and that glucose is one of the carbon sources from host plant to AM fungi. 3) Electrophoresis analysis showed that symbiosis-specific alkaline phosphatase was present in the soluble protein of mycorrhizal roots. The phosphatase may originate from AM fungi. Based on these findings, the regulation of the symbiosis was discussed.

TI HIPCs' debt review of the issues

DT Article
ID DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES; PRIVATE INVESTMENT; EMPIRICAL-ANALYSIS; OVERHANG;
   CRISIS
AB A group of low-income countries (the HIPCs), most of which ave in Sub-Saharan Africa, has continued to experience external debt problems. Because the economic characteristics and the external imbalances of the HIPCs are very different from those of middle-income countries, the approach to analysing debt problems and debt reduction initiatives that was developed during the debt crisis of the 1980s needs to be modified and complemented in many important ways. This paper tries to fill this gap by revisiting the methodological issues underlying the analysis of debt sustainability, as well as the theory and empirical evidence of the effects of large debts on economic performance. It finds that (further) debt reduction for the HIPCs may only have positive effects on economic performance if it is seen as endorsing strong and effective programmes of economic stabilisation and reform. This judgment will have to be made on a case-by-case basis. The paper concludes with a number of principles which should guide any practical mechanisms for debt relief.

TI Assessing and managing the university technology business incubator: An

SO JOURNAL OF BUSINESS VENTURING
LA English

ID ORGANIZATIONAL-EFFECTIVENESS; FIRMS; COMPANIES; POLICY
AB This article provides a conceptual framework for assessing and managing the university technology business incubator (UTBI) as a tool for new venture creation. It is widely believed that UTBIs contribute to the nurturing of new technology-based firms (NTBFs). However, they have escaped systematic review in the United States due to a lack of historical data. To fill this gap, a new UTBI performance assessment framework is proposed, which is drawn from a combined survey of the existing body of knowledge in the areas of business incubation, the university's involvement in technology and business development support, and the commonly accepted approaches to organizational assessment that provide the necessary building blocks for the integrative framework. The proposed model is comprised of three performance dimensions: (Ij program sustainability and growth; (2) tenant firm's survival and growth; and (3) contributions to the sponsoring university's,lzission. Further, the scope and effectiveness of the facility management policies, and the provision of services are assessed. The application of this framework is illustrated using four representative UTBI cases selected from a field of 30 five-year or older U.S.-based facilities and their 29 tenant firms our of the 84 firms contacted for the survey (35%). A comparative review of these four cases reveals that the framework provides a flexible methodology to assess the performance of UTBIs. The article concludes with a Set Of elements identified for evaluating UTBIs under the aforementioned three performance dimensions providing measurement indicators. This framework seeks to provide conceptual clarity for those responsible for assessing UTBI performance, directing their operations, or endeavoring to create them. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Inc.

ID ALLOCATION
AB Exogenous price changes affect the amount that a small country exporting natural resource commodities must invest to sustain its consumption level. The necessary amount is given by the difference between Hotelling rent and the discounted sum of future terms-of-trade effects (capital gains). The latter term is found to be large relative to the former in the case of petroleum depletion in Indonesia. This suggests that resource-rich countries will need to invest more than previously expected to sustain their consumption levels, if natural resource prices continue their long-term historical decline.

AB Cadmium is similar to 10% of root and leafy vegetables sold through the Sydney Market exceeds the maximum permitted concentration (MPC) set by the Australian New Zealand (ANZ) Food Authority (0.005 mg kg(-1) fresh weight). The leafy vegetables are mostly produced in the Greater Sydney Region; therefore, we investigated Cd contamination on the soils and vegetables of the Region. The crops and topsoils (0-15 cm) from 29 farms and uncropped (background) top soils were sampled and analyzed. Fruit generally had the lowest Cd levels and leafy vegetables the highest, with 0 and 27% exceeding the MPC. Cadmium in cropped soils was 0.11 to 6.37% mg kg(-1) (mean 1.33 mg kg(-1)) and in background soils averaged 0.36 mg kg(-1). Soils derived from shale had the highest background Cd levels. Additions of P, Zn, and Cd in fertilizer and poultry manure explained significant proportions of the increases in soil concentrations of P (r(2) = 0.62, P < 0.001) and Zn (r(2) = 0.29, P < 0.05), but not of Cd. Cadmium increases were more closely related to increases in Zn (r(2) = 0.26) and exchangeable cations (r(2) = 0.34), which result from a history of heavy, annual applications of poultry manure. Typical rates of Cd addition were about 10 times and sustainable rate. Finally, the ANZ environmental investigation guideline for soil Cd (3 mg kg(-1)), was a poor indicator of crop contamination, because similar to 0.3 mg Cd kg(-1) soil resulted in lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) and broccoli (Brassica oleracea) exceeding the MPC.

AB Partnering has become an important new method in the management of engineering projects. Especially in large-scale endeavors, the economies of time, resources, and costs are enhanced by cooperation, especially in large-scale endeavors. But partnering is a radical change from traditional practices and thus requires the mobilization of participating partners and their organizations. In a recent book we presented four systemic processes that make radical change possible and sustainable. These critical implementation activities can be described as methodologies that will strengthen the partnering process and create long-term organizational learning competencies in the industry.

AB A paired comparison of 60 Illinois farm families war employed, 30 using sustainable systems and 30 using conventional systems, to determine factors affecting adaption of sustainable farming systems The groups do not diverge significantly along dimensions typically accounting for farming contrasts, but are distinctive socially. Families using sustainable systems have traditions of environmentalism, systematically do on-farm experimentation, and are prudent about resources Rather than making a paradigm shift to environmentally sensitive farming, families who adopt have a predisposition toward sustainable practices in all aspects of their lives. Adoption of sustainable systems is therefore as much for efficiency or financial motives ar it is for environmental reasons. Families farming conventionally but sharing many characteristics identified with sustainable families, potentially are those best targeted for educational programs.

AB Increasingly, environmental decision-making is scrutinised with respect to a precautionary principle. This principle asserts that where uncertainty and doubt make it impossible to be sure about a correct decision, any errors should favour the long-term sustainability of the environment.
   Although there an problems in practical adherence to this principle, it has particular meaning and value for quantitative, ecological aspects of environmental sampling and monitoring. When probabilistic (or statistical) interpretations of data are made, there are two potential errors: Type I, or rejecting a null hypothesis when it is true and Type II, or retaining a null hypothesis when it is wrong. In environmental terms, these can often be translated as Type I error occurring if it is claimed that there is an environmental impact when there is none. A Type II error would represent failing to detect an impact even though one has occurred.
   Most ecological and environmental work is designed to keep the possibility of Type I error small (and by convention at about one in twenty). Usually, there is little or no concern about Type II errors. The precautionary principle, however, dictates that Type II errors are a serious problem for environmental management-and much more so than Type I errors. Thus, not detecting impacts (Type II) is not precautionary.
   This paper summarizes the relevant features of environmental monitoring and sampling that decrease the chance of Type II error (and therefore increase the 'power' of a sampling program to detect impacts). Better consideration of these issues in the design of sampling would greatly increase adherence to the precautionary principle and would enhance the prospects of sustainable environmental decision-making.
   Interpreting precautionary principles in terms of environmental sampling and measurement would increase the need (and potentially the capacity) to define possible environmental disturbances and responses to them in more quantitative and less vague terms.

AB The concept and methods of ecological diversity in communities were applied to phytoplankton categorized by flow cytometric measurements related to size and chlorophyll content. Each cytometric signature was condensed to single numerical values indicative of diversity and evenness. Measurements pooled from studies disparate in temporal and spatial scales indicated greater chlorophyll biomass and primary production with greater cytometric diversity and evenness. Future development of these ideas may help link biological oceanographic processes with patterns established through ecological processes at the community level.

ID OPTIMAL BIRTH-CONTROL; STRUCTURED POPULATIONS; DYNAMICS
AB The optimal equilibrium harvesting policy is investigated for an age-dependent population of females whose life history consists of two stages termed eggs (or juveniles) and adults. Using a continuous-time linear model, we consider admissible harvesting policies in which a certain fraction of individuals of fixed ages is harvested per unit time in both stages to bring the population to an equilibrium level. Determination of the harvest rate that maximizes the sustainable yield, subject to a linear ecological or economic constraint, leads to a nonlinear, nonconvex optimization problem. The optimal policy is shown to consist of harvesting at most three ages. Thus, we say that the harvest is trimodal. In one stage, at most two ages are harvested, with the oldest being harvested completely; in the other, at most one age is harvested completely. In each stage, the age totally removed, if present, is older than the surplus age, which is the age at which the proportion of the expected number of eggs multiplied by the proportion of the expected number of adults first exceeds one. The three harvesting ages are dependent on the birth, maturation, and death rates and on the economic parameters of the problem. A simple algorithm to find the optimum harvesting strategy is described. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 1997.

AB Agricultural engineering is a multidisciplinary field of science. Beside the traditional mechanical engineering other engineering branches, electronics, control engineering and physics play their specific role within the agricultural engineering area. Agricultural engineering has affected and stimulated major changes in agriculture. In the last decades agricultural engineering also focusses on environmental aspects. Nowadays knowledge and expertise generated in several agricultural and environmental engineering fields must be integrated with expertise of biological and socio-economical sciences. In the evolution towards sustainable agricultural systems it is clear that important contributions can be made. The redesign of production systems and its technology can help to achieve an ecologically sound and economically viable agriculture and its acceptance in community.

AB Paper is a material which is part and parcel of civilisation. Since its invention it has had a substantial influence on the development of humanity. We can hardly imagine modern society existing without paper. It is an extremely versatile material, which acts as a carrier of information, as packaging, as hygienic material and in many other special applications.
   From the ecological point of view paper has two significant advantages. Firstly, it is derived from wood, a renewable raw material, secondly, used paper can be converted into new paper. Given these pre-conditions paper can be the pattern for a sustainable development. An ecologically aligned paper economy can minimise effects on the environment and close up ecological cycles.
   The policy of the Federal Government, which deals with the closed substance cycle, ties in with the natural advantages of paper. The Packaging Ordinance, which is based on the principle of product responsibility, has built for paper a solid bridge between industrial production and waste disposal. As far as graphic papers are concerned, this was affected by the participants in this economic activity by a negotiated commitment. The successful efforts in both these fields show clearly that the closed loop and producer's responsibility have been accepted by those concerned as a challenge for the future.
   The Act for promoting closed substance cycle waste management and insuring environmentally compatible waste disposal establishes the legal basis for the policy of the Federal Government on this matter. In the sense of the principles of sustainable development, this Regulation has as its aim that the waste of an economic activity should again become raw material of production. For the very first time have the product and production responsibility of producers of goods, and the avoidance and re-use of waste by the producing industry, been made into instruments of law. The details of this regulation ensure that the recycling of waste occurs in an environmentally friendly manner and that noxious materials are not disposed of by adding them to the product or passed into the environment. This ensures that the principle of a sustainable development concerning waste is fully observed. The Act mentioned above forms a development of the EU Waste Regulation and is based on the wider meaning of waste, in which waste paper is regarded as ''waste for recycling''. Although the legal regulations, which apply to waste paper utilisation, do not imply special restrictions, the very word ''waste'' can lead to a problem with the image of waste paper recycling, which can be detrimental concerning the closed substance cycle. On the basis of the EU-legalities, matters concerning image problems with waste paper recycling can only be dealt with on the EU-level, The Federal Government therefore supports initiatives of the waste paper recycling industry and its associations, to try to negotiate with the EU Commission concerning a further development of the EU regulation on waste. This should be seen against the background that the successful recycling of waste paper forms a model for the policy of the closed substance cycle of the Federal Government.

AB Based on the vision of continuing economical growth the role of paper will continue to be central in people's everyday life. However, as known, the paper itself and the entire paper making process has been under considerable environmental pressure over the past decades. Has this criticism been fair, or has the paper been picked up as a showpiece by various pressure groups in forming their profiles?
   Criticism usually furthers development as long as it is based on substance or on a clear vision. The recent multiclient study ''Towards a Sustainable Paper Cycle'' shows that today's modern papermaking is approaching the sustainable development status in many aspects. It also shows that there is room for well focused research to solve the remaining obstacles for a sustainable paper cycle: concept.
   At the same time as we create more research-based knowledge, increase the substance, we should be aware that we are dealing with a totality, which is very challenging to communicate. Everybody in our industry should accept the sustainability as the ultimate goal, but we have to be open also to the existing problems.
   So I see two totalities which mean real challenges to the sustainable paper cycle. Firstly, we still have to focus on research, as to whether it means closing cycles, biodiversity in plantations or new pulping methods, just to mention some areas as examples. My presentation does not go into these questions, as I do not claim to be an expert. Secondly, we have to improve our expertise in communicating our achievements and also what we have not achieved. The case needs different ways to communicate in forestry, in different areas of the world, in the customer end, with the authorities, again only to mention a few examples.
   Indeed, the sustainable development is a challenge and we will be challenged to achieve this targeted situation. As the ultimate goal we have to prove what this industry believes in - that the sustainable paper cycle is possible and that we can remove the remaining obstacles. Compared to most of the other global industries we have a positive case for the future.

AB This study is the first to examine the effects of endurance training in an elasmobranch fish. Twenty-four leopard sharks (Triakis semifasciata) were divided randomly into three groups. Eight sharks were killed immediately, eight were forced to swim continuously for 6 wk against a current of 35 cm s(-1) (60%-65% of maximal sustainable swimming speed), and eight were held for 6 wk in a tank without induced current. There were no changes due to training in maximal sustainable speed, oxygen consumption rates, percentage of the myotome composed of red and white muscle fibers, blood oxygen-carrying capacity, liver mass, liver lipid, glycogen, and protein concentrations, white muscle protein content, heart ventricle mass, or the specific activities of the enzymes citrate synthase, pyruvate kinase, and lactate dehydrogenase in the heart ventricle. In red myotomal muscle, citrate synthase activity increased 17% as a result of training, but there was no change in muscle fiber diameter. The greatest effects occurred in white myotomal muscle, in which a 34% increase in fiber diameter and a 36% increase in the activities of citrate synthase and lactate dehydrogenase occurred as a result of training. The conditioned fish also had significantly higher growth rates. The observed effects within the myotomal muscle may reflect the higher growth rates of the trained leopard sharks, or they may be a specific response to the increased energetic demands of the training activity, indicating characteristics that limit swimming performance in leopard sharks.

AB Biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) has an assured place in agriculture, mainly as a source of nitrogen for legumes. Legumes are currently grown mostly as a source of vegetable oil and as food for humans and animals, but not as nitrogen source.
   Other crops with BNF capability may be eventually be developed eventually. Such crops will also need mineral fertilizers to maintain a good status of soil nutrients, but their possible effects to the environment is also a concern. Fertilizers, however, will remain a necessary and sustainable input to agriculture to feed the present and increasing human population. It is not a case of whether BNF is better or worse than mineral fertilizers because both plays an important role in agriculture.

AB The extension of nitrogen-fixing symbioses to important crop plants such as the cereals has been a long-standing goal in the field of biological nitrogen fixation. One of the approaches that has been used to try to achieve this goal involves the isolation and characterization of stable endophytic bacteria from a variety of wild and cultivated rice species that either have a natural ability. to fix nitrogen or can be engineered to do so. Here we present the results of our first screening effort for rice endophytes and their characterization using acetylene reduction assays (ARA), genomic fingerprinting with primers corresponding to naturally occurring repetitive DNA elements (rep-PCR), partial 16S rDNA sequence analysis and PCR mediated detection of nitrogen fixation (nif) genes with universal nif primers developed in our laboratory. We also describe our efforts to inoculate rice plants with the isolates obtained from the screening, in order to examine their invasiveness and persistence (stable endophytic maintenance). Lastly, we review our attempts to tag selected isolates with reporter genes/proteins, such as beta-glucuronidase (gus) or green fluorescent protein (gfp), in order to be able to track putative endophytes during colonization of rice tissues.

AB This paper highlights results from a collaborative life-cycle design project between the University of Michigan, the US Environment Protection Agency and United Solar Systems Corporation, Energy analysis is a critical planning and design tool for photovoltaic (PV) modules, A set of model equations for evaluating the life-cycle energy performance of PV systems and other electricity-generating systems ape presented The total PV life-cycle, encompassing material production, manufacturing and assembly, use and end-of-life management, was investigated.
   Three metrics-energy payback time, electricity production efficiency and life-cycle conversion efficiency-were defined for PV modules with and without balance-of-system (BOS) components, These metrics were evaluated for a United Solar UPM-880 amorphous silicon PV module based on average insolation in Detroit, Boulder and Phoenix, Based on these metrics, a minimum condition for assessing the sustainability of electricity-generating systems was proposed and discussed. The life-cycle energy analysis indicated that the aluminum frame is responsible for a significant fraction of the energy invested in the UPM-880 module. (C) 1997 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI Technological capability assessment as an input for strategic planning:

   Authority of Thailand

LA English
DT Article
ID SUSTAINABLE COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE; RESOURCE-BASED VIEW; INTANGIBLE
   RESOURCES; CORE CAPABILITIES; INDUSTRY; FIRM
AB In the present era of rapid technological change, technological aspects need to be explicitly considered in strategic planning. One such aspect is the evaluation of the strengths and weaknesses with respect to a firm's technological capability. Existing methodologies for technological capability assessment tend to be very general and do not focus on critical elements that constitute the technological capability of a firm.
   This paper suggests a comprehensive methodology and illustrates it through case studies of two firms in the electricity utility sector, namely the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT) and Electricite' de France (EDF). The two case studies, based on the proposed methodology, show how the technological capability profile of both these firms can be developed and draw attention not only to areas of strength but also to those that are weak and need improvement. On the basis of such findings several strategic implications have been highlighted in the case of EDF and EGAT Existing strategic planning literature does not elaborate adequately upon the use of technological capability assessments in the planning framework. This paper attempts to make a contribution in this regard as well.
   The two case studies also draw attention to the fact that there are important endogenous and exogenous factors which contribute to technological capability development. These include: technology used by the company; company culture; organization size; company strategy; the level of learning; intelligence gathering activities; size of the economy and growth rate; financial and fiscal policies of government; and factor market conditions. fn conclusion, it is pointed out that the proposed approach can also be used, with suitable adaptations, for studying other firms in the manufacturing sector.

AB Tuberculosis incidence in Africa is increasing dramatically and fragile health systems are struggling to cope. Potential coping capacity may lie within affected communities but this capacity needs to be harnessed if tuberculosis is to be controlled. Since 1991 all patients with tuberculosis in Hlabisa health district, South Africa have been eligible for community-based directly observed therapy (DOT). Patients are supervised either by a health worker (HW) in a village clinic, or in the community by a community health worker (CHW) or a volunteer lay person (VLP). Tuberculosis incidence increased from 312 cases in 1991 to 1250 cases in 1996. By December 1995, 2622 (87%) of 3006 patients had received DOT, supervised mainly by VLP (56%) but also by HW (28%) and CHW (16%). The proportion supervised by HW fell from 46% in 1991 to 26% in 1995 (P < 0.0001). More patients supervised by VLP (85%) and CHW (88%) than by HW (79%, P = 0.0008) completed treatment. Case-holding by HW declined more between 1991 and 1995 (84% to 71%, P = 0.02) than did case-holding by both CHW (95 % to 90% P = 0.7) and VLP (88% to 84%, P = 0.4) Mortality was similar (4-6%) and stable over time, irrespective of the supervisor. High tuberculosis treatment completion rates are achievable and sustainable for several years in resource-poor settings despite a massively increased case load if community resources are harnessed. Patients may be more effectively supervised by voluntary lay people than by health workers under these circumstances. without being placed It increased risk. These findings suggest that community supervisors may be an essential component of any DOT strategy.

TI A resume of WASH, UNDP, and World Bank water and sanitation experience
SO WATER SA
LA English
DT Article
AB The paper describes findings of UNDP, World Bank and the USAID-sponsored Water and Sanitation for Health Project (WASH), that are of value to water and sanitation provision for the developing urban and peri-urban areas of South Africa.
   It is the view of these agencies that the challenges in water and sanitation provision in developing countries can conceptually be viewed as two closely related agendas, viz:
   to complete the ''old agenda'' of providing domestic services, and
   to make progress with the ''new agend'' of environmentally sustainable development.
   The paper abstracts many important findings of the agencies' work, and describes their shift in emphasis from single-focus projects to more integrated approaches to the provision of infrastructure and the improvement of health. It is noted that much evidence is available from case studies about what works in given sets of circumstances and what does not, and why projects and programmes must evolve from, and be tailored to, diverse individual circumstances.

ID WESTERN OREGON; WASHINGTON; FOREST
AB The northern spotted (Strix occidentalis caurina) uses a wide array of nesting habitat throughout its current range and successfully reproduces in a variety of stand types on the eastern slope of the Pacific Northwest Cascades. The species has the ability to utilize dynamic forest stands that continue to undergo significant changes in tree density, proportion of tree size classes, and tree species composition. Current stand structure and composition reflect the results of timber harvest, reduced fire effects and ongoing successional and stand development processes. In nest stands, multi-layered canopy was more strongly expressed in numbers of both small (< 13 cm DBH) and large (> 41 cm DBH) trees than in unoccupied stands of the same type within the owl neighborhoods. Tree density and the proportion of shade-tolerant tree species have increased significantly in spotted owl nest sites in both dry and wet forests since Eurosettlement. Barring disturbance, further increases in the dominance of shade-tolerant species should occur over time with continual change in nest stand structure and composition. The development of dense forest stands and 'old-forest structural attributes' as a result of reduced fire effects could be potential mitigating factors to the loss of old-forest habitat from harvest and should be considered in determining the available owl habitat in the eastern Cascades. However, old-forest structural attributes in dense, overstocked stands are at high fire hazard and should be viewed as transitional until old-forest habitat with improved sustainability becomes available.

AB Sustainable exploitation of non-wood forest resources as a means for achieving the complimentary objectives of natural forest conservation and income generation for rural inhabitants has drawn international attention in recent years. Accomplishing these dual goals requires an understanding of how non-timber forest products (NTFP) extraction and marketing functions in the tropical regions. This is often hindered by an absence of basic research and analysis. The paper reviews the prevailing management systems and forest policy in India with a view to examining the problems and prospects for NTFP development. Factors influencing the production of economically important NTFP were determined through a case study and the deficiencies in the existing marketing strategy were analysed. Measures to improve the extraction system for higher returns to both the state forestry sector and primary collectors were highlighted and the need for domestication of NTFP species was stressed.

AB The purpose of this study was to evaluate the usefulness and sensitivity of parameters that describe various soil organic matter characteristics for the evaluation of harvesting impacts on ecosystem function, using an ecosystem-level, hybrid simulation model (FORECAST, a model developed from its predecessor FORCYTE-11). Four separate sets of forest management options were applied to both a simulated unmanaged Douglas-fir forest (with a high accumulation of forest floor, coarse woody debris, and the nutrients contained therein) and to a simulated Douglas-fir forest growing on a site depleted in organic matter and nutrients. These four options consisted of the combination of two rotation lengths (40 vs. 80 years), and two levels of biomass utilization (full-tree vs. conventional tree length harvest).
   Based on the model simulations, productivity on the previously unmanaged site dropped significantly (to 59% of the value for the original, unmanaged forest) by the end of the second 40 year rotation when subjected to an intensive management option (40 year rotation, full-tree harvesting), However, a rapid drop in the active soil pool of decomposing organic matter occurred and was not rebuilt. As a result of this reduction in the size of the active soil pool, nitrogen deficiencies (N-demand greater than N-uptake) occurred in the subsequent rotations. In contrast, the initially nutritionally degraded site responded positively to an intermediate level of management (80 year rotations, stem-only harvesting), with a steady increment in the active soil organic matter pool size over the 240 year simulation period. This response indicates that sites degraded by past activities generally have the ability to recover (aggrade) if put under a less demanding management regime. Change in the mass and dynamics of active soil organic matter provides a more rapid and sensitive parameter than tree growth when attempting to assess the sustainability of management alternatives. Examples are presented which illustrate the importance of the starting state condition, as well as the management system being applied, when attempting to assess the sustainability of management alternatives.

AB The long-term sustainable production of fast-growing single-species plantations is now being questioned because of their effects on soil fertility. As an alternative to monocultures, growing mixed stands with N-fixing trees as an essential component of the mixture was tested in this trial. Eucalyptus globulus and Acacia mearnsii were planted in five different proportions (100E, 75E:25A, 50E:50A, 25E:75A, 100A) at two densities (3.3 m x 2 m and 3.3 m x 3 m) at Cann River in East Gippsland, Australia. Effects of species interactions on tree growth and concentrations of N and P in plant tissues and on soil N mineralization were assessed. Height and volume increments of individual eucalypt trees were positively affected by the presence of acacia. There was an indication at age 33 months that the 50E:50A treatment had the greatest height at the higher planting density. This was attributed to better N status of eucalypts as indicated by the N concentration of live and senescent leaves and of fine roots. The presumed transfer of N from acacias to eucalypts during the early stages of plantation development probably resulted mainly from below-ground turnover of roots and nodules, as above-ground litter decomposition had not then commenced. The study showed no conclusive evidence of any change in P cycling in mixed stands at 33 months after planting, suggesting the need for inputs of P as fertilizer to remove any P deficiency and enhance N fixation by acacia. The trial will in due course provide data which will enable a better understanding of the potential long-term nutritional benefits and costs of using an acacia in mixture with eucalypts.

AB Forest growth models form one of several important prerequisites for sustainable management. The complexity of tropical moist forest means that there is often little objective information to classify sites and species for growth modelling and yield prediction. Classification based on observable morphological characteristics may be a useful surrogate for, or supplement to, other alternatives. This study investigated the utility of plant functional attributes (PFAs) for site and species classification. PFAs describe a plant in terms of its photosynthetic and vascular support system, and the sum of individual PFAs for all species on a plot provides an efficient summary of vegetation features at the site. Preliminary observations suggested that the PFA summary may also indicate site productivity, and that specific PFAs may be used to group species for modelling growth and yield, Data from 17 permanent plots in the tropical rainforests of North Queensland were used to test these preliminary observations. Standard PFA proformas were completed for each plot in January 1995, and the relationships between the PFAs, site productivity and specific growth patterns were examined using discriminant analysis, linear regression and standard statistical tests. Results indicate that mean leaf size, and the incidence of species with vertical leaf inclination (more than 30 degrees above horizontal) are significantly correlated with site productivity. Of the PFAs assessed, five elements appear to offer a useful basis for grouping species for modelling: leaf size and inclination, a furcation index (i.e. relative height to first fork or break in the main stem), and the presence of lenticels and chlorophyllous tissue on the main stem. The restricted nature of our database limits comment on the general utility of the method, but results suggest that further work on PFAs is warranted. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Though the food security system in India is resilient enough to give short-run drought proofing, the long-run drought proofing can be ensured only through programmes like watershed development in dry belt, for nearly 70 per cent of the land and 40 per cent of food production comes from dry farming. The study analyses the role of watershed development programme on the sustainable development of dry region and to what extent participation of local resource users helps in sustaining the development temporally.

AB Till now the Indian policies have adopted a cautious approach ensuring that the requisite foodgrains are produced, before launching a massive drive for diversification and exports. However, doubts have been raised about the sustainability of growth in production as well as efficacy of the PDS to ensure food security. Alternatively, a strategy has been advocated to ensure foodgrain self-sufficiency by enhancing access to land/natural resources.
   This paper examines some of the more recent trends in production and demonstrates that the yield based growth in food production has taken place in most states including dryland regions; that the diversification is a larger process that had already set in before liberalization; and that the shift from oilseeds to foodgrain production is essential for economic sustainability of dryland farming.

AB Pure cultures of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria, Nitrosomonas europaea, were exposed to trichloroethylene (TCE), 1,1-dichloroethylene (1,1-DCE), chloroform (CF), 1,2-dichloroethane (1,2-DCA), or carbon tetrachloride (CT), in the presence of ammonia, in a quasi steady-state bioreactor. Estimates of enzyme kinetics constants, solvent inactivation constants, and culture recovery constants were obtained by simultaneously fitting three model curves to experimental data using nonlinear optimization techniques and an enzyme kinetics model, referred to as the inhibition, inactivation, and recovery (IIR) model, that accounts for inhibition of ammonia oxidation by the solvent, enzyme inactivation by solvent product toxicity, and respondent synthesis of new enzyme (recovery). Results showed relative enzyme affinities for ammonia monooxygenase (AMO) of 1,1-DCE approximate to TCE > CT > NH3 > CF > 1,2-DCA. Relative maximum specific substrate transformation rates were NH3 > 1,2-DCA > CF > TCE approximate to 1,1-DCE > CT (=O). The TCE, CF, and 1,1-DCE inactivated the cells, with 1,1-DCE being about three times more potent than TCE or CF. Under the conditions of these experiments, inactivating injuries caused by TCE and 1,1-DCE appeared limited primarily to the AMO enzyme, but injuries caused by CF appeared to be more generalized. The CT was not oxidized by N. europaea while 1,2-DCA was oxidized quite readily and showed no inactivation effects. Recovery capabilities were demonstrated with all solvents except CF. A method for estimating protein yield, the relationship between the transformation capacity model and the IIR model, and a condition necessary for sustainable cometabolic treatment of inactivating substrates are presented.

AB The dynamics of nutrient cycling within a forest system involve processes operating on many different timescales, ranging from seconds to thousands of years. In their response to environmental change, trees can respond initially in one direction and then later reverse the response due to a process acting on a longer time scale. Thus, theoretical models are required for the interpretation of short-term experiments where CO2 concentration or nutrient availability are modified. Comins and McMurtrie (1993) delineate the G'DAY plant-soil model, which attempts to incorporate nutrient cycling responses on various time scales in a model of moderate complexity, using the Century model of soil nutrient dynamics coupled with a simple model of tree growth. The model shows a complex response to doubling CO2 under nitrogen-limited conditions; large or small short-term responses can be independently combined with either large or small long-term responses, depending on certain details of plant and soil dynamics. Comins and McMurtrie describe the long-term behaviour of the system by calculating the equilibrium of the model, excluding the passive soil organic matter pool. This analytical result makes clear which parameters of the model determine the long-term dynamics. Subsequently it has been found that a more general description of long-term dynamics requires understanding both the equilibrium pool sizes and the equilibration time of the system. This paper derives an analytical expression for the equilibration time, again permitting the important parameters of the model to be identified. It also describes an intermediate level of approximation, using differential equations for slow soil organic matter carbon and nitrogen pools. This is useful for generalisations of the model, and for describing the long-term dynamics in a gradually changing environment, as opposed to the dynamics following a step change. It is found that most parametrisations of G'DAY which have low nitrogen loss rates also have relatively long equilibration times. The equilibration time is approximately predicted by the slow pool decay time divided by the 'slow nitrogen loss fraction' (defined as the fraction of nitrogen released from the slow soil organic matter pool which leaves the system without ever re-entering the slow pool). In a slowly changing environment, the response of G'DAY can be approximately predicted using equilibrium analysis and a time lag, where the appropriate time lag is equal to the predicted equilibration time.

AB The experimental field plots were divided into two sections managed under either conventional or sustainable farming practices plus two different rotation schemes. The planting order for rotation System 1 was seen manure, cabbage, sweet corn, rice, vegetable soybean while under System 2, the order was green manure, sweet corn, vegetable soybean, rice, radish, vegetable soybean. In samples of sandstone shale and slate mixed alluvial soil and Taiwan clay taken from field plots operated under rotation System 1, the nitrifying activities were always higher in soils receiving organic fertilizer as compared with chemical fertilizer treatment. When comparing the nitrifying activities of soils collected from fields managed under different rotation systems, the results indicated that the activity was always higher in soil collected from fields grown with legume. In our attempts to compare the numbers of ammonium-oxidizing and nitrite-oxidizing bacteria in soils receiving different fertilizers or between rotation systems, we failed to detect any significant differences between those samples taken at the same period of time. However, when comparing the trends of nitrite and nitrate accumulation in alluvial soil and Taiwan clay incubated at 30 degrees C and 40 degrees C, changes were observed. Therefore, we believe that the differences in nitrite and nitrate accumulations in soils receiving chemical or organic fertilizer were caused by variation in the composition of nitrifying bacterial populations in these soils.

   changes and sustainable agriculture - South and South-East Asian context
SO CURRENT SCIENCE

DT Article
AB Though the global change-change in land cover, land use, atmospheric concentration of greenhouse gases, loss of biodiversity and many related processes today-has enormous dimensions, this is the result of changes at micro-level, i.e. the village, small towns and higher order as a result of 'development'. Therefore, the corrective action or mitigation strategy should start at that level. There has been almost no change in forest cover in South and South-East Asia between 1978 and 1993. The important driving forces for land cover change are population, affluence and technology. While the developing countries have been attempting to define poverty, no effort has been made to define affluence, and also the responsibility of the affluent sections of the society towards local, regional and global change. The improved technology of crop production, particularly of wheat and rice, has resulted in saving 160 mha of land since 1961-62 in South and South-East Asia. New problems of sustainability of rice - wheat cropping system, groundwater pollution, reduced emphasis on nutritious grains (coarse grains) and stagnation in research on crop improvement have emerged. The regional cooperation and action points are suggested for meeting the new challenges.

AB Drawing on the resource-based view of the firm, we posited that environmental performance and economic performance are positively linked and that industry growth moderates the relationship, with the returns to environmental performance higher ire high-growth industries, We tested these hypotheses with an analysis of 243 firms over two years, using independently developed environmental, ratings. Results indicate that ''it pays to he green'' and that this relationship strengthens with industry growth. Mle conclude by highlighting the study's academic and managerial implications, making special reference to the social issues in management literature.

AB Our recent 18-month calcium supplementation trial demonstrated a significant increase in radial bone mineral mass in 7-year-old children with calcium intake approximate to 300 mg/day (Am J Clin Nutr 1994; 60: 744-50). The persistence of higher bone mass after cessation of calcium supplementation is unknown. This is a follow-up study to investigate: the lasting effect of calcium supplementation on bone acquisition. Subjects were 159 Chinese children aged 8.7 gears, Distal one-third radial bone mineral content (BMC) and bone width (BW) were measured by single-photon absorptiometry. After 12 months, the significant difference in mean +/- SD percentage radial BMC disappeared between the study and control groups (7.34 +/- 6.77% vs 8.67 +/- 6.46%, p > 0.05). Dietary calcium intakes were similar between the groups. During the supplementation phase, the study group had 17.9% greater BMC gain than that of controls. In the follow-up phase, however, the study group had 16.1% less BMC gain than that of controls. It appears that an increased acquisition rate during the supplementation phase was almost balanced by a reduced acquisition rate during follow-up phase, Moreover, throughout the entire 30-month period, the overall BMC acquisition rates of the study and control groups were 25% and 23.8%, respectively. Hence, the overall acquisition rate of the study group was only 5% higher than that of controls. Therefore, the effect of calcium supplementation on bone mineral gain appears to reflect a transient reduction in bone turnover rate. Longer-term calcium trials are necessary to confirm whether a sustainable higher calcium intake throughout childhood will enhance peak bone mass.

AB The ultimate goal of any sexual and reproductive health program is to ensure cost effectiveness, quality and sustainability. Reproductive health awareness is an educational approach which is both relevant and sensitive to many communities' existing sexual and reproductive health needs and concerns. When working with community groups, a participatory approach that includes reproductive health awareness concepts is a simple non-threatening way for programs to quickly expand beyond pure information giving and explore what reproductive health means to people. Although many community sexual and reproductive health programs do not use the term reproductive health awareness, they use techniques similar to the reproductive health awareness education approach, when facilitating discussions about sexual or reproductive health. If reproductive health awareness is identified and included as one of the dimensions of future sexual and reproductive health programs, this will hopefully strengthen the program's overall quality and effectiveness.

DE hunting; lion; Panthera; population density; quota
ID AFRICAN
AB In 1992, tourist hunting in the Selous Game Reserve generated 1.28 million dollars for the Tanzanian government, of which 0.96 million dollars were returned to wildlife conservation. Lions (Panthera lee) are one of three critical species for tourist hunting, consistently generating 12%-13% of hunting revenue from 1988 to 1992, Because of their ecological and economic importance (and intrinsic value), it is important that lion quotas be set so that offtake is sustainable. The population density of lions in Selous ranges from 0.08 to 0.13 adults km(-2), comparable to unhunted ecosystems. The adult sex ratio (36-41% male) and the ratio of cubs to adults (29% cubs) are similar to those of unhunted populations, The ratio of lions to hyaenas is lower in heavily hunted areas (0.17 lions/hyena) than in unhunted areas (0.43 lions/hyena). Hunting: levels between 1989 and 1994 took 2.7-4.3% of adult males annually, which is sustainable. The current quota is 10-16% of the adult male population, which exceeds natural mortality rates for male lions. To remain stable if the quota was filled, the population would have to compensate via increased fecundity, increased juvenile survival, or an altered sex-ratio. Compensation occurs in Selous by producing (Or raising) more male than female cubs (66-81% of juveniles are male). Only 28% of the Selous quota was filled in 1992. The percentage of quota filled (both in Selous and nationwide) has dropped since 1988 as quotas have increased, The current intensity of lion hunting in Selous is sustainable, but the quota cannot be filled sustainably.

DE local commitment; social reproduction of landscape qualities;
   participation and responsibility; asymmetry
AB In Dutch rural planning, constraints concerning the accessibility and other physical characteristics of an area are no longer a major problem. More important is the policy-making process at higher levels of society and processes of economic and social restructuring, over which local people do not have adequate control. This threatens their strong sense of commitment to their direct physical and social environment.
   As a consequence, sustainable rural landscape development is not primarily a technical problem, or a problem of design and reconstruction of the area, but a problem of communication and participation Development projects need a social basis and should include measures to promote the production of quality landscapes by the local population. This cannot be achieved in a strategy to reach sustainable landscape development without taking account of the individual need of people to maintain their commitment to the landscape, and without adjustment of the unbalanced distribution of human resources for future control over the area. Important steps in this strategy would be an early exchange of information about the planning process, and the establishment of intermediary bodies to narrow the gap between the level of policy making and the everyday experiences of local people.

AB On the basis of summarized experiences in agricultural landscape planning of the few last years in Switzerland the landscape evaluation and the implementation process are analysed; the principles of a 'holistic' approach are outlined. It is shown that, epistemologically, objectivity in valuation and priority-setting emerges out of a dialectic cognition process between different poles (complementary aspects of different landscape scales, different viewpoints on respective interests, different hierarchy levels in project organization structure). Each sphere of complementarity needs its adapted methods and approaches, which are presented and discussed on referring to participative planning project examples. The results of such projects so far, compared with conventional approaches, have turned out encouragingly-both from the point of view of local people and of planners/governmental authorities. Nevertheless, several crucial conditions, challenges and obstacles have to be taken into account. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

   The first farm is located in the landscape system of the Coastal Plains near the boundary with the landscape system of the Antiappennino Heights in the Province of Grosseto, southern Tuscany.
   The second one is located in the landscape system of the Pliocene Hills in the Province of Florence, central Tuscany. It was found that the organic farms in both regions add a considerable number of values to the surrounding landscape. Thereby a number of the criteria were criticized, though most were quite useful.

DE agro-landscape; biodynamic; ecology; farmer and consumers;

AB A sustainable, ecologically sound management of the landscape cannot be established by top-down planning and regulations. It appears to be more a matter of willingness to become aware of and to accept responsibility for those living in that landscape. Organic and in particular biodynamic agriculture take the challenge to develop appropriate forms of social and economic cooperation in addition to the ecologically sound agro-techniques they deem essential. For this development, perceiving the farm as a kind of organism which has to be individually developed, is necessary. The example of a farmers' association in northern Germany is used to clarify the relationships between ecological measures to improve the landscape and the socioeconomic framework of agriculture. Such a bottom-up landscape development, which includes individual approaches and a concept perceiving the landscape as a whole, is seen as an interesting addition to top-down landscape planning. Instead of an approach separating intensive agro-production and nature conservation, which looks absurd from an overall ecological point of view, a nature-compliant agriculture must be developed, which starts by accepting the natural conditions and develops them accordingly, to fit the needs of the relevant society.

   farm; the Netherlands
AB In the framework of the Concerted Action 'The Landscape and Nature Production Capacity of Organic\Sustainable Types of Agriculture', the authors visited the organic goat farm Capricas to test some criteria on farm level. Ten, mainly cultural, criteria had been selected because they were related to the field of work of the authors. The aim was to test the usability of the criteria in order to assess the farm's contribution to landscape quality. Data were gained during a day of fieldwork by direct observations, an interview and survey of the literature.
   The ten criteria appeared to be useful for describing the features which influence landscape quality. However, for measuring these criteria a clear reference is needed, which was not available in this exercise. Therefore, only a global valuation of the farm's contribution to the landscape quality can given so far. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

DE regional autonomy; agro-landscape; landscape-ecosystem; ecological
   agriculture; species' distribution patterns
AB Landscape, in this paper, is defined as ''a complex of geographically, functionally and historically interrelated ecosystems'' (also: ''organised land''). For its planning and management, mapping of geomorphological, hydrological, and climatic conditions is crucial to understand the ecological patterns. To warrant the landscape's sustainability, its ecosystems' multiple and interdependent functions should be carefully identified on macro-, meso- and micro-level. It is argued that, whereas a natural ecosystem is homogenous, the landscape ecosystem is heterogeneous, for example in a mosaic or zoned way.
   Like evolution in organisms, succession in ecosystems tends do develop toward increasing independency from environmental fluctuations (increasing autonomy of the systems). On the contrary, landscape ecosystems have increasingly lost their regional autonomy over the last decades, as external input technologies became favoured. However, theories and practices of ecological (organic) agriculture, low external input oriented as they are, tend to re-enforce the local ecosystems' autonomy together with the regional identity. In the Netherlands intensive and widespread land reclamation (polders and floodplains) made hydro-ecology a major landscape-ecology determinant. Distribution patterns of floristic species are found to reflect the hydro-dynamic conditions in natural and semi-natural ecosystems. Provided that suitable knowledge on local conditions is available, they can be used as indicators of potential sites for nature regeneration and indicate landscape degradation as well. Even though potentially favouring agro-ecosystems diversity and regional autonomy, ecological types of agriculture, as currently defined by law, do only promote nature on the farm when the farmer dedicates special attention it as an additional objective of his (organic) farming.

TI Evaluation of fields and field margins in nature production capacity

DE biodiversity; ecoregulation; habitat evaluation; Hungary; plant
   protection
AB Biotic diversity in rural areas is one of the key paints of sustainable agriculture and rural development. Biotic diversity and species restoration are closely connected with habitats and thus plant cover diversity. Hungarian agriculture is in a state of transition towards market oriented production and development. Changes in property rights, farm size, land use and the greater importance of environmental issues demand new approaches for plant protection and habitat evaluation.
   In our study some examples will be given showing the importance both of fields and field margins and about their contribution to plant protection and nature production.
   Plant species and predators (carabids, spiders) were studied in winter wheat fields and in the field margins. Evidence was found of the importance of the field margin for the number and composition of plant species. Parallel to this, carabids and spiders (as significant predators) were studied. For both carabids and spiders, species number and diversity were significantly higher in field margins compared with fields. The species distribution of carabids among these two different habitats, however, indicates that some species are typical 'field species'. Thus, proper management of both habitats is necessary so that they may contribute to biotic diversity,
   A possible evaluation of the contribution of habitats to native flora and fauna is discussed. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB A Concerted Action has been initiated to discuss the assessment of sustainable agro-landscape values in the EU. The objective is to find out how criteria and parameters can be defined that would help farmers, authorities and politicians to manage the agro-landscape towards sustainability and socio/cultural appreciation. Such parameters should most probably consist of a general mainframe with compatible regional specifications. They could eventually be a base for income support/cross-compliance type of payments that farmers receive for their landscape management performance. Referring to the papers presented in this special issue, an effort is made to integrate the values proposed by the wide range of participating disciplines into a consistent and knowledgeable system. This is done by linking the different values as mentioned by the participants to the human motivations, phrased according to Maslow, that they are meant to serve. The disciplines present have been provisionally clustered into three areas with two main issues: (1) environment (resource conditions) and ecology (biological relations); (2) economy (flows of finances and services) and sociology (participative procedures); (3) psychology (appreciation and aesthetics) and anthropology (history and ethics). In these three realms, they are perceived as representing a double hierarchy of priorities: from the environment onward they represent the evolutionary option of basic human needs, evolving from sheer survival to the development of the individual potentials (food first, then ethics). From the cultural aspect of ethics to the environmental conditions they represent a more humanistic (humane), immaterial priority of ethical values, leading social and economic priorities to their environmental impacts. From this effort, indications are derived pointing at options for a coherent system of agro-landscape values, especially when seen in the perspective of sustainable land use. A table showing the various agro-landscape quality aspects is presented. Throughout this paper, the agro-landscape is perceived as an integrated product of human actions, of agro-technical, political and mental (ethical) character. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB The coastal areas of East Africa are centers of economic activities and population growth. As a result environmental conditions are deteriorating rapidly. Pollution, destruction of natural habitats and overfishing are some of the main problems which are posing an increasing threat to the life and well-being of increasing numbers of people in the countries of Eastern Africa including the Island States. In 1993, the governments in the region met and agreed on a program of action to achieve a more sustainable development of the coastal areas (The Arusha Resolution on integrated Coastal Zone Management in Eastern Africa including Island States). This article attempts to assess development over the last five to six years. In some countries of the region critical recommendations have not been acted on at all or to a limited extent only. in the Second Policy Conference on Integrated Coastal Zone Management in Eastern Africa, held in the Seychelles in October 1996, the countries agreed to make more concerted attempts to improve the situation, including the development and implementation of a strategy for capacity building as well as the establishment of a multisectoral coordinating mechanism for ICZM in each country.

TI Tourism and biodiversity conservation: The Sikkim Himalaya
SO AMBIO
LA English
DT Article
AB The Sikkim Himalaya is an area of high biodiversity and cultural heterogeneity with distinctive ethnic groups, mountain peaks, sacred lakes, and monasteries, making it a place of tourist attraction. The annual influx of visitors into Sikkim has increased by about 155% over a span of 5 years (1988-1994). Trekking, nature and recreational tourism are growing very rapidly in the Sikkim Himalaya. The socioeconomic conditions for people involved in the tourism business have also improved. The State has a rich tradition of nature conservation. However, local needs and increased tourist activities are causing some environmental degradation to this unspoilt region. Based on three of the most commonly used tourist destinations, the perception of local stakeholders and their attitudes, and discussions with authorities, this paper analyzes the dynamics of tourism growth and biodiversity and its impact on resources, environment, local communities and the state economy. Tourism in Sikkim is growing and is expected to reach ca. 400000 tourists per year by the end of this century. There is a vast scope for increased tourism in Sikkim that must be viewed with response to environment preservation, and local communities must be involved with such programs. This paper illustrates how tourism activities may be implemented and managed sustainably so that vegetation and culture are protected, and tourist benefits can reach the local community.

TI Ethical dilemmas in current planning for polio eradication
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH
LA English
DT Article
ID POLIOMYELITIS
AB Intensification of polio eradication efforts worldwide raises concerns about costs and benefits for poor countries. A major argument for global funding is the high benefit-cost ratio of eradication; however, financial benefits are greatest for rich countries. By contrast, the greatest costs are borne by poor countries; the Pan American Health Organization has estimated that host countries bore 80% of costs for polio eradication in the Americas. The 1988 World Health Assembly resolution setting up the polio Eradication Initiative carried the proviso that programs should strengthen health infrastructures. Drastic cuts in donor funding for health make this commitment even more important. Two international evaluations have reported both positive and negative effects of polio and Expanded Programme on Immunization programs on the functioning and sustainability of primary health care. Negative effects were greatest in poor countries with many other diseases of public health importance. If poor countries are expected to divert funds from their own urgent priorities, donors should make solid commitments to long-term support for sustainable health development.

AB Tropical rain forests are characterized by a complex and spatially heterogeneous structure. It is essential to analyze the factors of this heterogeneity in order to set up sustainable management policies in these environments. We have studied the influence of topography on floristic structure, considering 3 ha of forest with contrasted relief. Correspondance analysis has shown that topography acts through drainage, leading to different specific compositions on ridge, slope and valley. It operates also in relation to forest dynamics, favouring pioneer species on steep slopes. In addition, this influence decreases as topographic heterogeneity is reduced; other factors related to forest internal characteristics then govern floristic structure. Moreover, this study brings new data concerning floristic composition and ecology of forests in this area, as well as topographical preferences of many species. Topography appears to be a key factor regarding the structure and the dynamics of tropical rain forests on contrasted relief, and should be considered in modelling.

DE livestock management; dryland; rangeland feed; sustainability
ID GLOBAL CHANGE
AB Livestock production from the drylands is quite important both in terms of the volume of product produced and in respect to the number of people dependent on livestock for their livelihood. Drylands support the full spectrum of production systems from commercial ranching in Australia, western USA, Mexico, Argentina and southern Africa through various gradations of crop-livestock systems in Africa and Asia to traditional nomadic and semi-nomadic subsistence systems. Almost everywhere, livestock production is undergoing rapid change in response to political, social, economic, environmental and demographic pressures. In this paper, we will outline the characteristics of various production systems, review their prospects and identify the problems and challenges facing them. We will assess the likely impact of global climate change and of the new technologies and the new economic world order. Finally, we will try to predict what the 21st century will be like for the millions of people whose livelihoods depend on the grazing by domesticated livestock.

DE arid areas; watershed management; alternate land use systems
AB A study on watershed management was initiated in 1986-87 at Jhanwar village (District, Jodhpur) and surveys were conducted to assess the problems, resources and potential of the area. The action plan was prepared and implemented. Farmers hi the watershed area showed keen and sustained interest in adoption of improved dryland farming technologies, including sustainable land use systems. Productivity analysis of watershed area indicated considerable improvement in gross monetary returns under different cropping systems. Water harvesting, through creation of farm ponds and its recycling in agro-horticulture (Ziziphus mauritiana) system resulted in diversified production (fruit, fuel and fodder) and sustained 1.14 adult cattle unit ha(-1) yr(-1). Development of pastures in community grazing lands increased forage production (2-3 t ha(-1)) over traditional methods (0.3-0.4 t ha(-1)). Adoption of various physical and biological land treatments in the eroded rocky catchment reduced the soil erosion and increased the ground water recharge: The program has resulted in an overall increase in the productivity by 25-30%. Although highly location specific, such a model has high replicability in large part of arid tropics in India and elsewhere.

ID WORLD-SYSTEMS; EVOLUTION
AB The goal of this paper is to create a theoretical context out of which can emerge a method for measuring the overall development of countries and therefore their position within the structure of the global economy. That context asks for a rethinking of development as other than the western model informing development studies over the last several decades. Instead, the view of development urged here is one that defines the progress of any society according to the goals it sets for itself. Wealth, or capital, is therefore more broadly defined as all of the potential resources that make this development possible. The translation of this philosophical stance into a working model for development studies draws from three theoretical sources-world-systems theory, complex systems theory, and ecological economics. The conceptual model is then operationalized as a multidimensional measure of development, and contrasted with the western tradition of chiefly defining development as national income or GNP per capita. The results offer some insights into the status of development among countries within the global economic system.

TI Ventilatory capacities at sea level and high altitude
SO AVIATION SPACE AND ENVIRONMENTAL MEDICINE

DT Article
ID INSPIRATORY MUSCLES; FLOW; ENDURANCE; EXERCISE; HYPOXIA; FATIGUE; HUMANS
AB Because air is less dense at high altitude (HA), airway resistance is reduced and maximum inspiratory and expiratory flows are greater than at sea level (SL). Despite the reduction in airway resistance, ventilatory muscle endurance may be decreased by hypobaric hypoxia and, thus, may be a factor in limiting exercise at HA. To explore the effects of HA on ventilatory capacities and their relation to ventilatory demands of exercise, we measured 15-s maximum voluntary ventilation (MVV), 15-min maximum sustainable ventilation (MSV), and maximum airway pressures (PImax and PEmax) in 18 healthy young men at SL and HA (Pikes Peak, 4300 m, or hypobaric chamber, PB similar to 460 mmHg). In eight of these subjects ventilatory capacities were compared with exercise ventilations. We also measured the effects of 36% O-2 on the MSV in 12 of the subjects exposed to simulated altitude. Similar results were obtained at either simulated or actual HA. We found that MW increased (p < 0.001) by 20% and the MSV (p < 0.001) by 15% at HA. Administration of 36% O-2 at HA increased MSV further by 5% with no effect on MVV. No effect of HA on maximum inspiratory and expiratory pressures was found. We confirmed previous findings of modest increases in forced 1-s expired volume (FEV1) and slight decreases in forced vital capacity (FVC) at HA. At both SL and HA, the MSV exceeded the ventilatory demands or submaximal cycle exercise that could be sustained for about 30 min. During progressive cycle exercise to exhaustion, however, peak (V) over dot E was not different from MW, either at SL or HA. We conclude that the small, but significant, increase in MSV with 36% O-2 administration at HA suggests that hypoxia decreases ventilatory endurance for flow loads as determined by the MSV. Thus, the possibility that ventilatory limits have a role in cessation of exercise at high altitude cannot be ruled out.

AB In 'good genes' models of sexual selection, females choose mates whose genes confer increased survival value to offspring. One possible index of male quality is aerobic capacity (the metabolic basis of sustainable exercise), which is likely to be important for fitness. If it is both heritable and ecologically valuable, high aerobic capacity would be a direct signal of male genetic quality. If aerobic capacity is phenotypically plastic but dependent on health, it may provide an indirect index of male quality in other heritable traits (e.g. pathogen resistance). We examined the relationship between courtship behaviour, aerobic capacity (measured as maximum rates of oxygen consumption), and mating success in red junglefowl (Gallus gallus). We also tested the effects of intestinal parasites (the nematode Ascaridia galli) and plasma testosterone levels on aerobic capacity and behaviour. We found no relationship between testosterone and behaviour, mating success, or aerobic capacity. A. galli infection changed the relationship between mass and aerobic capacity; infected males had lower aerobic capacity than uninfected males, but only for small males. Discriminant function analysis suggested that aerobic capacity and display behaviour, together with male ornaments (comb size and colour), were the most important factors determining the mating success of males. However, aerobic capacity and display rate were not strongly correlated, and the manner by which females can discriminate among males with differing aerobic capacity is unclear.

ID COMMON PROPERTY; RESOURCES
AB A review of contributions to the resource conservation literature shows that sustainability problems are seen as caused by ''common property.'' This ''tragedy of the commons'' is understood as the result of the failure to assign fully property rights to individuals. The supporting assumptions and premises to these ''privatarian'' arguments are explicated and examined. After refuting the main premises, it is argued that the application of neoclassical assumptions and premises overlooks other legitimate forms of ownership as effective solutions to the tragedy of the commons. In revisiting other categories of ownership, the limits of privatarianism are identified and the prospects for solutions to sustainability problems are expanded.

   input-output analysis
SO ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
LA English
DT Article
DE sustainability; tropical forests; Indonesia; logging; plantations;
   input-output analysis
AB The extraordinarily high ecological values of Indonesia's tropical forests are being threatened by excessive and careless logging. This paper reports the results of a dynamic input-output model used to make projections of the growth of demand for logs through to the year 2020 and of the likely impact of this growth on forest degradation measured by rates of soil erosion and deforestation. Policy variables built into the model scenarios include the rate of plantation establishment and the 'technologies' used to log natural forests. The results show that the critical variables determining the future of Indonesia's forests will be the overall rate of growth of the economy and the rate of plantation establishment. However, even with a marked shift to plantations and adoption of much more sustainable practices for logging natural forests (both of which are in practice unlikely), degradation of Indonesia's tropical forests will be severe.

AB There are many methodological approaches within ecological economics. One of the principal modes of analysis is a modified version of the 'standard neoclassical model'. This paper examines the parallels which emerge between the ideas of some ecological economists concerning production and the ideas of others concerning consumption, when these ideas are interpreted in the neoclassical paradigm. It is well known that ecological economics is characterized by arguments concerning limits to substitution between inputs (energy, natural capital, etc., vs. manufactured capital, labor, etc.) in production and the implications these have for sustainability. However, various authors have also expressed concerns regarding limits to substitution in consumption, either between environmental assets and other goods or between basic needs commodities and other goods. Though the specific reasons for non-substitution are different in the production and consumption cases, the underlying theme is that individual commodities and other inputs have unique physical or other properties which make them poor substitutes. Ideas about irreversibility in production and economic development are also prominent in ecological economics. Likewise, many authors have argued for similar irreversibilities in consumption behavior. In analogy to the term technological change, I coin the term ''preferential change'' to describe these phenomena. The linking themes in this case are that the economy-environment system is evolutionary in character and that external effects-intended and unintended consequences of actions or processes imposed on other parties or resources-are all pervasive.

DE System of National Accounts; green accounting; stocks and flows; weak
   and strong sustainability; macroeconomic analysis and policy
AB Through the lens of conventional national accounting, resource depletion and natural environment degradation often appear misleadingly as desirable economic growth. The old System of National Accounts (SNA) has been revised and a set of environmental 'satellite accounts' proposed. Certain weaknesses, however, pervade the new proposals. The conventional measurements remain largely unaltered, and the satellite accounts are of unclear purpose and unnecessarily complex. As proposed, they rely on the valuation of environmental stocks, while the economically more important flow accounts, to their detriment, are to be derived indirectly from changes in stock values. The SNA, the paper stresses, is primarily an economic framework, incapable of capturing all environmental change, and the national accounts are far more useful economically than environmentally. Greening the accounts would be optional for most affluent countries, whose overriding environmental concern is pollution. This can be addressed directly through taxation and regulation. Pollution information in satellite accounts can indeed be valuable, but revised and fully integrated resource accounting is a priority concern for those developing countries that are running down natural resources, and for which conventional accounting distorts macroeconomic measurement, analysis and policy. The paper argues that green accounting can only ensure income (sometimes called weak) sustainability, which should be considered as a step leading ultimately to an ecological (or stronger) sustainability.

AB In the area of fresh surface water resources, which are gradually becoming more scarce, sustainable utilization implies the need for policies aiming to provide adequate water supplies for everyone in both national and international contexts. Many international river basins are shared without any formal intergovernmental agreement, while bilateral agreements guaranteeing amicable cooperation amount to a handful. This paper presents a simple economic-ecologic model within which it examines input-output controls, social input prices, bilateral water trade, a water market for all water users, and a fixed water allocation agreement, as possible water policies for cross border river water sharing. All of these policies can satisfy the conditions for maximum joint economic benefits, while simultaneously working towards maintaining the functional integrity of river ecosystems. In theory, therefore, these policies are of equal use. There are, however, several costs associated with policy administration which are hidden and must explicitly be taken into account. The analysis indicates that bilateral water trade can prove a workable, efficient and sustainable policy for cross border water sharing.

AB The diversity of plant life forms in tropical forests affords the opportunity for assembly of plant combinations, both natural and managed, that make full use of resources and sustain high productivity. The influence of combining life forms on productivity and resource use was evaluated using three fast-growing tree species (Hyeronima alchorneoides, Cedrela odorata, and Cordia alliodora); each species was grown alone and with two perennial, large-stature, self-supporting monocots (Euterpe oleracea and Heliconia imbricata).
   Aboveground net primary productivity was extremely high in all stands. The monocots did not contribute significantly to the productivity of the Hyeronima polycultures, which was 4.5-8.4 g.m(-2).d(-1) between 18 and 36 mo. In contrast, the monocots accounted for 57% of the productivity (9.7 g.m(-2).d(-1)) of Cedrela polycultures and 67% of the productivity (6.8 g.m(-2).d(-1)) of the Cordia polycultures, by age 3 yr. The leaf area and density of fine roots in the Cedrela and Cordia polycultures were also significantly increased by the presence of the monocots, reaching or surpassing the levels found in the Hyeronima stands.
   The high productivity of Hyeronima, coupled with poor growth of its interplanted monocots, indicated that Hyeronima was able to achieve nearly complete use of resources. Ecosystem productivity and resource capture were increased when the monocots were grown with the other two tree species, and this occurred because of the inability of the tree species to completely utilize available resources, which provided an opportunity for the monocots to flourish in the understory. Monocot productivity in the Cedrela stands was additive to that of the trees, indicating complementary resource use between the monocots and this tree species. In the case of Cordia, tree productivity was slowed by the monocots, but this decline was more than compensated for by the high productivity of the associated monocots.
   Whether in natural forests or human-constructed agroforestry systems, the presence of dominant species that do not fully exploit all available resources allows the coexistence of other species and creates the potential for complementary resource use. The resource use characteristics of such species should be a key consideration in forest restoration efforts and in the design of sustainable land use systems.

AB Various policies and programs have been created to promote energy conservation ill Asia. Energy conservation centers, energy conservation standards and labeling, commercial building codes, industrial energy use regulations, and utility demand-side management (DSM) are but a few of them. This article attempts to analyze the roles of these different policies and programs in seven typical Asian countries: China, Indonesia, Japan, Pakistan, South Korea, the Philippines, and Thailand The conclusions show that the two most important features behind the success policies and programs are (1) government policy support and (2) long-run self-sustainability of financial support to the programs.

DE ecotourism; Peru; tropical forests; Tambopata; sustainable development;
   land tenure
AB Several authors have suggested that ecotourism can enhance the value of intact wildlands and thereby promote conservation. Two rainforest lodges dating from the 1970s and located in southeastern Amazonian Peru have been held up as early success stories in tourism-driven conservation, but a more recent assessment reveals that both lodges have since lost their rainforest reserves to encroachment. One of the major reasons for failure was that the national land laws in effect se the time did not allow the purchase of land titles. Recently, Peru has instituted a process for the purchase of land titles in the rainforest. One lodge has used the new land tenure laws with some success to create a rainforest reserve. The very attempt to buy land for purposes of conservation can promote encroachment and land-buying speculation, and the lodge's current agreement with its neighbours to provide a school in exchange for non-encroachment is fraught with moral hazards and appears unstable over the long term. Tourism can promote conservation primarily at the national level, and ecotourism projects in the Peruvian Amazon can stabilize land-use patterns at least in the short term. However, the conservation of habitat over the long-term will rest primarily an the ability of the State to enforce a consistent land use policy with regard to land tenure and Park protection.

ID REGULATORY ENFORCEMENT; CATASTROPHE
AB Despite steady injection of public funds by successive administrations, the Canadian fishery industry is characterized by resource depletion, vessel tie-ups, and overcapacity, which have led to plant closures and rising unemployment. This paper assesses the progress Canadian marine policies have been making towards rational use and conservation of fisheries and promotion of employment and economic development in fishing communities since 1977.
   The analysis begins with the creation of the 200-mile exclusive economic zone (EEZ) and its rationale in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), namely conservation. State subsidies for fleet upgrading, industry modernization, marketing, and the introduction of quota systems, such as the individual transferable quotas (ITQs) and enterprise quotas (EQs), are identified as the key policy initiatives which might realize an economically-viable fishing industry in the post-1977 period. These policies produced corporate expansion and prosperity in the mid-1980s, but there followed corporate losses because of Canadian over-dependence on American markets and sharp quota cuts.
   With regard to conservation, shortcomings are identified in the virtual population analysis model (VPA), and the inability of the Department of Fisheries to monitor fishing effort by domestic and foreign vessels. The need for radical change in the future direction of marine policies is emphasized and arguments made which support the following objectives: elimination of ecologically-harmful fishing technologies; use of community quotas (with a modified individual quota system); strengthening of community management systems and development of comanagement approaches to fisheries management, involving government and fishing communities.

AB Over the past two decades 'sustainable development' has grown from a term expressing concern for social and environmental problems to an international craze. The concept purportedly offers cures for the many and diverse problems afflicting modem society and because it involves an integrated approach, the sustainable development fashion has resulted in much-needed collaboration between specialists from diverse backgrounds, to work on the complex problems involved in the interactions between society and environment. However, the term is rarely defined, and, being stylish and institutionalized, the 'sustainability movement' now directs the way much science and policy for biological conservation and development are designed, executed and evaluated. Occult, but basic, in nearly ail discourses of sustainable development is the axiom of continual growth; and, in most cases, instead of offering a true solution to contemporary problems, the term is a source of confusion, contention and even deception. It is imperative that the use of this term, especially in multidisciplinary, international and scientific spheres, be based on clear understanding of its meaning, and that the issue of growth and the concept of limits be clearly incorporated into the core of the discussion.

DE atmospheric change; sustainability index
AB Assessing the major atmospheric issues - acidic deposition, climate change, ozone depletion, smog, hazardous air pollutants and suspended particulate matter - together rather than individually provides many advantages. But to be successful, this integration requires a common method for relating these issues to one another. This is a scientific question. In order to successfully resolve the atmospheric issues (a policy question) requires communication of the relevant science to nonscientists in plain language. Non-scientists need to be part of the development of the structure of the communications vehicle. The objective for multi-issue assessment, and thus for the development of an index to track the state of the environment in an integrated way, is of course related to the desire to achieve environmentally sustainable development. Sustainability can be represented by a 3-legged stool and is an apt symbol of the struggle of Canadians to balance their ecological, economic and social needs. Although the environment is the basis of all life, humankind has created society and has defined how that society will function (the economy). The three legs of the stool (ecosystem, economy, society) represent the three parts of the 'sustainability' balance. The seat of the stool represents the 'governance process' and the three legs are deeply embedded in this governance process because it is the 'governance' which ensures the stability of the system over time. The challenge then is to measure the stability of the 'stool' in a way which all can understand. This measure of 'sustainability' must respond to individual and collective actions which improve or degrade the environment. This paper presents such a framework for a 'sustainability index' and outlines the next steps that need to be taken. The framework starts from the premise that ecosystem, economy and society are equal parts of 'sustainability'. Ecosystem indices are representative measures of the state of the environment while economic indices are representative measures of the state of the economy. Social indices in some way have to measure the state of society. The trick, for a successful sustainability index, will be to ensure that the important aspects of the ecosystem, the economy and society, are included. The overall index must be relatively stable but must be responsive to changes.

AB It is proposed that the prerequisites for a low risk to major cancers-breast, colon, lung, prostate, melanoma (as, for example in Africans, Chinese and Japanese)-include upregulated hypothalamic dopamingergic activity compared to depressed noradrenergic/thyrogenic function and raised vagal tone, and a neuroendocrine constellation that promotes improved immune efficiency and is inimical to the onset of aversive cell responses. Since the integrity of these tissues is regulated by hypothalamic-hypophyseal hormones, under tonic dopaminergic inhibition, cancers are potentially preventable as long as dopaminergic integrity is maintained, or the decline in ageing is slowed. Evidence for the impact of upregulated dopamine on tumour prevention includes: (1) a reduced (40%) rate of colonic cancer in exercise-trained ageing subjects; (2) reduced expected rates of lung/colon cancers, and skin tumours in prolonged post-menopausal oestrogen replacement; (3) the virtual suppression of all cancers during pregnancy (when dopamine synthesis increases); (4) the low rate of bronchogenic carcinoma correlates with reduced enzymatic conversion of dopamine to noradrenaline; and (5) neuroblastoma (specifically dopamine dysregulated tumour) regresses spontaneously on dopamine normalization. Similar tumour reduction is anticipated by controlling the intake of calories. The subtlety of the switch to upregulated dopamine, the speed of translation at the cellular level and the sustainability of responses as long as the initiating stimulus persists (as exposed by pregnancy), underline the plasticity of the neuroendocrine mechanism and ease of manipulation. Long exposure to environmental iodine deficiency, as seen for example in Africans and Chinese, reveals a crucial dopamine-thyroid action that slows cell timing mechanisms. The common neurohormonal basis identified for the prevention of human cancers has practical application, with reasonably assured positive results.

AB This paper applies a fuzzy multi-objective programming model for the evaluation of sustainable management strategies of optimal land development in the reservoir watershed. The environmental goals lie in the conservation of reservoir water quality and the economic goals focus on the rewards from various uses of land within the watershed. Carrying capacity of the land and assimilative capacity of the reservoir an two major limitations encountered in systems analysis. In particular, it demonstrates how imprecise information in such a system can be quantified by specific membership functions in a fuzzy multi-objective analytical framework, It shows that the fuzzy outputs associated with different weight distribution sin decision analysis can successfully reflect system complexity and generate more realistic management policies. A case study of the planning for land use programs in the Tweng-Wen reservoir watershed in Taiwan was demonstrated. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

TI Planning for sustainable development: Insights from the literatures of
   political science
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID POLICY CHANGE; GOVERNMENT
AB Over the past decade European political leaders have increasingly come to refer to 'sustainable development' as a legitimate focus of government activity. Starting from the premises that sustainable development is a complex and contested ideal, and that experiences with state planning in the twentieth century have been deeply ambiguous, this article reflects on the insights which political science can shed on the new social project of 'planning for sustainable development'. The discussion centres on three relevant political science literatures -meta critiques of planning,'new governance' debates, and enquiries into policy related learning. Consideration of these perspectives suggest that to the extent that it is possible for 'planning for sustainable development' to attain its declared objectives this will depend upon the integration of sustainable development norms into existing planning structures and modalities, the extensive development of co-operative management initiatives, and vigorous debates about alternative futures. Coordination among the inevitably disjointed and partially contradictory efforts of multiple agencies will rely upon the integrative potential of the sustainable development norm, central government initiatives, and collision, negotiation and mutual adjustment.

ID EUROPEAN-COMMUNITY; WHEAT
AB Definitions and concepts of production ecology are presented as a basis for development of alternative production technologies characterized by their input-output combinations. With these concepts the relative importance of several growth factors and inputs is investigated to explain actual yield levels and resource-use efficiencies. Differences between potential and actual levels are analyzed to open ways for improved production technologies. The basis of the analysis is knowledge of basic physical, chemical, physiological and ecological processes at soil, field and crop level. New production technologies and their input-output combinations can be used in studies aimed at the exploration of options for sustainable agricultural production systems and land use. The concepts allow a systematic analysis and quantification of input-output combinations and clearly discriminate between bio-physical possibilities and socio-economic constraints and objectives. They help in defining objectives and means for agricultural production and land use, and may be valuable as aids to communication between various disciplines involved in studying the possibility and feasibility of future production technologies and land use options. The concepts production level, physical environment, target-oriented approach, production technique, production activity, and production orientation are applied to identify new technologies and production systems at various levels of scale, each requiring different types of information. In this paper some examples of applications are given at field, farm and at regional level.

AB 1. Recently, fresh attempts have been made to understand the mechanisms structuring species-body size distributions. Of these, the model developed by Brown, Marquet & Taper (1993) (BMT), which uses measures of resource acquisition and conversion to determine an optimal body size (M*) for a given assemblage, is potentially the most significant. Here, we examine the novelty of the model and some of its assumptions, and test its empirical predictions.
   2. The BMT model is one of a suite of physiological/life-history models examining size at maturity. Such energetic or 'physical' approaches to body size evolution have a considerable modern history and continue to enjoy attention in physiological ecology and life-history theory.
   3. Although mortality significantly influences life-history evolution and mostly precludes the evolution of a body size that maximizes reproductive power output, it is excluded from the BMT model. Likewise, the model assumes that power and not efficiency is maximized, although there are conditions where this is not likely to be the case. Furthermore, the BMT model assumes that resource acquisition and conversion are physiologically limited, although the importance of physiological limitation in ecology remains unclear.
   4. Additional assumptions of the model include coincidence of the optimum body size of an individual and a species, when in many species this is not the case, and coincidence of the most speciose size class in an assemblage and the optimal body size. Similarly, the probable influence of differences in the scaling of various parameters at the intra- and interspecific levels are not addressed, nor are the impacts of discrepancies between phenotypic and genotypic optima.
   5. The measures of resource acquisition and conversion used in the BMT model are not only problematic, but also limit the utility of the model. If the scaling constants and exponents of field metabolic rate minus basal metabolic are used as a measure of resource acquisition beyond maintenance needs, and those for intrinsic rate of increase (r(max)) as a measure of resource conversion, the applicability of the model to other taxa can be extended.
   6. Using these measures we show that the model continues to provide a reasonable prediction of M* for the terrestrial mammal assemblages of both North America and Australia. However, when taxonomic inclusiveness is reduced by removing eutherians from the Australian data set and by examining the predictions of the model with regard to diprotodonts only, the model fails to provide reasonable predictions of M*.
   7. Given problems with the BMT model, but its clear ability to predict the modal body size of at least two terrestrial mammal assemblages, we suggest that there is considerable scope for exploring the relationships between resource acquisition and conversion at the level of the individual and energy partitioning between individuals in multispecies communities.

AB As world population moves to 10-12 billion, there will be, must be, vast development of Earth Resources. If there is to be truly sustainable development, we must use all knowledge about our planet with greater wisdom than in the past. We must integrate all knowledge to solve critical problems like energy supply, food security, waste management and the maintenance of air and water quality for all species who live with us and support us. The Earth Sciences are at the core of our life support systems.

AB In grassland ecosystems, most of the carbon (C) occurs below-ground. Understanding changes in soil fluxes induced by elevated atmospheric CO2 is critical for balancing the global C budget and for managing grassland ecosystems sustainably. In this review, we use the results of short-term (1-2 years) studies of below-ground processes in grassland communities under elevated CO2 to assess future prospects for longer-term increases in soil C storage.
   Results are broadly consistent with those from other plant communities and include: increases in below-ground net primary productivity and an increase in soil C cycling rate, changes in soil faunal community, and generally no increase in soil C storage. Based on other experimental data, future C storage could be favoured in soils of moderate nutrient status, moderate-to-high clay content, and low (or moderately high) soil moisture status. Some support for these suggestions is provided by preliminary results from direct measurements of soil C concentrations near a New Zealand natural CO2-venting spring, and by simulations of future changes in grassland soils under the combined effects of CO2 fertilization and regional climate change.
   Early detection of any increase in soil C storage appears unlikely in complex grassland communities because of (a) the difficulty of separating an elevated CO2 effect from the effects of soil factors including moisture status, (b) the high spatial variability of soil C and (c) the effects of global warming. Several research imperatives are identified for reducing the uncertainties in the effects of elevated atmospheric CO2 on soil C.

TI Sustainable development and urban growth: Precarious habitat and water
   management in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam
SO HABITAT INTERNATIONAL
LA English
DT Article
AB Vietnam is still today one of the poorest countries in the world. For some years now, it has nonetheless represented a pole of economic development in South East Asia, thanks to a government policy of liberalisation of production facilities.
   Economic expansion results in an annual growth rate of the Gross National Product of more than 80%, and a metropolitan concentration of activities.(Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC) accounting for 30% of foreign investment and Hanoi 14%). Within this framework, Vietnamese cities are confronted with extremely serious problems connected with population increase and degradation of natural resources.
   Ho Chi Minh City, the metropolis of South Vietnam, has more than 5 million inhabitants. Economic expansion is marked by the establishment of a great many industrial, commercial and service companies. Another aspect of urban reality, the population density is very high (more than 23,000 inhabitants per square kilometre), working-class housing conditions are of very low quality and public networks do not meet the population's needs.
   Research is currently being carried out by the Environmental Committee of HCMC and the EPFL (Swiss Federal Institute of Technology) in order to establish the relationship between development of the precarious habitat and pollution of the urban water supply. An initial observation may be made:
   Water represents a key element in the development of HCMC. The city is intersected by canals and rivers, used as a dumping ground for all the industrial aid domestic waste, a dwelling place for the most destitute families (makeshift housing on piles), traffic routes for waterway transport and market gardening areas. The question of water utilisation arises because the level of contamination recorded, whether in the conveyance circuit, its domestic use or at the drainage stage, exceeds generally accepted hygiene standards, and constitutes a risk for the population's health.
   It is essential that measures should be taken, particularly in the precarious habitat areas where the population lives at the limit of absolute poverty. According to the survey conducted on the basis of 600 households in two working-class areas, 42% of the active population have unofficial jobs, and the average monthly household income is in the order of 12 US dollars. Under conditions such as these, it is extremely difficult for families to invest in housing and improving the environment.
   Innovative forms of dialogue between public authorities, the people's committees which exist in each subdistrict and the population must form the basis of simple solutions aimed at the creation of jobs and the rehabilitation of these areas. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

TI Dirt and diarrhoea: Formative research in hygiene promotion programmes
SO HEALTH POLICY AND PLANNING
LA English
DT Article
ID BURKINA-FASO; CHILDHOOD DIARRHEA; BEHAVIOR
AB Investment in the promotion of better hygiene for the prevention of diarrhoeal diseases and as a component of water and sanitation programmes is increasing. Before designing programmes capable of sustainably modifying hygiene behaviour in large populations, valid answers to a number of basic questions concerning the site and the intended beneficiaries have to be obtained. Such questions include 'what practices favour the transmission of enteric pathogens?', 'what advantages will be perceived by those who adopt safe practices?' and 'what channels of communication are currently employed by the target population?' A study of hygiene and diarrhoea in Bobo-Dioulasso, Burkina Faso, used a mixture of methods to address such questions. This paper draws on that experience to propose a plan of preliminary research using a variety of techniques which could be implemented over a period of a few months by planners of hygiene promotion programmes. The techniques discussed include structured observation, focus group discussions and behavioural trials, Modest investment in such systematic formative research with clear and limited goals is likely to be repaid many times over in the increased effectiveness of hygiene promotion programmes.

   Machigueuga Indians of the Peruvian Amazon
SO HUMAN ECOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
DE commercialization; deforestation; sustainability; Machiguenga; markets
AB By marshaling empirical data from five Machiguenga communities studied over 20 years, this paper disputes two common assumptions about the behavior of indigenous peoples in the face of increasing commercialization. First, many Amazonian researchers suggest that the social and ecological deterioration confronting native populations results from externally-imposed political, legal and market structures that compel local groups to pursue short-term, unstable economic strategies. Second, these structural explanations are combined with the increasing recognition that indigenous peoples possess a substantial agroecological knowledge to suggest that, if indigenous people receive control of adequate land and resources, they will implement their traditional knowledge in conservative resource management practices. In contrast to these assumptions, this analysis shows that the Machiguenga are not compelled by external forces (such as land tenure, migration policies or economic trends), but instead are active enthusiastic participants seeking to engage the market in order to acquire western goods. Further despite highly adaptive traditional subsistence patterns and a vast agroecological knowledge, households and communities facing increasing degrees of market integration are progressively altering their traditional cropping strategies, planting practices, labor allocation and land use patterns toward a greater emphasis on commodity crop production and domesticated animal breeding. This increasing concentration on income generating activities subverts the environmentally-friendly nature of traditional productive practices and creates a socially, economically, and ecologically unsustainable system.

AB Since the hydrogen movement started in 1974, there has been progress in research, development, demonstration and commercialization activities, covering all aspects of the hydrogen energy system. In order to solve the interrelated problems of depletion of fossil fuels and the environmental impact of the combustion products of fossil fuels, it is desirable to speed up the conversion to the hydrogen energy system. Most established industries have joined the hydrogen movement. There is one exceptioa: the fossil fuel industry. A call is made to the fossil fuel industry to join the hydrogen movement. It is also proposed to change the present economic system with a sustainability economics in order to account for enviionmental damage, recyclability and decommissioning, and thus, ensure a sustainable future.

AB The enlargement of complexity and effects of environmental problems has increased the need for a 'compass' to point us in the direction of sustainability. The four principles - System Conditions - which we have earlier described, along with a step-by-step approach to meet them, is such a compass. The System Conditions are first order principles for Sustainability:
   they do not cover the whole area of Sustainability;
   they are complementary, i.e. they do not overlap;
   they are all necessary;
   they are applicable at different scales and activities.
   The compass provides a model that does not only imply restrictions to business and policy-making, but also opportunities from a self-interest point of view. The model makes it possible to foresee changes regarding demands and costs on the future market. A number of business corporations and municipalities apply the compass as a guiding tool to the future market, asking the following strategic questions for each of the System Conditions:
   (1) Does this measure decrease our dependence on lithospheric metals, fuels and other minerals - primarily when waste from such materials are already accumulating in the ecosphere?
   (2) Does this measure decrease our dependence on persistent unnatural substances, primarily when such substances are already accumulating in the ecosphere?
   (3) Does this measure decrease our dependence on activities which encroach on productive parts of Nature, e.g. long distance transport or other deleterious exploitation of green surfaces, over-fishing, etc?
   (4) Does this measure decrease our dependence on using an unnecessary large amount of resources in relation to added human value?

AB After a brief history of pesticide use and impacts in Latin America, the paper analyzes how agricultural development programmes, from the Green Revolution to the promotion of non-traditional export crops, have perpetuated the pesticide treadmill in the region. A fundamental issue in the paper is to link the pesticide problem to the broader policy, institutional socio-economic and technical changes that must occur if agriculture is to be ecologically sound, economically viable and socially just. By using several examples of biological control and integrated pest management programmes as case studies, ways of promoting the transition of chemical intensive commercial agriculture to a more sustainable and low-external input agriculture are explored. In the policy realm, a series of requirements and incentives to initiate change towards ecological pest management are suggested, including: changing the political-economic structures, countering pressures from the agrochemical industry, disseminating IPM among farmers, broadening education and outreach in IPM.

DE rural poor; extension messages; cultivation choices; institutional

AB This paper is the outcome of a PhD study conducted in two villages of Sri Lanka in relation to technological change and the rural poor with specific reference to agricultural. extension: more precisely, extension messages and methods, cultivation choices, and institutional linkages. The paper reveals that reformulation of the concept of extension (including the civil agronomy dimension) will allow agricultural extension services to adopt non-directive or problem-solving strategies towards an overall development of the rural (poor) population. As a consequence, the poor can influence the content of the extension agenda and the technical message arising therefrom. This influence in turn, will shape the composition of the production support services in rural development such as extension, credit, mechanisation, input delivery and marketing in civil society.

DE sustainable tourism; dependency; protected areas; local community;
   livelihood needs
AB During the last two decades, extensive networks of protected areas in many developing countries have stimulated growth in protected area-based tourism. As protected area tourism occurs in isolated and remote rural regions, it is often assumed that such regions will experience stimulation of economic activities induced by tourism from which local people will be able to derive tangible benefits. Evidence suggests that this is rarely the case. Indeed, in the majority of protected areas, benefits have hardly reached the local community which bears the heaviest burden of protected area management. When a protected area is established and opened for tourism, it is often outsiders who rush in to siphon-off a major portion of the tourism income generated locally. Nevertheless, there are some pioneering approaches such as CAMPFIRE (Communal Areas Management Programme for Indigenous Resources) and ACAP (Annapurna Conservation Area Project) which have attempted to fulfil livelihood needs of local communities using benefits derived from wildlife or nature-based tourism. Both projects emphasize a people-centred, participatory democratic approach. Citing various examples from developing countries, this paper discusses the dependent nature of tourism in general, impact of protected area tourism on local livelihoods, and some constraints and opportunities for the long-term viability of protected areas.

AB SETTING: Community care organizations in sub-Saharan Africa.
   OBJECTIVES: To evaluate current tuberculosis (TB) care in community health care organizations in sub-Saharan Africa, to assess their potential contribution to tuberculosis care, and to develop a model for expanded community participation in effective TB control.
   DESIGN: Quantitative assessment of tuberculosis care and cross-sectional assessment of qualitative measures in 14 community care organizations in Uganda, Zambia, South Africa and Malawi.
   RESULTS: The community care organizations assessed mainly provided care for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and aquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) patients, and received funding from non-governmental organizations. Shortcomings in tuberculosis care included delays in diagnosis (which was often not based on sputum examination), drug shortages, low completion rates, high default rates, inadequate recording, little interaction with government tuberculosis programmes, and inadequate training of staff. However, one organization that provided primarily tuberculosis care and collaborated closely with the district tuberculosis programme and hospital attained a high treatment completion rate. The strong points of the community care organizations that favour a potential role of community participation in tuberculosis care were accessibility and staff motivation.
   CONCLUSION: Despite most community care organizations' shortcomings in tuberculosis care, they do have the potential to improve the care of tuberculosis patients, thus reducing the load on overstretched health facilities. Their potential impact on tuberculosis control depends on their population coverage and sustainability. HIV/AIDS community care organizations with strengthened management of tuberculosis care could serve as a model for expanded community participation in tuberculosis control. Operational research is needed to assess the feasibility and cost-effectiveness of community-based TB care.

AB Four crews of firefighters built fireline for 7 min periods (with intervening rests), without fire, at self-chosen 'slow', 'normal', and 'fast' rates in Australian eucalypt forests. Individuals differed twofold for energy expenditure (EE, measured as oxygen uptake by the Douglas bag technique) and relative work load (RWL, i.e % of maximum oxygen uptake), and threefold for productivity and efficiency (productivity per unit EE). They maintained their differences in all stages of the test and also while suppressing free-running wildland fires, showing that the work rate adopted was a stable characteristic of the individuals' work behaviour. The technique of raking fireline did not constrain EE but instead allowed firefighters to call upon their maximum work capacity for urgent tasks with no reduction in efficiency. EE, RWL, and heart rate increased linearly with productivity whereas perceived exertion and pulmonary ventilation increased curvilinearly, rising steeply at 'fast' work rates. We suggest that perceived exertion and the ventilatory threshold (the upper limit of comfortable breathing) provide the cues by which firefighters pace themselves at sustainable work rates that balance their fireline productivity against its physiological cost. The findings were highly consistent over four crews, three summers, and two regions and are thus generally applicable to bushfire suppression in southern Australia.

AB Timed-activity studies were made of four crews while they attempted to suppress well-developed experimental bushfires of intensities commonly faced by handtool crews, and also while they built fireline in the same way without fire, during three summers in Australian eucalypt forests. Fireline construction with rakehoes (including step up) occupied, on average, 63% of the crew's time. Firefighters raked for 38 seconds followed by 10 seconds of step up, thus obtaining frequent brief rests for the arm muscles involved in raking. Energy expenditure (EE) of all fire-suppression activities averaged 516 W, equivalent to a relative work load (RWL) of 45% of the men's maximum work capacity. Pulmonary ventilation averaged 55 (range 38-83) 1 min(-1) during raking and 40 (range 23-73) 1 min(-1) during all activities. Each firefighter built 1.90 m(2) of fireline per minute of raking, and 1.21 m(2) min(-1) over the whole period of the attack Each hour the six men engaged in fireline construction built and held 436 m(2), i.e. 512 metres of fireline 0.85 metres wide. Individuals consistently differed twofold in their self-chosen levels of raking EE and RWL and threefold in productivity and efficiency (productivity per unit EE), whereas average raking EE did not differ between crews, nor between attacks with and without fire. We conclude that wildland firefighters pace themselves at their own preferred and sustainable work rates.

AB Four crews of male firefighters were studied while they attempted to suppress well-developed experimental bushfires of intensities commonly faced by hand-tool crews, and also while they built fireline in the same way without fire, during three summers in Australian eucalypt forests. Multiple-regression analyses of their responses showed that they maintained their deep body temperature and heart rate at constant and sustainable levels over a wide range of work duration and intensity, and of heat from weather and fire that frequently exceeded the limits recommended in current heat-stress guidelines. Energy expenditure declined slightly with warmer weather and fire although not with rake duration. Productivity was unchanged by warmer weather but declined slightly with rake duration and with fire. The findings confirm the effectiveness of the firefighters' work practices that allowed them to set their own pace, and of their light, well ventilated clothing that permitted unrestricted evaporation of sweat.

AB The scenario workshop is an example of the Scandinavian tradition of citizen involvement. The method is a mix of scenario and workshop. Scenarios produced by experts (scientists) are presented to a local community in a workshop lasting two to three days during which local participants produce criticism, debate and plans for community action. The method, originally used to actively involve citizens in the development of environmentally sustainable cities in Denmark, is now in use throughout Europe, as the various EU directorates have become very aware of their usefulness. A method has now been generated at the Copenhagen Business School for the field of transport. Four transport scenarios were generated relating to post-Fordist production systems, transport and the concept of sustainable mobility. They are to be presented in a transport-intensive region of Denmark to analyse barriers against environmentally induced adjustments to the transport sector and to find new solutions to the dilemma by creating dialogue between planners, politicians and transport managers.

DE cattle distributions; grazing; modelling; remote sensing; spatial
   patterns
AB 1. Patterns of change in vegetation cover, as measured by multitemporal remote sensing using the LANDSAT Multispectral Scanner, were used to model domestic cattle distributions in the arid range-lands of central Australia.
   2. Model assumptions that paddock shape and waterpoint layout have no effect on rate of cover change (and thus cattle distribution), other than through changes in the area of a paddock and the individual landscape types within it, at each distance from water seem justified.
   3. Model assumptions that rate of cover change in a particular landscape type at a given distance from water is unaffected by the mix of other landscape types around it also seem justified.
   4. Land degradation appears to have only a limited effect on the distribution of cattle compared with differences in grazing preference for individual landscape types and the number of cattle present in these rangelands.
   5. Generalized cattle distribution models can be derived for broad landscape types on the basis of distance from water and grazing preference. These models can be applied irrespective of the number of cattle present.
   6. The models have potential for incorporation into decision support systems for paddock design and waterpoint layout. Such systems could ensure the effective and sustainable utilization of arid rangeland vegetation by cattle.

TI Design for flexibility and affordability: Learning from the post-war
   home
SO JOURNAL OF ARCHITECTURAL AND PLANNING RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
AB North America is currently experiencing a housing crisis. Demand for affordable single-family homes far exceeds supply, a situation that is forcing would-be owners to rent until they can afford the available homes that surpass both their needs and means. This situation is not a new one. The return of ten million American war veterans in 1945, coupled with the stagnant state of construction following the Depression years, created a housing crisis on an even greater scale. The crisis stimulated research into new building technology and resulted in the development of new construction materials and new designs for small houses. The objective of the housing industry became the provision of attractive, low-cost homes in a rapid, cost-effective manner. The post-war housing crisis resulted in the application of a wealth of technological and design innovations in what traditionally had been a conservative industry. A similar transformation of the homebuilding industry will again be necessary to rectify current imbalances. In this paper, the author synthesizes the results of a study of single-family, detached housing innovations representative of the period 1945-1959. The author then demonstrates how successful post-war housing innovations can be modified to provide affordable housing today. Three models of affordable homes that were recently designed for the marketplace by the author and his colleagues are presented. They embody principles inspired by the restrictions of the post-war era and that respond to the needs of today's housing user, namely affordability, adaptability, and sustainability. Two of these designs go beyond the drawing board as they have been successfully accepted in at least one North American housing market.

AB Medicinal plants continue to be of use for the treatment of disease on a world-wide basis. Plants are a logical source for new drug discovery and currently many thousands are being screened for biological activities in order to develop new drug entities. In recent years novel anticancer and antimalarial drugs have been developed from plant sources. Although there are many potent and specific drugs available today for the treatment of disease, there is a public swing to alternative/complementary medicine, including the use of herbal medicines, in developed countries, The sale of herbal products in Europe during 1992 was US$1.4 billion. The majority of herbal products on sale in the UK are not licensed as medicines and are nor assessed for their quality, safety, and efficacy as are licensed medicines. This is a matter for concern to both consumers and health-care professionals. Many of the world's population cannot afford medicines and rely on traditional systems of medicine which are mainly plant based. These medicinal plants require investigation in collaborative research programmes between scientists in developed and developing countries. The demand for medicinal plants is contributing to the loss of plant species and future demands should be met from cultivated sustainable species.

DE coastal zone; environmental assessment; environmental indicators;
   coastal planning and management
AB A methodological framework for the determination of environmental quality in coastal areas is presented. The method is based on the identification of a series of characteristics (e.g. water quality, hazard level, potential for use) which can be used to describe different environmental components (e.g. coastal waters, natural hazards, human features) using certain indicators (e.g. ppm of selected pollutants, number of storms per year, number and quality of historical sites). Numerical indices which can be used to assess different qualities on the basis of the indicators are proposed. These indices can be applied to both ''natural'' environmental units and coastal jurisdictions and they can be used for mapping environmental quality and monitoring its change with time. A conservation/development diagram is proposed as a tool to help identify and assess planning conflicts in coastal areas.
   The method proposed should facilitate the integration of scientific assessments into the process of coastal planning and management, through the application of indices which summarize environmental characteristics in terms significant for planners. It can also help to determine whether existing management and policy trends move away or towards sustainability, as the indices provide a means to determine whether environmental quality in a coastal area is decreasing or increasing.

Major changes include: the development of a partnership between the industry and the research community, internationalization the stronger emphasis on integrated topics and approaches as opposed to the traditional emphasis on technical research, and the dominant role of electronic communication. On top of that in most industrialized countries there is a growing emphasis on building and construction research and development (R&D) programs on topics related to information technology (IT) and sustainable construction. With the exception of only a small number of research institutes, companies, and universities, it is only very recently that those U.S. organizations active in the field of building and construction R&D have started to strive for a more active role and a more innovative attitude concerning the development of a partnership between industry and the research community, and the development of international collaboration.

   case
SO JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS & MANAGEMENT STRATEGY

ID NONMARKET
AB This paper examines the integration of market and nonmarket strategies in a setting involving market competition and international trade policy where governments serve as bargaining agents for firms. In the case modeled, the Eastman Kodak Company (Kodak) filed a Section 301 petition under LTS trade law against practices of Fuji Photo Film Company (Fujifilm) in the Japanese distribution system that Kodak alleges constitute trade barriers. The model has four components. The market model characterizes the competition between Fujifilm and Kodak, incorporating characteristics descriptive of the demand and market structure in Japan. Enforcement of an international trade agreement focusing on practices in a distribution system are problematic, so the second model characterizes the sustainability of concessions obtained through a trade agreement using a repeated game extension of the market model. The third model characterizes the bargaining between the US and Japanese governments using the preferences induced by the market model and the limits on sustainable concessions characterized in the second model. Using a common-agency framework, the fourth model represents the nonmarket competition between the two firms as they work to influence the bargaining positions of the governments. The result is a model in which market and nonmarket strategies are integrated in a formal theory of the resolution of trade disputes and rite subsequent effects on market competition. The equilibrium characterized allows a comparative statics analysis of the synergies between market and nonmarket strategies.

TI Sustainability of rangeland pastoralism - A case study from the west
   Australian arid zone using stochastic optimal control theory
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
DE sustainability; pastoralism; vegetation dynamics
ID OBJECTIVES
AB Optimal economic policies with respect to stocking rate and season of grazing for an arid chenopod pasture type were derived for various starting states under a stochastic optimal control framework. Optimal policies were determined using decision criteria which involved either no discounting of future returns or a discount rate of 6%, and were further evaluated by analysing their long-run economic and ecological consequences. All optimal policies involved either year-long set stocking or destocking. Policies involving seasonal grazing or variable stocking rates were not economically viable at the specified cost levels. Optimal stocking rates increase with the level of forage biomass and the density of adult plants, but decrease with the level of either young or old seedlings when these provide an opportunity for regeneration of degraded range. Without discounting, pastoral use of this vegetation type can be both economically and ecologically sustainable. Long-run vegetation dynamics under this criterion are similar to those expected in an ungrazed community. However, land which is severely degraded is, for all practical purposes, not recoverable either by privately optimal grazing management or by complete removal of grazing. Discounting of future returns results in a more exploitative set of grazing policies and reduces opportunities for regeneration of degraded land. Pastoralism under this criterion is not ecologically sustainable although it is economically viable. The role of such. analyses in pastoral management decision-making, and the implications of the results for policy with respect to administration of public rangelands, are briefly discussed.

ID ACCUMULATION; CRUCIFERAE
AB Experiments were carried out in Italy on the potential use of the hyperaccumulator Alyssum bertolonii in phytomining of ultramafic soils for Ni. In situ experimental plots at Murlo, Tuscany were fertilized with various regimes during a 2-year period. The best fertilizer treatment (N + K + P) gave a threefold increase of the biomass of reproductive matter to 9.0 t/ha without dilution of the unfertilized Ni content. A Ni content of 0.8% in dry matter (11% in ash), would give a Ni yield of 72 kg/ha without need of resowing for a further crop. There was no correlation between the age of a plant and its Ni content. The long-term cropping sustainability of the soils was simulated by sequential extractions with KH phthalate solutions at pH 2, 4 and 6 that showed a limiting available Ni content of 768 mu g/g. Thus just over seven croppings at pH 6 in the rhizosphere would reduce the available Ni pool by 30%. A proposed model for phytomining involves harvesting the crop after 12 months and burning the material to produce a sulphur-free bio-ore with about 11% Ni. Utilising the energy of combustion is also discussed. It is considered that Alyssum bertolonii or other Alyssum species might be used for phytomining throughout the Mediterranean area including Anatolia, as well as in Western Australia and the western United States. The economic limits of phytomining are proposed and at current world prices, the technique would only be feasible for Ni and Co with plants of at least the same biomass as Alyssum. Plants of higher biomass and similar uptake potential as for Ni, could extend the limits to other elements.

DE Europe; inventory; environmental geochemical baselines
AB The Forum of European Geological Surveys (FOREGS) includes representatives from 33 European countries and is responsible for co-ordinating Geological Survey activities in Europe. The FOREGS Geochemistry Task Group was established in 1994 to develop a strategy for the preparation of European geochemical maps following the recommendations of the International Geological Correlation Programme (IGCP) Project 259 'International Geochemical Mapping' (now the International Union of Geological Sciences (IUGS)/International Association of Geochemistry and Cosmochemistry (IAGC) Working Group on Global Geochemical Baselines).
   The FOREGS geochemistry programme is aimed at preparing a standardised European geochemical baseline to IGCP-259 standards. The principal aims of this dataset will be for environmental purposes, as a baseline for the assessment of the extent and distribution of contaminated land in the context of variations in the natural geochemical background, but it will also have applications in resource assessment and for the development of policy for the sustainable management of metalliferous mineral and other resources.
   The first phase of the programme was the compilation of an inventory of geochemical data based on the results of a questionnaire completed by Geological Surveys and related organisations throughout the FOREGS community. The results show that the sample types which have been used most extensively are stream sediment (26% coverage), surface water (19% coverage) and soil (11% coverage). Stream sediments have been collected using a narrow range of mesh sizes (<150-<200 mu m), but soil samples have been collected according to two different conventions: some surveys used a similar mesh size range to that used for stream sediments while others employed the <1000 or <2000 mu m fractions traditionally used by soil surveys. Sample densities range from 1 sample per 0.5 km(2) to 1 per 3500 km(2), Various analytical methods have been used, but most of the available data have been calibrated using international reference materials, and data for :he most important of the potentially harmful elements (PHEs) are available for most datasets. Systematic radiometric data are available for only a small proportion of Europe, a situation which compares very unfavourably with that in Australia, North America, the former Soviet Union and many developing countries.
   Recommendations are made for increasing the compatibility of geochemical methods between national geochemical surveys as a basis for the preparation of a series of European geochemical maps. The next stage of the FOREGS Geochemistry Task Group will be the collection of the Global Reference Network of samples against which to standardise national datasets according to the methods recommended in the final report of the IGCP 259 programme.

TI Reinvention and retrenchment: Lessons from the application of the New
   Zealand model to Alberta, Canada
SO JOURNAL OF POLICY ANALYSIS AND MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB Is New Zealand a model for ''reinventing'' government and cutting spending? The government of Alberta, Canada, consciously replicated significant elements of the New Zealand model to attain fiscal balance and public sector reorganization, including the cove element of restructuring institutions to change individual behavior Despite broad similarities in policy content and outcome, differences in the specific content of policy and the politics of policy implementation led to differences in the sustainability of reform and the location of budget cuts. Alberta's Progressive Conservative party emphasized expenditure cuts where both the New Zealand Labour and National pal ties emphasized government reorganization and the introduction of market mechanisms. Contrasting these efforts to balance budgets and reinvent government suggests that there is considerable variation in the ''model,'' and that left governments in general are probably more likely to pursue and succeed at the reinvention of government, while stinting fiscal balance. Right governments, on the other hand, ave more likely to achieve short-run fiscal balance at the expense of successful reinvention. In turn this suggests that while the partisan orientation of the reforming party matters, neither has an ideal policy mix for long-term fiscal stability. Alternation of governments may provide the best policy mix.

AB The crucial role of muscle glycogen as a fuel during prolonged exercise is well established, and the effects of acute changes in dietary carbohydrate intake on muscle glycogen content and on endurance capacity are equally well known. More recently, it has been recognized that diet can also affect the performance of high-intensity exercise of short (2-7 min) duration. If the muscle glycogen content is lowered by prolonged (1-1.5 h) exhausting cycle exercise, and is subsequently kept low for 3-4 days by consumption of a diet deficient in carbohydrate (< 5% of total energy intake), there is a dramatic (similar to 10-30%) reduction in exercise capacity during cycling sustainable for about 5 min. The same effect is observed if exercise is preceded by 3-4 days on a carbohydrate-restricted diet or by a 24 h total fast without prior depletion of the muscle glycogen. Consumption of a diet high in carbohydrate (70% of total energy intake from carbohydrate) for 3-4 days before exercise improves exercise capacity during high-intensity exercise, although this effect is less consistent. The blood lactate concentration is always lower at the point of fatigue after a diet low in carbohydrate and higher after a diet high in carbohydrate than after a normal diet. Even when the duration of the exercise task is kept constant, the blood lactate concentration is higher after exercise on a diet high in carbohydrate than on a diet low in carbohydrate. Consumption of a low-carbohydrate isoenergetic diet is achieved by an increased intake of protein and fat. A high-protein diet, particularly when combined with a low carbohydrate intake, results in metabolic acidosis, which ensues within 24 h and persists for at least 4 days. This appears to be the result of an increase in the circulating concentrations of strong organic acids, particularly free fatty acids and 3-hydroxybutyrate, together with an increase in the total plasma protein concentration. This acidosis, rather than any decrease in the muscle glycogen content, may be responsible for the reduced exercise capacity in high-intensity exercise; this may be due to a reduced rate of efflux of lactate and hydrogen ions from the working muscles. Alternatively, the accumulation of acetyl groups in the carbohydrate-deprived state may reduce substrate flux through the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, thus reducing aerobic energy supply and accelerating the onset of fatigue.

AB Sustainable groundwater management requires (a) maximizing the use of aquifer storage to reduce water-supply costs while limiting environmental impacts, and (b) maximizing groundwater protection to reduce water-supply treatment needs while not unduly restricting land-use activities. These key issues are evaluated from the experience of a recent and comprehensive national strategic study involving detailed consultation with many stakeholders with an interest in groundwater resources. Such balances are not easy to achieve because groundwater systems are complex to analyse and slow to respond to change, resulting in considerable uncertainty in assessment and prediction without in-depth research and high-resolution monitoring. Current institutional and regulatory arrangements for the water sector in England and Wales do not appear to be achieving the best possible use of aquifer storage and optimal investment in groundwater protection.

AB Many factors contribute to the complex patterns of ecological conditions in streams. Nutrient and light availability are 2 factors that directly affect benthic algal assemblages and thereby indirectly affect stream faunas. A null model of the major changes and determinants of benthic algal assemblage structure and function along resource (nutrient and light) gradients is proposed, This model predicts that low-resource stress, herbivory, competition, and colonization of habitats by new algal growth forms are the dominant determinants of benthic algal ecology at suceessively higher resource levels. It also predicts major changes in algal assemblages in resource conditions at which regulation of communities changes from one dominant determinant to another. In many streams, diatoms dominate low-density biofilms in low resource conditions where resource stress and herbivory regulate periyhyton. Above a herbivory threshold, a resource condition in which algal accumulation rates equal grazing rates, diatoms should accrue to densities that are regulated by competition for light and nutrients. Another resource threshold can occur where increasing nutrient or light regimes make the habitat available for colonization by different algae, such as Cladophora or other filamentous greens, that have growth forms very different from those of diatom-dominated assemblages.
   A concept of ecological sustainability is also proposed which quantifies the changes in environmental conditions that an ecosystem can withstand without ''significantly'' changing ecological integrity. Linkage between the resource threshold hypothesis and ecological sustainability helps to define environmental criteria at points along resource gradients where significant changes in ecological processes are expected.

AB A healthy stream is an ecosystem that is sustainable and resilient, maintaining its ecological structure and function over time while continuing to meet societal needs and expectations. The concept described in this paper explicitly incorporates both ecological integrity (maintaining structure and function) and human Values (what society Values in the ecosystem). Stream ecologists who want their research to contribute to improving conditions in flowing waters require concepts Like stream health, which will stimulate research in directions that will be more effective in restoring and preserving the unique organisms and ecosystems they study. Determining what is a healthy stream requires integration of stream ecology with disciplines such as economics and political science, because a concept of stream health must take into account the human attitudes and social institutions that are a part of the stream's societal watershed. New and fruitful directions for stream research lie in developing operational measures of stream health, which include the human dimension and move beyond identifying symptoms of ecological stress, and in elucidating the ecological processes and human actions that maintain stream health.

AB Multi-use tree plantations are a major component of the traditional rural landscapes of semiarid Mediterranean regions. Having evolved over centuries, these landscapes are the product of sustainable development. Within their flexible spatial format, agricultural, silvicultural, and pastoral production is combined to provide efficient use of the natural and human resources. Olive and carob tree plantations in the Girne region of North Cyprus are chosen as an example of these traditional landscapes. They are evaluated according to information gathered from field surveys in two sample locations: one in rural marginal lands; the other, a few kilometres to the east of Girne town. The findings indicate that these landscapes are undergoing a process of degradation and fragmentation owing to economic and socio-cultural factors.
   The objective of the present study is fourfold: (1) to determine the structure, distribution pattern, and management of these traditional landscapes; (2) to evaluate the pattern and causes of their degradation; (3) to draw attention to their ecological and cultural significance within the context of the Girne region; (4) to propose alternative roles that will allow them to become integrated into future developments.
   The study reviews the potential of tourism to provide a context for the appreciation and protection of these traditional landscapes. The Dik Burun tourist project is reviewed as an example of local-scale application of such an alternative. Landscapes of multi-use olive and carob plantations are incorporated into the project master plan, ensuring not only their protection, but also their continued contribution towards enhancing the ecological, cultural and aesthetic character of the region.

AB The expression of platelet-derived growth factor A (PDGF-A), and its spatial and temporal relationship to interstitial collagens in kidneys with congenital multicystic dysplasia using in situ hybridization, have been examined. Seventeen dysplastic kidneys (16 weeks to 7 months) and 30 normal age-matched controls were used in the study. Increased PDGF-A mRNA was detected in dysplastic compared to normal kidneys in all age groups including extensively fibrotic postnatal kidneys. An abundant PDGF-A mRNA signal was seen within the epithelial cells of cystically dilated or dysplastic tubules and within interstitial fibroblasts and disorganized primitive mesenchyme. A comparable amount of PDGF-A protein was detected by Western blotting. Procollagen I and III mRNA were increased in fibroblasts surrounding cystic and dysplastic tubules. We conclude that tubular epithelial production of PDGF-A may induce collagenous matrix production by adjacent fibroblasts, while marked up-regulation of PDGF-A by interstitial cells may be responsible for sustainable fibrogenic effects in the fetal kidney contributing to renal maldevelopment.

AB Iron supplementation, mostly with a therapeutic orientation, has been a key strategy for the shortterm control of iron deficiency and ferropenic anemia. It has been used almost exclusively in antenatal clinics, but in spite of its confirmed efficacy in supervised trials, it has proven ineffective in practice in most developing countries. Poor effectiveness has been attributed to various factors including insufficient dose and time of supplementation and poor adherence. These problems have led to the administration of high iron doses, which have proven equally ineffective in practice. This paper introduces four concepts. (1) that iron supplementation targeted to pregnant women should cover the full reproductive cycle, from prepregnancy to at least the end of lactation instead of only the pregnant woman; (2) that entering pregnancy with iron deficiency contributes to the failure of antenatal iron supplementation and that prepregnancy iron reserves increase the effectiveness of antenatal supplementation; (3) that medium-to long-term weekly ingestion of proper iron-folate supplements, with a preventive aim and directed to all risk groups, should be community based rather than health service based but supervised by the latter (in this sense, preventive supplementation is equal to targeted iron fortification); and (4) that preventive supplementation, based on weekly dosing, has proven efficacious. Problem-oriented research to evaluate the sustainability and medium-to long-term efficacy of these concepts is called for. The bases for the concepts and suggestions are summarized in this paper.

AB Although the success factor approach has been widely used to model the interaction of Information Systems (IS) with organizations, there are inherent limitations associated with this approach. This paper attempts to address some of the concerns and extends the existing base of work on success factors by identifying the key constructs in successful IS implementation and developing a model for relating these constructs.

TI Integrated farming in the Netherlands: Flirtation or solid change?
SO OUTLOOK ON AGRICULTURE
LA English
DT Article
AB Like many other areas of intensive agriculture in Europe,the Netherlands is struggling with environmental pollution caused by overuse of pesticides and fertilizers. The Dutch government has been investing in the development and implementation of integrated farming systems (IFS) since 1979, with a view to a national conversion to sustainable agriculture. Although IFS ideas are becoming more widely accepted in the farming community, they have only been implemented on a small scale so far. This article describes those developments and discusses marketing, extension, and policy initiatives that might motivate more Dutch farmers to adopt IFS.

ID PEST
AB Agrosystem diversification is a term for agronomic methods which involve the cultivation of several crops together, and which have been evolved in the tropics over centuries of trial and error by local farmers. Little is known about the effects of growing crops together but what is clear is that intercropping has a great potential for pest and disease reduction, both in the tropics and in temperate regions. Exploration of this potential in field vegetable crops has shown promising results but reveals certain constraints. Important contributions to sustainable vegetable cropping methods can be realized by research and agro-nomic optimization, Decreasing growers' dependence of pesticides while maintaining product quality and marketable yields is the main purpose of intercropping in sustainable field vegetable growing.

TI Outlook on the feeding of poultry
SO OUTLOOK ON AGRICULTURE
LA English
DT Article
ID PROTEIN-SOURCES; RESOURCES; PACIFIC; ASIA; FORMULATION; DIGESTION; ACID
AB The future feeding of poultry is considered under two scenarios: one relating to developed regions where the feed supply is secure, and the other relating to some developing regions where it is less certain. No major changes are anticipated in regions with an ample supply of conventional feed ingredients, but significant changes are likely in regions which are attempting to expand their poultry industries with an inadequate indigenous supply of conventional feedstuffs. They will have to rely on strategies to im prove protein utilization,such as supplementation with amino acids or the use of proteases, or strategies to improve energy utilization,such as the use of enzymes or unconventional feed sources, In developing countries, meanwhile, likely developments include the emergence of a feed manufacturing infrastructure to support the various sectors of the poultry industry and the more widespread adoption of integrated plant/poultry/soil production systems that emphasize economic efficiency and sustainability.

AB We focus on the role of fiscal policies in macroeconomic stabilization in eastern Europe and assess the sustainability of fiscal policies for the central and eastern European economies in transition. We show the main causes of fiscal imbalances experienced at the beginning of the transition process. Countries that adopted tight fiscal policies were more successful with their inflation stabilization programmes, have experienced a faster recovery of growth, and did not experience a steeper decline in output. Countries with unsustainable fiscal policies all floated their exchange rate, bur there are both floating and peg arrangements among the successful stabilizers. In all the successful cases, however, current account convertibility was established. We also discuss the experience of Poland and Romania--two polar cases in terms of fiscal policies and present lessons and policy recommendations for other economies in transition.

AB Continuing criticism of the term 'sustainable development' deflects attention from the political project that has to underpin shifts in human behaviour. It is more important to redefine the roles and functions of public and private institutions in ways that legitimate sustainable actions in the belief that latent public support for environmental protection can be converted into a widening range of new but customary behaviours. A brief review of the UK government's response to the Rio declaration demonstrates faltering purpose, reinforcing and reflecting public distrust of government and those commercial interests that benefit from the status quo. Only very modest comfort can be taken from its limited initiatives which range from the greater dissemination of information to the setting of some environmental targets. The unwillingness of government to promote major fiscal or financial reforms, or significantly to decentralize power and initiative, or to recognize the limitations to scientific knowledge when seeking the bases to 'rational' decision-making in the face of uncertainty, reveal the inadequacy of the steps so far taken.

AB Primary wood is an important renewable resource. To counteract increasing pressures on forests a systematic approach has been developed to achieve a more sustainable use of wood in the Netherlands. This approach aims at using primary wood as efficiently as possible and with appropriate fit. The application thereof has led to an inventory of 81 relatively simple technical wood saving options and 23 options that increase the use of wood by substitution of environmentally less appropriate materials. It was found that overall the consumption of wood in the Netherlands may be reduced by about two-thirds. The application of a similar approach may be feasible for other countries in order to analyse their wood consumption and to find out how to achieve a more sustainable use.

DT Article
DE life cycle assessment; ecoprofile; innovation; technical change;
   competitiveness
AB Firms are the primary organisers and drivers of resources flows through and emissions from developed economies. Sustainable industrial development is a process in which these flows are modified. This includes both a reduction of materials and energy intensity, increasing cyclicity of materials fluxes, and a reduction of dissipative uses of toxic materials. The role of firms in achieving these changes is discussed in this paper. Life cycle assessment activities in large European firms in six industrial sectors are assessed. Market and regulatory pressures on firms to adopt life cycle approaches differ markedly between industrial sectors and across national markets. Producers of final products are most likely to find opportunities for improvements in the life cycle environmental performance of products while making gains in dynamic competitiveness at the same time. Upstream producers of commodity products have tended to use life cycle approaches defensively against negative environmental claims and in seeking to influence the policy process. Despite widespread adoption of life cycle approaches, changes in product system ecoprofiles are likely to be slow given technological trajectories, infrastructural and resource endowments, and the fragmentation of environmental responsibility across the product chain.

AB Lake Victoria is the second largest freshwater body in the world by surface area. It is a very important water body for the livelihood of people, particularly those living in its basin. The lake is currently facing many problems such as serious environmental degradation, pollution and overfishing. Mismanagement of wetlands which is another problem threatening the hydrological and ecological balance of the lake is discussed. This report provides: an overview of the Lake Victoria ecosystem; describes major wetlands of the Lake Victoria basin in Tanzania and their uses; identifies water supply, agriculture, fishing, conversion into other uses (mainly residential); and cattle grazing as main uses of wetlands; and discusses threats and changes faced by wetlands. Direct anthropogenic activities such as irrational uses of wetlands for agriculture, pollution and conversion of wetlands into settlement areas are responsible for wetland degradation and loss. Problems of sedimentation as a result of agricultural activities, hydrological changes of wetlands due to road construction and subsidence of wetlands due to excessive extraction of water are indirect results of human actions. Drought is the common natural cause for the change or loss of wetlands in the lake basin. Absence of wetlands policy, conflicting sectoral policies on issues related to wetlands, deficient planning concepts, limited information and awareness on the importance of wetlands and absence of an institution to deal specifically with wetland management contribute to degradation and loss of wetlands. A number of recommendations for sustainable use of wetlands are put forward. Formulation of the National Wetlands Policy and launching of awareness campaigns on wise use of wetlands are recommended. The presentation also emphasises carrying out of research on the propel utilisation of wetlands, monitoring of wetland uses and provision of sustainable exploitation of wetland resources extension services.

AB The ecological consequences of Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuge menziesii) plantations in the south of Chile and their impact on the native vegetation and soil chemistry were studied. The study area was a private forest property close to Villarrica (39 degrees 19'S, 72 degrees 18'W) in southern Chile. Vegetation samples and transect methods were used to assess floristic structure. Samples from four typical soil profiles under native forest and Douglas-fir plantations were analyzed to evaluate the impact of plantations on soil chemistry. Large differences in species diversity and vegetational structure were found between native forest and Douglas-fir plantations. Native forests are rich in epiphyts, climbers and endemic species, the top layer is formed by emergent Nothofagus obliqua, N. alpina or N. dombeyi, the layers below are formed by evergreen tree species from Valdivian rainforest. Douglas-fir plantations are caracterized by non-native species (mostly european species of meadows or disturbed sites) and they are extremely poor in native plant species. In addition to the negative influences on the diversity of native flora, the Douglas-fir plantations show changes in soil chemistry compared with soil profiles under native forest. The upper soil horizons under Pseudotsuga menziesii show the tendency to be impoverished in base cations, their base saturation is lower and they have lower levels of phosphorus. From an ecological point of view the Douglas-fir plantations are not sustainable because of their destructive influences on the native vegetation. Therefore the Douglas-fir plantations should not be extended to areas with a high ecological value.

ID UNITED-STATES; INDUSTRY; SYSTEMS
AB Dairy farmers in Michigan's Upper Peninsula, an economically marginal rural region, are encumbered by contextual constraints that are not similarly faced by their downstate counterparts. However, this does not mean that they are any less ambitious or less efficient in dealing with the resources available to them. indeed, dairying and similar small-scale economic enterprises in this and other marginal contexts may be quite competitive and sustainable if appropriate sociopolitical supports are instituted and, in the case of dairying, if marketing orders and regulatory policies are formulated and implemented in light of their impact upon the economic growth and viability of the wider region. To explore this issue, we consider the situations, basic characteristics, and restructuring trends over time of dairy farms in three upstate localities as compared with that of a downstate dairy farming community.

SO SINGAPORE JOURNAL OF TROPICAL GEOGRAPHY

DT Article
ID GENDER; INDIA; TREES
AB Conventional development theory and practice have often failed to recognise the centrality of women in sustainable resource management A conceptual shift in environment and resource policies, planning and programmes is required to affirm that women are active participants rather than passive recipients of change. To address the need for enhanced women's participation in community-based forestry development, this paper focuses on the policy and programme elements important in the design and implementation of successful community forestry projects. Consequently, the intention of this paper is to increase the awareness of planners and decisionmakers regarding methods of operationalising women's participation in community-based forestry. Building upon previous work from aid agencies and other researchers, a range of institutional, organisational, socio-cultural and project elements are identified. These elements provide a comprehensive framework of the policy and programme issues requiring consideration when promoting women's participation in successful community-based forestry activities.

TI Causes and effects of coastal sand mining in Ghana
SO SINGAPORE JOURNAL OF TROPICAL GEOGRAPHY
LA English
DT Article
AB Sand mining is a type of open-cast mining that provides material for the construction sector in Ghana. The construction sector in the coastal areas of Ghana relies heavily on coastal sand and pebbles in the building of houses, bridges and roads. Its contribution to Ghana's industrial output has increased from 17.4 per cent in 1986 to 20.8 per cent in 1993. However, the process of sand mining has accelerated coastal environmental degradation to an alarming rate in many areas. As a result the government has been compelled to spend millions of dollars to combat sea erosion. This paper examines the causes and effects of coastal sand mining in three communities in the Ahanta West District of Ghana. It argues that coastal sand needs to be exploited to satisfy human demands but this requires efficient and effective resource management to ensure sustainable development. It also calls for a concerted effort by policy makers, sand contractors, engineers, traditional rulers and local residents to find a solution to the coastal environmental crisis.

SO SOIL TECHNOLOGY

DE carbonate status; Chernozems; irrigation; reformation
AB Non-irrigated and irrigated Ordinary Chernozems of Stavropol Upland, Central Precaucasus (Russia), were examined. A number of morphological and instrumental methods was used for detailed investigation of the carbonates in the soils. This approach allowed us to reveal the essential change of the carbonate status of the irrigated Chernozems as a result of changing the soil moisture regime and the predominance of leaching processes under 30 years irrigation by fresh water. The changes included distinct enhancement of spatial variability and instability of carbonate-illuvial horizon deposition, the highest data scatter on carbonate content within this horizon, the signs of increased mobility of carbonate material and the change of the mechanism of the carbonate accumulations. Carbonates moving with soil solutions and mobile migrational forms of carbonate accumulations as well as segregating forms and lithogenic concretions were transformed under the irrigation. Irrigation for 30 years resulted in unfavorable reclamative changes of the Ordinary Chernozems carbonate status: decalcification of the upper part of the solum, disappearance of the mobile carbonate accumulations from the upper horizons, the initial point of the compact carbonate-hardened horizon in the low part of profile and the increase of the calcium and magnesium content in the soil solution. The problem studied is complicated because of the inherent variability of carbonate parameters and the multitude of factors having an influence on carbonate status. Much mon work is needed because of the importance of the topic for sustainability of agricultural production systems, for prediction and overcoming of unfavorable consequences of irrigation, for the up-to-date problem of the greenhouse effect and the response of carbonate reserves to climate changes.

AB Intensive monocropping of maize is widely practised in densely populated regions of west Africa. A wide range of tillage systems are used for seedbed preparation without the benefits of research information from long-term experiments relating tillage method to soil properties. Soil chemical effects of eight tillage and residue management treatments were studied for 8 years or 16 consecutive maize monoculture crops for a western Nigerian soil with a coarse-textured surface horizon. Treatments established on a newly cleared land were: (1) notill +/- crop residue mulch, (2) notill +/- chiselling in the row zone at 50 cm depth, (3) mouldboard ploughing +/- harrowing, (4) disc ploughing +/- rotovation, (5) notill - residue mulch, (6) mouldboard ploughing at the end of rains or summer ploughing, (7) mouldboard ploughing +/- residue mulch, and (8) mouldboard ploughing and harrowing +/- ridging or ridge till. Soil chemical properties of the 0-5-cm and 5-10-cm depths were measured during the dry season every year beginning with base line characterization soon after land clearing in 1980. Soil pH declined with cultivation duration from 6.6 in 1981 to 5.4 in 1987 for the 0-5-cm depth, and from 6.5 in 1981 to 5.5 in 1987 for the 5-10-cm depth. Mean soil pH for the 0-5-cm depth declined from 6.7 to 5.6 in notill +/- residue mulch, and from 6.7 to 5.4 with mouldboard ploughing. Soil content of Bray P increased with cultivation duration due to application of phosphatic fertilizers. There occurred a significant decrease in soil organic carbon (SOC) and total soil nitrogen (TSN), and an increase in C:N ratio with cultivation duration. Mean SOC content in 1987 of the 0-5-cm depth was 13.9 g kg(-1) for the notill treatment compared with 11.0 g kg(-1) for the plough-based methods. Soil concentration Ca and Mg and total cation exchange capacity (CEC) increased with cultivation duration. Maize grain yield was significantly correlated with SOC, exchangeable Ca2+, and CEC.
   Continuous cropping decreased soil chemical quality, and the rate of decreases was more with plough-based than notill methods. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Soil organic carbon concentrations (OCCs) decline when semiarid grasslands are brought under cultivation. As a result, soil aggregate size and stability may decline, which, with the decreases in OCC, may degrade soil quality and reduce crop yields. Effects of cropping systems, crop or field conditions, and tillage methods on dry and water-stable aggregation and OCCs in the surface layer of a Torrertic Paleustoll (Pullman clay loam) were determined. Samples were obtained from the 0-3-cm depth in plots of four dryland studies and three non-replicated field areas. Areas sampled ranged from those cropped to winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and grain sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench) for over 20 years to grasslands converted to cropland in 1994. In general, soil aggregates were smaller and OCCs were greater with no-tillage (NT) than with stubble mulch tillage (SMT) on areas cropped for over 20 years. On areas recently converted to cropland, aggregates were larger and OCCs were greater with NT than with other tillage methods. The 0.42-0.84- and 0.84-2.0-mm dry aggregates were among those most stable when sieved in water. The results indicate practices that maintain soil OCCs at the higher levels and promote development of dry aggregates in the 0.42-2.0-mm size range are important for production sustainability of Torrertic Paleustolls such as Pullman clay loam and similar soils.

AB The impact of soil erosion on soil productivity was estimated for a Rhodic Ferralsol and a Eutric Cambisol in Santa Catarina, southern Brazil. Over equivalent periods, total soil losses were an order of magnitude different (868 and 68 t/ha respectively on the bare soil control), yet the impact on maize yield per tonne of soil lost was far greater at the Cambisol site with less erosion. Similar interesting contrasts between sites were found for the other measures of impact with decline in pH and phosphorus and increase in free aluminium being the most obvious induced soil differences. The results demonstrate the variable nature of erosion impact according to soil type and they highlight the importance of examining a number of measures of impact before pronouncing on the sustainability of any particular agricultural practice.

TI Comparison between a nature reserve and adjacent communal land in Xeric
   Succulent Thicket: an indigenous plant user's perspective
SO SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
AB Local people with knowledge of indigenous plants could contribute to the management of protected areas while simultaneously improving their options for employment. Members of a local Xhosa community who lived adjacent to the Great Fish River nature reserve in the former Ciskei, Eastern Cape, were employed to assist us with an inventory of locally useful plants. The survey, was designed to quantify differences in plant diversity between the nature reserve and the adjacent communal area, from the point of view of indigenous plant users. Traditional healers and rural villagers who were experienced users of indigenous plants were recruited with the aid of a community organisation. Plants which were used for physical and spiritual healing, fuel, food and construction were identified along paired transects in the nature reserve and the communal area, respectively. Hierarchical richness indices (HRIs) and the number of recognisable plants as well as their abundance at each site were used to compare the nature reserve to the communal area. Altogether 122 utilised plant types were recorded, of which 68% had medicinal or spiritual value, 12% were used for food, 13% for fuel and 7% for building purposes. These ratios were similar for both the nature reserve and the communal area, One hundred and eight (108) useful types of plants were recorded on the nature reserve and 97 in the communal area. The nature reserve contained 25 'unique' recognisable plants which were not recorded in the communal area, whereas the communal area contained 14. Useful plants were more abundant on the nature reserve than in the communal area, and the average HRI for the nature reserve was almost double that of the communal area.
   The advantages to the community were limited: temporary employment was created and local skills were developed which might have improved the people's prospects for future employment. The conservation. benefits were more substantial: information became available which would otherwise have remained hidden, relations between the community and conservation agencies improved, and credible education programmes in sustainable resource use could be developed through a participatory approach. The next step from a management point of view is to provide opportunities for the community to interpret and apply the results, and with the local people, to explore small business opportunities based on the cultivation of useful plants. Participatory research and monitoring could be furthered by putting greater emphasis on the participatory process than on results, by actively involving local people in the development of monitoring programmes from the outset, and by interpreting and deliberating the results of monitoring with them in an interactive way.

AB One of the most difficult and challenging problems in conservation biology is determining the minimum conditions needed for the survival and adaptation of a species or population. The computer modelling programme VORTEX is used to simulate conditions needed for the survival of a reintroduced warthog Phacochoerus aethiopicus population in the Andries Vosloo Kudu Reserve, Eastern Cape Province, South Africa. Numerous scenarios were simulated to determine the possible effect of harvesting, supplementing and environmental catastrophes on the population. The most optimistic scenario for the population with no harvesting or environmental catastrophes still showed the population to be vulnerable (a probability of extinction equal to or greater than 0.1 within 100 years). Although the viability of the population is improved when occasionally supplemented, the results suggest that present management practices are not sustainable in the long term.

AB In this paper, we examine the importance of year, industry, corporate-parent, and business-specific effects on the profitability of U.S. public corporations within specific 4-digit SIC categories. Our results indicate that year, industry, corporate-parent, and business-specific effects account for 2 percent, 19 percent, 4 percent, and 32 percent, respectively, of the aggregate variance in profitability We also find that the importance of the effects differs substantially across broad economic sectors. Industry effects account for a smaller portion of profit variance in manufacturing but a larger portion in lodging/entertainment, services, wholesale/retail trade, and transportation. Across all sectors we find a negative covariance between corporate-parent and industry effects. A derailed analysis suggests that industry, corporate-parent, and business-specific effects are related in complex ways. (C) 1997 by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI Pricing aircraft emissions at Lyon-Satolas airport

LA English
DT Article
ID AIR-POLLUTION; POLICY; ISSUES
AB The cost of air pollution from aviation at Lyon-Satolas airport for 1987, 1990, 1994, and 2015 is estimated by linking environmental assessment techniques that yield an emissions inventory for aircraft operations with economic cost evaluations of air pollution from ground based sources in Lyon (e.g. road transport, industry, and agriculture). To highlight both the uncertainty that exists regarding the economic assessment of damages from air pollution's effects and the variation in 'willingness to pay' for environmentally sustainable transportation, estimates are expressed as a range covering four possible scenarios. These scenarios differ along two parameters: rural vs urban impact of pollution and minimal vs potential preferences for environmental protection in a particular jurisdiction. Such an approach produces a range of estimates that could be applied to virtually any airport, thus allowing public officials not only in Lyon, but also elsewhere, to factor the approximation of environmental costs that they judge to be most appropriate into airport planning and aviation policy development.

AB The progression of the Aquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) pandemic in Tanzania continues at a rapid rate because of cultural, economic and institutional factors. The adverse impact on household and community welfare has been considerable because of the production forgone as labor is reallocated to nurse and mourn the victims; declining farm productivity as assets and working capital are sold to pay medical bills; and rising dependency burdens. To bring the epidemic under control sustainably and efficiently the study recommends careful research into community-based strategies which can: foster new social ethics; promote rural productivity and employment; improve health services; and provide survival safety-nets for the victims' families.

TI The correlation between the hunting bag records of red deer, roe deer,
   and brown hare with those of their primary predators in Slovakia.
SO ZEITSCHRIFT FUR JAGDWISSENSCHAFT
LA German
DT Article
AB During this century the hunting kill of red deer has increased 8.86 times, that for roe deer 3.51 rimes, for brown bear 4.57 rimes, for wolf 29.75 times, and for lynx 4.06 times. The hunting bag has also greatly increased for wild boar, mouflon, and fallow deer. At the beginning of this century 482 red deer and 1145 roe deer were shot for every wolf, whereas now these figures are reduced to 143 respectively 135 animals.
   The predation pressure of wolves has greatly increased, while that of brown bear and lynx on roe deer has become only slightly greater; their predation pressure on red deer has even diminished (Tab. 1-2, Fig. 1-2). At the beginning of the 20th century 35 brown hares were bagged for each fox hunted, while now the relationship is 4 hares per fox. The predation pressures of fox on field hares has increased enormously, and thus a greater amount of fox hunting is imperative.
   The comparison of the hunting records of the investigated game species (Tab. 3-4, Fig. 3-10) shows that if rationally controlled by hunting, predators in agricultural areas do nor obstruct ecological game management and a sustainable rational utilization of the so-called useful game species. Within the framework of systematic game management it is better to guarantee the preservation of appropriate levels of predator populations than to exclude them from being hunted which results in large increases in their numbers and serious damage to human interests in cultivated areas.
   It must be emphasized that the calculated correlations for the hunting kill (Tab. 3-4, Fig. 3-10) are only valid for the area investigated and the the rime periods of this study. These correlations do not apply to other areas or for other time periods.

DT Article
AB For a state like Orissa with few big industrial units, the main issue will be to work out strategies that help in the sustainable decentralised growth of industries. The present pattern of industrialisation is largely inadequate and the state has to actively intervene in the promotion of those industries suitable to the resource endowment of the state.

AB The epidermis is an attractive site for therapeutic gene delivery because it is accessible and capable of delivering polypeptides to the systemic circulation. A number of difficulties, however, have emerged in attempts at cutaneous gene delivery, and central among these is an inability to sustain therapeutic gene production. We have examined two major potential contributing factors, viral vector stamina and involvement of long-lived epidermal progenitor cells. Human keratinocytes were either untreated or transduced with a retroviral vector for beta-galactosidase (beta-Gal) at >99% efficiency and then grafted onto immunodeficient mice to regenerate human epidermis. Human epidermis was monitored in vivo after grafting for clinical and histologic appearance as well as for gene expression. Although integrated vector sequences persisted unchanged in engineered epidermis at 10 weeks post-grafting, retroviral long terminal repeat (LTR)-driven beta-Gal expression ceased in vivo after approximately 4 weeks. Endogenous cellular promoters, however, maintained consistently normal gene expression levels without evidence of time-dependent decline, as determined by immunostaining with species-specific antibodies for human involucrin, filaggrin, keratinocyte transglutaminase, keratin 10, type VII collagen, and Laminin 5 proteins out to week 14 post-grafting. Transduced human keratinocytes generated multilayer epidermis sustained through multiple epidermal turnover cycles; this epidermis demonstrated retention of a spatially appropriate pattern of basal and suprabasal epidermal marker gene expression. These results confirm previous findings suggesting that viral promoter-driven gene expression is not durable and demonstrate that keratinocytes passaged in vitro can regenerate and sustain normal epidermis for prolonged periods.

TI Why not push for a 9 per cent growth rate?
SO ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL WEEKLY
LA English
DT Article
AB One quite indisputable gain of the reform has been the increasing openness of the economy. The rise in the openness ratio began in the mid-1980s and accelerated in the 1990s, following the depreciation of the currency in 1990-91. However, the 1997-98 budget and the current exchange rate policy, it is argued here, will lead to a stagnation in the openness ratio, unless corrections are made. A bolder investment programme and a fairly large depreciation of the currency would lead to a sustainable growth in excess of 9 per cent. Without such correction, growth is likely to fall after a year to less than 6 per cent and would bring back the situation of a payments problem that characterised the late 1980s. Of course, the current orthodoxy of the policy-makers and the RBI would have to go.

AB This paper gives an overview of recent progress made in modelling economic environmental systems and in environmental policy analysis. In the modelling part attention will be given to new integrating frameworks offered inter alia by materials balance approaches, especially in the context of linkages between physical environmental phenomena and economic production and valuation. These can be relevant for studying materials-product chains, multisectoral materials flows, or even multiple use of complex ecosystems. Modern approaches will be dealt with, such as analysis for sustainable development, and ways of incorporating scenario experiments in environmental modelling approaches. In the context of sustainable development, modelling of multiple use of ecosystems and of spatial dimensions is also discussed. In the last part of the paper new advances in the area of environmental policy analysis will be dealt with. The main focus will be on methods for addressing uncertainty in evaluating environmental policy strategies, in particular fuzzy information and the use of meta-analysis.

TI GRAZPLAN: Decision support systems for Australian grazing enterprises
   .1. Overview of the GRAZPLAN project, and a description of the MetAccess
   and LambAlive DSS
SO AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS

AB Effective transfer of new information and technology to farming practice is the major goal of the GRAZPLAN project. GRAZPLAN contains a suite of complementary decision support systems (DSS) that incorporate results from research on grazing systems and are now being released through a commercial partner as aids to extension. The computer packages are designed to be used in conjunction with local weather and farm data to test the relevance of different management procedures for individual farms. The main DSS, GrazPlan, can be used to evaluate and optimize long-term management decisions in relation to profitability and sustainability. It is quite general in its application and modular in structure. The Australis-wide database of daily weather records, which drives this program, is the basis for two smaller DSS, MetAccess and LambAlive, which are described in this paper. MetAccess is designed to display and analyse daily weather records and provide users with estimates of the probability of specified weather patterns within the range of data from a specified locality. LambAlive is designed to predict the risk of lamb deaths from bad weather for specified localities and flocks and enables the user to test different procedures that may reduce these losses.

AB The human appropriation of net primary production (NPP) significantly alters the energy flow of ecosystems. The NPP-appropriation, defined as the difference between the NPP of the hypothetical undisturbed vegetation and the amount of biomass currently available in ecological cycles, is investigated for the 99 political districts of Austria (1990). Calculations are based on data for land-use, forestry, yield, and climate. Total aboveground NPP of the actual vegetation was found to be 7% less than that of the potential natural vegetation. Additionally, 34% of potential production is harvested, resulting in a total reduction of ecologically available aboveground NPP of 41%. Since this could have significant ecological effects, e.g. on biodiversity, it is of potential interest for strategies of sustainable development, indicators for stresses on the environment, and the environmental effects of increased utilization of biomass.

AB Total amounts of plant nutrients in biomass and soil were estimated in a tropical rainforest ecosystem in Sabah, Malaysia. Amounts of some elements, especially calcium, were very low in the soil. The loss of calcium through log removal after clearfelling represented about 19% of the total amount in the ecosystem, indicating that sustainable forestry in this area is not possible without replacing the calcium removed. Neither the calcium content of the biomass nor the amount of exchangeable calcium in the soil were extremely low. Total analyses of the soil, including a complete digestion of the minerals are, therefore, necessary for a satisfactory determination of the long-term productivity of forest soils in areas with low contents of one or more plant nutrients.

AB We estimated the ecological footprint of cities in Baltic Europe and globally. The 29 largest cities of Baltic Europe appropriate for their resource consumption and waste assimilation an area of forest, agricultural, marine, and wetland ecosystems that is at least 565-1130 times larger than the area of the cities themselves. Of the global human population, 20% (1.1 billion), living in 744 large cities worldwide, appropriate for their seafood consumption as much as 25% of the globally available area of productive marine ecosystems. The same cities' appropriation of forests for assimilation of CO2 emissions exceeds the full sink capacity of the world's forests by more than 10%. If the goal as emphasized at the UN Habitat II Conference, 1996, is sustainable human settlements, the increasingly limited capacity of ecosystems to sustain urban areas has to be explicitly accounted for in city planning and development.

ID CORAL COMMUNITY; REEF; REGENERATION; SURVIVAL; GROWTH
AB Recreational scuba diving has generally been perceived as an activity with low environmental impact. With the rapid growth in popularity of diving, concerns have arisen that some heavily-dived sites may have diver visitation rates approaching the limit of ecological sustainability. The potential impacts of divers were assessed in underwater surveys at four major dive-sites in Eastern Australia. Recreational divers were followed for 30 minutes, and all contacts with and damage to the substratum or biota were recorded. Information on diver qualifications and experience was collected. The mean number of contacts with the substratum per 30 minute dive at each site ranged from 35 to 121, with a maximum of 304 in a single dive. The majority of contacts were made with fins. Breakage of coral ranged from an average of 0.6 per dive to 1.9 per dive. Most divers damaged no coral, but a small minority of divers broke between 10 and 15 corals each per 30 minute dive. The level of damage to the sites studied appeared to be sustainable at present levels of use by divers. However, at intensively dived, coral-dominated sites, the potential exists for considerable environmental impact as the number of recreational divers increases beyond present levels.

AB A bioeconomic model of livestock production from wind-erosive rangelands is developed and optimized. Equations of motion capture the impact of topsoil stock on forage productivity and the protective effect of forage stock on soil loss from wind erosion. For overgrazed wind-erosive rangelands, a lower discount rate provides incentives for lighter grazing, as does consideration of effect of stocking rates on animal performance. In the case where off-site damages are large, internalizing offsite effects would also encourage lighter grazing and hence promote sustainable production. An illustrative application of the model is also included.

TI The institutional role of state education departments: A historical
   perspective
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
ID POLICY
AB Since the early 1980s, the prevailing school reform strategy among states has been toward more centralized and more encompassing legislative and administrative controls. As reformers increasingly expect states to carry the burden of school improvement, such expectations have, in turn, shifted attention to states' administrative capacities to effect change. While state education departments should, and in some instances do, play an important part in the educational reform process, little is known about their capacities to effect large-scale and enduring change. Unlike European countries, the United States did not develop differentiated, centralized bureaucracies with direct authority and control over education. While specific configurations of control have differed over the past 150 years, the role of state education departments always has been contingent. In the first half of the twentieth century, they were defined by elite professional interests and in the second half by an array of special interests. This article examines the role of state education departments from their nineteenth-century origins by tracing the development of state administrative authority in education and the political forces that have shaped it. A central question that the article poses is whether large-scale educational reform is sustainable in the absence of an institutional center to shape policy, aggregate interests, and control and channel conflict. The first part of the article proposes a theoretical framework for understanding state education departments as political institutions. The second part examines the historical developments of state administrative bureaucracies. The final part of the article integrates the historical and theoretical to suggest an analytic framework for understanding the institutional role of state education departments.

ID STRATEGIES; POLICY
AB Given the contested meanings of the local global context, it is important to see local political processes as more than a matter of new interests or claims prompted by globalization or even new institutions such as public-private partnerships. We argue that local politics in a global era are best understood in terms of the ideas, institutions, and interests shaping local policy processes. They are shaped by the causal stories that different groups and organizations use to politicize issues linking the local and the global, to seek new institutional venues, and to promote some solutions over others. We draw on our national surveys in 1989 and 1996 of large and medium-sized American cities to examine these causal stories about globalization and localism and the policy choices they privilege. Five local strategies are especially salient: classic locational approaches, the world-class community orientation, the entrepreneurial mercantilism strategy, asset-based human capital strategies, and the sustainable development orientation.

AB Purpose: A perfusion system for studying the vasoactive properties of the guinea-pig choroid is described.
   Methods: The principle of operation is that the vascular resistance of the entire Vascular network oi an isolated, perfused eye can be monitored by recording the pressure required to deliver a constant flow of perfusate through the network Delivery of the pharmacological agent of interest into the perfusate stream and the subsequent determination of the magnitude of any induced pressure changes allows the vasoactive potency oi various agonists to be assessed.
   Results: The baseline vascular resistance was 1.35 +/- 0.16 mmHg.min/mu L (mean +/- SEM; n = 10) and the mean response to intraluminal delivery of 124 mmol/L K+ Krebs was an increase in resistance of 297 +/- 67%. Vasoactive responses were sustainable for more than 8 h.
   Conclusions: This system will now be used to study the vasoactive properties of the guinea-pig choroid in greater detail.

DT Article
AB Building on the basic tenet of environmental accounting, a simple Keynesian framework is adapted for the determination of sustainable income. The adaptation involves the formulation of linear as well as nonlinear frameworks of income determination. These frameworks are empirically demonstrated for the US economy by integrating standard macroeconomic data with macro-environmental data. The analysis includes the derivation of sustainable income paths and the evaluation of wages and technology/management policies for jointly achieving full employment and sustainable income. The results indicate efficiency improvements in the utilisation of environmental capital and possible convergence between the sustainable and actual income paths.

AB For more than a decade environmental specimen banking (ESB) has been an established approach for monitoring and retrospective environmental survey purposes in a number of developed countries. Specimen banking is carried out on regional or national scales for various environmental materials. The ecological or problem-oriented approach, as pursued e.g. in Germany or USA has the advantages of a restricted survey and a clear political mandate. Environmental problems, however, are by no means national or regional issues, since the diversity and dispersion of hazardous substances make environmental monitoring clearly a global affair. The structuring of our environment suggests that banking should not be limited by national boundaries, but rather be based on eco-systematic principles. Such distinct banking efforts should be devoted to the monitoring of physico-chemical aspects of climatic change and air pollution, soil quality, and aquatic monitoring on a world-wide scale. As some experience already exists with specialized banking programs for marine samples, such as the National Marine Mammal Tissue Bank or the Mussel Watch Program in the United States, an international marine specimen bank, based on principles of national ESB's, is advocated to be established in due time. Following the recommendations of the 1992 Rio 'Earth Summit' to pursue sustainable development strategies, such an establishment could strongly facilitate efforts concerning pollution control and mitigation, overexploitation and mining of ocean resources on a regional or global scale.

SO CHIMIA

DT Article
AB Over the past 20 years an impressive number of environmental legislative instruments have been implemented across the EU, part of which have widely influenced the development, the production and the marketing of chemical substances and products. The need to align ecology and economy in the marketplace under the approach of sustainable development has defined a policy designed to exert control on the handling of chemicals. Safe product use and environmental protection have become key activities with the objective to safeguard the environment, the workers as well as the consumers when they get into contact with chemical products. In 1967 the so-called Dangerous Substances Directive has paved the way for providing a maximum of protection regarding the safe handling of chemicals while avoiding barriers to trade in the EU. Today the legislative developments have evolved towards the risk assessment (and management) of new and existing chemicals. These instruments have been accompanied by an increasing need for information to be shared with various audiences, and of which the Safety Data Sheet represents probably the most largely distributed document.

AB Naturally-occurring wetlands perform such functions as flood control, pollution filtration, nutrient recycling, sediment accretion, groundwater recharge and water supply, erosion control, and plant and wildlife preservation. A large concentration of wetlands is located in Eastern Europe. A significant amount of Eastern European wetlands has been converted to agricultural use in the past, and remaining wetlands are subject to agricultural drainage. Drained wetlands are used as prime agriculture lands for a variety of food crops. Other agricultural uses of wetlands range from growing Phragmites australis (common reed) for thatch and livestock feed, to collecting peat for heating and cooking fuel. Altered hydrologic regimes due to global climate change could further exacerbate encroachment of agricultural land use into wetlands.
   The vulnerability and adaptation studies of the U.S. Country Studies Program are used to analyze where climate change impacts to agriculture may likewise impact wetland;areas. Scenarios indicate higher temperatures and greater evapotranspiration altering the hydrologic regime such that freshwater wetlands are potentially vulnerable in Bulgaria, Czech Republic, and Russia, and that coastal wetlands are at risk in Estonia. Runoff is identified as a key hydrological parameter affecting wetland function. Since wetland losses may increase as a result of climate-change-induced impacts to agriculture, precautionary management options are reviewed, such as establishing buffer areas, promoting sustainable uses of wetlands, and restoration of farmed or mined wetland areas. These options may reduce the extent of negative agricultural impacts on wetlands due to global climate change.

AB In this paper aspects of knowledge generation and administration concerning management of a rural enterprise in the Argentine Chaco region are analyzed, The deterioration of natural resources and human living conditions show that forest-cattle interaction and the ecological economics of the system are poorly understood or not properly taken into account. A methodological solution to a typical decision-making problem is proposed here and illustrated by a worked example extracted from a real feasibility study. The introduction provides a summary of the natural history and of the human interventions in the region. Arguments on the role of silvopastoral systems in reverting forest and soil degradation into sustainable productive undertakings are also exposed, The mathematical treatment of the problem follows a system theoretic approach, A basic nonlinear model for the dynamics is designed first. Its simplest version includes three state variables (livestock units, forest biomass and forage availability) and two manipulated variables (percentage of female calves sold each year and percentage of the cows that did not give birth during the past period and went for sale), States and controls are related by coupled differential-difference equations. Selected results from simulation are shown, Foundations are also laid for taking into account impulsional controls (selective and massive wood extractions, forage implantation, cattle additions and sales). The objective function reflects sustainable development principles, It evaluates the process in terms of usual economics and introduces ecological components of the management strategy, The total cost is expressed as the accumulation of net expenses made for a fixed number of years, minus the sale value of the firm at the end, Then a dynamic programming scheme is developed for finding optimal trajectories with respect to the basic setup, Shadow prices for the states are derived from the solution. Progress towards the building of a decision support system with the preceding elements is reported.

AB Economic growth is distinguished from commercial growth and is defined in this article as the growth of the value a society puts in monetary terms on all commercial and non-commercial goods and values it possesses during a certain period. A computable general equilibrium model is used to show the impact of changes in the endowments, preferences and production possibilities on economic income, which in the model comprises all wealth. Besides land with its natural resources and labor, energy is the key endowment to drive an economy, The model leads in an intuitive way to the following conclusions: (1) Societies should start to use appropriate indicators for true economic growth, rather than just for commercial growth as measured by gross national product. (2) All types of economic growth are limited, no matter if based on endowment growth, production efficiency growth, or changes in preferences, (3) Economic growth should be oriented more towards increasing production efficiency and less towards using more natural resources, (4) Human population growth puts at risk the possibilities for average economic growth per person. (5) We should get better prepared to use solar energy in the future. (6) Besides economic growth, there exists pure utility growth, which is not measurable in monetary terms; it includes much of scientific progress in the long run and is of great importance even though it cannot be included in an indicator of economic growth.

AB Constructed and natural wetlands are capable of absorbing new phosphorus loadings, and in appropriate circumstances can provide a low cost alternative to chemical and biological treatment. Phosphorus (P) interacts strongly with wetland soils and biota, which provide both short term and sustainable long term storage of this nutrient. Soil sorption may provide initial removal, but this partly reversible storage eventually becomes saturated. Uptake by biota, including bacteria, algae, and duckweed, as well as macrophytes, forms an initial removal mechanism. Cycling through growth, death and decomposition returns most of the biotic uptake: but an important residual contributes to long term accretion in newly formed sediments and soils. Despite the apparent complexity of these several removal mechanisms, data analysis shows that relatively simple equations can describe the sustainable processes. Previous global first order removal rates characterize the sustainable removal, but do not incorporate any biotic features. This paper presents an autobiotic model, based upon cycling through the biomass compartments, and calibrates it to data from 17 years of operation of the Houghton Lake, MI treatment wetland. This model replaces a first order concentration-based rate with a first order biomass-based rate. When coupled with mass balances, it describes the spatial distribution of both biomass and P concentrations, as well as the evolution of the new standing crop. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

SO ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT QUARTERLY

DT Article
AB ''Sustainable development'' is an emerging approach to development combining aspects of traditional economic development with elements of environmental and social policy. This article examines the experience of Canadian federal and provincial governments in formulating sustainable development policies over the past decade through ''Round Tables'' of government officials and private sector representatives. The influence of these efforts on economic development policies is specifically examined. The Canadian experience suggests that sustainable development can influence development goals for the natural resource industries and provide improved understanding of the economic and environmental implications of regional growth in a way that enhances long-term prospects for economic growth. However, success at formulation of sustainable development policies does not equate with success at adoption or implementation. Varying approaches to political leadership, government organization, timing, and management create varying results.

TI The Kuznets curve for the environment and economic growth: Examining the

SO ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING A
LA English
DT Article
ID QUALITY
AB Recent research has examined the relationship between certain indicators of environmental quality and income, concluding on the basis of econometric estimation that in some cases an inverted-U relationship, which has been called an environmental Kuznets curve (EKC), exists between these variables. There has been speculation on the implications of this for economic and environmental policy. In this paper I examine this research as a whole and find that unequivocal evidence for an EKC relationship is very scant; that there are important indicators which show a monotonically increasing relationship; that even where there may be an EKC relationship, most of the world's population is still on the section of the curve that is increasing, so that growth in income on the basis of this relationship would result in considerable further environmental damage; and that reviews of overall environmental quality even in the richest countries show that it is still declining. I conclude that from the point of view of environmental sustainability the income-environment relationship is still very problematic and that determined environmental policy will be required if future income growth is to be compatible with sustainable development.

ID CONSUMPTION
AB Most people value and enjoy the benefits that the use of their own car brings to their quality of life. These benefits are reflected in the increases in travel, the use of more resources, and the production of more pollution. However, this situation is not sustainable. In this paper the author argues the case for planning playing an instrumental role in achieving sustainability objectives in transport. It reviews the contributions that economics (pricing) and technological measures might have. The conclusion reached is that the scale of price increases required to achieve a reduction in car use will not be politically acceptable. Similarly, technological improvements may only give us a breathing space before more positive action is necessary. Even if the environmental problems created by the car are solved, there will always be the underlying problem of congestion. The only alternative is to travel shorter distances, to develop the potential for linking activities, and to use the car less-this is where planning has a key role.
   Three main actions are proposed to avoid the need to travel. The first is the implementation of a set of development principles through examining the role that density and settlement size might have on urban sustainability. This issue is particularly important given the current debate at all levels in the United Kingdom over housing allocations and the possibility of a new generation of new settlements. The second action explores the concept of the social audit and the social costs associated with the closure of existing facilities and the opening of new facilities, many of which are inaccessible to those without a car. There have been savings to the provider of the facility through economies of scale, but additional costs have been transferred to the users of these facilities. The social audit would examine all the costs and benefits of these decisions, with a view to subsidy to prevent closure and a tax on greenfield developments to help pay for the redevelopment of brownfield sites within urban areas. The third action is to create quality neighbourhoods in cities to maintain and promote communities with high environmental quality and no congestion. It is only through maintaining and improving environmental quality that urban sustainability can be enhanced, as these locations must form the focus for development. They allow for the provision of clean public transport, they would promote walk and cycling, and they would reduce levels of car dependence.

AB This paper presents a foundation for improving the risk assessment process for freshwater wetlands. Integrating wetland science, i.e., use of an ecosystem-based approach, is the key concept. Each biotic and abiotic wetland component should be identified and its contribution to ecosystem functions and societal values determined when deciding whether a stressor poses an unreasonable risk to the sustainability of a particular wetland. Understanding the major external and internal factors that regulate the operational conditions of wetlands is critical to risk characterization. Determining the linkages between these factors, and how they influence the way stressors affect wetlands, is the basis for an ecosystem approach. Adequate consideration of wetland ecology, hydrology, geomorphology, and soils can greatly reduce the level of uncertainty associated with risk assessment and lead to more effective risk management. In order to formulate effective solutions, wetland problems must be considered at watershed, landscape, and ecosystem scales. Application of an ecosystem approach can be greatly facilitated ii wetland scientists and risk assessors work together to develop a common understanding of the principles of both disciplines.

AB India has a territory of 328 million hectares, which receives an average annual rainfall of 120 cm; this is among the highest for a comparable geographical area in the world. Despite India's vast water resources, droughts and famines are a common occurrence in many parts of country. This paper briefly surveys India's river-basin systems, drought-prone areas, hydrogeological systems, groundwater potential and utilization in light of water-quality constraints, and environmental pollution in India. This paper concludes by clarifying the main actions required to ensure a sustainable development of water resources in India.

AB Nonuse values are a potentially very important, but controversial, aspect of the economic valuation of the environment. Since no use is envisaged by the individual, a degree of altruism appears to be the driving force behind nonuse values. Whilst much of the controversy has focused upon measurement issues associated with the contingent valuation method, this paper concentrates on the underlying motivations, whether ethical or economic, that form the basis for such values. Some fundamental aspects of defining and quantifying economic nonuse values are considered, and possible motives for attributing value to the environment are analysed, making a clear distinction between 'selfish' altruism and 'selfless' altruism. The difference has crucial implications for economic valuation and for assessing individuals' willingness to pay for environmental quality. The concept of Safe Minimum Standards is introduced as a means of supplementing purely economic methodology to incorporate ethical concerns into decision making.

AB The basic thesis that environmental values must spring from the economic relations of human societies is examined and it is suggested that although such connections are never absent, they do not account for the totality of values. Rather, they interact with other values in a kind of helical strand which is open-ended and self-organising. In such a context, 'sustainability', for example, becomes a rather time-limited idea. Our present ways of describing such evolution and interactions are also briefly examined.

AB This paper presents a systematic discussion, mainly for non-economists, on economic approaches to the concept of sustainable development. As a first step, the concept of sustainability is extensively discussed. As a second step, the argument that it is not possible to consider sustainability only from an economic or ecological point of view is defended; issues such as economic-ecological integration, inter-generational and intra-generational equity are considered of fundamental importance. Two different economic approaches to environmental issues, i.e. neo-classical environmental economics and ecological economics, are compared. Some key differences such as weak versus strong sustainability, commensurability versus incommensurability and ethical neutrality versus different values acceptance are pointed out.

AB Objectives: To develop and test the long-term feasibility of an interdisciplinary independent drug information service providing both written and oral drug information to physicians in an urban area of Sweden (> 400 000 inhabitants).
   Method's: A drug information service was developed encouraging a cooperative approach between a department of clinical pharmacology, general practitioners (GPs), pharmacists, and Drug and Therapeutic Committees. Scientifically-based drug information was condensed and interpreted by a team and presented in both written and oral form. In one part of the area, both oral and written information was provided, while in another part of the area, only written information was distributed. Questionnaires and one prescription survey were performed to elucidate the knowledge and attitudes of the GPs regarding drug treatment of one condition (urinary tract infection, UTI, and norfloxacin were used as examples), as well as their opinion of our services.
   Results: Over a period of 10 years, 75 issues of a drug bulletin (2000 copies) were distributed. Oral, producerindependent drug information, provided jointly by a GP and a pharmacist, was given on 16 occasions in each of 30 health centres (150 GPs). Around 80% of the GPs participated in the meetings. Of these GPs, 75% found the service important for their daily work. A majority of the GPs had prescribed the test drug, norfloxacin, not a first-line drug according to local recommendations, I year after approval. A significantly lower proportion of prescribers were observed in the area where the GPs had been provided with both written and oral information regarding recommended treatment (including first-line drugs) for uncomplicated cystitis. The approximate cost for this service in 1995 was SEK 0.685 million (USD 0.1 million); the prescribing costs of the 150 GPs were estimated at SEK 255 million per year. This means that the cost of the service per GP is only around 0.3 % of normal prescribing costs.
   Conclusion: Over a period of 10 years the information/education method described here has proven sustainable and feasible in terms of providing the information, regarding participation of the target group GPs in the oral sessions, and regarding integration of the service into the existing health care system.

AB Six sustainable enrichment cultures of thermophilic H-2-oxidizing microorganisms utilizing Fe(III) as an electron acceptor were obtained from geothermally heated environments located on two continents (America, Eurasia) and on islands in the Northern (Iceland) and Southern (Fiji) hemispheres. demonstrating the wide distribution of these microorganisms. The main products of amorphic Fc(III) oxide reduction were magnetite and siderite. The observed temperature range for Fe(lII) reduction in growing cultures was from 55 degrees C to 87 degrees C, extending the known limits for growth of Fe(III)-reducing microorganisms producing extracellular magnetite to nearly 90 degrees C.

AB We assessed the damage caused by selection logging of mahogany in a tropical forest in northern Belize and compared it with damage reported in other Neotropical logging and disturbance studies. We mapped skid roads and tree felling sites, and assessed soil compaction, loss of canopy cover, damage to saplings and trees, seedling survival and seedling height growth. Logging had been conducted using hand crews with chain saws and cable skidders. Logging directly affected 11.9 ha (12.9%) of the 92.3 ha logging area. Canopy cover decreased the most at logging gaps, and soils were most compacted on skid roads. Soil compaction was much greater on roads where more than one tree had been skidded. For the whole logged area, canopy cover declined 2% and compacted soils covered 3.8% of the area. Seedling height growth was unaffected by soil compaction, but seedling survival was less on compacted sites. About 50% of the trees and about 15% of the saplings were damaged in gaps and along skid roads. However, only 4.8% of the trees and 1.9% of the saplings were damaged for the logged area as a whole. The most common kinds of damage included scraped bark, snapped tops, and run-over stems. Although this logging operation had relatively low impacts compared with other logging operations in the Neotropics, it may not be silviculturally sustainable because its disturbance may be insufficient to promote adequate mahogany regeneration.

AB Nutrient fluxes were determined in a chronosequence of Douglas-fir stands in the Beaujolais Mounts (France). Annual and seasonal variations occurred during the 3 years of investigation; fluxes were generally highest in autumn-winter.
   Atmospheric inputs were among the mean values from a monitoring network of forest ecosystems in France. Nutrient outputs from the soil profile were higher than average and occurred mainly during vegetation dormancy.
   Mean input-output budgets were negative for N, S, K, Ca and Mg, characterising an imbalance of the site chemistry dynamics. The P budget was positive. Most of the nutrient output from the ecosystem occurred as losses in the drainage water. These losses were related to excess nitrification and consecutive cation mobilisation throughout the soil profile.
   Surface water, however, had a neutral pH and very low nitrate and aluminium contents, which may have been buffered by the subsoil,
   Budgets differed between stands and tended to be more negative in the youngest stand. Part of this behaviour was related to stand age and part to the former land use of plots. Theoretical budgets were calculated for forest rotation lengths of 20, 40 and 60 years; it was concluded that shorter rotations would increase nutrient losses. The trend of a decrease in budget deficits with stand age suggests that the effect of vegetation change will be reduced at the next rotation but the impact of stand development may remain.
   Predicted nutrient budgets for a second 60 year Douglas-fir rotation suggested that available Ca in the soil would be depleted and that this depletion would be even more drastic if whole tree harvesting were adopted.
   In conclusion, Douglas-fir stands introduced changes in soil function that may impoverish the soil if present trends remain the same over the next forest rotations. The maintenance of sustainability will require nutrient input by fertilisation.

TI Certified wood markets in the US: Implications for tropical
   deforestation
SO FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
DE ecological certification; green premium; forest products
AB Ecological certification is touted as a market based incentive for improved tropical forest management and has generated considerable debate in development programs, academia, industry and environmental circles. The fundamental belief is that consumers will be willing to pay a premium for wood products produced in well managed or 'sustainable' forest operations. The true test of willingness to pay comes from the results of actual market transactions and the most accurate estimation will come from the people who, for the past few years, have been directly involved in the certified wood market. This paper focuses on merchants who have been actively involved in US markets for certified wood products. Survey results indicate an active and growing market. However, there is little evidence of a 'green' premium being applied to final products. Further, merchants who purchase from international sources face significantly more problems than do merchants who purchase from domestic sources. The result is that new entrants into the market are purchasing from domestic, not international sources. Thus, the potential of ecological certification as a market based incentive to reduce tropical deforestation from the US perspective is questionable.

DT Article
DE Africa; land productivity; land quality; soil constraints
AB Africa, with a total land mass of about 30.7 million km(2) and a population exceeding 746 million persons, has generally lagged behind in agricultural development. Sub-Saharan Africa (excluding South Africa) is the poorest developing region, with 29 out of 34 countries being some of the poorest in the world. The purpose of this study is to develop a Soil Taxonomy map, based on the FAO Soil Map of the World, which together with other data, is used to make continent-level assessments of land productivity and sustainability. Prime land occupies about 9.6% of Africa and the lands with high potential occupy an area of about 6.7%. The medium- and low-potential lands, which together occupy 28.3% of the area have major constraints for low-input agriculture. Resource-poor farmers who live on these lands have high risks and, generally, the probability of agriculture failure is high to very high. The remaining about 55% of the land consists of deserts or other lands with major constraints even for low-input agriculture. The desert margins have nomadic grazing which with increasing animal population is stressing the environment. A soil quality analysis and an evaluation of sustainable production, based only on biophysical considerations, suggest the need for major investments to enhance the productivity of the soil resources of this continent.

AB Agri-environmental policies have become increasingly prominent measures in the farm sector of England and Wales. This major development has not escaped the attention of agricultural geographers, but little work has emerged which overtly explores the geographical consequences of agri-environmental policy on land use patterns and countryside conservation. Understanding this geography is important in the evaluation of the unevenness of post-productivist processes in the countryside. Using different 'scales' of analysis and specific examples, this paper examines published literature, secondary and primary data to tease out the geographical impacts of agri-environmental policy. Each scale of analysis informs the interpretation of agri-environmental policy impacts in different ways. A national scale analysis provides a general impression of farmers' interest in conservation and their receptiveness to agri-environmental schemes. However, numbers of farmers enrolled gives little idea of the quality of environmental practices undertaken and any subsequent modifications to land use patterns. Moving to a regional scale permits greater sensitivity to interactions between scheme characteristics and factors peculiar to farming in a locality. A wide variety of agri-environmental policy outcomes emerge, demonstrating that a meso-scale analysis is a useful aid to detailed research into the geography of agri-environmental policy. Farm and field scale approaches show that existing studies concentrate on processes of adoption and less on outcomes 'on the ground'. However, a selection of complex patterns at these scales are highlighted. Micro-scale aspects of agri-environmental policy deserve far more attention from agricultural geographers, although integrative research which draws upon insights gained from each scale is advocated to understand fully the geographical impacts of agri-environmental policy on land use patterns.

AB The paper explores the possible impact of the Botswana Secondary Schools Management Development Project on human resource development in the education sector. The introduction describes the context of the project, relates organizational development to human resource development and outlines the concept of the self-managing school. After a discussion of the educational context, within the framework of the revised National Education Policy, the infrastructural elements of the project are related to the conceptual networks which include equity, sustainability and co-operation (teamwork). This is followed by a description of a school-focused strategy and the adoption of two key methodologies, co-consultancy and action research. Project activities are outlined in tabular form before looking at the approaches and structures that are intended to enable creative and flexible sustainability. The key section looks to the future, exploring the potential impact the project may have on the professional development of the educational manager cadre in schools and the Ministry of Education.

AB The strategies for resources management depend upon the underlying comprehension about ecosystems dynamics. Contrasted approaches arise according to whether emphasis is laid on ecosystems' equilibrium or on resilience. Management proposals are based on the later spares temporal and spatial heterogeneity.
   Arid and semiarid ecosystems follow pulse-reserve dynamics; i.e., they show a remarkable short-term temporal variation. Water availability is the major controlling factor, yearly precipitation is variable, and occurs in infrequent, discrete events. After a long dry period, the system is in an inactive steady state. Rainfall triggers growth and biomass builds up. The size of the production pulse depends on the input level. The system's persistence depends both on the amounts of stored reserves, and on backflow to reserves. Any factor interfering with storage mechanisms or accelerating reserve losses reduces the persistence capacity.
   In arid and semiarid ecosystems with high resilience, cryptic degradation takes place, and when its effects become evident it is usually too late to stop the process. The management of these ecosystems is a delicate enterprise, since small disturbances gradually reduce their resilience up to the threshold value, beyond which an unpredicted event may irreversibly degrade the ecosystem. The Venezuelan arid and semiarid lands occupy 4.6% of the territory. Their long history of devastating land use, based on goat herding in a haphazard manner at the expense of natural vegetation, has depleted the ecological base, and increased poverty. Their small relative extension and great fragility, are arguments to encourage a strategy of ''no-action''. However, the importance of vegetation cover in ameliorating climates, as well as the presence of an impoverished human population, are good reasons to promote research and development, based on a minimum risk policy.
   Governmental agencies have handled the situation in an unidimensional fashion, focusing their attention on water scarcity. However, it is the set of interactions in the socio-ecological system that influence the pulse-reserve dynamics and modify resilience. In this paper, a different approach, based all the local experience and with the community participation from the planning stage, is proposed. Land use diversification with minimum capital input is promoted. The aim is to optimize land use while reducing extra regional dependence; i.e., increasing self-reliance.
   Actual and potential uses of native and introduced forage species are promoted, together with the appropriate cropping systems, in order to reduce the pressure on natural vegetation. Lowcost technologies, aimed at increasing water and soil conservation, are analyzed. The quest of the intersection between scientific knowledge and concrete action the current social media, offers an opportunity to overcome the classical approaches.

ID INDIA
AB In this paper we present an optimization model (using Linear Programming) for sustainable agriculture development in the Chellampatti block of Madurai District, Tamil Nadu, Southern India. The model is developed based on the availability of various energy sources in the block, and the requirements of various human and agricultural activities. The model optimizes the distribution of land for cultivating various crops based on the block's energy resources limitations and also to meet the minimum energy requirements of human beings and animals with regard to cereal, pulses, oil seeds, sugar, vegetables, fuel and feed. It is also suggested that the model can be modified to suit the local conditions so that it can have universal application for sustainable agriculture development. It is shown that, by applying the model, the revenue of the block through agriculture can be increased from the existing per hectare income of Rs 17 600 to Rs 27 175.8 through proper planning, even without the import of cereals and external input energies like chemical fertilizers, diesel and machinery. The model takes care of the environment and the agro-ecosystem of the villages so that ecological balance is maintained. The model is solved by the HYPER LINDO software package in a PC-AT computer environment. (C) 1997 by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI Stocking rate effects on sheep and forage productivity under rubber in
   Malaysia
SO JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
AB The productivity of grazing sheep was assessed under 7-year-old rubber at the Rubber Research Institute of the Malaysia Experimental Station at Sungai Buloh near Kuala Lumpur between October 1988 and May 1990. The sheep were Dorset x Marlin crossbred lambs and they grazed planted leguminous cover crops and naturally occurring species at a range of stocking rates.
   In the immature rubber trial, presentation yields of forage declined with time regardless of stocking rate. In the mature rubber trial, presentation yields of forage were low (<1000 kg/ha) due to low light transmission. High stocking rates (>6 sheep/ha) resulted in a decrease in the proportion of palatable species, namely Pueraria phaseoloides, Paspalum conjugatum, Asystasia gangetica and Mikania micrantha and an increase in the proportion of the less palatable species such as Calopogonium caeruleum and Cyrtococcum oxyphyllum.
   Daily liveweight gains ranged from 100 g/lamb per day at 4 sheep/ha to 70 g/lamb per day at 14 sheep/ha in the immature rubber trial. Only the lowest stocking rate of 2 sheep/ha was continuously sustainable in the mature rubber trial. The estimated maximum liveweight gain that could be achieved under immature rubber was 266 kg/ha per year at a stocking rate of 13.2 sheep/ha.

TI GPI distributors: Field notes on a partnering relationship for
   sustainable business
SO JOURNAL OF BUSINESS RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
AB The relationship between GPI Distributors and its partnering supplier, Vellen Lumber, is profiled based on field notes from a series of in-depth interviews with distributor respondents. From this form of case data, specific partnering activities are documented and a detailed description of the wood products market is provided. Most of the partnering activities described are in the anticipated direction according to the prediction matrix developed by project coordinators, Richard P. Vlosky and Elizabeth J. Wilson (described in Fontenot and Wilson, 1997, this issue). However, an interesting ''protection'' activity was described whereby GPI and Vellen attempt to guard their market shaves from potential competitors while not violating anti-trust regulations. This subtle finding is an example of ''thick description'' that can result from field notes. Thus, a contribution of this article is to provide an example of field-based data in qualitative research.

AB Environmental pollution has become a major concern for the future of life on our planet; medical care, especially in hospitals, contributes significantly to this pollution. The increasing usage of highly-developed medical devices, drugs and disposable products are a drain on natural resources as well as financial ones. In this situation, it is a major task for hospital epidemiologists to maintain high standards of hygiene while reducing environmental pollution, reducing consumption of limited natural resources, and minimizing costs. The reduction of hospital waste, the control of polluting and toxic emissions, the avoidance of unnecessary disinfection procedures and disposables, and the implementation of energy and water saving technologies are practicable measures in hospital ecology. To realize a sustainable development within hospitals, it is necessary that the need to maintain a balance between effective infection control and a good ecological environment is recognized and supported by health-care workers and the hospital management.

TI Building sustainable public policy decisions through partnerships
SO JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING
LA English
DT Article
AB Sustainable resolution of complex and controversial environmental issues by government agencies in the public policy arena can hinge on the success of the decisionmaking process. Governmental partnerships can assist in building resilient decisions. A decision closure framework that targets decision-making closure and is composed of human factors, operational characteristics, and organizational structure are used as a tool to analyze the strengths and weaknesses of three government partnerships. The analysis proceeds to use a single region's partnerships to minimize the influence of human factors. Nevertheless, several of the key factors identified in successful decision making from the three partnerships stemmed largely from the contributions of the human qualities. The procedural characteristics most helpful in decision closure included establishment of clear roles and responsibilities, preparation and ratification of partnership documents such as vision statements and work plans, and regular assessments of performance. The analysis suggests that a two-tiered organizational structure with compartments for input from ''subjective'' and ''objective'' sources is successful for information exchange.

ID SAFETY
AB The use of technique of genetic engineering in the food system is the source of some debate. Proponents stress the potential biotechnology has for reducing the need for agricultural chemicals and improving the production quality, safety, cost, and convenience of food products. They consider special labeling unnecessary and potentially misleading. Opponents raise a variety of food safety ecological, social, and ethical issues and call for labeling, sometimes at any cost. Both ranges of views make valid points and overlook important realities. Nutrition education professionals, who are seen as trusted sources of information about food biotechnology, can help consumers understand issues raised by genetic engineering and facilitate cooperative dialogue among consumer, industry, and regulatory groups with the ultimate goal of promoting a safe, nutritious, and sustainable food system.

AB All mature individuals of Aglaia aff. flavida (Meliaceae) were mapped in a 260 ha study area at the Crater Mountain Biological Research Station in Papua New Guinea. Sixty-four reproductively mature trees were found in an aggregated distribution with a mean inter-tree distance of 88.9 m. The sample consisted of 35 female and 29 male trees with a mean shortest distance between sexes of 232 m. Seed production and seed removal of 22 female trees was monitored throughout the 1992 fruiting season. Female trees within 200 m of male trees generally produced large seeds crops (> 100 seeds) whereas trees farther than 200 m from the nearest male had small seed crops (< 100 seeds) regardless of female size (DBH). Most seeds (63.2%, n = 3312) produced in a sub-sample of 22 trees came from the five most fecund trees, which also produced 74.1% of the seeds that were removed by vertebrate dispersers. Where a minority of a population of rare tropical trees produce the majority of progeny, sustainable harvest practices would be most effective where highly fecund individuals are identified and conserved.

AB The amounts and chemical composition of bulk precipitation were investigated over a continuous 21-mo period (January 1990 to September 1991) at four sites along an East-West transect perpendicular to the coast of Southwest Viti Levu, Fiji. Measured rainfall totals in 1990 ranged from 1796 mm at the coastal Korokula station to 2113 mm at the inland Tulasewa station, which is somewhat higher than the long-term average of 1707 mm at a reference weather station located in the centre of the study area. The first 9 mo of 1991 were relatively dry (range 1027-1533 mm) with a total of 1157 mm at the reference site as compared to a long-term average of 1330 mm. Concentrations of all investigated constituents in bulk rainfall were low, except during the passage of cyclone Sina due to the deposition of large amounts of, especially, chloride, sodium and sulphate in sea spray. Concentrations of sodium and magnesium could be explained fully by maritime contributions to the rainfall composition at all sites, Maritime contributions to the concentrations of calcium, sulphate and potassium accounted for 10-40% of the total, whereas bicarbonate, ammonium, nitrate, silicon, aluminium, iron and manganese were derived exclusively from terrestrial sources. The annual atmospheric nutrient deposition rates were low by pan-tropical standards, particularly when the contribution of cyclone Sina was excluded. Annual totals (in kg ha(-1)) ranged from 2.4-8.8 for nitrogen, 0.4-1.1 for phosphorus, 2.3-4.9 for potassium, 1.4-1.9 for calcium and from 1.1-1.3 for magnesium. The inclusion of the contribution by the cyclone more than doubled the deposition of potassium, calcium and magnesium, although values still remained well within the range reported for humid tropical areas. The estimated atmospheric deposition of nutrients over a typical rotation period (16 y) was sufficient to balance losses in harvested Pinus caribaea logs (stemwood plus bark) of potassium, calcium and magnesium, but not of nitrogen and, probably, phosphorus. Nutrient losses associated with the harvesting of stemwood alone were compensated entirely by the atmospheric inputs.

TI Reconfiguring the edge city: The use of ecological design parameters in

SO LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING
LA English
DT Article
DE ecological design; sustainable communities
AB Suburban development in the Greater Vancouver Region of British Columbia, as with edge-city development elsewhere in North America, continues to erode forest and farm, disrupt hydrological patterns, and weaken the overall ecological integrity of the region. Fragmented landscapes and equally fragmented communities isolate citizens from nature as well as from one another. Alternative approaches and models for creating sustainable communities are urgently required. This paper presents one such model, using criteria developed from a wide range of exemplary sustainable community approaches employed elsewhere in North America and Europe. It compares this model sustainable community with an existing edge community in the region and concludes with the assertion that a high level of sustainability is not only attainable but also can improve a community's sense of the civic and sense of place.

AB Phyllostachys pubescens Mazel ex Houzeau de Lehaie is one of the largest bamboo species with a leptomorph root system in the world. The species originates in China and has been naturalized in the neighboring countries. It was introduced in 1746 into Japan because of the economic value of the young sprouts and culm woods. It escaped from the planted areas and expanded by invading the original vegetation. In order to clarify the basic ecological characteristics of the species, carbon fixation and cycling were determined in a stand of Phyllostachys pubescens. The standing culm density and average DBH in 1991 were 7100 ha(-1) and 11.3 cm, respectively. The above-ground biomass was 116.5 t ha(-1) for culms, 15.5 t ha(-1) for branches, 5.9 t ha(-1) for leaves and 137.9 t ha(-1) in total. The total above-ground biomass was one of the largest among the world's bamboo communities. The biomasses of rhizomes and fine roots were 16.7 t ha(-1) and 27.9 t ha(-1), respectively. Annual soil respiration was 52.3 t CO2 ha(-1) yr(-1), the highest among those determined in Japan. The gross production was high: 32.8 t C ha(-1) yr(-1). Allocation of the products to its root system was also high: 34% to gross production and 46% to the fluxes out of the leaves into other compartments of the ecosystem. This resulted in the reduced above-ground net production of 18.1 t ha(-1) yr(-1), which fell within the average range of productivity of forests under similar climate conditions. This paper discusses the correspondence of the allocation pattern with the successful range expansion.

SO PROFESSIONAL GEOGRAPHER

DT Article
DE drought; perception; marginal environments; content analysis; ranching
AB Drought exacts a heavy toll on agricultural productivity, yet it has been largely defined as a one-dimensional natural hazard. This paper explores an understanding and defining of drought based on the perception of ranchers in the marginal physical environment of western South Dakota. Analysis of interview data reveals at least four separate dimensions of drought: (1) when a percentage of normal rainfall is received, (2) when ranch operation is affected, (3) when a definite amount of rainfall is received, and (4) the timeliness of rainfall. The incorporation of perception-based data with site-specific drought severity indices, such as the Palmer Index, can provide a more complete characterization of a hazard affecting the productivity and sustainability of semiarid environments worldwide.

AB In this paper, echoing the spirit and purpose of Michael Chisholm's best work, I discuss the economics of alternative patterns of land use and development. First, the paper revisits Angle-American debates from the 1960s and 1970s on the economics of urban form. Second, it looks at significant new conclusions from work in Britain in the late-1980s and early-1990s. It then summarizes an emerging academic debate on sustainable urban development. Finally it looks at some relevant European policy initiatives on sustainable urban transportation and land use, and asks what pointers these intiatives offer to the future.

AB Several strands of social movement activism have recently coalesced in France to push a new agenda for sustainable agriculture into the policy arena. Activist groups are forming alliances nationally and across Europe to devise common strategies. The emergence of collective action by these groups has been undertheorized in social science literature dealing with sustainable agriculture. This article suggests one approach to bridging this knowledge gap by considering the origins of these movements in the context of theory based on karl Polanyi's (1957) book, The Great Transformation. Viewed as examples of Polanyi's concept of the double movement of societal societal self-protection, the histories and goals of these groups are interpreted as reflecting an ongoing struggle to define a place for nonmarket social and environmental concerns that are threatened by an increasing emphasis on agricultural competitiveness in global markets.

AB Knowledge issues are a critical dimension in the politics of the sustainable agriculture movement. Recent research has examined how sustainable farming networks facilitate the creation and exchange of local knowledge about alternative practices and ideas. This article extends those analyses by exploring the role of social location in that knowledge creation and exchange process, based oil field research in a sustainable fanning network organized by and for women farmers. Different experiences in everyday life may create multiple and partial perspectives from which local knowledge for sustainability is generated and exchanged.

AB There are few places where the hegemony of industrial agriculture is more complete than in contemporary Mexico. The forces arrayed against sustainable agriculture in such a context are formidable; yet this study chronicles an encouraging agroecology movement in indigenous regions of rural Mexico. Mexico's sustainable agriculture movement is emerging at a surprising nexus, in new linkages between indigenous resistance and modem environmentalism. These alliances center on a shared interest in the preservation and defense of traditional ecological knowledge. The resulting fusion of traditional and scientific knowledge undergirds creative experimentation in agreecology, discussed here as an essential component in a larger, although more difficult, quest for sustainable development.

AB The scientific cadre often assumes that research and farming decisions are value-free. Biological scientists and agricultural producers need to recognize how our values influence the degree to which we engage difficult long-term economic, environmental, and social impacts of technology. Identification and clarification of values can help shape and inform decisions on research and production practices. Envisioning activities can create an awareness of the consequences of current systems and open new vistas for the future. Envisioning how a farm or a community can appear in 25 years engenders challenges to current assumptions about efficiencies of scale, impacts of new technologies, and social consequences of changes in agricultural systems. Scientists can ''learn from The future'' by examining successful and unsuccessful models tried in other places and times, and create prejerable futures that reflect values of producers and society rather than accepting a trend-based future for each farm and community.

AB The central question posed by this essay is whether sustainable agriculture will be able to rescue modem industrial agriculture from its present state of crisis. To answer this question this article begins by outlining the economic, social, and ecological dimensions of the crisis each of which must be addressed by an alternative paradigm in order to pull agriculture out of crisis. It then examines a persistent contradiction in the alternative agriculture movement: that of input substitution versus agroecologically informed transformation of farming systems. It is argued that the prevalence of input substitution, which emphasizes alternatives to agrochemical inputs without challenging the monoculture structure of agricultural systems, greatly diminishes the potential of sustainable agriculture. By only addressing environmental concerns, this dominant approach offers little hope of either reversing the rapid degradation of the resource base for future production or of resolving the current profit squeeze and debt trap in which the world's farmers are caught.

AB Data from a long-term farming systems trial of sustainable and conventional cash grain rotations are used to show the relative merits of participating in the government farm programs These rotations were studied through use of 20-year simulations of the 1990 Farm Program, the 1990 Farm Program with expanded flex provisions, and three proposals for the 1996 Farm Program including one that closely resembles the Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act of 1996. These different commodity programs provide a beneficial income safety net for farmers who have made the decisions to practice sustainable crop rotations The benefits, however, are less than those for conventional farmers. Compared with conventional farmers, sustainable program participants face (I) restrictions in practicing their rotations, (2) reduced land values because of loss of base acreage, and (3) smaller income streams from reduced deficiency payments. Program alternatives that offer 100% flexibility allow sustainable farmers largely to avoid the first two problems; the 1996 act can provide a financial safety net for conventional farmers interested in converting to a more sustainable crop rotation.

AB Global considerations and international initiatives have a significant impact on a nation's policy choices and directions. As societies and their economies become increasingly integrated, new institutions of global governance will significantly shape political and economic behavior on both national and subnational levels. Given this context, the evolution of sustainable development as a conceptual and policy framework in agriculture will be partly determined by the emerging international rules governing trade and the environment. With North America as the primary focus, this article examines the current institutional frameworks of GATT (now the WTO), and NAFTA and identifies the (dis)incentives and opportunities they provide for agricultural production and sustainability.

AB The rapid transition to integrated pest management in Indonesian rice production represents the world's most successful policy effort to reduce pesticide use on a national level. This article seeks to identify the reasons for this success. Conventional policy analysis, which focuses on state regulatory and economic intervention, misses several important factors. State and nonstate actors cooperated in a unique division of policy labor that allowed both traditional and alternative policy mechanisms to be used. These mechanisms included a decentralized and participatory form of information generation and dissemination. In addition to bureaucratic autonomy, institutional arrangements in the Indonesian case included a decentralization of decision-making authority, creating an integrated policy-making process capable of learning about, and responding to, local conditions.

AB Research on nitrogen fixation tends to become more carefully targeted, and covers not only biological but also social and cultural aspects to achieve sustainability. However, many issues remain unsolved, such as improving N-2 uptake and the delivery mechanisms, the influence of free nitrogen in the soil and its influence on nodulation. The importance of analysing traditional field practices by farmers is stressed with examples from Mexico and Costa Rica involving Leucaena, Alnus acuminata and Erythrina spp. The case of E. poeppigiana, widely propagated by large cuttings as a shade tree for coffee where it is drastically pollarded twice a year, is described and analysed. Apparently the practice provides considerable benefits to the soil and associated crops. Erythrina spp. also show promise as nurse trees to favour nearby planted timber trees. These and other examples lend themselves to promising research projects. (C) 1997 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB The pressing need to increase food production in the tropics to Feed the burgeoning population of the Third World requires that crop yields ha(-1) must be increased without prejudicing the resource base for future generations. Biological nitrogen fixation (BNF), especially that associated with legumes, has great potential to contribute to productive and sustainable agricultural systems for the tropics, but more research is required to investigate how biologically fixed N, and the increased BhTF contributions resulting from research innovations, can be incorporated into viable agricultural systems to increase crop or pasture yields and to substitute N fertiliser inputs. A majority of the soils of the humid and semi-humid tropics have mineral fractions composed of 1:1 lattice clays or sesquioxides of relatively low capacity to retain nutrients (CEC) and water (WHC). It is the soil organic matter (SOM) which has high CEC (after liming) and WHC, and soils under undisturbed climax vegetation are usually high in organic matter which is responsible for their fertility. The key to the long term fertility of such soils is to maintain their soil organic matter by the preservation of crop residues and the selection of suitable crop rotations or fallows. In this review we examine several types of agricultural systems utilised in the tropics ranging from pastures, ley cropping, zero-till rotations as well as green manuring and discuss the management options that can be adopted to preserve their agricultural productivity through the strategic use of legumes in these systems, and their effects on pasture and crop yields. The introduction of forage legumes into tropical pastures can increase and sustain their productivity, with only modest inputs of lime and P and K fertilisers. Similarly, crop and pasture rotations (ley cropping) maintain SOM and soil fertility and crop yields can benefit greatly from the introduction of pasture legumes into the ley. Continuous cropping under minimum or zero tillage can maintain soil cover, and stimulate the retention of SOM, such that nutrient losses are often minimal, and legume derived N can be efficiently transferred to subsequent crops. The options for the resource-poor small-holder to efficiently utilise biologically fixed N as a N supply for cereal grains are more limited and need more attention from researchers as well as less neglect from government organisations. The addition of lime and P fertiliser in modest quantities in many under-developed regions could make large contributions to increased crop yields. If such modest fertiliser inputs were to be combined with suitable crop rotations including green manure or grain legume crops, larger increases in crops yields could be achieved on a sustainable basis, but in many regions agricultural extension services are non-existent and poor farmers have little access to even these basic chemical inputs.

AB Grain legumes fix about 15-210 kg N ha(-1) seasonally in Africa, and therefore feature prominently in the cropping systems of traditional farmers. However, increased exploitation of this biological N is constrained by various environmental and nutritional Factors, including the cropping patterns used. An evaluation of traditional cropping systems in Africa shows that crop rotation involving legume and cereal monocultures is by far more sustainable than intercropping, the most dominant cultural practice in the continent. Tree legumes also fix about 43-581 kg N ha(-1) y(-1), making their leaf prunings an important component of sustainability in agroforestry and alley cropping systems. In a single year, the prunings of Sesbania sesban can provide up to a hectare of cereal crop, up to 448 kg N, 31.4 kg P, 125 kg K, 114 kg Ca and 27.3 kg Mg, thus making the foliage of this legume the ''ideal'' fertilizer. Clearly, achieving sustainable yields in Sub-Saharan Africa would require a deeper understanding of how fixed N in legume residues is managed in the soil environment, in addition to expanding the use of neglected African food legumes, which exhibit considerable drought resistance and nitrate tolerance. In Africa. where soil moisture often limits yields, research on neglected, symbiotic native legumes with NOS and drought-tolerant traits would constitute a sound basis for increased sustainable production.

ID SOUTHEAST BRAZIL; NODULATION; INOCULATION
AB Biodiversity, nutrient cycling and energy flux are the bases for sustainability of any system. Among the essential nutrients for plant growth, N is the most expensive and energy-consuming, and potentially is an environmental pollutant. Mixed crops with N-2-fixing trees (NFTs) have been thought to maintain biodiversity and sustainability of systems in the tropics. However, most of the empirical knowledge and scientific research done with NFTs have taken for granted that all legume species nodulate and fix N under field conditions without inoculation or without supplementing phosphorus, the most common limiting essential nutrient for legumes in the tropics. In the last few years, surveys on nodulation of legume tree species and selection of highly efficient rhizobial strains for legume trees have received more attention. More than 600 species have been observed for their nodulation status in Brazil and from their nodules approximately 2400 rhizobial strains have been isolated. From 44 legume species with potential uses in the different agrosystems, efficient N-2-fixing rhizobia have been selected and are available for inoculant production. New species of rhizobia or bradyrhizobia have been described and large collections of isolates are being developed. Useful legume tree species may contribute around 12 tons of dry litter and 190 kg of N ha(-1) y(-1) to renovate degraded soil. These studies have prompted use of nodulated and mycorrhizal legume trees to revegetate poor or depleted soils with the goal of restoring their fertility. Experiments with native and introduced legume tree species have been successful in revegetating exposed subsoil, open mining areas and acidic residues from bauxite mining without addition of organic soil. However, supplements of rock phosphate, gypsum, micronutrients and potassium are required. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB Seven tree legumes with agroforestry potential were tested for their capacity to nodulate with indigenous rhizobia or bradyrhizobia in soils collected from different ecological zones in South Africa. Our findings show that all the tested species, except Acacia senegal, could effectively nodulate with root-nodule bacteria native to Venda and Klipspruit soils. Since Acacia seyal, Acacia galpinii, Albizia lebbeck and Acacia auriculiformis exhibited, in that order, a greater level of growth and symbiotic performance, they manifest themselves as suitable species for agroforestry programs in Venda and Klipspruit soils. One indigenous species, Acacia ataxancantha, was assessed to be a non-nodulating legume even when inoculated with a promiscuous strain of Rhizobium NGR234. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

ID SLOPE
AB Understanding the basic processes and factors that are responsible for inducing land degradation, particularly soil erosion and associated phenomena is critical to the conceptualization, design, and implementation of productive, stable, and sustainable agricultural systems. This is particularly so on steeplands where the potential for soil erosion and runoff water losses is high. The productivity and degradation hazards on these lands are determined by the site's climate, soil and topography. However, their uniqueness lies more with their topographic constraints than with other factors. Use of steeplands is an increasingly common situation in the tropics because of high population pressures and continuing encroachment on hilly lands. Erosion potential and actual erosion in these settings may exceed tens or even hundreds of tons of soil loss per hectare per year; thus the selection and design of cropping systems, land management systems, and water management systems must be tailored to attain effective runoff and erosion control in order to avoid their detrimental impacts both on-site and off-site. Contrary to the customary arguments for the 'long-term' nature of erosion impacts; enhancing the conservation-effectiveness of rainfed fanning on tropical steeplands can be shown to provide both short- and long-term benefits to the farming system, the overall economy, and the environment. Productivity-enhancing crop and soil and water conservation management approaches (biological measures) may be more important than structural measures in imparting long-term sustainability. Incorporating indigenous knowledge into project design should be emphasized to assure the farmer's involvement and cooperation in planning, implementing, and maintaining conservation measures.

AB Greater knowledge of the long-term effects of tillage and N fertilization on soil chemical and physical properties is needed in order to assess the contributions of these practices to sustainable land management, especially in warm, subhumid climates where organic matter is quickly oxidized. Soil properties were evaluated after 16 years of corn (Zea mays L.)/cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) production under conventional-bedding (CT), moldboard (MB), chisel (CH), minimum tillage (MT), and no-tillage (NT) with low (45 N kg ha(-1)) and high (90 N kg ha(-1)) N fertilization on an Orelia sandy clay loam (fine-loamy, mixed, hyperthermic Typic Ochraqualf) soil in south Texas (USA). Tillage systems significantly affected soil bulk density in the 0- to 200-mm soil depth. No-tillage bulk densities ranged from 5 to 19% higher than for the other tillage treatments while those from MB ranged from 7 to 21% lower. Conservation tillage treatments (NT and MT) resulted in a 30 to 135% increase in surface crop residues compared with other tillage treatments, while plots with the high N rate exhibited 8% more residue than with low N fertilization. In the 0- to 50-mm surface layer, organic C, total N, and extractable P were approximately 64, 78, and 110% higher with NT than with the average of the other tillage treatments. Higher N fertilization increased organic C, total N, and extractable P by 9, 7, and 19%, respectively, in the 200-mm depth. No-tillage decreased cation exchange capacity (CEC) and soil pH as compared with MB, CH, and CT in the 0- to 50-mm soil layer. Residual NO3--N to a depth of 1200 mm under NT and MT was consistently less than with the other tillage treatments. Higher levels of soil organic C, total N, and extractable P and lower concentrations of NO3- were directly related to surface accumulation of crop residues promoted by conservation tillage management. The long-term sustainability for crop production on this soil appeared to be enhanced with reduced tillage management. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Good-quality soil is important for crop production sustainability of agricultural lands. An indicator of soil quality is the soil organic carbon (OC) concentration, which affects the soil dry aggregate (DA) and water-stable aggregate (WSA) size distribution. These, in turn, affect the soil quality. This study was conducted to establish relationships among various DA, WSA, and soil OC variables of a Torrertic Paleustoll (Pullman clay loam) using simple, polynomial, and multiple regression procedures. Samples were obtained from a depth of 0-3 cm of 18 differently managed dryland treatment areas or fields at Bushland, Texas, USA, to determine DA and WSA size distributions and OC concentrations of bulk soil. The water stability and OC of aggregates obtained by dry sieving were determined also. Areas sampled ranged from plots or fields cropped to winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and grain sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench) for over 20 years to grasslands converted to cropland in 1994. Of the 110 relationships analyzed, 63 were significant at P less than or equal to 0.05 and another 23 were related at P levels of 0.10, 0.20, or 0.40. Variables involving the 0.84 to 2.0 mm DAs often were significantly related to various other DA and WSA variables and to soil OC variables, including a positive relationship with bulk soil OC. The DAs in this size range resist erosion by wind. Because of their significant relationship with WSAs, they are important also for maintaining water infiltration, thereby reducing the potential for erosion by water and increasing the potential for greater soil water storage. Practices such as reduced or no-tillage retain crop residues on the soil surface and thereby maintain or enhance surface soil OC concentrations, which enhance the development of DAs in this size range. By inference, these practices, therefore, are important also for maintaining production sustainability of Torrertic Paleustolls such as Pullman clay loam and similar soils.

TI Economic analysis of size and feed type of swine production in Hawaii
SO SWINE HEALTH AND PRODUCTION
LA English
DT Article
DE swine; profitability; farm size; feeding; Hawaii
AB Purpose: To examine the profitability of Hawaii swine production and the industry's potential for future expansion.
   Methods: Sixty commercial hog producers were interviewed to collect data on capital investment in and various costs of and returns from swine production. Costs and returns were compared by farm size and type of feeding practice. Factors that significantly affect profitability were determined. Costs and returns of farrow-to-finish operations were also compared between Hawaii and Iowa.
   Results: The study showed wide variation across different farm sizes with respect to total economic cost and net return per 100 Ib (45.4 kg) of live hog produced. The total economic cost was negatively correlated (r = -.318, P = .016) and net return was positively correlated (r = .336, P = .011) with farm size. The average net return for large herds (> 75 sows) was higher (P = .003) than for small (< 25 sows) and medium (25-75 sows) herds. Factors related to these differences were lower (P < .001) labor use, a lower (P = .006) price for purchased feed and a tendency to wean more (P = .067) pigs per sow per year in large herds compared to small and medium herds. However, the sample revealed a sizable proportion of small herds that had profitability comparable to some large herds. Although feed costs were lower among garbage feeders, their total economic cost per 100 lb (45.4 kg) of live hog produced was relatively higher than for grain feeders. Overall, grain feeders were not significantly different in profitability from garbage feeders. Garbage feeders did not realize the full benefits of reduced feed costs due to garbage feeding because they paid a higher (P = .002) price for purchased feeds, used more (P < .001) labor, and weaned fewer (P < .001) pigs per sow per year compared to grain feeders. On average, the total economic cost per 100 Ib (45.4 kg) of live hog produced by farrow-to-finish operations was nearly three times higher in Hawaii than in Iowa.
   Implications: Capturing economies of size and increasing efficiency may be the key to a sustainable swine industry in Hawaii.

AB It seems safe to say that in the past technological change created more jobs in total than it destroyed. That this was true in the past does not mean it will be true in the future. As advanced industrial economies struggle with jobless growth, tower-income countries will have to create new jobs in very large numbers. With technology, in all its forms, reducing the direct labor content of production in almost all sectors, it is not clear that there will be enough work either the developed or the developing countries. Any transition to sustainable development requires that most people in most places achieve levels of economic security they deem adequate. Thus, creating decent jobs by the hundreds of millions poses a fundamental bottleneck to sustainability. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Inc.

AB Knowledge of weed biology is essential for development of both economically and environmentally acceptable weed management systems. Weed biology relates to plant attributes such as morphology, seed dormancy and germination, physiology of growth, competitive ability, and reproductive biology. Concepts of population biology such as seedbank dynamics for annuals and root reserves, dormancy, and longevity of vegetative propagules for perennials can be used to predict weed infestations better and to evaluate sustainable management strategies. Integrated approaches that give priority to depletion of root reserves or seedbanks through interfering with dormancy or germination requirements have great potential to enhance weed management strategies in the future.

AB This paper discusses the role of microbial resource collections in the ex situ conservation of microbial diversity and, in particular, the activities of a recently completed Darwin Initiative project to facilitate collection, identification and exploitation of Indonesian microbial diversity. This helped revitalize the collection of the Lembaga Ilmu Pengetahuea Indonesia (Indonesian Institute of Sciences), LIPI, Research and Development Centre for biology, Bogor, Indonesia. It is suggested that a focus on microorganisms beneficial to man is essential to enable ex situ collections to be a useful tool in the conservation and sustainable utilization of microbial diversity. This task is enormous and far beyond the capabilities of one collection and its achievement will necessitate a network of collections.

AB Evaluating biodiversity in agricultural areas requires two steps: (i) adequate measurement and (ii) pertinent interpretation. Since the whole spectrum of biodiversity in the sense of the Rio Convention cannot possibly be measured as such, adequate measurable correlates or surrogates have to be found. One possibility are standardized inventories to assess species diversity in specious groups of arthropods. They can provide reproducible and comparable values for estimates of site-specific biodiversity in the form of averaged rarefaction functions for the relationship between numbers of individuals and numbers of species in different habitats. Examples of 'rapid biodiversity assessment' are presented and their possibilities and limitations are discussed.
   At a higher integrative level, biodiversity evaluation can be based on landscape parameters. According to a proposed conceptual model, the 'mosaic concept', regional biodiversity mainly depends on structural parameters such as habitat diversity and landscape heterogeneity, and functionally on metacommunity dynamics.
   Approaches with a combination of both site-specific biodiversity measures and assessments of habitat diversity and heterogeneity are not yet established, but in the near future may lead to a scientifically based evaluation of the potential for increasing biodiversity by appropriate landscape management. In the light of scenarios for global change, maintaining high levels of overall biodiversity in agroecosystems may become as important for ecological sustainabilty as keeping up high abundances of presently well-adapted beneficial organisms.

AB This paper emphasizes some aspects of soil protozoology related to agriculture, viz. farming systems, biocides, and biodiversity. Ecofarming slightly increases abundances and biomasses of soil protozoa and stimulates soil life in general. Agroecosystems are more sensitive to conventional farming practices than grasslands, especially under severe climatic conditions, e.g, water stress, The increased soil life under ecofarming is not associated with an increased crop yield. In contrast, yield decreases more or less distinctly. However, the yield loss is usually partially or completely compensated by the reduced operating expenses (energy input) per crop unit. Thus, ecofarming appears to be a useful practice, especially for sustaining biodiversity.
   The effects of biocides on soil protozoa can be summarized as follows: (1) The general pattern of reaction of soil protozoa to biocide stress is the same as that of other organisms; (2) Many protozoan species seem to be just as sensitive to pesticides as other more commonly used test organisms; (3) Insecticides are usually more toxic than herbicides and disturb soil protozoa critically, i.e, populations often do not fully recover within 60 days; (4) Fungicides have rather varied effects but most of them very likely do not influence soil protozoa critically. There is still a great need for comprehensive, well-designed field studies on the effects of biocides on soil protozoa, especially testate amoebae.
   Literature on protozoan species diversity in agroecosystems is sparse, highly scattered, and burdened with misidentifications. Our own data indicate that species richness of ciliates is usually only slightly decreased, and is sometimes even higher, in agroecosystems as compared with neighbouring natural biotopes. This contrasts with species richness of testate amoebae, which is invariably and distinctly (greater than or equal to 50%) reduced by agriculture, leaving an impoverished version of the original, much more diverse community. Testate amoebae are thus highly sensitive bioindicators in agroecosystems. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB A preliminary study of soil macrofauna biodiversity in a set of ecosystems, from natural reserves to managed agroecosystems, provides indications that species number, population density and biomass decrease from natural ecosystems to agroecosystems. The main reason for the decrease appears to be a lack of available organic matter and essential element supply in the agroecosystem soil. However, biodiversity of soil biota as a whole is relatively close in agroecosystems and natural ecosystems if considered in terms of an index of genetic saturation (IGS). IGS is equal to the sum of S(m(j) x k(j)) where S is the sum of products m(j) and k(j) for species of a separate group of organisms (S is equal to species number in the group), m(j) is the production of j-species and k(j) is the DNA concentration in this j-species. The main biodiversity pool is in the microbial biomass of any ecosystem. Maintaining biodiversity for a sustainable agriculture is connected with maintaining available organic matter and essential nutrient sources in the soil. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Technological development in agriculture has led to a diminished use of biodiversity in food production, and a reduced efficiency of energy use. This paper explores the reasons for these paradoxical effects of progress, by considering the farming system as an integral part of the larger socioeconomic system and natural environment in which it operates. Whenever changes in the socioeconomic and demographic characteristics of society result in a higher opportunity cost of labor, land and capital, the agricultural sector has no other option but to augment the productivity of labor, land and the economic return of capital investments. At the farm level, this translates into the need to increase the density of agricultural throughputs, per hour of farm labor and per hectare of land, in the agroecosystem. Above a certain threshold, high densities of agricultural throughputs can no longer be achieved with natural patterns of matter cycling in the agroecosystem. Fossil energy inputs and monoculture then become a necessity.
   The relationship between socioeconomic and demographic characteristics on the one hand and actual productivity of labor and land in agriculture on the other hand is confirmed by a cross-sectional analysis of a large sample of countries. General trends in economic and population growth indicate that most countries are moving toward high-energy-input and labor-saving technologies. Moving away from this path of technological development in agriculture, as would be required to preserve and enhance biodiversity use in agriculture, is an immense challenge that needs to be faced.

   forest management
AB Indonesia has the world's third largest area of tropical forest. These forests are treasured for their high biodiversity, a result of the country's unique geographic positioning, but also as an economically important natural resource. Although the early decades of accelerated timber exploitation in Indonesia demonstrated little concern for the sustainability of forest resources, recently a shift to genuine conservationist forest policies can be observed. These new policies, however, mainly relate to the forestry sector and much less to the ongoing conflicts between the state and forest-dependent people. It is still a commonly held belief that swidden agriculturists are responsible for about half of Indonesia's annual deforestation. In order to solve this problem the country has defined a number of measures that attempt to convert swidden agriculturists into sedentary cultivators. In this paper these measures are discussed, and they are juxtaposed to new insights on the nature of the dynamics of swidden agriculture and the role that forest management plays in this agricultural method. The official schemes only propose some sort of plantation development, which significantly reduces biodiversity in the agricultural landscape. With an example of swidden agriculture from West Kalimantan, including it's important forest management component, this paper demonstrates that developing such existing agriculture-forest management holds the potential to bring economic development to the region, while biodiversity is conserved.

AB Holistic Resource Management (HRM) is a process of goal setting, decision making and monitoring which integrates social, ecological and economic factors. Biodiversity enhancement is a fundamental principle in HRM and students are taught that biodiversity is the foundation of sustainable profit. In the HRM process, practitioners develop a holistic goal which includes: (1) quality of life values, (2) forms of production to support those values, and (3) landscape planning, which should protect and enhance biodiversity and support ecosystem processes of succession, energy flow, hydrological and nutrient cycling, We present an overview of the HRM model and results of interviews with 25 HRM farmers and ranchers from across the USA in which perceptions and experiences with respect to the role of biodiversity in the sustainability of their operations were explored. An ethnographic approach and qualitative research methods were used in the interviews. While only 9% of the interviewees reported thinking about biodiversity in the context of their operations before being exposed to HRM, now all of them think biodiversity is important to the sustainability of their farms and ranches. Of the people interviewed, 95% perceived increases in biodiversity (particularly with respect to plants) and 80% perceived increase in profits from their land since HRM began influencing their decisions. In addition to perceiving increases in biodiversity, all of the interviewees reported observing indications of positive changes in some of the ecosystem processes on their farms or ranches. In addition, 91% of the interviewees reported improvements in their quality of life because of changes in their time budgets. Three of the interviewees who had quantitative data on changes in numbers of plant species and economic indicators are discussed in detail. We conclude that holistic management approaches like HRM are worthy of further study. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Ethiopia is known as a center of diversity hosting various flora and fauna. Traditional farmers living in the country's highly varied agro-ecological zones have developed various farming systems that are characterized by the high degree of inter- and intra-specific crop diversity across space and time. A wide range of crop diversity has been maintained by traditional farming societies in a sustainable way through the accumulated experience and interaction of farmers with their natural environment and without the need for technical scientific knowledge or external commercial inputs. The technological packages of improved high input seeds (often hybrids), inorganic fertilizers, pesticides and herbicides, although useful in raising production in the short-term, have been seriously eroding genetic diversity at the farm level. In line with this, the paper discusses the implications of these technologies to peasant farmers, the challenges and prospects, the particular functions of diversity in sustaining production in the traditional sector, the need for conserving indigenous seeds (landraces), and the roles women play in the development and conservation of crop genetic resources. The paper highlights the relevance of diversity from the farmers' point of view with practical examples. Initiatives taken to develop the local capacity towards achieving a sustainable production particularly by the resource-poor farmers living in marginal areas or changing growing conditions are also discussed.

AB We characterized the bacterial populations that grew in a Moffett Field, Calif,, aquifer following three sequential field tests of phenol- or toluene-driven cometabolism of trichloroethene (TCE), Reducing the toluene and phenol concentrations in most-probable-number (MPN) tubes from 50 to 5 ppm increased the population density measured for these degraders by 1.5 and 1 log units, respectively, suggesting that natural populations might be quite sensitive to these substrates, Phenol and toluene degraders were isolated from the terminal MPN dilution tubes; 63 genetically distinct strains were identified among the 273 phenol- and toluene-degrading isolates obtained, TCE was cometabolized by 60% of the genetically distinct strains, Most strains (57%) grew on both phenol and toluene, and 78% of these strains hybridized to the toluene ortho-monooxygenase (TOM) probe, None of the strains hybridized to probes from the four other toluene oxygenase pathways, Gram-positive strains comprised 30% of the collection; all of these grew on phenol, and 47% of them also grew on toluene, but none hybridized to the TOM probe, Among the gram-negative strains, 86% of those that grew on both toluene and phenol hybridized to the TOM probe, while only 5% of those that were TOM-positive grew on toluene alone, A larger proportion of TCE degraders was found among gram-negative than gram-positive strains and among organisms that grew on phenol than those that grew on toluene, Hybridization of strains to the TOM probe was somewhat predictive of their TCE-cometabolizing ability, especially for strains isolated on toluene, but there was also a significant number (20%) of strains that hybridized to the TOM probe but were poor TCE cooxidizers. No Moffett Field isolates were as effective as Burkholderia cepacia G4 in cooxidizing TCE, Most of the aquifer strains ranged from moderately effective to ineffective in TCE cooxidation. Such populations, however, apparently accounted for the successful phenol- and toluene-stimulated TCE removal that occurred during the field assessment of this remediation process, This suggests that naturally occurring communities of only moderate TCE-cooxidizing ability may support successful TCE bioremediation as long as the phenol or toluene present is not limiting, This activity, however, may not be sustainable for the long term, because TCE-inactive populations that consumed toluene at rates equal to that of the best TCE degraders were present and hence would be expected to eventually dominate the community.

AB Monitoring soil physical and biological properties may provide useful information in assessing the sustainability of agricultural systems, as these two components of soil are mainly responsible for improving the soil fertility status and higher plant productivity. Soil physical and biological properties often change when. different cropping, tillage, or management systems other than conventional cultivation practices are imposed. The effects of ley cycles on selected soil physical properties and biological processes were assessed in the Indian arid zone of Jodhpur. Moisture retention and infiltration rates were significantly higher with the ley treatments compared with those of the conventionally cultivated field (CCF); saturated hydraulic conductivity was lower for the different ley treatments. Dehydrogenase, phosphatases, and nitrogenase activities were higher for the ley treatments than for the CCF treatments. Nitrogenase activity was not detected at 15 to 30 cm depth of normal cultivated soil. Continuous forage production for 6 to 8 years had resulted in an increase in the population of nitrifying bacteria, viable VAM spores, organic matter content, and total nitrogen. In general, these increases were highest in soils that remained in stubble. There was no significant difference between the 6- and 8-year ley cycles. Subsurface soil in all the treatments had a lower biological activity. The results of the study demonstrated the potential value of grass leys for enhancing soil biological processes, moisture retention, and infiltration rates. Additionally, the ley treatments improved soil fertility status, resulting in significant increases in yields of pearl millet grain and straw.

TI Empowering women in villages: All-women village councils in Maharashtra,
   India
SO BULLETIN OF CONCERNED ASIAN SCHOLARS
LA English
DT Article
AB In 1989 seven all-women village councils were elected in Maharashtra as a result of the campaign of the Shetkari Sanghatana, a large farmers' organization. A study of three different villages reveals important gains in empowerment seen in terms of access to work, education, and income, as well as an overall tendency for the women's councils to focus on issues of sustainable development. There were differences within villages, however, mainly due to different styles of local leadership. Within India, in the context of various efforts to attempt women's empowerment, the Sanghatana's strategy of mass organizing uniting the women and men of the majority of village farmers and agricultural laborers can be contrasted with the ''radical feminist'' approach, which often pits women against men, as well as with the ''enclave'' strategies of some left organizations and nongovernmental organizations that have limited social impact because they focus entirely on one section of a community.

   From central to community orientation
SO COASTAL MANAGEMENT
LA English

   management; participatory action research; traditional knowledge and
   management systems
ID MARINE RESERVES; PHILIPPINE
AB The development phases of coastal management in tropical countries are described. Precolonial, centralized, community based, and collaborative coastal management are identified as forms of management which have evolved to what today is called integrated coastal management. Centralized management began during colonial times when any attempt at management was orchestrated from the top of government. Community based coastal Management, in response to the failures of more centralized approaches, began in the Philippines through several projects, the experience of which spread to other countries in Southeast Asia and to Ecuador in the 1980s. The concept of collaborative management is now accepted as a description of variations in joint management arrangements between government and community or with the private sector stakeholders. It is suggested that collaborative management and integrated coastal management are more or less synonymous. The trends identified within tropical coastal management include interdisciplinary research and management integration, valuing traditional knowledge and management systems, increasing reliance on local participation, and using participation oriented research approaches. It is seen that the capacity for improved coastal management is increasing dramatically with a strong emphasis on training through academe and field learning trials. The authors ave positive about current developments in coastal management, while cautioning practitioners that global economics will increasingly impact the use and conservation of coastal resources. A theme is that local government and community accountability in coastal management will help make efforts effective and move sustainable.

TI Sustainable resource management in the Brazilian Amazon: The case of the
   community of Tiningu
SO COASTAL MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
DE Amazonia; fishing agreements; floodplain land use
ID FISHERIES
AB For centuries, Amazonian populations acquired an intimate knowledge of the local resources and of their variability. This knowledge provided them with a basic understanding of the interrelations between species that motivated them to conserve their resource base and to use appropriate techniques for their utilization. However, in recent years resource use in the floodplains became affected by conflicts between fishermen and members of other economic sectors that use the plains for agriculture, cattle feeding, and forestry. This paper describes the institutional context of Amazonian resource use and explains the conflicts that affect the floodplain resources, as well as the role of fishing agreements to solve them. The paper also outlines the land use practices implemented by the community of Tiningu on the Maica River, municipality of Santarem (Para), and the fishing agreement that Tininguans signed with their neighbor communities and local ranchers to promote the sustainable management of the resource. Although conflicts have been avoided, the feasibility of enforcing such an agreement, in the context of the Brazilian legal framework is debatable.

AB The Murphy Model (MM2) of the Australian economy is designed for forecasting and policy analysis at both the national and industry levels. It traces the quarter-by-quarter adjustment of the economy to a balanced growth path. This paper applies optimal control to MM2. The results show how fiscal and monetary policies should be coordinated to pursue targets for inflation and unemployment. If the inflation target is reduced, monetary policy but not fiscal policy should be tightened to achieve the new target. This monetary tightening increases unemployment, so the optimal severity of the tightening depends on the priority placed on the inflation target relative to the unemployment target. If there is a wage shock which is associated with an increase in the sustainable unemployment rate, both monetary and fiscal policy should be tightened. Copyright (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB The study of economic systems, and their guidance towards sustainability, can be enhanced by understanding how natural systems use materials and energy at various levels of system organization, how these levels interrelate, and how interrelationships change. Towards this end, the paper introduces natural economics as an approach to understanding the dynamics of hierarchical systems. We define the concepts of natural economics to facilitate the description and assessment of system change, and present dynamic modeling as a method for empirical research and as a tool for management decision making. We illustrate with empirical applications the use of dynamic modeling at various levels of system organization. Empirical illustrations range from dynamic models of simple physical systems of material transport, energy degradation and self-organized criticality to models of complex industrial systems, such as US iron ore mining and steel production. The insights derived from the natural economics approach are used to draw conclusions for the study and management of economy-environment interactions.

   ISEW calculation 1955-1992
SO ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
LA English

AB Although the inadequacy of GDP to measure economic welfare is widely accepted theoretically, it is still used as the key indicator for economic policy. This article's aim, therefore, is to give some empirical evidence to the theoretical critique. Economic welfare, or at least its change over time, is estimated by the index of sustainable economic welfare (ISEW), which takes account of GDP, unpaid household labor, social costs, environmental damage and income distribution. The concept of the ISEW, which was originally developed by Herman Daly and John Cobb, is entirely reformulated with special regard to questions of inner consistency and clarity in structure, As an illustration the methods of the calculation in the Austria case study and its results are presented. The main result is that GDP and economic welfare as measured by the ISEW differ significantly. Up until the 1970s GDP only slightly overestimated the growth of economic welfare, but since then it has been completely misleading. While GDP continues to rise, sustainable economic welfare has been stagnating since the middle of the 1980s. The main causes have been growing future welfare reductions, increasing income inequality and a stagnation in the value of unpaid household labor. As GDP neglects those aspects, it systematically misinterprets economic welfare. However, the ISEW does not intend to simply replace GDP as a unique welfare measure but should form part of a more holistic social reporting system.

AB Insects can provide one source of income to villagers as part of an alternative to logging. The Insect Farming and Trading Agency (IFTA) of Papua New Guinea aims to return as much income as possible to village-level insect collectors. An increase in demand or profit margin in the insect trade could potentially benefit sustainable forestry schemes that include insect collecting. The sustainability of insect collecting is discussed. Species rarity, specimen prices, and species wing sizes are compared. Prices are greater for rarer species, Prices are correlated with wing size, particularly at the retail level, but rarity is not positively correlated with wing size. Consequently, it should be possible to selectively increase the prices of non-rare, larger species at the wholesale level. There is a large wholesale-to-retail price markup for some species. So, consumers are probably willing to pay a wide range of prices for some species, and therefore it may be possible for IFTA to raise prices for species when IFTA is the exclusive supplier and when there is an indication that there is low price elasticity. Although price increases may have a favorable impact on sustainable management of tropical forests, steady and long-term increased consumer demand for insects from tropical forests would likely have a more substantial impact. Income from extractive reserves is usually non-competitive with income from timber, hence a broad package of income sources is usually necessary.

DT Article
AB This paper discusses some issues and challenges which library information systems in developing countries have faced in planning, implementing and managing CD-ROM services. It focuses on the measures taken to solve these challenges in terms of planning, funding, hardware, software, database selection, installation, staff and user training, publicity: use policies and procedures, document non-availability and evaluation. The paper concludes that the implementation of CD-ROM in developing countries will continue growing, and that users will increasingly become more sophisticated and will keep demanding better CD-ROM resources and services. In order to cope with these demands, institutions involved in implementing CD-ROM services will continue pursuing the current trend of adopting resourceful, creative and innovative approaches in tackling the challenges posed by the implementation of CD-ROM. Finally the paper recommends, among other things, that it is crucial to develop a new vision based on a thorough needs assessment to guide library information systems in planning, implementing and developing user-oriented CD-ROM. It is also strongly recommended that a partnership approach between library information systems and relevant departments (like information technology departments), funding organisations, CD-ROM publishers and vendors is crucial for developing sustainable CD-ROM services.

AB This paper presents a description of the Caqueta district in Lima and describes the methodology and research meth ods used. It presents the key findings of the project and concludes with a brief discussion of mitigation as a tool for urban development. The paper seeks to reinforce the key point of the project: the adherence to ''top down'' interventions can ignore community level initiatives and the positive inputs of other actors; also that risk reduction can be used as a tool in uniting key actors to focus on protecting livelihoods, as well as lives, in the promotion of sustainable urban development. This paper results from a recently completed project entitled ''Reducing Risk In Vulnerable Communities, Lima, Peru. Phase One: Caqueta Pilot Project''. The principle aim of the project was to identify and subsequently develop, with the participation of key ''stakeholders'', sustainable risk reduction measures for Caqueta, a particularly low-income area of Lima, Peru, vulnerable to landslides, earthquakes and fire.

   organizational innovation
AB This study examines the factors influencing the adoption of a unique organizational innovation for local forest management in China. The share-holding integrated forestry tenure (or the SHIFT) system in Sanming prefecture of Fujian province, People's Republic of China, is based on a system of benefit sharing and tenureship that provides both management responsibility and economic incentive to local villagers. The adoption of SHIFT has improved sustainability, productivity, equity, and flexibility in the face of changes caused by biophysical and human intervention, and encouraged a more democratic rural life and more power of independent decision-making. It has also given a greater role to professional foresters and led to a more diversified set of management goals. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

TI Sustainable techniques in forestry - A model approach

LA German
DT Article
AB Technical processes in forestry are not sustainable as such, but affect sustainable forest management in many ways. They may have a direct effect on the environment and society or they may indirectly either interfere with Or promote benefits from forestry and the effects of the forest. For a comprehensive assessment of these effects ''eco-efficiency'' and ecological, social and ergonomic ''compatibility'' have to be taken into consideration apart from classical criteria such as ''functionality'' and ''efficiency''. When deciding in favour of a process - or the control variate - various obstacles such as scale levels, values, restrictions, operational objectives and uncertainties regarding the effects of processes or future developments call for a comprehensive model, as proposed in this study. Finally, the postulate is advanced that it will also depend on the technics used in the forest whether forestry experts will be considered sufficiently competent to continue to manage our forests in the future.

DT Article
ID WATER EROSION; LAND; SCOTLAND; ENGLAND
AB Accelerated erosion hers occurred widely in Britain since the land was cleared of woodland from about 5000 years ago, especially, at times of agricultural expansion and increased population pressure, Soil stripped from slopes has been deposited on valley floors and coastal marshes. Much of the evidence for this is portrayed on soil maps and from this information and that in accompanying publications, depths of eroded soil can be estimated Both then and now, the short-term impacts of erosion were and are of little consequence to farmers, but erosion has resulted in a marked longer-term decline in the agricultural productivity of soils. Presently, water and wind erosion of arable land can be widespread in certain soil landscapes and the assessment of this erosion in farmers' fields's is described in this article. Accelerated erosion can also be induced by overstocking the land, especially with sheep. This, too, can easily, be assessed in the field. The impacts of present-day accelerated erosion are described and some of the considerable associated costs are estimated Some visual impacts and, for example, the threat of flooding are also important, but cannot be quantified. Because present-day farming practices exacerbate erosion, a more sustainable way of using the land is required.

ID EXPLORING ENVIRONMENTAL VALUES
AB It is increasingly recognized that the success of sustainable development initiatives depends on widespread public identification and support, Indeed, public participation has become a core component of the official discourse of sustainable development, particularly at local level, However to date there has been little research examining the 'cultural' factors governing the potential public uptake of sustainability, This paper reports on a study using focus groups drawn from different sections of the Lancashire public which sought to cast light on public understanding of and identification with sustainable development, Considerable public support was found for the idea that current ways of life are generating problems for the future and that economic activity would have to be held within environmental limits, However there was very little support for the idea that sustainability would be achieved through and business initiatives, in particular was deeply mistrusted as part of the 'system' which was generating environmental and social problems, The paper argues that this mistrust in government and the lack of a sense of individual agency has serious implications for the political salience of sustainable development, Initiatives to generate public participation, particularly by providing information through sustainability indicators, are unlikely to succeed unless this is addressed.

AB A 3-year experiment was conducted to determine the optimum fertilizer N requirements of fresh-market tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.) 'Sunbeam' grown on a hairy vetch (Vicia villosa Roth.) or black polyethylene mulch. In 1993 and 1994, four rates of fertilizer N (0, 56, 112, and 168 kg.ha(-1)) as water-soluble NH4NO3 were applied in 14 equal applications through the trickle irrigation system starting 1 week after planting. Four additional rates (224, 280, 336, and 392 kg.ha(-1)) were applied in 1995 to assess the plant response to supra-optimal levels of N. Hairy vetch produced 3.3-4.5 t.ha(-1) of aboveground biomass and a total N content of 126-169 kg.ha(-1) in the above-ground biomass. Leaf N content at 7 weeks after transplanting of tomatoes correlated positively with yield from black polyethylene but did not correlate with yield from the hairy vetch plots where leaf N content was optimal at all N rates. Predicted tomato yields were higher for the hairy vetch than for the black polyethylene treatment at all applied N rates in all years. Tomatoes grown in black polyethylene required N at 130 to 144 kg.ha(-1) to achieve yields equivalent to those grown following unfertilized hairy vetch. Tomato yield increased in response to applied N in both mulches in all 3 years; optimum N rates of 89 and 190 kg.ha(-1) in hairy vetch and black polyethylene, respectively, were predicted by a linear plateau model, and 124 and 295 kg.ha(-1) by a quadratic plateau model. The linear plateau model is recommended because it would allow less N to become available for runoff and leaching.

TI A concrete response to poverty? Rethinking approaches to urban poverty
   and infrastructure: A Zambian case study
SO IDS BULLETIN-INSTITUTE OF DEVELOPMENT STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
AB This article looks at definitions and concepts of urban poverty and the ways in which they inform the infrastructure debate. Parallels between the treatment of poverty in classical literature and the treatment of urban poverty in the current orthodoxy (notably as developed in the World Bank's World Development Report (WDR 1990)) are examined. This article suggests that this orthodox way of approaching and addressing poverty may not be producing either the most appropriate or sustainable response. The arguments are explored through an analysis of urban infrastructure provision with reference to an alternative approach to water services in urban Zambia.

AB The transmission performance of regular two-connected multihop transparent optical networks in uniform traffic under hot-potato, single-buffer deflection routing schemes is presented. Manhattan Street Network (MS) and ShuffleNet (SN) are compared in terms of bit error rate (BER) and packet error rate (PER) both analytically and by simulation. The authors implement a novel strategy of analysis, in which the transmission performance evaluation is linked to the traffic randomness of the networks. Amplifier spontaneous emission (ASE) noise, and device-induced crosstalk severely limit the characteristics of the network, such as propagation distance, sustainable traffic and bit rate. The results indicate that under the same load the BER performance of single-buffer deflection routing is worse than hot-potato. However, at BER = 10(-9) single-buffer has a higher throughout than hot-potato. It is shown that the feasibility of deflection routing in transparent networks with MS and SN topologies heavily depends on the power coupling coefficient of the routing space switch used in each node.

ID COMPRESSION
AB Rate control is considered an important issue in video coding, since it significantly affects video quality. In this paper, we will discuss joint encoder and channel rate control for variable bit-rate (VBR) video over packet-switched ATM networks. Since variable bit-rate traffic is allowed in such networks, an open-loop encoder without rate control can generate consistent quality video, However, in order to improve statistical multiplexing gain (SMG), an encoder buffer is essential to meet traffic constraints imposed by networks and to smooth the highly variable video bitstream. Due to the finite buffer size, some forms of encoder rate control have to be enforced, and consequently, video quality varies, We argue that a rate control scheme has to balance both issues of consistent video quality on the encoder side and bitstream smoothness for SMG on the network side, We present a joint encoder and channel rate control algorithm for ATM networks with leaky buckets as open-loop source how control models, The algorithm considers constraints imposed by the encoder and decoder buffers, the leaky bucket control, traffic smoothing, and rate control, The encoder rate control is separated into a sustainable-rate control and a unidirectional instantaneous-rate control, It can improve the problem of leaky bucket saturation exhibited in previous works, Experimental results with MPEG video will be presented, The results verify our analysis and show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

On the basis of these developments, this paper considers the use and sustainability of biomass as an industrial fuel. Data is presented, arising from a field study, on biomass supply and availability, costs of energy in key industries and the annual environmental burdens due to the emissions of carbon dioxide and nitrogen oxides to the atmosphere, Estimates are made of reductions in emissions and improvements in the sustainability of fuelwoods from considerations of the thermal efficiency of combustion plant.

TI Measuring Economic Convergence

LA English
DT Article
DE convergence; stationarity; Europe; monetary convergence; real
   convergence
AB The sustainability of the ERM and the feasibility of EMU is dependent upon the economies of the EC achieving the appropriate degree of economic convergence. One of the difficulties in determining this is the absence of a broadly acceptable measure of economic convergence. In this paper we consider possible definitions of convergence for time series. To be useful the definition must allow for the stochastic nature of the data under consideration, and for the development of formal tests of a convergence hypothesis. These two considerations lead us to a preferred definition of convergence and a proposed framework for testing, based on a time varying parameter formulation and estimation by Kalman filter techniques. We consider the relationship between our proposed framework and other methods for testing convergence. It is argued that our method encompasses most of the tests that exist in the literature. Tests for convergence are then applied to exchange rates, interest rates and inflation rates for a sample of countries including members of the ERM. We conclude that the ERM may have helped to promote convergence in the nominal exchange rates. Although interest rate differentials have declined, convergence does not seem to be occurring. For inflation rates convergence can be rejected. Taken together these results suggest reasons for the recent disruption to the ERM and bring into question its sustainability.

AB We assessed the feasibility, practicability and economics of biological control of Kariba weed (Salvinia molesta) in Zimbabwe. The weed has become an important aquatic weed in inland water impoundments in Zimbabwe, and is detrimental to irrigation, both domestic livestock water supply, fisheries and the environment in general. During 1992-95, attempts were made to control Kariba weed using a biocontrol agent (Cyrtobagous salviniae: Curculionidae) on two dams comprising 16 ha in Tengwe commercial farming area in northwest Zimbabwe. The effectiveness of biological control of Kariba weed was apparent within four months of release of the weevil agent and 99% control of weed was obtained within two years. The benefit, cost ratio of biological control as compared to chemical control, was 1:10.6 over a four year period. This study shows the effectiveness, economic benefit and environmental sustainability of biological control of Kariba weed under Zimbabwean conditions.

TI Densification strategies for high endurance P/M components
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF POWDER METALLURGY
LA English
DT Article
AB In recent years the use of powder metallurgy (P/M) parts in automotive drivetrains has shown impressive growth. This is forecast to continue in the medium term (1-5 years) with the ongoing adoption of high volume components such as powder forged connecting rods, P/M main bearing caps and P/M transmission sprockets.
   In the longer term (5-10 years) continued real growth will become increasingly dependent on P/M's ability to displace parts made from heat treated low alloy wrought steel. Many traditional P/M materials will not meet the durability demands of these components, in part due to strength deficits caused by residual porosity and inappropriate alloying.
   This review paper focuses on the density requirements for high performance components. By reference to actual parts in production, it is proposed that no single high density process will meet the requirements for every component. A variety of strategies must be developed, keeping in mind from the outset, that any new process must have a sustainable cost advantage if if is to succeed in dislodging long established manufacturing methods.

TI Planning, democracy and the challenge of sustainable development
SO INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
AB Over the past decade sustainable development has increasingly been adopted as an objective of government policy, and ''planning for sustainable development'' is now a real-world activity of officials and ministries. A survey of conceptual issues, of three environmental economists' proposals to achieve sustainability, and of initial practical experience in the industrialised countries suggest that planning for environmentally sustainable development involves an ambitious attempt to reconcile environmental and development objectives. It is argued that to the extent that this proves possible it will be a radically disjointed process involving interaction of many agencies and actors. At the heart of the challenge of planning for sustainable development is an issue of institutional design to which political science, despite the hesitancy it has so far displayed to engage with the issue, could yet make a meaningful contribution.

   Methodology for calculating growth, senescence and intake fluxes

AB 1. A sustainable, low-input land use might be achieved by the use of grazed grass-legume mixtures. However, maintaining the species balance has proven to be difficult, especially as grazing provides differential defoliation and regrowth. Since changes in the sward botanical composition can be ascribed to species differences in growth, senescence or intake, a method that yields independent estimates of these three fluxes for both components of a grazed grass-legume mixture is needed.
   2. The objective of this paper is to present and assess such a detailed tissue turnover method based on non-destructive measurements of individually marked population units. This method was applied during two spring and summer growing seasons to a ryegrass-clover mixture continuously or rotationally grazed by sheep and is assessed using these experimental results.
   3. Defoliation was measured on grazed population units (i.e. grass tillers; elongated and axillary shoot growing points of clover). To calculate the growth rate of defoliated leaves, a sample of ungrazed leaves of each defoliation status (with or without previous defoliation) was used. Additionally, for clover, a sample of ungrazed leaves of each 'botanical number' was also required. The mean extension rates of leaves that underwent defoliation during an observed period, and of leaves that did not, was not significantly different during the preceding period.
   4. The estimates of the mixture growth flux varied by less than 10 and 17% when the mean values of the gravimetric coefficients and of the density of the population units, respectively, were increased by one standard deviation. The net recruitment of new population units led to an underestimation of the growth flux by 8 and 5% with grass and clover, respectively.
   5. The method was partially validated, by comparing independent estimates of the mean dry-weight of the population units, based either on tissue turnover or on destructive measurements. For vegetative tillers and elongated clover growing points, both estimates were highly correlated with no significant bias.
   6. Although this method is labour intensive, it yields reliable estimates of the growth, intake and senescence fluxes, at three different levels (square metre, population unit and plant part). Hence, a better understanding of the impacts of herbivory on the grass-legume balance in a grazed mixture can be gained.

TI Mineral resources accounting: a technique for monitoring the Philippine
   mining industry for sustainable development

   Southeast Asia (GEOSEA VIII)

AB Mining which extracts exhaustible mineral resources has been condemned by certain sectors as promoting social inequity and underdevelopment. This is so because once a tonne of copper, say, is mined it is forever lost to the future generation. Such perception translates into policies that are usually disadvantageous or even hostile to the industry. Despite this adverse criticism, recent developments in natural resources accounting indicate that mining can truly contribute to the sustainable economic development of a society. True worth of mining in economic development can be assessed and monitored on a continuing basis through an appropriate system of natural accounts (SNA). If the industry is found deficient, such SNA can also point out how the industry can be made to constribute to sustainable growth. The prevailing SNA is criticized as having failed to capture the adverse effects on the welfare of society of producing a nonrenewable resource such as minerals. For instance, the production of copper for a particular year registers an increase in gross national product equivalent to its monetary value. However, the concomitant depletion of the country's natural wealth due to such production is nowhere recorded in the SNA. This faulty accounting gives rise to policies that result in nonsustainable economic growth. In order to address the preceding problem, this paper presents an accounting formula applicable to any nonrenewable resource whereby revenue is decomposed into income and capital components. To achieve sustainable economic growth, it states that the capital component must be invested to generate future incomes. However, investments need not be confined to the same sector. Application of the accounting scheme to the Philippine copper and gold sectors during the 1980-1990 period leads to the following conclusions: (a) by and large, gold and copper mining operations have indeed contributed positively to national income, contrary to allegations of certain sectors of society; (b) level of reserves, metal prices, level of production and interest rates are the major determinants of mineral depletion; as (c) given the results of the accounting exercise, policies can be formulated to enhance sustainable growth. One important constraint of the exercise is the failure to include the environmental effects which are usually considered (though not necessarily so) detrimental to society's welfare mainly because they are not being monitored.

TI The role of women in social protest in the Highlands of Scotland,
   c.1880-1939
SO JOURNAL OF HISTORICAL GEOGRAPHY
LA English
DT Article
AB For some time, the presence and prominence of women has been identified as central to events of rural social protest in Britain. Yet explanation of such centrality has tended to be based upon, and perpetuate, gender divisions. Little regard has been given to the notion that women took part in protest for reasons shared with their male counterparts. A similar pattern of explanation has been advanced for protest events in the Highlands of Scotland. Food riot and resistance to clearance are seen as attempts to defend the 'moral economy', whilst the land seizures of the 1880s are seen as products of a developed class consciousness. Where women's participation is recognized and considered, explanation is not based in the underpinning, legitimizing notion of male protest-the ideology of rights to land-but is based instead in women's domestic role. Separate explanations such as these would appear no longer sustainable. The introduction of capitalism into the region and the consequent development of crofting agriculture, compelled the reworking of existing relations between men and women. Women became central to the functioning of the crofting economy and vital to the maintenance of claims to land. From this they drew the strength to participate in protest and drew upon the same nexus of motivations as their male counterparts. (C) 1997 Academic Press Limited.

   TRACER; YIELDS
AB Soil conservation tillage systems, including ridge-tillage, often reduce surface water contamination by pesticides because soil erosion and surface runoff are reduced. However, the effects on losses through subsurface drainage tile are somewhat uncertain. Our field study quantified the effects of four tillage practices in continuous corn (Zea mays L.) and corn-soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr] rotations on herbicide and nitrate N losses in tile drainage water. Fertilizer and pesticide application methods were uniform for ridge, moldboard, chisel, and no-till systems. Pesticide and nitrate N leaching losses were significantly affected by crop rotation. Tillage practice had little influence on nitrate N and pesticide losses to the subsurface drainage water within a corn-soybean rotation. However, ridge-till and no-till resulted in larger losses of atrazine than the moldboard plow and chisel based systems under continuous corn, Tillage system did not affect the timings of peak tile flow occurrences, although peak tile flow volume was affected by tillage, presumably because each system had its own macropore system related to preservation or annual destruction of biopores by tillage. Corn yields were significantly higher under corn-soybean rotation than with continuous-corn for all tillage practices, These results indicate that continuous corn production is not an environmentally sustainable practice for this area because it resulted in higher nitrate N leaching losses to groundwater, received higher N-applications, and resulted in lower corn yields than the corn-soybean rotation, The results also reinforce the need for studies on chemical placement, rate, and timing for various tillage practices to reduce tile drainage losses of agricultural chemicals.

TI Composting for feedlot manure management and soil quality
SO JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION AGRICULTURE
LA English
DT Article
ID NITROGEN AVAILABILITY; CARBON; MINERALIZATION; WASTE; PATHOGENS; CORN
AB Contemporary industrialized grain and livestock production is characterized by efficient, large-scale confined animal feedlot operations (CAFOs) and equally efficient and large-scale, but separate, grain operations. Though both are highly productive, feedlot operators have come to view manure as a waste management problem, while grain operations face declining soil quality and a reliance on commercial fertilizers to maximize yields. Neither type of operation can be considered sustainable. Cooperative on-farm composting may provide solutions to some of the problems facing our industrialized agricultural systems and render the systems more sustainable. In this paper we view cooperative on-farm composting as the combination and processing of feedlot manure with crop stover to produce a beneficial natural soil amendment and fertilizer for those fields from which the stover was taken. Cooperative on-farm composting would help protect surface and groundwater from nutrient loading, save resources, and help renew social ties within the agricultural community. Composting stabilizes nutrients, kills pathogens and weed seeds, reduces moisture content, reduces odor, and improves physical properties of manure, thereby improving its value as a soil amendment and fertilizer. Although some N in raw manure is lost during composting, the end product differs from raw manure in that it exhibits minimal N loss in storage or after field application. Composted manure can become the primary fertilizer for grain production once the cumulative N mineralization from previous applications reach steady- state. The use of composted manure improves soil quality and greatly reduces total energy consumption compared with the use of commercial fertilizer. A hypothetical example illustrates how compost applications to irrigated corn (Zea mays L.) could result in a net energy savings of about 3.3 million Btu/acre, which is equivalent to the energy contained in 19.4 gallons of diesel fuel/acre.

TI Economic and biological benefits of intercropping berseem clover with
   oat in corn-soybean-oat rotations
SO JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION AGRICULTURE

DT Article
ID LEGUME COVER CROPS; NO-TILLAGE CORN; NITROGEN-SOURCE; GRAIN-SORGHUM;
   YIELD
AB Sustainability of Iowa agriculture may require change from predominantly a corn (Zea mays L.)-soybean [Glycine mar (L.) Merr.] rotation to more diverse cropping systems. Alternative crops are vital for providing temporal diversity. Reincorporating small grains into a three-crop rotation with corn and soybean can provide greater temporal diversity, especially if a forage legume is included as a companion crop, A field study was established in 1991 on a Kenyon (fine-loamy, mixed, mesic Typic Hapludoll) soil to evaluate the economic and biological benefits of an oat (Avena sativa L.) crop underseeded with berseem clover (trifolium alexandrinum L.) in a three crop- rotation. Two rotation treatments were compared: (i) corn-soybean-oat and (ii) corn-soybean-oat intercropped with berseem clover. In 1992, 1993, 1994, and 1995, oat grain yield was not significantly changed when berseem clover was underseeded with the oat crop. However, in 5 yr, oat underseeded with berseem clover produced up to 70% more biomass (harvested material without the grain) than sole-crop oat straw. The biomass (40% oat straw and 60% berseem clover forage) also had adequate digestible material (51%) to be considered as low quality forage. Berseem clover regrowth after oat grain harvest produced an average 1.2 tons/acre of forage, which could have been harvested for hay or left in the field as green manure. During this trial, berseem clover regrowth was left as groundcover and green manure, which contributed an average of 39 lb N/acre to the succeeding corn crop. Corn grain yields following berseem clover were 10% higher over the trial period. Soybean grain yields were the same for both treatments. Intercropping berseem clover with oat returned an average of $39/acre more than sole-crop oat. This study demonstrated both economic and biological advantages for more diverse cropping practices.

AB The report on 'Europe's Environment', published in 1995 by the European Environment Agency, presents clear information on (a) the state of the environment, (b) pressures stressing it, and (c) the human activities behind these issues. It sets the style for improved presentation of environmental management issues through the use of environmental indicators. This will help the UK environmental manager to target policy and/or management response, and to view their issues whether at local, regional or national level - within a wider European and thereby global context. Key environmental problems for Europe are transport, land degradation, diffuse pollution of water, loss of natural habitats, waste production, and a range of local pressures - such as poor air quality - caused by conurbations. Future environmental management must be capable of integrated multi-media application, and should be applied at the most appropriate level, drawing on a range of approaches from 'top down' regulation through to a 'bottom up' commitment by individuals.

AB During the next fifteen years, the recycling of sewage sludge to agricultural land will increase significantly in Scotland as a result of EC regulations. This paper describes how soils and related environmental data around Edinburgh can be interrogated and interpreted to assess (a) the suitability of land for sludge utilization, (b) the risk of water pollution in relation to different soil conditions, (c) the ability of soils to adsorb potentially toxic elements in the sludge to prevent transfer to water or plants, and (d) the operational security and environmental sustainability of sludge recycling. The interpretations can make a valuable contribution to the appraisal of sludge disposal policy and implementation, and provide a framework for technology transfer between engineering, environmental and agricultural interests.

If benefits were noted, 5 to 10 additional daily sessions were performed. Complete success was defined as improvement in all parameters of interest, including decrease in the frequency of daily bowel movements, increased sensation, increased ability to hold stool and a significant subjective change in bowel habits. Moderate success implied improvement in 1 to 3 parameters and treatment failure was defined as lack of improvement in any parameter.
   Results: A total of 55 children 2 to 14 years old (mean age 6.7) completed a mean of 18 daily sessions per patient of bowel electrostimulation. Followup ranged from 1 to 6 years. Diapers are no longer required due to defecation problems in 14 children older than 3 years. Complete success was achieved in 20 cases (36.3%) and moderate success in an additional 30 (54.5%, overall success rate 90.8%). Specifically, 89% of the patients reported elimination of stooling accidents, 82% reported increased sensation and 71% were able to hold the bowel movement. Overall 68% of the patients noticed significantly improved bowel function. Complete/moderate success of transrectal electrostimulation was statistically significant for all 4 parameters (p <0.05), and complete success was significant for increased sensation, ability to hold and episodes of accidents. Therapy failed in 5 children (9%). There were no untoward effects.
   Conclusions: Transrectal electrostimulation is a well tolerated and minimally invasive modality that provides sustainable improvement in stool continence in children with myelomeningocele and neuropathic bowel dysfunction.

ID SUSPENSION
AB The potential for energy regeneration in vibration control systems is investigated. Such control systems hold the possibility of self-sustainability by alternately extracting and releasing energy originating from the vibrating system in a controlled non-passive manner. To be self-sustaining, more energy must on average flow into the control system than flows out. Generally speaking, the performance of such a system will approach that of an active system while theoretically requiring no externally supplied power. As research progresses in this area, an increasing number of viable applications for regenerative vibration control systems are being uncovered. This paper examines two broad applications: base-excited suspensions and periodically excited compound mounts. Some experimental results of the former are presented to support our claims.

AB Wolverine (Gulo gulo) predation on sheep (Ovis aces) on summer range in mountain areas has been documented in Norway during the last 15 years. Norweigan government policy is to sustain viable wolverine populations. However, the conflict created by wolverine predation on sheep and domestic reindeer results in strong local pressure for licenses to kill wolverines, and results as well in illegal killing. Illegal killing poses a threat to sustainable management of this protected species. Because sheep are present only in the alpine ecosystem during the short summer period, wolverine populations probably are not dependent on sheep predation. The aim of our study was to find nonlethal taste and olfactory agents that have an aversive effect on wolverines. We showed that certain chemicals and oils are potential aversive agents for captive wolverines by adding small amounts of chemicals to die normal diet, and by observing their reaction both directly and through video analysis. Five oils and 3 chemicals in combination Sate distinctive aversive reactions and were considered a good choice for tests in the field with wild wolverines. Development of dispensers is necessary for using the chemicals as long-lasting repellents on sheep. Volatile repellents attached to lambs are a potential method for decreasing wolverine predation on sheep.

AB Although unprecedented economic development in the Chinese societies of East Asia has raised global-concerns about the natural environment, little is known about consumer or corporate environmentalism in Greater China. A research initiative employing multiple methods recently examined sustainable development issues in Hong Kong and China. An ethnographic study which incorporated data from a longitudinal survey of espoused attitudes and consumer behaviour is reported here. This study extended previous efforts to benchmark Hong Kong against the USA and found support for a convergence theory of environmentalism. Green marketing opportunities, are elaborated by framing the empirical findings in the context of Chinese cultural values and institutional factors. The roles of state intervention, market forces, Confucian and Taoist ethics, ISO 14000 certification, biomimetic process innovations and environmental technology transfer are considered in terms of nurturing green business in Greater China.

AB Fisheries for assemblages of interacting species with seasonal recruitment occur throughout temperate and boreal regions of the world ocean. Such systems are conveniently modeled within a difference-equation framework. Here, we examine the dynamic behavior of discrete-time models for an exploited predator-prey system. We contrast the dynamic properties of an aggregate production model and an age-structured model in which recruitment and mortality are explicitly considered. The joint effects of harvesting and interspecific interactions on the stability of the system are defined and contrasted with results for single species systems. We demonstrate that harvesting is a potentially stabilizing factor in the production model and in an age-structured model in which juveniles are harvested and that the relative magnitude of the interaction between predator and prey strongly affects the exploitation levels at which stabilization occurs. In contrast, harvesting is potentially destabilizing (i.e., results in complex dynamics) in an age-structured model with harvesting of adults only; again, the magnitude of the interaction determines the stability boundaries, with stronger interactions leading to a broader range of stable parameter space. In both the aggregate production model and the age-structured model with harvesting of juvenile predator and prey, exploitation effectively reduces the intrinsic rate of increase of the populations; for prey, this effect is amplified by high predation mortality rates. Sustainable levels of exploitation for both predators and prey are lower for the case where juveniles are harvested. Predators and resource harvesters can be viewed as competitors for the prey, and sustainable harvest levels are directly affected by the magnitude of predation mortality. These considerations expand the scope of issues to be resolved in fishery management to include factors such as trade-offs between mean yield and the potential for intrinsic variability and the role of predator-prey interactions in shaping the dynamics of exploited systems.

AB The temporal and geographical roles of meltwater discharge (from the Laurentide ice sheet) on North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) production are investigated utilizing a global, realistic geometry, coupled climate model which does not require the use of flux adjustments. Model results suggest that preconditioning by meltwater discharge (to the Mississippi) prior to the Younger Dryas (YD) is capable of pushing NADW beyond the limit of its sustainability. The diversion of meltwater to the St. Lawrence then merely serves to completely inhibit NADW production. The modeled change in surface air temperature generally agrees with the global pattern and magnitude of temperature change seen in paleoclimatic reconstructions of the YD and is intimately linked to changes in NADW formation. The global thermohaline circulation provides an interhemispheric teleconnection with the Southern Oceans, while changes in the atmospheric heat transport (reacting to a global redistribution of oceanic heat transport) provide a mechanism for interbasin teleconnection. Although the primary thermodynamic and hydrological cycle feedback processes are included within the atmospheric model, in the absence of additional feedbacks an equilibrium without the presence of NADW is possible. The inclusion of the wind stress/speed feedback is found to significantly contribute to the resumption of NADW production, as suggested by previous studies. Contrary to these same studies, however, the coupled model indicates an advective spin-up timescale is required for resumption of NADW production and hence the termination of the modeled YD-like climate event (as opposed to a decadal-century timescale). The reason for the discrepancy is unclear but may be associated with the use of fixed salt flux fields applied in previous studies, or the duration, strength, and geographical location of the imposed meltwater applied.

AB A study was conducted to determine the effects of water stress resulting from competing vegetation on disease development of Sphaeropsis sapinea in red pine plantations. A 9-year-old plantation was selected in 1992 and experiments were conducted for three consecutive years. Four treatments were assigned at random to individual trees: no treatment, herbicide to kill surrounding weeds, supplemental water, and both herbicide and supplemental water. Two isolates of each S. sapinea morphotype (A and B) were used to inoculate wounded lateral shoots. Disease development was measured as the maximum distance below the inoculation site at which necrotic needles were observed. Nonwatered trees with competing vegetation (nontreated condition) had significantly lower predawn needle water potentials (more water stress) and more severe disease development than trees that received the herbicide, water, or combined herbicide and water treatments. The most severe disease occurred in the driest year and the least in the wettest year. Competing vegetation indirectly affected disease development by inducing water stress, even in relatively moist years, on trees previously considered well established. Isolates of morphotype A were more aggressive than isolates of morphotype B. Conclusions from this research have implications for sustainable management of the region's conifer forests.

CY JUL 22-26, 1996

ID AGRICULTURE; SUSTAINABILITY
AB Food has become marginalized from discussions of agriculture and rural development, due partly to a division of labour within the discipline which treats agriculture as part of the sociology of work and production, and partly to the acceptance by rural sociologists and policy makers that the task of farmers in the contemporary developed world is less to produce food than to produce the countryside. Using ideas from the organic farming movement in Ireland, the paper argues that food is still a highly significant issue for both consumption and development, and needs to be conceptualized in rural sociology in more holistic ways. It also suggests that if food is not treated as central to the rural environment, organic farming will tend to be assimilated into environmental conservationism and its critique of conventional productivist forms of agriculture undermined.

TI Power, interests and the extension of sustainable agriculture
SO SOCIOLOGIA RURALIS
LA English
DT Article
ID SCIENCE; AUSTRALIA; ADOPTION; FARM
AB Extension theory has moved towards conceptualizations which illuminate the power relationships inherent in extension practice. Consideration of power relationships raises questions about the interests of the parties involved and problems inherent in their conceptualization. Extension theory has not yet tackled these problems, leaving the 'farmer first' and 'beyond farmer first' approaches as well as earlier top-down models inadequate. This paper discusses the relationship between concepts of power and interests before raising some problems implied by interests. While interests are seen as essentially contestable and their assessment. is seen as cultural construction, their analysis can be based on a pragmatic approach to human needs. A model which sees extension as a power relationship steers it towards outcomes which emphasize the enactment of power relations rather than behavioural objectives. The objective for extension becomes creation of a pluralistic arena in which the assessment of interests of all parties is challengeable and is challenged by all others.

AB The interaction between transferred-electron effect and base widening under transient conditions in III-V heterojunction bipolar transistors is considered. Modification of the collector field profile with an n(+) doping spike is shown to cause a time delay for the onset of Kirk effect creating conditions for the inception of charge instabilities. Numerical simulations suggest the possibility of sustainable intrinsic current oscillations in properly engineered bipolar transistor structures. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

ID ABROAD
AB We developed an interdisciplinary field course in Costa Rica focused on sustainable development. Taught by three primary professors and augmented by various on-site discussants, the semester-long curriculum integrated sociology and political economy with agricultural ecology. Our guiding philosophy dictated that the curriculum be empirically based, involve working collaboratively, and utilize multidisciplinary investigation. Faculty members and students worked together in a number of sites throughout the country to investigate the human and environmental problems of sustainability. Students were open to interdisciplinary approaches and cooperated to produce scientific field reports. Although teaching an integrated field course abroad is challenging for faculty members and students alike, we conclude that this approach is an excellent way to teach about sustainability. This report adds to the literature on teaching and learning abroad by also considering interdisciplinary collaboration and the formation of a learning community.

TI Public transport regulation through a government organized NGO: The
   Faisalabad experience in Pakistan
SO TRANSPORT REVIEWS
LA English
DT Article
AB In Pakistan, public transport services in urban areas are suffering from poor quality and undue regulation. In order to alleviate the situation in Faisalabad, government officials founded a welfare organization which has assumed responsibility of public transport regulation. It is registered with the Social Welfare Department as the Faisalabad Urban Transport Society (FUTS), which organizes stage carriage services with the active participation of private minibus operators. This paper describes a unique experience of public transport operation under the new form of regulation and control. It provides an account of the organizational structure, objectives and operational characteristics of the society, and various aspects of planning and regulation are evaluated, with their impact on the performance and quality of services offered by the FUTS. It is concluded that the FUTS services are a measurable success, providing substantial improvements and commanding wide acceptance both by passengers and by the private operators participating in the scheme. The key factors involved in this success are realistic fares, the involvement of private operators in decision making, freedom from the constraint of government bureaucracy, and strict enforcement of service standards. Further investigation is needed into the sustainability and replicability of this regulatory model.

AB The objective of this study was to establish critical limits and functional relationships for soil properties and yield of various crops on Oxisols, Ultisols, and Alfisols of the tropics. Relationships between relative yield and so,, acidity, available P, exchangeable K, bulk density, and rooting depth were developed using published data of several experiments on liming and deep liming, fertilizer rates, traffic-induced compaction, and desurfacing. The results showed that critical limits of soil properties for maize (Zea mays L.) were 1.08% for soil organic C, 5.0 for pH, 23.5% for Al-saturation, 7.6 mg kg(-1) for P (Bray-1), 0.83 mmol (K+) kg(-1) for exchangeable K, 1.50 Mg m(-3) for bulk density, and 23 cm for rooting depth. Grain legumes [cowpea (Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp.), soya bean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.), and groundnut (Arachis hypogaea L.)] had similar critical limits, except higher P requirements. Cassava was less sensitive to acid soils than grain crops. The functional relationships developed can serve as a guideline for assessing soil degradation and determining response trends to inputs.

TI Sustainable urban transport systems: An expert-based strategic scenario
   approach
SO URBAN STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
AB Current trends in transport indicate that the system is moving away from sustainability and that major changes are necessary to make the transport system more compatible with environmental sustainability. Main problems may occur in urban transport, where not many promising solutions are expected, while the problems are severe. In view of the great number of uncertainties, we will in our paper resort to the use of scenarios. We will address in particular expert scenarios, concerned with a sustainable transport system, by applying the recently developed spider model. Based on a set of distinct characteristics, represented in eight axes in the spatial, institutional, economic and social-psychological field, an evaluation framework is constructed which visualises the driving forces that largely influence the future of the urban transport system. Next, expected and desired scenarios are constructed on the basis of information obtained from a survey among Dutch transport experts (both average scenarios and scenarios reflecting segments of respondents). The expected scenarios show that many current trends will continue, while the transport system is largely the same as the current one. The desired scenarios on the other hand, suggest the emergence and the need for a more collective system, in which also many new modes are operating. In the paper the resulting urban transport systems are also discussed. By calculating the CO2 emissions in the average expected and desired scenario, we can test the fulfilment of environmental quality norms. It appears that the expected scenario does not lead to a significant reduction of those emissions; the desired scenario however, may lead to a large scale reduction of the emissions. The conclusion is that the differences in expert opinion are small and that a sustainable (urban) transport system is still far away in the future, although the compact city concept may perhaps offer a promising perspective.

TI The populist road to market reform - Policy and electoral coalitions in
   Mexico and Argentina
SO WORLD POLITICS
LA English
DT Article
AB Governing parties face two fundamental casks: they must pursue policies effectively and they must win elections. Their national coalitions, therefore, generally include two types of constituencies those that are important for policy-making and those that make it possible to win elections. In effect, governing parties must bring together a policy coalition and an electoral coalition. This distinction sheds light on how the transitional costs of major economic policy shifts can be made sustainable in electoral terms. It also provides a starting point for analysis of how two of Latin America's most important labor-based parties, the Peronist party in Argentina and the Partido Revolucionario Institucional (PRI) in Mexico, maintained electoral dominance while pursuing free-market reforms that adversely affected key social constituencies. Peronism and the PRI are conceived of as having encompassed historically two distinctive and regionally based subcoalitions: a metropolitan coalition that gave support to the parties' development strategies and a peripheral coalition that carried the burden of generating electoral majorities. This framework permits a reconceptualization of the historic coalitional dynamics of Peronism and the PRI and sheds light on the current process of coalitional change and economic reform.

AB Previously, we reported the development of two fibroblastic cell lines (MDV OU2.1 and OU2.2) infected with Marek's disease virus (MDV). The two cell lines, in nonconfluent continuous cultures, displayed characteristics consistent with MDV existing in a latent slate. However, presence of distinct plaques in confluent cell monolayers and the ability to transfer cytolytic infection to susceptible birds and primary chick embryo fibroblasts, suggest that, if latent, the virus is easily reactivated from MDV OU2 cell lines. In this report, we present evidence which supports the hypothesis that MDV genomes in MDV OU2 cells are latent. PCR analyses and in vivo experiments demonstrate that CHCC-OU2 cells stabilize MDV so that serial in vitro passage does not attenuate the virus. Following two years of active culture, MDV genomes in MDV OU2 cells are still oncogenic, similar to that seen in MDV-lymphoblastoid cell lines. Expansion of the 132-bp repeat within MDV BamHI fragments H and D, typical of highly passaged serotype 1 MDV, has not been observed beyond two copies in MDV OU2 cells. Indirect immunofluorescence assays clearly demonstrate that MDV OU2 cells do not express glycoproteins B and 1 when subconfluent. However, upon reaching confluence these proteins are expressed in readily delectable amounts. Using RT-PCR we demonstrate that glycoproteins E and D are highly expressed in confluent MDV OU2 cells but absent from subconfluent cells, and MDV latency-associated transcripts (LATs), which are antisense to ICP4 transcripts and have been associated with latent MDV infection, are expressed in subconfluent MDV OU2 cells. Coincident with an increase in ICP4 expression, MDV LAT expression is down regulated when MDV OU2 cells become confluent. (C) 1997 Academic Press.

AB A major problem in defining the chronology of geomagnetic reversals is linked to the detection of short (<30 kyr) time intervals between reversals (TIBR). Published polarity timescales do not usually include the shortest TIBR; therefore the timescales are inherently incomplete. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the effects of this incompleteness on the analysis of the geomagnetic polarity timescale; the ultimate goal is to provide constraints on the Earth's core processes. The effects of inclusion/exclusion of the shortest TIBR are verified by comparing the results obtained by statistical analysis of real and synthetic series of events; for the real sequence, two basic cases are considered in which the ''tiny wiggles'' are attributed either to short TIBR or to paleointensity fluctuations. Particular attention is paid to the influence of measurement errors estimated for the most recently published Cenozoic timescale. By following the minimalist philosophy of Occam's razor, which is particularly suitable for studying poorly known processes, the reliability of the simplest model, i.e., the Poisson process which is symmetric in polarity, can be checked. The results indicate the plausibility of a generalized renewal process; the only regularity is relative to the long-term trend, which is probably linked to core-mantle coupling. In detail, a uniform exponential trend in the last 80 Myr is found for the timescale; it is not presently possible to estimate the influence of the inclusion of tiny wiggles because they are well-resolved only in the last 30 Myr, a period in which both series are stationary. The sequences, with and without tiny wiggles, are symmetric in polarity, with no evidence of low-dimensional chaos and memory of past configurations. The empirical statistical distribution of the TIBR departs slightly from a theoretical exponential distribution, i.e., from a Poisson process, which can be explained by a lack of short anomalies, and/or by a generating process with wear-out properties (a more general renewal process). A real exponential distribution is sustainable only if the number of missing short TIBR in the last 30 Myr is larger than the number of tiny wiggles observed in the same period.

AB The desire of environmentally-conscious consumers and manufacturers to choose more environmentally benign products and processes has led to the development of life cycle assessment (LCA) and design for environment (DfE). In both of these areas, attention has focused initially on the development of inventories of emissions and raw materials consumption for particular products and processes. A number of methods for the comparison and evaluation of an inventory's dissimilar pollution loads and resource demands have been proposed, but no satisfactory solution has yet been identified. This paper compares the structure and properties of six different methods. The health hazard scoring (HHS) system uses the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) to weight workplace toxic effects and accident risks. The material input per service-unit (MIPS) aggregates the mass of all the material input required to produce a product or service, The Swiss eco-point (SEP) method scores pollutant loadings based on a source's contribution to an acceptable total pollution load and an environmental scarcity factor. The sustainable process index (SPI) determines the area that would be required to operate a process sustainably, based on renewable resource generation and toxic degradation; an extension of the dilution volume approach, The Society of Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry's life-cycle impact assessment (SETAC LCA) impact assessment method aggregates pollutants with similar impacts to equivalency potentials (measured in kg CO2 equivalent, kg benzene equivalent etc.) and uses decision analysis to assign weights to different adverse impacts. The environmental priority system (EPS) characterizes the environmental damage caused by equivalency potentials and expresses it in monetary terms, derived from environmental economics. Despite their use for the same purposes, the six methods differ in what they try to achieve, in the effects they consider, in the depth of analysis, in the way values influence the final score, and in use of ordinal or cardinal measures of impact. Two problem areas are identified: (1) to varying degrees, each of the methods has the potential to recommend an alternative that actually has a higher impact than other alternatives; (2) for some of the methods the data requirement is so extensive and the tolerance of imperfect data is so low that the application of the method for reasonably sophisticated products or processes would be too complicated.

AB We present the first application of a forest gap model to the study of logging techniques in Malaysian tropical Dipterocarp rain forests. The aim of this paper is to reveal the impact of different logging techniques on forest composition, sustainability and logged biomass. We performed simulations both with and without damage to trees due to harvesting. The latter simulations allowed us to deduce that an optimum logging cycle of 100 years maximizes yield. In contrast, short logging cycles of 20 years show low yields and dramatic changes in the species composition of the forest. To restore the species composition to its undisturbed state, a regeneration time of 200 years is needed. From our simulations we deduce that it is crucial to take logging damage into account in order to obtain realistic descriptions of both the yield and forest composition.

ID REGINA
AB Four cultivars of Alstroemeria have been grown for 18 months under high levels of supplementary lighting (180 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) at two air temperatures combined with two soil temperatures (four temperatures for one cultivar). Irrespective of soil temperature and for all cultivars, the production of flowering stems was higher in the treatment with an air temperature set point of 18 degrees C than in the treatment with 21 degrees C as set point. The cultivars responded differently to soil temperature. For 'King Cardinal' and 'Amanda' the production was highest at the lowest soil temperature (14 degrees C), whereas the optimal soil temperatures for 'Helios' and 'Cinderella' were 18 degrees C and 22 degrees C, respectively. At both soil temperatures the yield from 'King Cardinal' and 'Amanda' decreased in the hot summer period and in the subsequent autumn. At the highest soil temperature the production of 'King Cardinal' nearly terminated at the end of the experiment. It is concluded that the optimum air temperature for a light intensive year-round production of Alstroemeria is well below 21 degrees C. With exact knowledge about the temperature tolerance and requirements of individual cultivars, it seems possible to obtain a high and sustainable production both with and without soil cooling.

AB The main aim of this paper is to apply mathematical programming and welfare maximization theory to analyze the effect of population growth on agriculture/forest land use competition, per capita cash income and subsistence consumption from privately owned farms as a basis to determine the economic sustainability of the present farming systems in the West Usambara Mountains. Two working hypotheses are presented: (1) given present population growth trends, present farming systems are not economically sustainable; (2) population growth will cause deforestation over time due to the expansion of farmlands.
   The analysis presented in this paper indicates that the present farming systems can sustain the present population growth rate (2.1% per annum for Lukozi Village) and per capita income for a maximum duration of 25-30 years. Life expectancy in Tanzania is over 45 years (based on 1988 population census). Thus, the present farming systems cannot sustain even one human generation.
   This suggests that, for the existing farming systems to become economically sustainable, it is important to improve farming technology which could increase crop production through improvements of land productivity, and to increase income from other sources. Such a strategy will meet the increased food demand as a result of population growth as well as limiting the expansion of farmlands through forest clearing. In addition, the welfare of the farmers and rural populace could be enhanced and improved. Also, it might be relevant to expand small-scale industrial activities to increase income from off-farm activities. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

DE forestry; concessions; indigenous people; Venezuela
AB The natural forests in Venezuela, with ca. 550 000 km(2), cover more than 50 % of the land's surface. South of the Orinoco river live only 10 % of the population and is located more than 80 % of the forest cover. These forests are characterized by their richness in endemic species as well as the presence of various indigenous ethnies. The forest use is practiced on Forest Reserves and other Public Forest Lots under the modality of Concessions; these are approved and controlled, through the presentation of a Forestry Master Plan, by the Environment Ministry/Forestry Service. About 3.5 million ha are nowadays managed under Concessions. It is planned to ampliate this surface in the next years up to 11 million ha. The roundwood production of the country is mainly obtained trough forest concession management of the natural forest. Simultaneously, other industrial wood products are gained through the establishment of plantations (ca. 500 000 ha existing) with exotic species, specially of Pinus caribaea and Eucalyptus spec. Forest use is performed also by the indigenous people in form of shifting cultivation (= Conuco). Agricultural production is combined with gathering and hunting of other forest products. However, this way of land use is mostly practiced without a legal support and the need of the indigenous people over their "own" land is growing every day. The forested surface for the planned expansion of the Forest Concessions is located southly of the Orinoco, where the forest systems are very fragile and usually inhabited by indigenous people. The establishment of Gathering Reserves within the areas where indigenous people live, could solve simultaneously the problem of the land tenure as well as the sustainable use of the forests and the preservation of biodiversity.

TI Bali: Sustainable development, tourism and coastal management
SO AMBIO
LA English
DT Article
AB With its distinctive landscape and culture, and competing development pressures, Bali, Indonesia, offers a microcosm to test the concept of sustainable development. Bali is encountering significant challenges in the promotion of policies to encourage vigorous economic development, while simultaneously enhancing traditional culture and protecting the integrity of the natural environment. These dimensions of sustainable development became the source of seven criteria, developed during the Bali Sustainable Development Project (BSDP), to assess opportunities and stresses. In this paper, attention is focused on one aspect: tourism development in coastal settings. Tourism and other development pressures have led to fragmentation and degradation of coastal ecosystems, modifications to coastal erosion, deposition and regeneration processes, and inequity regarding access to coastal resources, especially for local people relative to their traditional activities. An integrated approach is recommended to protect and rehabilitate linked coastal ecosystems within the context of cultural tourism policies.

TI Managing forest fallows: Improving the economics of swidden agriculture
SO AMBIO

   MANAGEMENT; AMAZON
AB The use of improved fallows has been proposed as a management alternative to shifting cultivation in the tropics. Managed fallows are quite widespread in the Americas, producing biological and economic benefits, however, cases in which both advantages are realized are scarce. In this article we evaluate the economic viability of forest fallows managed with planted timber tree species to replenish soils and provide economically valuable timber. At a 5% real interest rate, the enriched fallow-subsistence agriculture system yields land values from USD 5000-12 000 ha(-1). The results suggest that managing forest fallows in this manner can make shifting agriculture sustainable and economically competitive. Although the experiences are site-specific, the species used have broad distribution in Latin America and we expect that the systems could be transferred to other areas with similar ecological and socioeconomic conditions.

AB The Pacific Islands, particularly the Polynesian islands, provide excellent model systems for understanding the human dimensions of global change. This is due to their uniquely microcosmic aspect. Little worlds unto themselves, islands are natural history's best shot at something approaching the controlled experiment. The human choices that have led to particular outcomes on these islands teach us that nothing is inevitable or predetermined. The more we understand how our predecessors fashioned the earth we have inherited, the better we may be able to achieve a ''sustainable'' relationship with our planet, our own Little microcosm within the cosmos.

AB For the last nine years, the Mexican federal government has followed a policy of building agreements (pacts) between the main economic groups for the sake of economic development and social stability. During 1995, under the North American Free Trade Agreement and other economic and political forces, the pact policy has been under unusual pressure. In this article, national agreements are modeled as the outcomes of political conflicts. The model generates a probabilistic forecast of the type of agreement (from sustainable pacts to paper pacts to no pact at all). A basic modeling assumption is that each group can choose between helping to bake the cake and fighting to get a larger share of it, and that the desirability of each type of agreement will be largely determined by that choice. Using the forecast, we build a decision model for choosing the best set of current gains and expectations that the government can offer to other actors.

TI Buried epistemologies: The politics of nature in (Post)colonial British
   Columbia
SO ANNALS OF THE ASSOCIATION OF AMERICAN GEOGRAPHERS
LA English
DT Article
ID OLD-GROWTH; GEOGRAPHY
AB Postcolonial theory has asserted the need to carefully consider how present-day social and cultural practices are marked by histories of colonialism. This paper explores representations of the 'rainforest' and 'nature' in British Columbia, Canada and traces a series of 'buried epistemologies' through which neocolonial relations are asserted in the region. Drawing upon recent representations of the forest proffered by the forest industry and the environmental movement, and the historical writings of a prominent nineteenth-century geologist and amateur ethnologist, the author shows how 'nature'('wilderness') has been constructed as a realm separate from 'culture.' He locates in this the possibility for contemporary practices that abstract and displace the 'forest' from its cultural surround and relocate it within the abstract spaces of the market the nation, and, in recent ecological rhetorics, the biosphere and the global community By so doing, the author contests assumptions that colonialism is only an 'ugly chapter' of Canadian history and argues instead that colonialist practices and rhetorics remain present but unthought in many of the categories, identities, and representational practices that are deployed today both in public debate and scientific management of 'natural landscapes' and 'natural resources.' Thus, amid the current popularity of notions like sustainable development, biodiversity management, ecosystem restoration, and so on-which risk abstracting natural 'systems' apart from their cultural surround-it is essential to recognize the colonial histories and neocolonial rhetorics that continue to infuse 'commonsense' categories and identities like 'nature' and 'resources.'

AB This study examines responses of the world's two largest foreign-aid donors, the U.S. and Japan, to the end of the Cold War. Using the Asia-Pacific region to assess changes in U.S. and Japanese aid policies, the analysis compares the rhetoric and discourses evident in policy documents with actual aid disbursements to the region before and after the Cold War. In the early days of the post- Cold War, the U.S. refocused aid discourse from geopolitics toward ''sustainable development'' and ''democratization,'' but these goals are now challenged by an aid-fatigued and Republican-dominated Congress. By contrast, Japanese support for aid remains strong. The declared purpose of Japanese aid has been broadened beyond their Cold War commercial orientation toward global goals. In terms of disbursements to the region, the U.S. and Japan have responded in opposite ways. While the Japanese are increasing their presence in the region, the U.S. is disengaging, and the gap between the two is increasing over time. The Japanese appear to have adopted a regional political role commensurate with their economic power.

AB Contemporary malaria control is based on the early and adequate treatment of the disease and on the application of preventive measures which have been selected to be effective, cost-effective and sustainable. The benefits and problems of malaria control between 1991 and 1995, in four widely different situations are reviewed: the revitalization of the national programme in Vietnam; control as part of disaster relief in Rwanda; Chad's initiation of a programme of cure and prevention in difficult circumstances; and malaria management as part of a reconstructed health-service infrastructure in Cambodia.
   Implementation of good malaria control appears to require a general health-service infrastructure, a capacity for epidemiology and research, and objective-oriented management of specific preventive action.

AB Energy-related CO2 emission projections of China up to 2030 are given. CO2 mitigation potential and technology options in main fields of energy conservation and energy substitution are analyzed. CO2 reduction costs of main mitigation technologies are estimated and the multi-criteria approach is used for assessment of priority technologies.
   The results of this study show (1) Given population expansion and high GDP growth, energy-related CO2 emissions will increase in China. (2) There exists a large energy conservation potential in China. (3) Adjustment of industry structure and increase of shares of products with high added value have and will play a very important role in reducing energy intensify of GDP. (4) Energy conservation and substitution of coal by natural gas, nuclear power, hydropower and renewable energy will be the key technological measures in a long-term strategy to reduce GHG emission. (5) Identification and implementation of GHG mitigation technologies is consistent with China's targets of sustainable development and environmental protection (6) Energy efficiency improvement is a ''no-regret'' option for CO2 reduction, whereas an incremental cost is needed to develop hydropower and renewable energy.

AB This paper presents a summary of the technologies and practices that could be implemented in Venezuela in order to contribute to both climate change mitigation and national development efforts. The mitigation analysis concentrates an options to reduce CO2 emissions generated from the energy sector and land-use change.
   From the mitigation options analyzed for the energy sector it was determined that the most effective are those in the transportation sector (switching to larger capacity vehicles, reduced private vehicle share, and switching fuels for public transportation from gasoline to natural gas), both in terms of contribution to emissions reduction and costs. Regarding the options for industry, boilers conversion from liquids to natural gas shows negative cost, but to a considerably lower extent that for the transportation sector. Efficiency improvements of natural gas boilers, which presents close to zero cost, is more effective in reducing emissions than boiler conversion. Increase in hydro power generation is the alternative with the highest total cost but it is very effective in reducing emissions.
   From the mitigation options analyzed for land-use change, if was established that the forest sector has a considerable potential for reducing CO2 emissions through the adoption of sustainable forest practices, especially by slowing the rate of forest loss and degradation. Maintenance of already existing biomass in natural forests should be the first priority of forest measures to reduce the amount of carbon released to the atmosphere. Forest protection and management of native forest represent the two options with the highest carbon conservation potential and the lowest carbon unit cost. Expansion of the forest cover through the development of intensive forest plantations also presents a high potential to offset carbon emissions in Venezuela.
   An analysis of the barriers to mitigation options implementation shows that in the energy sector, low energy prices represent the main barrier to any mitigation program. Another important limitation to mitigation strategies implementation is the lack of institutional capacity and legal instruments for developing the mitigation measures. In the forest sector the primary causes of forest clearing in the country are not related to forest activities, so the definition of feasible mitigation options will depend upon a good understanding of other economic sectors and how they account for land-use change. Land tenure, rural poverty, political interests, and weak implementation of land-use planning instruments and environmental laws are considered to be the key limitations to any effort dealing with forest conservation. Land tenure, economic factors, and lack of incentives represent some of the most important barriers to the development of forest plantations and agroforestry systems in the country.

AB An important commitment in the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change is to conduct mitigation analysis and to communicate climate change measures and polices. In major part reducing CO2 as well as the other greenhouse gas emissions in Kazakstan can be a side-product of measures addressed to increasing energy efficiency. Since such measures are very important for the national economy, mitigation strategies in the energy sector of Kazakstan are directly connected with the general national strategy of the energy sector development. This paper outlines the main measures and technologies in energy sector of Kazakstan which can lead to GHG emissions reduction and presents the results of current mitigation assessment.
   The mitigation analysis addressed to energy production sector. A baseline and six mitigation scenarios were developed to evaluate the most attractive mitigation options, focusing on specific technologies which have been already included in sustainable energy programs. According to the baseline projection, Kazakstan's CO2 emissions will not exceed their 1990 level until 2005. The potential for CO2 emission reduction is estimated to be about 11 % of the baseline emission level by the end of considered period (in 2020). The main mitigation options in the energy production sector in terms of mitigation potential and technical and economical feasibility include rehabilitation of thermal power plants aimed to increasing efficiency, use of nuclear energy, and further expansion in the use of hydro energy based on small hydroelectric power plants.

TI Chances for competitive initiatives
SO ATW-INTERNATIONALE ZEITSCHRIFT FUR KERNENERGIE
LA German
DT Article
AB The regulatory reforms in the energy sector require a dual-track approach: On the one hand, the markets for electricity and gas should be deregulated speedily; on the other hand, incentives are needed for environmentally sound supply structures without a new tide of regulations being created. As yet, no hard and fast solution is to be seen, but it is possible to outline the basic data for compromises which at least would be an improvement over the status quo and would open up opportunities for a sustainable optimization along the lines of a market economy.
   The plans of the German federal government to give up all monopolist exceptions in the power industry using line transmission, such as the abolition of demarcation agreements which, at present, are still permitted in competition policy, and of the exclusivity clause in license agreements, may be able to create sufficient space for intense competition to develop. However no segregation in transmission lines should have an impact on developments. This means that regulations intensifying competition should be sought both for the construction of new grid systems and for requests by third parties to run their products through transmission systems they do not own. The criteria applied to licensing new lines should be worded in such a way that local opposition will be unable to cause excessive delays which would be intolerable to the national economy.
   However, deregulation is but one side of the coin. It is a way to tap successfully, and for the long term, the potential for cost and price reductions for electricity and gas. On the other hand however also the ecological risks of energy supply must be limited further Broad-based incentives must be offered to energy supplies whose generation gives rise to less CO2, in order not to lose sight of the need to protect the climate.
   There should be no debate about the preservation of CO2-free nuclear power as an option in Germany. Moreover, the efficiency of energy conversion and energy use must be increased and, at the same time, the use of renewable energy sources must be stepped up in the long nln. The introduction of power transmission regulations by the government giving priority to ''eco-electricity'' would entail considerable need for more regulation. In that case, the desired invigoration of the competitive forces of the market would threaten to end in a spiral of interventionist measures. Likewise, the government regulations about electricity pur chases and prices under the Electricity Supply Act are far from being a perfect solution. Obviously, the government needs money for all these measures. A value added tax differentiated on ecological grounds would be a rather general tool leaving a high degree of freedom to addresses without containing any terms controlling their behavior. Bonn needs approval from Brussels for such steps. The German federal government should make it clear to the European Union that deregulation requires ecological support in conformity with the market. In addition to energy taxation coordinated EU-wide, this could include a value added tax differentiated ecologically. Even though no workable solution has as yet been found for the introduction of eco-taxes, this topic should not be lost in the tax reform in Germany.

AB Sustainable agriculture is prescribed as a policy approach that maximizes economic benefits while maintaining environmental quality. It is argued that this approach is human capital-intensive and encourages new scientific developments. To attain sustainability, economic incentives for the development and adoption of precision technologies (with minimal residues that cause environmental damage) have to be developed. Taxation and tradeable permits are desirable policies to attain first-best solutions; however, when heterogeneity and lack-of-information problems are significant, alternative institutions have to be developed. The paper presents and discusses such institutions.

TI Lawyers abroad: The internationalization of legal practice
SO CALIFORNIA MANAGEMENT REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
ID LAW
AB Since the late 1960s, a number of U.S. and British law firms have quietly, and successfully, gone global. Traipsing after their far-flung corporate clients, these law firms have slowly but steadily established their own global networks. Unlike the manufacturing firms that preceded them abroad, law firms are essentially service firms, selling the ephemeral products of information, skills, and advice. As such, they rank among the first global providers of information-based services. This article takes a first cut at analyzing and underscoring the internationalization of the legal practice. It explores how law firms have entered the international economy and flags the issues that seem most relevant to their success and sustainability. The four factors that have contributed mast directly to their success-size, reputation, ''walking assets,'' and a balance between global and local interests-are not specific to the legal profession but are equally applicable to other information-based industries.

AB Fuel utilization during aerobic exercise was determined in juvenile rainbow trout that had previously undergone 2 weeks of continuous aerobic training at 25% of their maximum sustainable speed (U-crit) and was compared with that in untrained trout. Instantaneous fuel usage was calculated from simultaneous measurements of oxygen consumption (M-O2) carbon dioxide excretion (M-CO2), and nitrogenous waste excretion (M-N). Over 58 h of sustained aerobic exercise at 55% of U-crit, M-O2 and M-CO2 remained virtually constant in the trained fish, in contrast to the significant fall over time in untrained fish, but total gas exchange was similar in the two groups. Aerobic respiratory quotient remained constant in the two treatments. M-N was lower in the trained fish, resulting in a much lower (and stable) nitrogen quotient; the nitrogen quotient increased with swimming duration in the untrained fish. Lipid was the major fuel source powering aerobic exercise in both groups. Carbohydrate also played a significant role, whereas protein was of lowest quantitative importance. Training resulted in a decrease in reliance on protein and an increase in reliance on lipid metabolism. The role of protein oxidation in supporting aerobic swimming in fish, which is smaller than commonly believed, is further reduced by training.

TI Stewardship for packaging and packaging waste: key policy elements for
   sustainability
SO CANADIAN PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION-ADMINISTRATION PUBLIQUE DU CANADA
LA English
DT Article
ID MANAGEMENT
AB Most analysts are still watching for the concrete institutional commitment and policy tools necessary to implement the conceptual shift needed to achieve sustainability. Recent stewardship policies and programs for packaging and packaging waste offer a timely example of the approaches that might be taken to reduce the impact of packaging and packaging waste and put us on a path towards sustainability. Through a comparison of the Canadian National Packaging Protocol and the European Parliament Packaging and Packaging Waste Directive and corresponding literature, approaches to the issue of packaging stewardship are explored, and the essential elements of packaging stewardship policy are established. These include take-back obligations, waste-prevention obligations, and life-cycle analysis reporting obligations. Each of these is discussed, and examples are drawn from Canadian provinces and European Union member states. As well, three policy vehicles easing the implementation of the essential elements are developed, including the transfer of take-back obligations, levy fees, and international standards for life-cycle assessment. Direction is presented regarding the future development of packaging stewardship policy in Canada. In particular, Canada's policies must evolve to create a contractual obligation for firms to meet quantified targets for reducing waste from packaging. A specific obligation for take-back and valorization of packaging waste, as well as an obligation to reduce packaging, would greatly improve Canada's packaging-stewardship policies.

AB Engineering needs a reorientation towards the real needs of society i.e. the benefit for mankind and the profit for industries at the same time, where the viability of nature with its recreative cycles is to be maintained. Engineering is more and more focusing on the whole system Earth, including the cycles in nature, which represent the carrying capacity. Thus, it is of importance to focus e.g. on water, soil and biodiversity itself with the chance and danger given with genetic engineering.

DT Article
DE ATM; shaping multiplexer; QoS; departure event driven traffic shaping;
   architecture
AB In order to utilize network resources effectively while providing satisfactory quality of service (QoS) to all users on the ATM network, it is necessary to control users' traffic at the network edges. ATM traffic may be controlled at the User-Network Interface (UNI) and Inter-Network Interface (INI) based on the traffic contracts. We propose an ATM shaping multiplexer along with its implementation architecture for all ATM traffic connections multiplexed in an output stream. These connections are to be strictly regulated by the so-called Generic Cell Rate Algorithm (GCRA). When ATM streams conforming to the GCRA are multiplexed together, contention can disturb the streams such that they are no longer in conformance. Thus, a departure event driven traffic shaping (DEDTS) algorithm is adopted to shape the cell streams in such a way that the outgoing ATM stream of each individual connection conforms to the ATM traffic descriptors, Peak Cell Rate (PCR), Sustainable Cell Rate (SCR), Cell Delay Variation Tolerance (CDVT), and Burst Tolerance (BT) declared in the traffic contract. A proposed architecture can be implemented to support up to thousands of virtual connections using off the shelf components.

DT Article
AB We look at how Vanuatu's forests have been used or ''managed'' over time. Traditional lore concerning resource use continues to meaningfully affect contemporary patterns of forest use, including the most dramatic use to date, large-scale logging. Aspects of traditional practices were generally sustainable, but current large-scale logging activities cannot be considered sustainable on social, ecological, or even timber-yield grounds. In light of this, several options and considerations for future sustainable forest management are presented, but the role of customary resource owners, and their traditional lore, is of primary importance in all of them.

AB The scattered nature of Solomon Island villages, the people's low literacy rate, and the country's many languages make it difficult to share development and environment messages effectively. Solomon Islands Development Trust has had a fourteen-year track record of reaching out to the village sector through its fifty mobile teams as well as its media arm, theater team, and departments focusing on sustainable forestry practices. It has become a major actor in combating destructive logging practices. The Pavuvu controversy focused national attention on the destructive practices of an overseas logging company, the government's dire need to gain revenue through logging, and the public stance of nongovernment organizations against the logging companies and the government. The Pavuvu controversy clarified for many that the logging issue was not simply about logging versus not logging, but more about the kind of government the country was experiencing.

TI Boundary conditions for the sustainable use of major fish stocks in the
   Baltic Sea
SO ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
LA English
DT Article
AB The history of the management of Baltic fishery resources suggests that both biological and non-biological factors influence management decisions and that both types of information are essential for management which promotes sustainability. There is a direct link between the exploitation level and the risks for fishing as an economic activity due to fluctuations in the resource. This paper analyses the sustainability of the present catch levels of major Baltic fish stocks. By examining the rate of fishing mortality and recruitment variability, the possibility of sustaining present catch levels can be investigated. Current catch levels of Baltic cod and some salmon stocks are not sustainable whereas sprat and herring catches are. High rates of fishing mortality of cod and salmon may endanger stocks if a drop in the recruitment causes an increase of the fishing mortality rates in order to sustain short-term catches. By analysing the trade off between exploitation level and risk of stock decline, managers can obtain a basis for quota negotiations.

AB Throughout its history, America has viewed its oceans as vast fishery frontiers. These frontiers are suffering depletion as large amounts of fishing power combined with significant oceanographic changes are straining the limits of sustainability. The new ocean frontier is not the promise of undeveloped resources, but rather the challenge of undeveloped sustainable governance systems. This paper discusses the institutional transformation necessary to achieve sustainable governance. The first part provides an historical overview of the American use of resources as frontiers. The second part characterizes the frontier as an extreme form of resource use, contrasting it to its opposite ideal, the commons. The third part outlines behavioral differences between the users of frontiers and commons, the pioneers and shareholders. Building on the attributes of resource management under the two ideals, the fourth part of the discussion focuses on the necessary conditions and major challenges to developing the institutional capital required for sustainable US fishery management, The institutional capital needed for sustainable fisheries governance is comprised of several pieces: (1) A perception of the fishery as an integrated ecosystem; (2) an identification of shareholders; (3) an allocation of decision making power and responsibility which vests all interests and internalizes the source of control; (4) incentive structures to promote long-term management; (5) management skills among fishery interests; (6) management processes that promote adaptability to change. The final section provides conclusions and an assessment of the progress US fishery management has made in institutional capital development. Pressures of scarcity are forcing US fisheries management to evolve away from the frontier ideal, but the development of the institutional capital necessary for sustainable fishery governance is incomplete.

ID INVESTMENT
AB A political economy of degradation and of sustainability should account not only for the full range of production costs but the sources of those costs. It should consider how the pursuit of wealth can, deliberately or not, lead to uncounted costs and unaccountable actors. This article explores the conditions of cost generation and externalization, especially those that are largely unintended and inadvertent. It shows how the pursuit of wealth, the expansion of markets, the mobility of capital, and the entanglements of production processes can lead to the unwitting generation and displacement of costs. It analyzes competitive business strategy and patterns of production and consumption for their contribution to such costs. Business strategy and state policy tend to create a never-ending search for frontiers, however simulated and however unecological they may be. The costs generated in those frontiers are a function of shading, that is, obscuring of costs, and distancing, the separation of production and consumption decisions, both of which impede ecological and social feedback and create cognitive, institutional, and ethical lags between initial benefits and eventual full costs. As distance increases along dimensions of geography, culture, bargaining power, or agency, negative feedback loops are severed, stakeholders expand while decision making contracts, environmental problems are displaced, and shading and cost externalization increase. The likelihood of sustainable resource use increases as distance is lowered, as institutions locate decision authority in those who receive negative ecological feedback and who have the capacity and incentives to act on that feedback, and as the burden of proof for economic interventions shifts to the interveners.

AB It has been suggested that the relationship between income and the associated environmental pressure in terms of derived materials inputs and pollution levels may take an inverted-U shape, indicating a 'delinking' of environmental pressure from economic growth in relation to rising per capita incomes. The likelihood of such a relationship being persistent is discussed in the context of a simple macro model of industrial metabolism, and the possibility of 'relinking' clearly emerges. Data on specific indicators of environmental pressure (i.e., the throughput of materials, energy and the volume of transport) in 19 countries have been used to investigate patterns of delinking. The results suggest that delinking may not be persistent; already some advanced economies may be entering a new period of relinking, The relationships between environmental pressure and welfare in the medium long term may be N-shaped rather than inverred-U-shaped.

AB There is a growing awareness among all countries and their decision makers, regardless of economic and industrial development, that the environment must be protected, leading towards a sustainable future. This is especially important in the energy sector-which is the principal factor in economic and industrial development-since the primary energy sources of today, fossil fuels, are the main culprits of global environmental problems, such as the greenhouse effect, ozone layer depletion, acid rains and pollution. Industrial countries, being greater consumers of fossil fuels, are affected to a greater extent by their environmental harms. Consequently, these countries are leading the way in environmental protection measures.
   The European Union, the second largest industrial grouping in the world, has become one of the leaders in taking important measures in the energy sector to curb the harmful emissions over the years. Spain, a member of the European Union, has initiated planning to reduce the pollutants produced by the energy sources and bring them in line with the European Union efforts, while keeping up the country's economic development. This paper reports the efforts and planning of Spain through the year 2010 to comply with the European Union environmental regulations on one hand and to sustain economic development on the other.

AB It is often argued that policies designed to protect the environment may harm economic growth. Moreover, if introduced unilaterally by a given country, they may reduce the competitiveness of domestic firms. These arguments are generally based on the assumption that environmental protection has to be achieved through the introduction of emission charges (e.g. a carbon tax). However, three issues need to be raised: first, the tax is not the only policy instrument-and is not the most efficient one-that can be used to reduce polluting emissions; secondly, even when a tax policy is implemented, it is important to assess the feedback effects induced by recycling the tax revenue; thirdly, and most importantly, the role of technical progress cannot be neglected. Therefore, there may exist a policy mix that provides firms with the correct incentives to adopt energy-saving technologies and to invest in environment-friendly R & D. The first two issues have partly been explored both in the theoretical and empirical literature. The third issue, i.e. the role of incentives to technical progress, still lacks adequate quantitative assessment. This is why a new model has been developed which endogenizes technical progress and its effects and feedbacks on economic, energy and environmental variables. Using WARM, an econometric general equilibrium model for the European Union and for each member country, this paper presents simulation results up to 2015 of the effects of some industrial-environmental policies which are aimed at protecting the environment without necessarily damaging competitiveness and economic growth. The results show that policies that stimulate environmental R & D, technological innovation and diffusion may provide firms with the correct incentives to avoid damaging the environment, while preserving their competitiveness in the market. Moreover, such a policy, based both on R & D subsidies and on innovation incentives, may not worsen the public-sector budget balance, as a result of the positive effects on economic growth.

TI Energy efficiency vs economic efficiency? New Zealand electricity sector
   reform in the context of the national energy policy objective
SO ENERGY POLICY
LA English
DT Article
ID UNITED-STATES; MARKETS
AB In this article, I review the diverse commentaries on New Zealand's ongoing electricity sector reform process, within the context of the Government's energy policy objective, In doing so, my purpose is to highlight the interactions between the concepts of energy efficiency and economic efficiency, In particular, I ask: how do the various commentators on reform define these concepts; what indicators do they use to measure them; and, what level of each do they prescribe as appropriate? My main objective is not to decide whether any commentator is 'right' or 'wrong', Rather, I seek to identify the distinct 'world views', or 'paradigms', underlying the commentaries with respect to both energy efficiency and economic efficiency, I conclude that economic efficiency is consistent with a 'supply side paradigm', valuing economic growth, whereas those who value energy efficiency over economic efficiency subscribe to a 'demand side paradigm', recognising the limits to growth, Such a paradigm derives from the ethic of sustainability, I dose by posing the (as Set unanswered) question: are these paradigms mutually exclusive?

AB Arrested succession is conspicuous in the abandoned pastures of the Andean piedmont that have encroached upon the tropical montane forests toward higher limits and steeper slopes. Habitat 'shredding' is analysed to depict the current spatial configuration of tropical Andean landscapes, based on fragmentation patterns prompted by seed dispersal ecology and pasture encroachment.
   Seed dispersal was studied to address the hypothesis that seed input constrains the recruitment of montane forest seedlings, thus impeding pasture conversion to forest. It turns out that a better competitor, the tussock grass Setaria sphacelata, is limiting dispersal success due to its bioarchitecture and planting patterns. Because of the variegation of fragments, the area is in danger of landscape homogeneity within a matrix of degraded pasture. Currently, protection of fragmented remnants and restoration of original landscape structure and function are urgent needs for land-use planning toward sustainable development in the region.
   Restoration ecology is plausible as a means of conservation for degraded Tropandean forests, since human impacts have shredded landscapes entirely. Dispersal ecology may be used to facilitate pasture conversion to forest in equatorial landscapes, but the proactive approach of pasture removal or planting strategy should differ from that for lowland Amazonia, where abandoned pastures are different from those of montane environs. However, the region may be preactively managed only if political decisions include conservation as a goal of development.

AB Conservation projects around the world have been impeded by conflicting land uses. In Greece, although agriculture is considered to have significant impacts on wetlands and adversely to have affected conservation, the attitudes of Greek farmers to wetlands and conservation have not been assessed. Data on demographic variables of farm operators, characteristics of the farming operation, irrigation practices, attitudes towards environment and the wetland resources, knowledge on the impact of agriculture on the local environment and opinions on the Common Agricultural Policy reform, were collected through a survey using personal interviews from a random sample of 196 farmers operating in two wetlands, Lakes Mikri Prespa and Kerkini (Ramsar sites), and 141 farmers operating in a plain, in Macedonia, northern Greece.
   Analysis of the data revealed that farmers practise crop and stock agriculture more intensively in wetlands than in the plain, and exploit wetland resources excessively. Hunting, fishing and wood harvesting are practised, and lake water is used intensively for irrigation by both groups of farmers, with no care for loss of the resources. Alternative methods of irrigation for improving efficiency of water use or alleviating hydrological pressures on the wetlands are not considered. Sustainability of agriculture is at risk as present practices result in impoverished soils, salinization of the fields and waste of water resources. Wetland farmers seemed to have a more negative attitude toward the wetland resources and seemed to be more ignorant of conservation issues or the impact of their practices on the environment than plain farmers. Moreover, their awareness and willingness to adopt an environmentally-friendly type of farming was very low.

AB The search for sustainable development provides the impetus for examining the role of indigenous institutions and their ecological knowledge in environmental assessment and local sustainability. This paper attempts to trace the evolution of environmental assessment in Ghana. Focusing on the Ashanti Region, the paper further discusses the nature and operations of indigenous institutions, their ecological knowledge, beliefs, practices, and social norms that are relevant to environmental assessment process in the country. Some of the challenges that emerge from the discussions are highlighted. There is a need to establish environmental assessment and cooperative management boards that would include representatives of indigenous institutions, in addition, the introduction of technical dictionaries and training manuals based on indigenous ecological knowledge and their humane environmental practices will further improve the environmental assessment process in Ghana.

AB Currently there is considerable interest in using elemental iron (Fe-0) for treatment of highly chlorinated organic compounds. Early studies found little microbiological contribution to degradation in laboratory and field tests. Most wort, since then has focused on abiotic processes. In studies conducted with a mixed, methanogenic culture, however, pseudo-first-order rate coefficients for chloroform degradation were at least 3.6 times greater in serum bottle incubations containing 40 mesh iron filings and live cells as compared to incubations containing Fe-0 and killed cells, Fe-0 and cell-free mineral medium, or Fe-0-free incubations with live cells. CF cometabolism and methanogenesis was apparently supported using cathodic hydrogen produced by anaerobic corrosion of the added Fe-0. The use of selective microbial inhibitors showed that H-2-consuming methanogens and not homoacetogens were responsible For CF degradation. The sustainability of the process was established in a 60-day column study using steel wool as support for microbial growth. The observation that cathodically produced H-2 can support reductive dechlorination by anaerobic bacteria may have significant practical implications.

AB Our ultimate resources come from the Sun and the Earth system. At this time we face a world crisis in energy, water and soil resources. Global pollution problems are increasing in almost all nations and our climate is changing. There is an urgent need to use our vast knowledge with a new wisdom and this requires new integrated teams of experts to provide the best alternatives for the needed new development problems. These teams must include economists, engineers and a broad spectrum of scientists. Today it is possible to produce clean energy, stop soil erosion, clean water and reduce and use wastes of many types. There is a great need to improve natural science education at all levels. All people must know how our planet works and that fluctuations, some inevitable, some controllable, will occur and that we must prepare for them. And it is clear that protecting the environment, eliminating pollution, preserving biodiversity is good economics. Ecology-Economy cannot be separated.

   situation and future trends
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PLANT PATHOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
DE population growth; food supply; productivity; crop losses; no control
   scenario; no loss scenario
AB Actual and potential crop losses of eight major food and cash crops have been estimated by evaluating data from literature and field experiments. Total losses were calculated from yield reductions due to pathogens, animal pests and weeds on a regional, continental and global level. Since 1965, worldwide production of most crops has increased considerably. Simultaneously, crop losses in wheat, potatoes, barley and rice increased by 4 to 10 percent, in maize, soybean, cotton and coffee losses remained unchanged or slightly decreased. The efficacy of crop protection practices was calculated as the percentage of potential losses prevented by control. The efficacy is highest in cotton (55 percent), it reaches only 34 to 38 percent in the food crops rice, wheat and maize. The variability among cropping areas is high: In Western Europe, 61 percent of potential crop losses is prevented, in North America and Oceania 44, in all other regions 38 percent. Due to the small share of Western Europe in worldwide production of 8 percent, the efficacy of actual crop protection worldwide is only 40 percent.
   In view of population growth and rising food demand crop production has to be increased substantially. As potential loss rates often increase with attainable yields high productivity largely depends on effective crop protection management. Scenarios for the production of food crops by the year 2025 in developed and in developing countries are given. Recent and future developments in crop protection can contribute to establish sustainability in agriculture and to preserve natural resources. However, although effective control methods have been developed for most biotic yield constraints, the use of crop protection products is regulated by economic considerations rather than by food demand.

SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PLANT PATHOLOGY

DT Article
DE interactive multiple goal linear programming; farming systems; nutrient
   management; crop protection; farm economics; learning processes
AB Current production systems for flower bulbs in the Netherlands employ considerable quantities of pesticides and nutrients per unit area. In 1993, an association of growers and environmentalists set out to design new farming systems that meet environmental objectives in addition to economic objectives. To support the design process, an explorative study was carried out to bring together the fragmented agronomic information and to assess agrotechnical options for sustainable flower bulb production with a time horizon of 10 to 15 years. Crop and inter-crop management systems representing the agro-technical components of sustainability at the farm level, were generated with a computer model by systematically varying four system characteristics, three of which represented strategic and tactical aspects of crop protection. Subjective components, one economic and two environmental objectives and various socio-economic constraints, were identified in interaction with the stakeholders. Interactive multiple goal linear programming was used to optimize the objectives at the farm level and determine the exchange value of the economic objective in terms of the environmental objectives. Calculations were carried out for two reference farm types. The results revealed that the negative impact of environment-oriented production systems on farm gross margin is importantly mitigated by strategic choices at the farm level, such as renting land and allowing a soil health improving crop, even though of low gross margin, into the rotation. In contrast, the a priori attention of the growers was focused on improving tactical pest and nutrient management at the crop level, the effect of which on farm gross margin is constrained by the strategic choices. Sensitivity analyses highlighted the need for more insight into the ecology of soil-borne growth reducing factors and their effect on crop yield. The paper describes the approach used, reports results and discusses the usefulness of the approach for the stakeholders and for disciplinary crop protection research.

AB With increasing population pressure, the agricultural frontier in tropical countries is being expanded into previously untouched or little changed areas, frequently resulting in environmental degradation. At the same time, the use of agricultural lands is undergoing rapid changes in response to increasing environmental concerns and external market forces. In large areas of Central America, for example, the production systems for coffee have lost much of their biological diversity in the last couple of decades. Observations of apparently higher yields in high-input and low-diversity systems resulted in recommendations to eliminate trees. In recent years, however, as a result of low coffee prices and environmental concerns, calls to reverse this trend have been made in many countries and research and implementation initiatives are being developed to, once again, increase the diversity of the systems by incorporating trees.
   The necessary changes in the objectives and management of land-use systems must be gradual to assure high acceptability of the new practices, Under such conditions, which are typical for most traditional land-use systems, the development of practices which integrate trees into the agricultural land-use systems assumes special importance. Agroforestry practices can help to improve land-use systems towards higher sustainability and/or provide a stepping stone towards other, often tree-based, land-use systems of higher viability.
   Using examples from the research and extension experiences at CATIE, some silvopastoral and agrisilvicultural systems are discussed with their potentials and limitations. To help evaluate improved systems, promising methodologies for appropriate research and extension are outlined. New research has shifted the focus to on-farm experimentation, and economic and extension aspects of agroforestry.

DE alley cropping; nutrient cycling; productivity; sustainability
AB In the past few decades there has been growing concern about the exhaustibility of non-renewable soil resources in developing countries in the tropics to meet the needs of present and future generations. Land degradation is a major problem in many parts of the tropics, including subSaharan Africa, mainly owing to overexploitation of vegetation and soil resources and adoption of inappropiate farming methods. The challenge is to increase the sustainable agricultural productivity of the land with acceptable inputs to meet increasing human needs, while maintaining the soil resource base and minimising environmental degradation. One technology that can meet this need for rainfed upland farming with low external chemical inputs is the alley cropping system. This technology integrates trees and shrubs in spatial zonal arrangements with food crops in the production system. The presence of woody species in the alley cropping production system has been shown to contribute to (1) nutrient recycling, (2) reduction in soil nutrient leaching losses, (3) stimulation of higher soil faunal activities, (4) soil erosion control, (5) soil fertility improvement and (6) sustained levels of crop production. These experiences can be utilised in developing sustainable and environmentally friendly agroforestry systems.

AB About 90% of the annual losses of tropical rain forests are caused by transformation into arable land, Most of the cropping activities on the former forest land are characterised by low input, partly shifting cultivation practices, leading to fast degradation of the lands which are finally abandoned owing to infertility. Success in protecting land from further degradation is determined by the economic viability of the respective system. Therefore, sustainability of agricultural systems depends on their economic sustainability, Intensive plantation cropping on former rain forest land appears to offer such an incentive to prevent the land from further degradation by employing the best technology available.
   Examples of intensive oil palm cultivation as a sustainable cropping system, in terms of economy and ecology, are given, Oil palm cultivation in a suitable environment outyields most annual crops and reveals a significant potential for efficient conversion of solar energy,
   With the employment of sound agronomic measures the present production potential can be fully realised and new techniques in the production of tissue cultured planting material provide further improved economic viability and environmentally sound cropping systems, Such an intensification offers excellent prospects for reducing the rate of deforestation in the humid tropics.

AB Sustainable forest management may be considered an evolutionary step beyond sustained yield management. Although objectives related to sustainable forest management are common in Canada, policy means of achieving these objectives are rarely spelled out. Currently, forest tenure policies are dominated by concepts associated with sustained yield that may preclude the realization of sustainable forest management objectives. This paper identifies how tenure policies based on sustained yield concepts of allowable annual cuts could change in order to address a more holistic view of forests associated with sustainable forest management.

DE networks; partnerships; alliances; forest issues
AB The Canadian Forest Service has reorganized its science and technology programs to focus on establishing partnerships and networks, thereby becoming a partner to business, academic institutions, other governments and voluntary organizations to stimulate increased S&T activity. Current policy issues in the forest sector reflect the changing nature of our society and the demands on forests in particular.
   The CFS has established national networks in the following fields: Effects of Forest Practices, Landscape Management, Climate Change, Fire Management, Socio-Economic Research, Pest Management Methods, Ecosystem Processes, Tree Biotechnology and Advanced Genetics, Biodiversity, and Forest Health.
   This national network-based approach to deliver its S&T program will allow us to address national and international issues while delivering programs through regional research centres. As the Canadian forest sector competes in world markets, it will have to meet international demands for sustainable forest management.

AB The premises upon which the post-war global energy system has been built have been dramatically changed over the last ten to fifteen years. In the Light of increased scientific knowledge and public awareness about the adverse effects of power generation to man and nature, the world energy system is in a state of transition. This work aims to:
   a. highlight the current energy picture in the Mediterranean basin; b. identify the environmental concerns associated with this energy system; c. review the locally available energy resources; and, d. finally, review and assess the currently available and future energy technologies with regard to their role in fueling the sustainable development of the countries in the region.
   The above analysis is done taking into account the current trends of population and energy intensity evolution in the Mediterranean countries, attempting, thus, to provide a useful and comprehensive framework for sustainable energy policy in the region.

TI Scenario workshops: A participatory approach to sustainable urban
   living?
SO FUTURES
LA English
DT Article
AB Cities have increasingly become a focus for environmental action, and many governments are in the process of devising strategies for sustainable development in urban areas. However, dissatisfaction with traditional approaches to environmental policy making has led to the rise of interest in involving the public in the process of plan and policy formulation. This paper provides a brief review of the rationale for increasing public participation in policy making, and focuses on one attempt to do this through the use of scenario workshops. The experience of the UK town of Preston is used to look at the effectiveness of this approach both in bringing about sustainable urban living, and as a truly participatory approach to policy making.

AB This article posits that entrepreneurial behavior within an organization can only be effectively created and controlled through an appropriate corporate culture. Corporate culture is viewed as a social structure that possesses two facets that are central to entrepreneurship. The first facet is a superstructure that provides an ideology to which organizational participants can commit to. The second is a sociostructure that facilitates the emergence of social capital, which can provide a form of sustainable competitive advantage.

TI Proposal for the development of an indigenous materials and
   Methods-oriented design data aid for design professionals practising in
   developing nations
SO HABITAT INTERNATIONAL
LA English
DT Article
AB The problem of meeting increasing shelter requirements in developing nations is seen as being a complex one, Factors such as reliance of developing nations upon built-environment technologies, materials and skills imported from developed nations are considered in terms of the pressures this typically places upon the natural capital of nations suffering from low currency exchange rates with developed nations, Such pressures are seen as detracting from the implementation of sustainable development policies with regard to depletion of natural capital.
   The paper suggests that encouragement should be given to the use of indigenous materials and methods as one contributed to an, as yet, emerging strategy of sustainable development, Such encouragement can be given through the supplying of performance and location data on indigenous materials and also through the supplying of data on 'best-use' methods of utilising such materials within the built environment.
   A possible format and means of delivery is proposed for a prototype design aid, which will supply both small scale entrepreneurs and design professionals in developing nations with data relevant to the use of indigenous materials and methods. Copyright (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

TI Urban governance in relation to the operation of urban services in
   developing countries
SO HABITAT INTERNATIONAL
LA English
DT Article
AB Urbanisation has become a powerful force in developing countries and is a development which has taken place quickly and comparatively recently in Asia, Africa and Latin America. However, a review funded by the Ford Foundation, concluded that this phenomenon of urban growth has not been recognised adequately in research and policy, or in the development programmes of international assistance agencies. Certain themes can be detected in emerging research on urbanisation: the environment and sustainability; poverty; finance and the economy of cities; urban social structure; globalisation; and urban governance. The latter has been identified as crucial to the management of Third World cities and can be defined as the relationship between municipal/city authorities and citizens. The importance of governance at a city level is reflected in the conditionality of 'good governance' imposed by most donor agencies including the UK Overseas Development Administration. But what does governance mean at the city level? How is current research analysing governance? What is emerging from research on urban governance in order to identify indicators of good governance that can eventually be incorporated into a method to analyse urban governance in any Third World city? This review is descriptive, and deeper knowledge of the relationship between municipal authorities and citizens will be obtained only through in-depth observation and interviews. However, with growing discussion about urban governance this first step of clarifying definitions and dimensions of urban governance is vital. Copyright (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

   ACCEPTABILITY; IMPACT; TRIAL; AREA
AB Through a Benin-Canada participatory research initiative which included both Benin and Canadian nongovernmental organizations, a local capacity to produce and market bednets for the prevention of malaria was developed. The development process began following a community-based assessment of local needs and skills. All materials for the manufacture and distribution of the bednets were obtained locally with the exception of the netting which was imported from Canada. The sustainability of the enterprise is enhanced by the community's recognition of the importance of malaria and the culturally acceptable practice of bednet use.

AB Participatory management approaches are increasingly recognized as an effective strategy for enabling the sustainable use of natural resources. The southeast coast of St. Lucia is one of the sites where a particular form of participatory management, a co-management regime, was recently developed to control the sea urchin fishery. The Caribbean Natural Resources Institute (CANARI) a NGO based in Vieux-Fort, St. Lucia, played a key role in the development of this co-management arrangement This case study of the sea urchin fishery in Vieux-Fort examines the extent of the devolution of authority to locally-based sea urchin harvesters, explores the potential contribution of local knowledge to the understanding of sea urchin behavior and points to elements of a strategy aimed at strengthening the organizational capacity of the core group of sea urchin harvesters. The study addresses both present practice and future possibilities in response to concrete questions raised by participants in the study.

ID GREEN-REVOLUTION; RUBBER; BORNEO
AB This study examines the moral ecology of resource use through a comparison of the ideological bases of three systems of resource use in Southeast Asia: gathering forest products (viz., forest fruit), swidden agriculture, and the cultivation of high-yielding variety, green revolution crops. A trade-off between the magnitude of return and the frequency of return is accepted in the first two systems, but this is denied in the third system in which there is, instead, insistence on continuous, high-magnitude returns. In the fruit- gathering and swidden cultivation systems there is recognition of linkages to the wider temporal and spatial processes in which they are embedded, but in the green revolution system there is only a very narrow view of these linkages. Whereas the necessity of reciprocal exchange with their wider social and natural environments is accepted in the first two systems, such exchanges are minimized in the green revolution system. This study contributes to current debates about sustainable resource use, the conception of nature and culture, and the epistemology of science and the contemporary role of anthropology.

AB It has been demonstrated using magnetic force microscopy (MFM) that magnetic recording patterns with linear densities in excess of 230 kfci can be sustained by isotropic longitudinal media with H-c = 2500 Oe and perpendicular media with H-c = 1800 Oe. It was found that the size of magnetic cluster domains limited the linear recording density sustainable by longitudinal medium and that the cluster size decreased with increasing medium coercivity, As the bit size approached the minimum cluster size observed in the magnetic background of longitudinal medium, the bits tended to percolate within the track resulting in a complete disappearance of a recorded pattern, In the case of the perpendicular medium, the bit transitions remained sharp at high densities, As the bit size approached minimum cluster domain size, the signal amplitude approached the noise amplitude thus limiting the detectability of the recorded bit pattern.

AB A field experiment was carried out at Hyderabad during 1990-91 and 1991-92 to develop and test suitable rice (Oryza sativa L.)-based cropping system and also appropriate tillage practice for some upland crops grown after rice. Groundnut (Arrachis hypogaea L.), blackgram (Phaseolus mungo L.), sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) and castor (Ricinus communis L.) were used as the test crops with different tillage practices, viz tillage, ploughing twice with country plough, ploughing with bullock-drawn mouldboard plough and disc harrowing, working with cultivator twice, and ploughing with tractor-drawn mouldboard plough once and rotovator twice. Land preparation with tractor-drawn mouldboard plough once and rotary tiller twice recorded higher net castor. However, rice-blackgram sequence registered higher production efficiency, and rice-castor gave higher land-utilization efficiency. Rice-groundnut sequence proved more sustainable and profitable, especially for Telangana region of Andhra Pradesh.

TI Integrated nutrient management for sustainable productivity of important
   cropping systems in Madhya Pradesh
SO INDIAN JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY
LA English
DT Article
AB A field experiment was conducted during 1987-88 to 1989-90 to determine suitable integrated nutrient management for sustainable productivity of rice (Oryza sativa L.)-wheat (Triticum aestivum L. emend. Fiori and Paol.) and sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench]-wheat cropping systems. Grain yield and total profit of crops in both the crop sequences increased with every corresponding increase in recommended dose up to 100% level, but 75% of the recommended dose to both crops in these crops sequences appeared optimum due to enhanced cost of fertilizers. Application of nutrients through fertilizers only the rainy-season (kharif) crops in both sequences gave higher grain yield than that obtained with the integrated use of fertilizers and organic manures at the same level of fertility. But total grain production and profits per year in both the sequences with 100% recommended dose through fertilizers were at par to those obtained with 75% of recommended dose through fertilizers + 6 tonnes/ha farmyard manure or green-manure and 50% of recommended dose through fertilizers + 12 tonnes/ha organic manures to the kharif crops (rice or sorghum) along with 100% recommended dose to wheat. The results indicated a saving of 25-50% quantity of costly N fertilizers and sustainability of grain production in the both cropping systems with the integrated use of fertilizers and organic manures.

SO INDIAN JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCES
LA English
DT Article
AB The growth, mortality, recruitment pattern and MSY of important fishery resources of Maharashtra were estimated. The investigation revealed that out of 18 fish resources 11 are optimally exploited. The penaeid prawn resources which are the target species of shrimp trawlers are underexploited. Cephalopods appear to be optimally exploited. The present yield of fishes, prawns and cephalopods are 65083, 38404 and 11373 tons while the estimated MSY are 83025, 72460 and 10475 tons. The study indicates that additional yield of 62,926 ton can be obtained by increasing the efforts to the extent of 25% without any adverse effects on the total resources.

TI Impacts and transfer of risky technologies to Amazonia
SO INTERCIENCIA
LA Spanish
DT Article
ID FUTURE
AB This article aims at establishing some premises on the impact assessment in order to rationalize the transfer of risky technologies to the environment and health within the context of the Amazon Basin.
   Some definitions of Sustainable Development focus on the importance of selection, acquisition, adoption, innovation and use of technologies that respect and work towards the carrying capacity of Earth-which is finite. This aspect has been underestimated by most of the technological developments in the Amazonian region.
   In the first part, this paper seeks to to define what ''sustainable technology'' is, fn regard to this quest, a relationship was found between the terms ''appropriate technology'', ''clean technology'', ''environmental technology'', ''intermediate technology'',''utopic technology'', ''soft technology'', and ''sustainable technology''.
   Secondly, this article presents the usefulness of the methodologies and procedures of impact assessments to determine risks to environment and health (potential risk assessments). Also, some experiences of which universities of developed countries are described here which incorporate the sustainability principle and impact assessment methodologies and procedures to engineering pensa and curricula, that could be considered and adapted by the engineering departments to the Amazonian universities.
   Within the center of Amazonia, some allegations of multinational and corporative national firms are disclosed transferring risky technologies, as well as some reasons for which these arguments should be ethically discarded.
   Finally, this article concludes with a list of some requirements to incorporate the ''sustainability'' principles to development projects in the Amazonia.

DT Article
DE sustainable development; 'back-to-nature' ideology; social evolution;
   conflict; social theory
ID FOOD WEBS
AB This paper is a provocative collection of arguments that came to the author's mind when reading through some of the literature on sustainable development. Similar to rather general sociological theories, these sustainability concepts - which are rooted in biological observations and theories of the non-human biosphere - describe elements of a universal development philosophy. But they fail to take into account some of the most basic characteristics of how human societies and economics function and develop. For instance, they largely ignore the role of conflict, the fundamental diversity of interests and lifestyles, power imbalance in and between human societies and the specific dynamics of pioneer development. Most importantly, they define life-support systems almost exclusively in bio-geophysical terms - ignoring the fact that human development primarily depends on the accumulated scientific and technological knowledge and on the cultural heritage of institutions and arrangements which represent successful solutions of social, economic and political problems.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND WORLD ECOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
DE Bhutan; economic development; environmental protection
AB National rights of utilization of natural resources (depletion of primary forest, decrease in range of biodiversity, etc.) and rights of polluting the 'global commons', contributing to global warming, depletion of the ozone layer, etc., have become central themes in today's international debate.
   For a small, least-developed country like Bhutan, which began modern economic development only 35 years ago after centuries of self-imposed isolation and hence still has most of its natural resources and environment intact, the question is how to spur much needed economic growth while preserving its pristine environment. Rapid population growth and the desire for economic development in a rugged mountainous terrain imposes a potential threat to the environment. Bhutan's National Environment Strategy has identified intersectoral contradictions and possible synergies in resource utilization and the need for institutional reforms, policies, manpower development, information, and legislation to achieve the goal of balanced sustainable development. The challenge ahead is the implementation of this strategy, as environmental regulations must be fitted into the society's economic and social structure.
   While promoting economic development, preservation of the environment can easily become a liability to Bhutan. There is the great danger that Bhutan's unique environment will come to be seen by other nations as just another unexploited asset.

   the process, or extending the approach
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND WORLD ECOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
DE discounting; sustainable development; cost-benefit; natural capital
ID INTERGENERATIONAL EQUITY; ENVIRONMENTAL RISK; DECISIONS; RESOURCE;
   SUBSTITUTION; CONSERVATION; MODEL
AB Discounting of future costs and benefits is an integral feature of economic appraisal, and one associated with considerable controversy. The fundamental objection to discounting has been the apparent disregard for future as compared to current concerns. Such intergenerational equity issues form the basis of the call for sustainable development, and the relatively recent focus on sustainability has renewed the focus on the role of discounting. A number of alterations have been proposed to reduce the differential between present and future concerns which results from discounting, the most radical of which is the abandoning of discounting altogether. This extreme is rejected, however, on the grounds of equity with regard to the current generation, and the potential for reduced welfare for both current and future generations. It is argued that sustainability can best be incorporated into decision making by applying physical sustainability constraints to otherwise economic efficiency derived selection criteria. This compromise can ensure the maintenance of natural capital for the future whilst not constricting economic progress which can benefit both present and future generations.

   statements with respect to sustainable development
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND WORLD ECOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
DE natural capital; sustainable development; biodiversity
AB The European and UK legislation on environmental assessment (EA), as well as requiring assessment of significant ecological effects, also requires development proponents to recommend mitigation measures for adverse impacts.
   Drawing on a review of proposed ecological mitigation measures in 194 environmental statements (ES) for UK development proposals, this paper highlights problems with the current legislation in ensuring that ecological impacts are mitigated effectively, with a view to sustainable development.
   The review reveals confusion about the extent to which ecological mitigation is required. First, there is no objective basis for deciding which potentially adverse impacts should be mitigated. Proposed mitigation measures do not always relate directly to the ecological impacts identified in ES and there is a high risk of residual adverse effects. Second, there is no generally accepted method for evaluating the effectiveness of proposed mitigation measures, despite a clear recommendation from the UK's Department of the Environment (DOE, 1989) that an 'assessment of the likely effectiveness' of mitigation measures should be included in ES. Methods which can be used to evaluate the likely feasibility, costs and redistributional effects of ecological mitigation measures in EA are needed. Some of the factors which should be taken into account are considered in this paper.

AB The application of the concept of sustainable development in development co-operation has created a need for additional professional training in The Netherlands. Sustainable development is a relatively new concept. Applying this concept in development projects and policies requires professionals with a interdisciplinary, analytical and environmentally-conscious approach. However, most of today's development experts have professional biases. Is it possible to teach development experts the sustainable development approach in a short training course?
   This article deals with the implementation of the concept of sustainable development for professional training purposes in the field of development co-operation. It describes the development of a training programme and its two central frameworks, illustrated with case studies. It also reports on experiences and makes evaluative remarks about the impact of the training on the participants.
   Since 1991, a one week training programme has been used to update project staff and desk officers. The training offers: (1) an overview of backgrounds and policies in the field of environment and sustainable development; (2) theory and tools to analyse problems of unsustainability; and (3) theory and tools to (re-)design environmentally-sound activities, projects and programmes.

AB A common concept is that upland agriculture undertaken by local communities is a major factor causing large-scale soil erosion and other environmental problems in the Himalaya. Attempts to measure soil loss from farm fields are limited. This study was undertaken to measure the rate of soil loss from fields sown with crops during the rainy season and to examine the factors determining the erosion rates in the Pranmati watershed which is characterised by settled organic farming on terraced slopes. About 43% of the total agricultural land in the watershed was on low sloping terraces (<2 degrees), 32% on medium sloping terraces (2-6 degrees) and 25% on highly sloping terraces (6-10 degrees). Potato was the most dominant crop, occupying 50.2% of the total cropped area, followed by Amaranthus paniculatus (22.6%), Eleusine coracana (11.2%), Echinocloa frumentacea (10%) and Oryza sativa (6%). Soil loss from different crop covers was in the range of 0.300-0.658 t/ha/yr on low sloping terraces, 1-7 t/ha/yr on medium sloping terraces, and 6.037-64.39 t/ha/yr on highly sloping terraces. Comparison of different crops revealed the highest soil loss was from potato fields, a cash crop in the watershed. Potato cultivation on highly sloping terraces accounted for 72.6% of the total soil loss from agricultural fields. The area under this crop is rapidly increasing because of increasing emphasis on a monetary economy. Organic manure input in potato fields (28.5 t/ha) was much higher as compared to traditional crops (7.8-15.5 t/ha). Byproducts of potato do not have any fodder value, while the traditional crops do have useful fodder byproducts. The increase in the area under potato also implies more intensive pressure on the forests. The threat of sail erosion causing unsustainability of upland agriculture seems to be due more to the cultivation of potato than to traditional subsistence crops. Factors related to erosion and land-use policy aspects are discussed in the paper.

SO INTERNATIONAL SOCIAL SCIENCE JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
AB After briefly reviewing the close historical relationship between transport, trade flows and the organization and workings of the world economy, this article sets out on the basis of that relationship to highlight the transition from national economic structures to the international structuring of the world economy and globalization. It then analyses the evolution of the world economic system, which is currently driven by increasingly complex transnational and transcontinental networks sustained by a large number of major arteries, which testify to the vitality of the triad of North America, the European Economic Area and Japan. The central areas formed by this triad stand in marked contrast to the peripheral areas whose markets are not buoyant enough to bring about real integration into the major areas generating both visible and invisible flows. A large number of intermediate areas, such as the newly industrialized countries, have broken out of the vicious circle and are now engaged in a development spiral, accelerating towards the momentum of the triad. Widespread mobility in the industrialized countries has also brought tourism to the forefront as a strategic instrument of economic deployment. However, the global picture registering the overall pattern of the flows raises the question of how to promote sustainable development without checking the momentum of the present world economic system.

AB Two Caribbean hair sheep breeds, the St. Croix (SC) and Barbados Blackbelly (BB), are found in the United States, and the SC has led to the development of the Katahdin (K), a synthetic breed of hair sheep. These breeds have mature ewe BW ranging from 32 to 54 kg (for BB and SC) and from 55 to 73 kg (K). Hair sheep and hair sheep crosses have lower rectal temperatures and respiration rates than wool breeds and a lower DMI and water intake. There are indications of increased resistance to internal parasites in hair sheep. Although hair sheep are seasonal breeders under U.S. photoperiodic conditions, they tend to perform better under accelerated lambing systems than traditional wool breeds. Fertility, prolificacy, and lamb survival is high in BB and SC, but hair x wool crossbred ewes tend to have a higher level of fertility than hair and wool parent breeds. Ewe productivity is also higher in hair x wool crosses than in wool crosses, particularly when adjusted for ewe BW or under accelerated lambing systems. Hair sheep have a lower ADG and intake of high-energy diets, as well as a lower gain/feed ratio, than wool breeds. Growth rates tend to be higher in SC than in BE. Differences in carcass characteristics are inconsistent between hair and wool breeds. Production characteristics of hair sheep, particularly hair x wool crosses, make them suitable for low-input, sustainable production systems that do not require high growth rates and large carcasses. There is a need to preserve the existing U.S. hair sheep germplasm base in support of such systems.

AB The lubrication form of the equations governing the flow of a thin liquid film on a horizontal right circular cylinder is derived. The equations are discretized and solved numerically using an alternating-direction implicit algorithm. Simulations demonstrate that the transition from a uniform coating to a final configuration of distinct drops follows a similar evolution for a wide range of cylinder radii. Initially gravity-driven drainage from the top and sides of the cylinder dampens the formation of any axial disturbances; only when this drainage slows do longitudinal waves begin to develop along the bottom of the cylinder. These waves grow rapidly and a series of alternating primary and satellite drops form during the transition from a linear to a nonlinear wave growth regime. This is followed by a slow drainage between adjacent drops as the drop pattern approaches an equilibrium state where surface tension forces exactly balance gravitational forces in each discrete drop. For large cylinder radii, these drops are localized on the bottom of the cylinder, while, for sufficiently small cylinder radii, these drops may wrap around the entire circumference of the cylinder. Integral measures of the evolving coating profile, such as the total energy and viscous dissipation rate, clearly show these growth phases. The equilibrium shape of large-amplitude pendant drops and the maximum sustainable drop volume for various cylinders are also considered. (C) 1997 Academic Press.

AB Sustainable use of tropical forest systems requires continuous monitoring of biological diversity and ecosystem functions. This can be efficiently done with 'early warning' (short-cycle) indicator groups of non-economical insects, whose population levels and resources are readily measured. Twenty-one groups of insects are evaluated as focal indicator taxa for rapid assessment of changes in Neotropical forest systems. Composite environmental indices for heterogeneity, richness, and natural disturbance are correlated positively with butterfly diversity in 56 Neotropical sites studied over many years. Various components of alpha, beta and gamma-diversity show typical responses to increased disturbance and different land-use regimes. Diversity often increases with disturbance near or below natural levels, but some sensitive species and genes are eliminated at very low levels of interference. Agricultural and silvicultural mosaics with over 30% conversion, including selective logging of three or more large trees per hectare, show shifts in species composition with irreversible loss of many components of the butterfly community, indicating non-sustainable land and resource use and reduction of future options. Monitoring of several insect indicator groups by local residents in a species-rich Brazilian Amazon extractive reserve has helped suggest guidelines for ecologically, economically, and socially sustainable zoning and use regimes.

AB Water has been taken for granted as an essential public health need since the Victorian sanitary revolution, Water has come back on to the public health agenda in the United Kingdom because of recent policy changes and their untoward environmental and social impacts; along with water privatization and tough new environmental directives, there have been serious water pollution incidents, water shortages, water debt and disconnection. Along with concern about protecting individual rights to a clean safe water supply, there is concern about the ability of national water resources to meet all our communities' needs, without unacceptable environmental damage. A national plan is needed for the conservation of water and protection of water resources and the environment; adequate central funds are needed to see that this happens. There should be greater emphasis on local water management and a key role for local authorities; there should be fair pricing, protection of water supplies for the poorest and most vulnerable, and a ban on water disconnection to domestic users, on public health grounds, More research is needed into the potential adverse health impact of people on prepayment meters disconnecting themselves. There is a place for water metering as the most rapidly deliverable means of controlling peak demand, reducing overall consumption and avoiding a targe-scale environmentally damaging solution to supply more water. However, control of leakage offers the largest potential saving and is the most cost-effective means to protect existing water supply. We question whether private water companies, geared to maximizing profit and share dividends, can deliver a national plan for the protection and management of water resources, for the good of the environment and future generations. The public health lobby must become more actively engaged in the debate about the supply, protection and price of our most precious public health asset - water.

TI Using GIS for evaluation of neighborhood pedestrian accessibility
SO JOURNAL OF URBAN PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT-ASCE
LA English
DT Article
ID WALKING
AB The neighborhood-level destination offers the potential for diversion from automobile travel to walking, and design that minimizes neighborhood walking distances should be encouraged. This paper illustrates the use of a geographic information systems (GIS) based approach to compare the average walking accessibility between alternative neighborhood designs. Three neighborhood plans for an actual 23.3-ha site are considered: the development's original layout the original layout without pedestrian walkways, and a more ''sustainable'' redesign. Schools, open space, and transit stops are considered as neighborhood destinations and a difference in pedestrian accessibility for the alternative plans is documented. Results suggest that empirical evaluation of neighborhood accessibility for subdivision layouts should be undertaken; that pedestrian walkways are an excellent means to improve walking accessibility within neighborhoods; and that with only minor changes to a site plan, many residents unfortunately remain beyond currently accepted walking distances for neighborhood-level destinations.

TI Examining the role of buyer-seller relationships in export performance
SO JOURNAL OF WORLD BUSINESS
LA English
DT Article
AB This article develops important benchmarks for suppliers concerned with building sustainable competitive advantage in their export markets. The evidence most especially suggests the need to focus more attention on buyer-seller relationship-building in export marketing, as compared to more conventional export support activities. Great Britain is a major export market for many suppliers in the United States. This article reports on British importers' perceptions of United States exporters, including importers' selection criteria used in choosing suppliers, and ratings of the performance is linked to their future purchase intentions. In particular high-performing importers are identified as a key target for sustained export growth. These importers display distinct preferences and priorities in trading relationships with exporters. The issues discussed in the article also provide potentially useful guidelines for examining exporter-importer relationships in other European Union countries.

AB Fisheries management issues are no longer exclusively limited to fisheries sustainability. General environmental concerns have become criteria in assessing the success of fisheries management and have opened up possibilities for new kinds of conflict between interest groups. As an example the disagreement between bird conservation and fisheries at the Shetland Islands shows how the introduction of new world views make management more complex. Quantitative tools of fisheries assessment can be used to identify scientific uncertainties but the resolution of conflicts demands new approaches to the whole management structure, which must facilitate a systematic treatment of different values and the trade-offs these imply. This paper discusses the application of decision-analytic methods for this purpose. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB Recent emphasis on residue management in sustainable agriculture highlights the importance of elucidating the mechanisms of microbial degradation of cellulose. Cellulose decomposition and its associated microbial dynamics in soil were investigated in incubation experiments. Population dynamics of actinomycetes, bacteria, and fungi were monitored by direct counts. Populations of oligotrophic bacteria in cellulose-amended soil were determined by plate count using a low C medium containing 4 mg C liter(-1) agar, and copiotrophs using a high C medium. Cumulative (CO2)-C-14 evolution from C-14-labeled cellulose was best described by a multiphasic curve in a 28-day incubation experiment. The initial phase of decomposition was attributed mainly to the activity of bacterial populations with a low oligotroph-to-copiotroph ratio, and the second phase mainly to fungal populations. An increase in oligotroph-to-copiotroph ratio coincided with the emergence of a rapid (CO2)-C-14 evolution stage. Streptomycin reduced (CO2)-C-14 evolution during the first phase and prompted earlier emergence of the second phase, compared to the control. Cycloheximide initially promoted (CO2)-C-14 evolution but subsequently had a lasting negative effect on (CO2)-C-14 evolution. Cycloheximide addition significantly increased bacterial biomass and resulted in substantially stronger oscillation of active bacterial populations, whereas it initially reduced, and then stimulated, active fungal biomass. The observed changes in (CO2)-C-14 evolution could not be explained by observed shifts in fungal and bacterial biomass, probably because functional groups of fungi and bacteria could not be distinguished. However, it was suggested that oligotrophic bacteria prompted activation of cellulolytic enzumes in fungi and played an important role in leading to fungal dominance of cellulose decomposition.

AB Changes in the broad determinants of health since the Alma Ata Conference in 1978 necessitate a renewed examination of the underlying principles and focus of the Primary Health Care (PHC) strategy. The PHC approach has been adopted by most countries and has led to improved access to certain basic health services. However, the health gains in other areas are less encouraging. Some elements of the PHC approach, for example, the effective implementation of equity-oriented health policies and the need to improve management principles within health services, have yet to be fully implemented. Moreover, to address the underlying determinants of health status, the World Health Organization's (WHO) renewed global health policy will have to include certain issues that were not considered at Alma Ata. For example, the health impacts of global recession and globalization and the need for human-centred sustainable development strategies were not considered at Alma Ata. A renewed global health policy will also have to consider demographic, epidemiological, environmental and technological changes that have emerged since 1978. It is important that WHO's renewed policy be based on sound evidence, a commitment to ethical principles and broad use of partnerships for health at global, national and local levels. One implication of this new context of health development for the renewed health policy will be that ''thinking globally and acting locally' will have to be complemented by stronger global action to protect local and national health.

SO OUTLOOK ON AGRICULTURE

AB Agriculture is the basic economic activity of the world's poorest countries, and the sustainability of this sector is vital for their overall development. Appropriate agricultural policies in conjunction with research and technology could play an important role in protecting and promoting sustainable agricultural development. In this paper, it is argued that agriculture-related policies should be geared towards providing economic incentives to resource-poor farmers, enabling them to improve their agricultural productivity, income and livelihood without causing environmental degradation, In this regard, research and technology development should be farmer-centred, practical and economical. Emphasis must be placed on raising yields, conserving soils, and lowering costs through improved farm management.

AB Four mechanisms of dispersal of propagules of Phytophthora capsici were investigated through modifications in cultural practices and fungicide applications in field plots of bell pepper (Capsicum annuum). Dispersal of soil inoculum was suppressed, and final incidence of disease was 2.5 to 43% when stubble from a fall-sown, no-till, wheat cover crop was present. Final disease incidence was 71 to 72% and pathogen spread occurred within and across rows when all dispersal mechanisms were operative in plots of pepper planted into bare soil. Final disease incidence was 42 to 78% with black plastic mulch when a sporulating pepper fruit placed on the surface served as the source of initial inoculum. The fungicide metalaxyl applied in the irrigation system did not suppress within-row spread of surface inoculum from a sporulating fruit on plastic, but did limit across-row spread; final disease incidence in metalaxyl-treated plots was 11.5 to 14%. Pathogen dispersal mechanisms were modified most dramatically by the no-till cropping system. Thus, simple changes in cultural practices can have dramatic effects on the development of Phytophthora epidemics. Ecologically based disease management strategies have the potential to reduce our reliance on agrichemicals in this and similar pathosystems.

AB Quantification of soil quality changes following deforestation by measurable soil attributes is important to sustainable management of soil and water conservation. A study was initiated in 1994 to evaluate the effects of deforestation on physical and chemical properties of soils under oak (Quercus brontii) forests in Lordegan region of central Zagrous mountain, Iran. Nine profiles which were derived from Bakhtiari conglomerate from three sites were selected for this research. These sites were: i) a virgin forest; ii) a completely deforested and currently utilized as crop land; and iii) a forest which has been cultivated for cropping under the trees (a type of agroforestry). Soil (coarse-silty, carbonatic, calcixerollic xerocherpts) characteristics that were analyzed include: bulk density, mean weight diameter, aggregate uniformity coefficient, organic matter nitrogen, potassium, phosphorous, pH, EC, soluble anions and cations, plasticity index, and tilth index. Deforestation and subsequently tillage practices resulted in almost a 20% increase in bulk density, 50% decrease in organic matter and total nitrogen, a 10 to 15% decrease in soluble ions comparing to the undisturbed forest soil. The filth index coefficient (average of three depths) of the forest site was significantly higher (0.717) than the cultivated forest (0.633) and the deforested (0.573) sites. Deforestation and clear cutting, of the forests in the central Zagrous mountain resulted in a lower soil quality and thus decreasing the productivity of the natural soil.

AB Reorganizations have provided fertile ground for researchers and practitioners seeking to draw lessons about the nature of public administration. The review leading to the reorganization of British local government in 1991-96 sustains the tradition. In an extraordinary unfolding of events key features of the policy and political system are laid bare. This article provides a background analysis of the review, examines the main turning points in the process, assesses the performance of key players and concludes with a judgement about the sustainability of the settlement that ultimately emerged. A number of lessons are drawn about the nature of the British political system as revealed through the impact of the challenge of a large-scale structural review of local government.

TI Making the transition from conventional to sustainable agriculture:
   Gender, social movement participation, and quality of life on the family
   farm
SO RURAL SOCIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB This qualitative study of a non-random sample of six farm couples in southeastern Minnesota was shaped by a question originally posed by the participating couples: Is quality of life changing in the same ways for women and men as a consequence of the transition to sustainable farming systems? Historically, the family farm has been treated in research and policy debates as a single unit, with little analysis applied to the multiplicity of interests and roles within the family. Some organizations of the sustainable agriculture movement have followed suit and largely ignored women's roles on the farm, despite their importance to farm operations. The social construct of gender has implications for how farmers in this study define quality of life which, in turn, affects participation in the sustainable agriculture movement. Much of what men emphasize in describing quality of life reflects the values the sustainable agriculture movement itself espouses. For their wives, descriptions of quality of life are largely entwined with their highly elastic gendered roles and responsibilities on the farm, in the household, in paid and unpaid work in the community, and much less with their involvement in the movement. Because women's different and important contributions to the farm and family are not institutionally recognized and addressed by the sustainable agriculture movement, the movement's goals, vision, and activities are gender-specific, dominated by men's participation and contributions.

TI Modern Amish farming as ecological agriculture
SO SOCIETY & NATURAL RESOURCES
LA English
DT Article
DE Amish agriculture; Amish pesticide use; ecological agriculture; New York
   State agriculture; stewardship; sustainability
AB Critics of industrial agriculture and advocates of ecological agriculture have cited Amish farming as a model of stewardship and sustainability. Amish farming in St. Lawrence County, New York, embodied ecological agriculture in some respects but not others. In comparison with non-Amish neighbors, Amish farms were smaller in scale, more diverse, and less integrated into the market economy. On the other hand, use of fertilizers and pesticides for crop production appeared to differ in kind, nor amount. Amish farmers relied primarily on their own experience, not trade magazines or the local cooperative extension, for agricultural information. The high use of petroleum-based inputs may have reflected the newness of Amish settlement in St. Lawrence County, a lack of awareness of the ecological impacts of these substances, or a shift away from traditional practices. In the self-sufficiency of their lives based on subsistence and diversity, these Amish otherwise exemplified the productive and self-regulatory characteristics of ecological agriculture.

AB This article examines the consequences of the globalization of the shrimp mariculture industry on rural livelihoods, social justice, and environmental quality in Central America. It considers the association between the expansion of shrimp farms and enhanced social conflict and the emergence of local resistance movements of the poor. It describes the globalization of shrimp mariculture, discusses its repercussions in Asia and Latin America, and explores its recent expansion in Central America. It reveals a number of factors that affect rural livelihoods, impinge on small farmers, and hurt the rural poor, and suggests that the industry may be intensifying the social and ecological crises associated with commodities promoted earlier. It raises serious concerns regarding equity, increased marginalization of the rural poor, and the further destruction of Central America's biophysical environment and natural resource base. Finally, it proposes changes in policy necessary to bring about more equitable and sustainable development.

AB The introduction of earthworms into degraded or newly restored land is known to promote soil improvement. Obtaining the most appropriate species in the large numbers required can be costly and time consuming using traditional techniques. Research and development of a novel approach, the Earthworm Inoculation Unit (EIU) technique, may help to overcome this. This technique combines cultivation of selected earthworms in small soil-based units, with an effective method of direct soil introduction. Successful cultivation of deep burrowing species, e.g. Lumbricus terrestris L. and Aporrectodea longa (Ude), and shallow working species, e.g. Allolobophora chlorotica (Savigny), has been achieved by optimizing environmental factors. Accelerated rates of reproduction compared with field data have been recorded.
   At soil-inoculation, each EIU was found to contain all three earthworm life stages, adults, cocoons and hatchlings, promoting maximum opportunity for successful colonisation. Results from field trials suggest, that for A. longa, the EIU technique can enhance survivorship in compacted clay soils compared with a more conventional inoculation method.
   Earthworm inoculation, where appropriate, should become an integral component of sustainable land restoration practice. In hostile soils, often associated with reclaimed land, the EIU technique may provide a means of ensuring long term survival for earthworm populations. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB Phosphorus immobilization is among the recalcitrant problems hampering crop production in the high rainfall acid soils of Nigeria. Applied inorganic phosphorus quickly becomes immobilized and unavailable to plants. There is, therefore, a need to develop cultural methods that foster fast and efficient recycling of phosphorus and carbon to satisfy plant demands and facilitate sustainable soil fertility management in these soils. Nine Streptosporangium isolates of Eudrilus eugeniae (earthworm) casts were found to be acidogenic, acid tolerant, rock phosphate (RP) solubilizers which could grow on synthetic glucose or carboxymethyl-cellulose (CMC) N-free or NH4Cl-enriched media as the sole carbon source. CMC induced production of extracellular cellulase enzyme and release of reducing sugar in all isolates. Both CMC media were acidified by all isolates. The ability to solubilize RP varied among the isolates and ranged from 800 mu g P g(-1)RP 7 d(-1) to 9500 mu g P g(-1) RP 7 d(-1). A maximum release of 1040 mu g (glucose equivalent) ml(-1) 7 d(-1) was recorded in N-free CMC, while a minimum of 121 mu g ml(-1) was recorded in NH4Cl-enriched CMC medium. These isolates could, therefore, be exploited in the industrial production of cellulolytic enzymes and microbial phosphate fertilizers which would enhance organic residues and plant nutrients recycling in the acid soils of Nigeria.

AB Crop-monitoring by farmer groups has been established to identify agronomic and soil factors limiting crop yields and to promote the adoption of sustainable farming practises in South Australia. The use of earthworms as a potential indicator of sustainability has been investigated with a survey of 95 paddocks sown to wheat, barley or peas, within an area of about 3500 km(2). Mean annual rainfall ranged from less than 350 mm to more than 500 mm, and soils varied from coarse sands through lighter loams to heavy clays.
   The dryland cropping soils in South Australia have been colonized by four immigrant earthworm species, Aporrectodea rosea (Savigny), Aporrectodea trapezoides (Duges), Microscolex dubius (Fletcher) and Micloscolex phosphoreus (Duges); populations are generally dominated by A. rosea. Population differences, such as the higher numbers of A. rosea recorded under barley than peas and more juveniles under peas than wheat, and the occasional abundance of other species in some paddocks may be used to indicate changes in soil conditions associated with management.
   Conservation tillage, retaining plant-residues and reducing cultivation, is being promoted as desirable in developing sustainable farming systems and the inverse relationship between earthworm abundance and intensity of tillage (r= -0.69***) provides support for earthworms as a potential indicator of sustainability. Earthworm abundance showed a small but significant correlation between earthworm activity and grain yields (r = 0.44***) and grain protein content (r = 0.52***). A positive correlation between nitrogen fertilizer levels and earthworm numbers (r = 0.48***) and biomass (r = 0.43***) may be related to increased soil organic matter, derived from increased plant growth.
   The distribution and abundance of earthworms is dependent not only on management related to crop production, but also on local soil and climatic factors. Density and biomass were significantly higher in paddocks with higher annual rainfall and inversely correlated with levels of coarse sand.
   The soils, crops, climate, management and history of a region of the geographic scale surveyed here is probably too diverse to provide simple relationships between earthworms and plant productivity. It is important to distinguish the broad concept of sustainable productivity on a regional basis from the reality of productivity and sustainability on the spatial and temporal scales of activity of the organisms studied and the production and management processes involved. At an appropriate scale, ecological data on both the species composition and on functional groups within earthworm communities, may be useful indicators of crop production and its sustainability.

TI Changes of soil phosphorous fractions under long-term corn monoculture
SO SOIL SCIENCE SOCIETY OF AMERICA JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
ID ORGANIC-CARBON; CULTIVATION; TRANSFORMATIONS; SORPTION
AB Corn (Zea mays L.) monoculture is a common management practice due to high production levels with economic and agronomic advantages. Phosphorus reactions in soil affect sustainable, economic corn management and environmental quality. Our objectives were to quantify changes in soil P fractions as related to additions of manure and inorganic P with time using a modified Hedley fractionation scheme. A field experiment was conducted on a Chicot sandy clay loam soil (fine-loamy, mixed, frigid Typic Hapludalf) from 1984 to 1993. With an annual rate of 60 kg P ha(-1) manure P plus 44 kg P ha(-1) inorganic P, labile inorganic P (Pi; Bicarb-Pi) increased and moderately labile Pi (NaOH-Pi) decreased. A higher annual P rate of 132 kg P ha(-1) plus manure P increased soil Pi through Bicarb-Pi, NaOH-Pi, and stable Ca-bound Pi (HCl-R). Inorganic P at either rate combined with manure P decreased labile Bicarb-Po fractions and increased moderately labile NaOH-Po, with the result that total extractable soil organic P (Po) increased. Without manure, 44 kg P ha(-1), approximately equal to P removal by the crop, resulted in no change in soil P fractions except for residual P (Res-P), which decreased. Soil Po and Pi levels increased continuously in soil fertilized with 132 kg P ha(-1) yr(-1) inorganic P only. With the manure-inorganic system, 86% of the Bicarb-Pi was supplied from added inorganic P, indicating reduced P fixation compared with the inorganic P system. The NaOH-Pi and Res-P were soil P sinks, with Res-P being supplied from both the NaOH-Po and HCl-Pi fractions. In contrast, NaOH-Pi in the inorganic P system was the major source for Bicarb-Pi.

SO SOIL USE AND MANAGEMENT

DE land resources; soil degradation; soil resources; Albania
AB When Albania emerged from its seclusion in 1991, the scientific community had its first opportunity to interact with its international counterparts. Soil resource assessment was made with systems developed in the early 1950s, laboratory facilities to provide supporting data were poor, and it was recognized that a new assessment was urgently needed.
   The country faces a major challenge in reforestation and sail conservation against a background of overgrazing by sheep and goats and clearing of trees and scrubs for fuelwood. Even orchard and olive trees were used as fuelwood during the winters of 1990 and 1991. Since then, gully and rill erosion has accelerated on many of the sloping lands. In addition to reforestation and conservation measures to reduce the pressures on the sloping land, it is necessary to enhance productivity on the fertile valley bottom soils where most of the agriculture is confined. In the recent past, grain yields have declined due to reduced fertilizer use (low purchasing capacity), and poor management practices. More recently productivity has slowly improved, but land degradation, particularly erosion, has visibly increased.
   USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service in collaboration with the Land Resources Institute of Albania, initiated work an a new national soil map through collation of existing information and field studies. The land unit for land use planning, evaluation, and general management decisions, is the Major Land Resource Area (MLRA). Each MLRA encompasses geographically associated soils, the majority of which have broadly similar patterns of climate, water resources, and land uses. The MLRAs presented here are based on the soil map of Albania at 1 :200 000 scale. The MLRA information provides an overview of the landscape and natural resources. It can be used to assess land suitability for various crops, opportunities to achieve self sufficiency in food production, selection of areas for both field crops and high value crops for export, and identification of appropriate farming system technologies. Each MLRA will have a set of degradation processes which can be flagged, therefore each of them becomes a unit for decision making with respect to investments in research and mitigating technologies. The task is far from complete. Appropriate databases are needed to support the decisions that are being made at national level. To complement the MLRA and related database, decision support systems are needed for the important task of developing policy options.

AB We compare the first local Lyapunov vector (LLV) and the leading optimal vectors in a T10/18 level truncated version of the National Centers for Environmental Prediction global spectral model. The leading LLV is a vector toward which all other perturbations turn and hence it is characterized by the fastest possible growth over infinitely long time periods, while the optimal vectors are perturbations that maximize growth for a finite time period, with respect to a chosen norm. Linear tangent model breeding experiments without convection at T10 resolution show that arbitrary random perturbations converge within a transition period of 3 to 4 days to a single LLV. We computed optimal vectors with the Lanczos algorithm, using the total energy norm. For optimization periods shorter than the transition period (about 3 days), the horizontal structure of the leading initial optimal vectors differs substantially From that of the leading LLV, which provides maximum sustainable growth, There are also profound differences between the two types of vectors in their vertical structure. While the 24-hour optimal vectors rapidly become similar to the LLV in their vertical structure, changes in their horizontal structure are: very slow. As a consequence, their amplification factor drops and stays well below that of the LLV for an extended period after the optimization period ends, This may have an adverse effect when optimal vectors with short optimization periods are used as initial perturbations for medium-range ensemble forecasts. The optimal vectors computed for 3 days or longer are different. In these vectors, the fastest growing initial perturbation has a horizontal structure similar to that of the leading LLV, and its major difference from the LLV, in the vertical structure, tends to disappear by the end of the optimization period. Initially, the optimal vectors are highly unbalanced and the rapid changes in their vertical structure are associated with geostrophic adjustment. The kinetic energy of the initial optimal vectors peaks in the lower troposphere, whereas in the LLV the maximum is around the jet level. During the integration the phase of the streamfunction held of the optimal vectors, with respect to their corresponding temperature field, is rapidly shifted 180 degrees. And, due to drastic changes that also rake place in the vertical temperature distribution, the maximum baroclinic shear shifts from the lower troposphere to just below the jet level. Just after initial rime, when the geostrophic adjustment dominates, the leading optimal vectors exhibit a growth rate significantly higher than that of the LLV. By the end of the period of optimization, however, the growth rate associated with the leading optimal vectors drops to or below the level of the Lyapunov exponent. The transient super-lyapunov growth associated with the leading optimal vectors is due to a one-time-only rapid rotation of the optimal vectors toward the leading LLVs. The nature of this rapid rotation depends on the length of the optimization period and the norm chosen, We speculate that the initial optimal vectors computed with commonly used norms may not be realizable perturbations in a dynamical system (that is not forced by random noise) since the leading optimal vectors are directions in the phase space from which perturbations are ''repelled''. By contrast, the leading LLV is the vector toward which all random perturbations, including the optimal vectors, are attracted, which gives the LLV a unique role in linear perturbation development.

AB Ecologists, conservation biologists and other natural historians increasingly recognize the need to become involved in public education. An ecologically literate public may be the 'last best hope' for a sustainable biosphere. Partnerships between ecologists and educators may be the best hope, though not the last, for moving towards an ecologically literate public. What are some practical schemes for such partnerships? We present a model for ecology education that has shown promise in several South American settings and describe its application in two quite different contexts in southern Argentina. We hope that our colleagues will ponder, criticize, modify, improve and apply the model in settings other than those we present here.

ID GRASSHOPPERS ORTHOPTERA; ACRIDIDAE; TILLAGE
AB Various forms of tow-input sustainable agriculture (LISA) are becoming more common in the Plains States, but little research has been conducted to evaluate the suitability of LISA fields for avian populations, except as nesting habitat. Because invertebrates are the primary food source of many grassland birds, we compared invertebrate biomass associated with LISA to that of conventionally farmed fields, grasslands, pastureland, and fallow fields. Sweepnets were used to collect invertebrate samples from twenty 1.5-ha plots at 2 locations in eastern Kansas. Invertebrates were sorted to order (Orthoptera and Hemiptera to family) and oven dried. Significantly higher biomasses (P < 0.05) of invertebrates were collected from LISA, fallow, grassland, and pastureland plots than from conventionally farmed fields. Invertebrate biomasses varied among different LISA treatments but few responses were significant because of limited replication of treatments and large variances. Two- to nine-fold differences in biomasses of Orthopteran and Hemipteran families were found among treatments. Incorporation of LISA into intensive habitat-management programs could be beneficial to avian species relying on invertebrates as a food source.

DE R&D; agriculture; researchers; financing; donors; Africa
AB Over the past three decades Africa's public agricultural research systems have changed in substantive ways. The total number of researchers increased fourfold, the dependency on expatriate researchers significantly declined, while the education levels of national researchers improved. Initially the growth in research staff was matched by growth in expenditures. But since the late 1970s, real research spending has stagnated. In addition, loans and grants from donor agencies now account for a sizeable share of total funding for many African agricultural research systems. Many of the developments of the past decade in personnel, expenditures, and sources of support for public sector research and development (R&D) in Africa are not sustainable. Spending per scientist has declined continuously during the past 30 years, most dramatically during the 1980s. Resources are spread increasingly thin over a growing group of researchers, which has negative effects on the efficiency and effectiveness of agricultural research in Africa.

ID POLICY
AB Zimbabwe epitomizes the contradictions driving the failure of state-directed agricultural development policies. In its second decade of independence, the government takes the credit for the country's agricultural and rural development success. Zimbabwe's ''Green Revolution'' record in Africa is enviable. Yet, this peasantry-led success story is problematic. It hides serious policy flaws in develop ment strategy, namely, lack of performance and waste characterizing the Model B producer cooperative resettlement projects. Individually and collectively, the cooperatives, the government's preferred mode of production, are a complete failure. Lessons for development programs elsewhere, and in emergent South Africa, in particular are clear. The political economy of government assistance is not sufficient to produce agricultural surpluses and sustainable development. The social economy of cooperation in production organization by Africa's traditional farmers also does not, necessarily, translate into modem cooperatives, as Zimbabwe's policy makers assumed. Producer cooperatives are unproductive because of the prevailing organizational culture which enables leading members to seek individual self-interest and private gain, making it hard for the rank and file to cooperate and work for the common good.

AB The influence of pH, carbon:nitrogen (C:N) ratio, carbon content and harvesting time on spore attributes of the biocontrol agent Trichoderma harzianum was evaluated. The effect of these culture parameters on viability, shelf-life and ultrastucture was also assessed. pH was a key parameter to manipulate for both growth and sporulation, while carbon concentration and C:N ratio strongly affected spore production time. At fixed pH, the C:N ratio had a limited influence on production yield, but was critical for spore shelf-life. The highest spore longevity was found in a medium with a C:N ratio of 14 and a pH of 7.0, when most resulting spores were still alive after 45 d storage. These spores also remained viable during storage under a broad range of relative humidities, indicating that they would be more sustainable in the field.

AB The Humber Estuary receives runoff from a fifth of the area of England, much of which is densely populated and industrialised. The river systems have been much altered by abstractions, effluent discharges, inter-river water transfers and changes to the physical habitat of channels. The riverine inputs of water, sediment and contaminants have a major influence on the environment of the Humber and the North Sea. Residual flow conditions are important for protecting uses of the rivers and the estuary. Some of the rivers have had a long history of pollution, although much investment in effluent treatment is in progress to improve water quality and ecology, and to achieve environmental quality standards for dangerous substances specified in international legislation. The aim is for a more sustainable management of the river systems, balancing the interests of their legitimate users. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB A series of mixed metal oxides of the compositions Ca1-xSrxTi1-xNiyO (x = 0-1.0, y = 0-1.0) were prepared by the citrate method, and was tested for the oxidation of CH4 to synthesis gas. Analytical results clearly showed the presence of Ca1-xSrxTi1-yNiyO perovskite structure, where Sr substituted all the Ca sites while Ni substituted the Ti sites in the range of y < 0.1. Among the catalysts tested, the compositions of x = y = 0.2 showed the highest activity. Either Ni species in the Ca0.8Sr0.2Ti1-yNiyO perovskite structure or NiO originally separated from the perovskite structure during the preparation was in situ reduced to Ni metal during the CH4 oxidation. The Ni metal thus formed showed high activity for synthesis gas production, where Ca0.8Sr0.2TiO3 perovskite has an important role as a carrier of the Ni catalyst.
   Three catalysts of the composition Ca0.8Sr0.2Ti1.0Ni0.2O were then prepared by citrate, impregnation and mixing methods. The highest activity was obtained with the citrate, followed by the impregnation of Ni on Ca0.8Sr0.2TiO3 perovskite. The catalyst prepared by the mixing method afforded no perovskite, resulting in low activity. The amount of coke formation over the Ni catalysts after the reaction for 150 h was as follows: citrate < impregnation much less than Ni/gamma-Al2O3 as the comparison. Ca0.8Sr0.2TiO3 perovskite was effective as the carrier of the Ni catalyst for the partial oxidation of CH4 to synthesis gas, Ni/Ca0.8Sr0.2TiO3 prepared by the citrate method is the most sustainable against coke formation during the reaction. It is likely that the citrate method gave high Ni dispersion over the perovskite as well as strong metal-support interaction between Ni and the perovskite, resulting in both high activity and high sustainability against coke formation.

TI Potential collapse of North Sea cod stocks
SO NATURE
LA English
DT Article
ID FISHERIES
AB In common with many fish stocks in the North Sea, cod are heavily exploited with as much as 60% of the fishable stock being removed annually(1). The International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES), which advises fishery managers on the state of fish stocks in the northeast Atlantic, has recommended that exploitation rates be reduced considerably and immediately, in order to prevent further stock decline(1). We examine the most recent ICES assessment of the North Sea cod stock(1) to see if the present exploitation regimen is sustainable. Our analysis suggests that not only is the present exploitation rate unsustainable, but that even regimens dose to the maximum sustainable yield may be potentially prone to risk. There is a need for swift and effective action to protect the stock and avoid the problems of the much publicized collapse of cod stocks off the coast of Atlantic Canada(2,3).

TI Land use planning and national soils policies
SO AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article
AB Land is used for many purposes. It is also the focus of conflict between a wide range of land uses including agriculture, mining, forestry and nature protection, leisure, and urban and industrial development. Competition between users grows more under increasing population pressure and in countries with a mixed economy. Decision making an land use options is therefore a current problem of modern societies. Adequate planning and decision making about land use is facilitated by a national soils policy framework. This is a set of guidelines, aimed at ensuring a sustainable utilization of the land-either for agricultural or non-agricultural uses-and limiting direct or indirect damage to the environment. The policy is integrated into a national development plan, and addresses the natural diversity and specific physical and socio-economic problems of the region concerned. National soils policies are therefore very country-specific, they rely on clearly defined long-term objectives and involve strategies and tools for implementation. A number of examples are given to illustrate the most relevant issues in national soils policies. Copyright (C) 1996 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd

AB This paper examines the characteristics of successful, locally-sponsored development of irrigated agriculture in the Sahel, through the presentation of a detailed case study. Particular attention is given to physical and organizational characteristics, and the historical development of an indigenous channel network which was designed to convey water from a natural lake to multiple users. Given certain economic and environmental conditions, it was found that necessary local resources could be mobilized for irrigation development and maintenance, independent of outside support from the national government and development agencies. It was also found that local communities were able to establish functional organizational structures necessary for the management of a shared irrigation water distribution system. Lessons derived from this case study could facilitate the development of more sustainable and autonomous irrigation systems in the region.

   agriculture history; nutrient cycling; nitrogen limitation
ID 17TH-CENTURY ORGANIC AGRICULTURE; JIAXING REGION
AB Traditional agriculture in China's Tai Lake Region sustained high productivity for more than nine centuries. This article examines the ecological basis for this high long-term productivity in a historical context, with a focus on the role of nutrient limitation. From 1000 AD to the 1950s, agricultural technology remained basically unchanged, as did the yields of rice; wheat and other crops. Still, total grain production and net farm income increased over time, as a result of increased multiple cropping, expanded mulberry/silk production, and the intensified use of organic fertilizers. Without degrading soil resources, continuous intensive farm management supported the nutritional and other needs of the rural population, which grew to nearly ten people per hectare of cultivated land by the 1930s. Ecological limitations to human carrying capacity that seem apparent in the mid 1800s appear to have been overcome since the 1960s by chemical nitrogen subsidy of agroecosystems. Human populations are now nearly twice their traditional maximum, and the region remains one of the world's most productive agricultural regions thanks in part to heavy fertilizer applications that have changed nitrogen from a limiting nutrient to a potential source of pollution. Whether these high inputs and/or other agricultural technologies will continue to sustain food self-sufficiency for the region's farmers remains to be seen. The high long-term productivity of Tai Lake Region agroecosystems make them ideal for study of the ecological basis for sustainable agriculture.

Using data gathered from their research project on sustainability, the authors show that attention by organizational members to meaningful cues embedded in terminology, expressions, and stories undermines existing institutional logics operating in firms and helps establish newer ones.

ID CANCER
AB We assessed the effects of an organised cervical screening program, using a population-based cervical cytology register, for Aboriginal women in the Fitzroy Valley, a remote part of the Kimberley region of Western Australia. Comparison of age-specific screening rates in the area during 1987-88, 1990-92 and 1993-94 showed that establishing the program in late 1989 was accompanied by dramatic increases in cervical screening rates, ranging from two- to over fourfold, with the largest increases in women aged 50 years and over. Following the departure of the coordinator in early 1993, screening rates decreased to between 76 per cent and 29 per cent of their 1990-92 levels, with the largest decreases occurring in the 40-49 and 60-69 years age groups. Rates were still above 1987-88 levels for most age groups. Of 545 women screened during 1991-92, 65 per cent had undergone a second Pap smear within the follow-up period of two to four years. Among women recommended for a repeat smear in two years, the probability of having a second smear was negatively associated with age (log-rank statistic = 35.58, 4 df, P < 0.0001). Follow-up of smears recommended for repeat in 12 months or earlier was less adequate in 1993-94 (46 per cent) than in 1991-92 (75 per cent). The program was successful in recruiting a large proportion of eligible women within a relatively short time, but coverage, especially of older women, was not sustained after a decline in the functioning of the recall system owing to staffing and organisational changes.

AB Domestic livestock in Nepal belong to 17 species, including five Bovidae (and interspecific hybrids of two of them), seven Aves, two Equidae (not including mules), pig (Sus scrofa), rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) and elephant (Loxodonta africana). Cattle (Bos taurus and Bos indicus) are the most numerous quadruped, followed by goats (Capra hircus), buffalo (Bulbalus bubalis) and sheep (Ovis ai ies). Domestic fowl (Gallus domesticus) are the most common poultry, followed by pigeons (Columba livia) and ducks (Anas platyrhyncos). Government policy is to upgrade and replace local types with improved stock. This policy has had limited success through lack of funding, inconsistent long-term objectives and an inability to pursue programmes in traditional farming systems. The purity of native types is being lost in some areas due to informal programmes by farmers themselves. Except for one type of goat there are no conservation programmes for native breeds. Wild relatives of livestock, including arnee (Bulbalus arnee), gaur (Bibos gaurus), wild boar (Sus scrofa), jungle fowl (Gallus gallus) and rock dove (Columba livia), are being infiltrated by genes of domestic animals. Little has been done to characterize Nepal's livestock resources yet continuous attempts have been made to replace them. Conservation needs are to: (i) identify all genetic resources comprising the gene pool of species used as domestic livestock; (ii) develop and use the associated diversity to increase production, achieve sustainable systems and meet demands for particular products; (iii) monitor resources represented by small numbers or that are being displaced; and (iv) preserve resources not in current demand. A start has been made on this by Nepal's membership of a regional network.

   Lake Malawi
AB Most of Malawi's popular food-fish species are in decline. The fishers attribute this decline to overfishing, changes in climate, inadequate fishing technology and supernatural powers. Sedimentation of the lake and rivers due to poor agricultural practices, which can also be implicated in the demise of Malawi's fisheries, was not recognized by the fishers. This study tested and confirmed that the fishers would readily switch to exploiting ornamental fish (Mbuna) for subsistence and cash if the more favoured food-fish species continued to dwindle. However, as most of the Mbuna species are localized to specific rocky habitats and are endemic to certain parts of the lake, they may be vulnerable to overfishing. To safeguard Lake Malawi's rich fish species diversity: (i) alternative economic opportunities for the lakeshore people should be identified, evaluated and promoted to alleviate the fishing pressure, (ii) the Department of Fisheries should collaborate with local fishermen in promoting sustainable fish utilization, e.g., through public campaigns aimed at sensitizing fishermen on the status of the fisheries and the vulnerability of some fish communities to overfishing and environmental degradation, and (iii) the degree of Mbuna exploitation, now that the popular food fishes are in decline, should be monitored and, where necessary, regulated to promote sustainability.

AB The documented population of the rare and endangered endemic Vanuatu palm, Carpoxylon macrospermum H. Wendl. & Drude (Arecaceae), comprises 154 reproductively mature individuals, and progressively larger numbers of associated juveniles and seedlings, scattered throughout nine islands of the Vanuatu archipelago. Of the total, only 32 mature individuals occur naturally on three islands - Aneityum, Futuna and Tanna - in the south of the archipelago. The remainder of the population are cultivated, primarily as single individuals, in village situations where the palm has varying degrees of traditional importance. The species is most often a subcanopy to emergent element in rainforest where it forms scattered small colonies. Preferred habitat appears to be moist lowland forest on high-fertility soils, in microclimates where drainage may be impeded or where high soil moisture levels are permanently maintained. Genetic variation within the population was determined by random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis. Only at two sites - Lown'ock and Yeruareng on Tanna - of the 26 sampled in total (of which 19 provided usable embryos), was there any significant variation detected. This result indicates that whatever variation there is will be found in the natural populations and that most cultivated plants are apparently derived from a limited number of trees. For practical conservation purposes and to maintain maximum genetic variation within the existing and future populations, propagating materials will need to be collected from these two sites plus any one of the other sites. In reference to population sustainability, the number of mature individuals in the known population is extremely small, and therefore the species is presently under considerable threat from land clearance, habitat degradation and genetic erosion induced by isolation and declining numbers.

AB PROBLEM Integrating residents into community family practices can be challenging for busy doctors, especially when new preceptors have no formal preparation or teaching experience.
   OBJECTIVE OF PROGRAM To develop an organized and practical approach to teaching residents in our busy rural group practice. Our seven northern Ontario family doctors have been training elective residents and clerks for 15 years. Recently, we have gone from hosting elective residents and students to teaching core family medicine residents. Our precepting plan allows us to dedicate a reasonable time to teaching while fulfilling our primary care duties
   MAIN COMPONENTS The program involves contracting, teaching monitoring, feedback, and evaluation.
   CONCLUSION We think we have developed a sustainable, workable set of teaching parameters that is applicable by various preceptors in different settings. It has simplified our teaching role and lessened our anxieties. Residents have benefited from the consistent protocol, which can be flexible enough to adapt to individual residents and preceptors, and have valued this teaching approach.

AB A procedure is shown, using the leopard shark (Triakis semifasciata) as an example, for obtaining estimates of a population's intrinsic rate of increase (r) that depends on the level of total mortality borne. The method uses age at female maturity, maximum reproductive age, and average fecundity and incorporates concepts of density dependence from standard fisheries population modelling. An estimate of the leopard shark's r value at the population size producing maximum sustainable yield was thus obtained and then extended to adjust estimates of its yield per recruit for the effects of recruitment reduction under fishing pressure. The results indicate that this shark may be more susceptible to overexploitation than previously thought. This procedure is shown to be capable of returning r values for the leopard and five other species of sharks that compare favorably with published values obtained by the more standard life table method. It should prove useful for assessing the status of populations for which few data exist.

TI Fishers' individual salmon harvesting rights: An option for Canada's
   Pacific Fisheries
SO CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES
LA English
DT Article
ID BRITISH-COLUMBIA; MANAGEMENT
AB Canada's Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus) fisheries are again in a crisis of declining stocks, excess fishing effort, and poor returns. Changes in fisheries management that may help resolve some of these problems include licence buy-backs, individual transferable quotas, additional effort controls, single-gear licensing, and area licensing or combinations thereof. This paper proposes an alternative: fishers' individual salmon harvesting rights, which provide fishers with rights to bid for the privilege of participating in salmon fishing openings. Fishers' individual salmon harvesting rights have the potential to rationalize the salmon fleets and control excessive fishing effort and thus help ensure the sustainability of the resource and viability of the industry.

AB The focus of the present Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement between Canada and the United States is on transboundary pollution and particularly the injury to health and property from exposures to persistent toxic substances. Several scientists and policy advisors have suggested, on the basis of the Ecosystem Approach and systems theory, that the agenda should move on to other demanding topics, such as the introduction of exotic species, biodiversity, habitat restoration, fisheries management, sustainable development, and governance of the Great Lakes basin. None of these issues, however, poses the same scale of threat to national sovereignty and bilateral interests as does transboundary pollution. Thus, none warrants the degree of attention that has been and should be paid, despite declining budgets, to assessing and controlling releases of persistent toxic substances that continue to injure fish, wildlife, and human health. Instead, it is recommended that other existing institutions and treaties, such as the several commissions in the Great Lakes basin, as well as local, state, and provincial governments, should address these other pressing issues through the development of other bilateral or multilateral agreements and improved institutional arrangements.

AB Neither the classic resource management concept of maximum sustainable yield nor the concept of sustainable development are useful to contemporary, nonanthropocentric, ecologically informed conservation biology. As an alternative, we advance an ecological definition of sustainability, that is in better accord with biological conservation: meeting human needs without compromising the health of ecosystems. In addition to familiar benefit-cost constraints on human economic activity, we urge adding ecologic constraints. Projects are not choice-worthy if they compromise the health of the ecosystems in which human economic systems are embedded. Sustainability, so defined, is proffered as an approach to conservation that would complement wildlands preservations for ecological integrity, not substitute for wildlands preservations.

TI Conservation implications of patterns of horn regeneration in dehorned
   white rhinos
SO CONSERVATION BIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID AFRICAN
AB The demand for rhino horn has led to drastic declines in numbers of rhinos in Asia and Africa. Although all trade in rhino products has been illegal since the mid-1970s, a lucrative illegal market flourishes and poaching continues. Horn removal from African rhinos has been conducted in Zimbabwe, Namibia, and Swaziland to deter poaching. Regeneration of horns following dehorning has created the potential for a sustainable harvest of rhino horn through dehorning programs Establishment of a regulated legal market for rhino horn has been suggested to help fund rhino conservation programs in African countries. However, evaluation of an economic harvest of rhino horn from dehorning programs has been limited because few data on rates and form of horn regeneration exist. Because rate of horn regeneration will determine the interval at which rhino horns could be harvested profitably, we measured horn regrowth for two white rhino (Ceratotherium simum) populations studied in Zimbabwe between 1991-1995. Measurements of horn sizes were collected before and after dehorning, and mass to volume relationships were calculated. Von Bertalanffy growth curves were used to model horn size and rates of horn regrowth relative to age. Adult males had larger horn bases (p < 0.001) and fastel rates of horn regrowth than adult females. Regenerated horn mass for adult males (>1.3 kg/yr) was almost twice the mass of adult females. Based on an economic model for profit maximization, intervals for dehorning range from 1.16 to 1.51 years and vary with both sex and age. We suggest managers use these values as minimum dehorning intervals to balance profits with long-term management goals. Rates of horn regeneration are likely to be less important than law enforcement in determing the efficacy of dehorning as a deterrent to rhino poaching.

AB Wildfires and alien grass invasion threaten dry tropical forests throughout Central America. Efforts to preserve and restore these forests will require a better understanding of how conversion to grassland changes key belowground processes and organisms such as soil organic matter, nutrient cycling, and mycorrhizae. We studied forest, edge, and grassland soils from five 60-m transects perpendicular to abrupt forest-grassland boundaries in Guanacaste Province, Costa Rica. Nutrient concentrations, N mineralization dynamics, and mycorrhizal fungal communities were compared across vegetation type (forest, edge, and grassland). The dynamics of N mineralization were measured in year-long laboratory incubations, and the diversity of mycorrhizal fungal communities was assessed from populations of soil-borne spores. Soil C, N, and K were lower, while many base cations and micronutrients were higher in grassland plots than in forest plots. Although differences in the quantity of total soil C and N occurred mainly in the forest-to-edge transition, differences in the quality of soil organic matter, as reflected by soil C:N ratios and mineralization rates, occurred in the edge-to-grassland transition. Beta diversity of mycorrhizal spore communities (measured by Sorenson's similarity index) was lower in the grassland plots than in the forest plots, indicating that grass invasion had caused some convergence. However, total spore density and alpha diversity of mycorrhizal spore communities (measured by species richness and Simpson's diversity index) were not altered by wildfires and grass invasion. These results suggest that persistence and regeneration of forest plant species in the grasslands may not be constrained to a significant degree by the lack of mycorrhizal symbionts. These grasslands appear to be sustainable, alternative stable states for these areas. Positive feedbacks between the alien grassland vegetation and both fire and nutrient cycling maintain and reinforce this alternative state.

AB We have successfully released phytophagous Willamette mites into Zinfandel vineyards that have had chronic problems with the economically more damaging Pacific spider mites. These releases induced resistance in the grapevines, causing smaller populations of Pacific mites and higher berry sugar concentrations. This study addresses the sustainability of our techniques. We define a sustainable technique as one that (1) is effective, (2) requires low inputs of resources, (3) is self-perpetuating, (4) produces minimal pollution, (5) produces minimal effects on non-target organisms, and (6) is compatible with other agronomic practices. Most of these criteria are met by our inoculation techniques; here we seek to determine the persistence of Willamette mites from one season to the next, and to evaluate effects of several commonly used agronomic practices on our vaccinations.
   Our data suggest that Willamette mites can be introduced a single time into a vineyard; they will reduce populations of Pacific mites and persist from year to year in the absence of miticides or other disruptions. We observed Willamette mites overwintering commonly on the grapevines and on box elder (Acer negundo) foliage adjacent to vineyards. Pacific mites were not observed overwintering in vineyards, and we surmise that they generally blow into vineyards during each growing season. We did not observe Willamette mites overwintering on cover crops although other phytophagous mites and predatory mites were found. In preliminary observations, we found no strong effects (positive or negative) associated with cover-cropping in terms of mite management.
   Vineyards with Pacific mites are often treated with miticides, either dicofol or propargite. We found that dicofol (but not propargite) was extremely disruptive to mite populations; after an initial kill, applications of dicofol were consistently associated with resurgences of mites that exceeded numbers found in unsprayed controls.
   Unlike applications of miticides, introductions of Willamette mites to control Pacific mites satisfy our criteria for sustainable agriculture. Here we demonstrated that they are self-perpetuating at low numbers from one season to the next. Furthermore, releasing Willamette mites for control of Pacific mites is compatible with some, but not all, management practices.

AB Issues related to data preservation and sharing are receiving increased attention from scientific societies, funding agencies, and the broad scientific community. Ecologists, for example, are increasingly using data collected by other scientists to address questions at broader spatial, temporal, and thematic scales (e.g., global change, biodiversity, sustainability). No data set is perfect and self-explanatory. Ecologists must, therefore, rely upon a set of instructions or documentation to acquire a specific data set, determine its suitability for meeting specific research objectives, and accurately interpret results from subsequent processing, analysis, and modeling.
   ''Metadata'' represent the set of instructions or documentation that describe the content, context, quality, structure, and accessibility of a data set. Although geospatial metadata standards have been developed and widely endorsed by the geographical science community, such standards do not yet exist for the ecological sciences. In this paper, we examine potential benefits and costs associated with developing and implementing metadata for nongeospatial ecological data. We present a set of generic metadata descriptors that could serve as the basis for a ''metadata standard'' for nongeospatial ecological data. Alternative strategies for metadata implementation that meet differing organizational or investigator-specific objectives are presented. Finally, we conclude with several recommendations related to future development and implementation of ecological metadata.

AB Production is commonly described as the root of wealth creation, growth and progress. Mainline production theory ascribes this wealth generating ability to a limited number of inputs transformed into equally narrowly defined goods and services. Output which is not part of the official economy's market exchange, or inputs not employed in their production process remain external and unaccounted for. Many of these unaccounted for goods and inputs are provided in households, gardens, subsistence production, or ecological and biophysical systems through the 'free' services of women or nature. Thus an alternative view of production is suggested, one which views production itself as linked to the social and bio-physical contexts within which it takes place. This context first makes the generation of input streams, the receiving of output streams and the processing of inputs by means of fund factors (Georgescu-Roegen) possible. As production is contextualized it becomes evident that processes which sustain input generation, waste absorption and material transformation are critical to the production process. These are referred to as sustaining services. A sustaining production process is one which maintains sustaining services instead of destroying them. It is further argued that steps toward the implementation of a sustaining production concept require a move from abstraction to material concreteness. Three areas of concreteness are discussed as moving from solely monetary to physical valuation criteria, moving from methodological homogeneity to diversity, and moving from a mystified and distanced decision making process about quantity and quality of production to one of informed, participatory discourse.

ID SUSTAINABILITY; EQUITY
AB Speaking from the margins, ecofeminist analysis exposes many of the assumptions of neoclassical economics as gender biased and as anti-ecological. It identifies the abstract individual of neoclassical economics as a privileged male individual whose apparent 'autonomy' is predicated on the oppression of women, marginal people and nature. Thus ecofeminists tell a different story about economic man - from the grounds of others' experience up. Ecofeminism points to the limits of models of sustainability built on extending market rationality to non-market spheres of life. Ecofeminist economics contains a creative tension between a commitment to social justice and a determination not to colonize the wild.

TI Economic policy for full employment: Proposals for Germany
SO ECONOMIC AND INDUSTRIAL DEMOCRACY
LA English
DT Article
AB Since the mid-1970s, Germany has suffered high unemployment levels. In 1996, there was a shortfall of 6-7 million jobs. Unemployment, which means a loss of production, and is the main cause of poverty and the fiscal crisis, has been exacerbated by reunification and by recent corporate and government strategy. This subordinates all social goals to that of international competitiveness, with downsizing and unemployment used to hold down workers' wages, social benefits, rights and aspirations. The article argues that any alternative economic policy for full employment, more social security, ecological sustainability and economic democracy must, therefore, be based on large-scale public investment, an expanded public sector, reduced working hours and a targeted labour market policy. This would be mostly self-financing and could be defended against a hostile economic environment but would require major changes in the distribution of income and power. The Maastricht Treaty presents new but not insurmountable obstacles.

   exercise
SO ECONOMICA
LA English
DT Article
ID UNEMPLOYMENT; INFLATION; CURVE
AB This paper, which examines Phillips's famous curve, is based on Phillips's private papers, and the London School of Economics Methodology, Measurement and Testing Seminar records (sources previously thought to be lost). These sources, plus Phillips's theoretical work, suggest that the equilibrium 'menu of choice' is a misinterpretation of Phillips's dynamic stabilization exercise. Phillips had a clearly articulated role for inflationary expectations in his model, and had no toleration for the notion that ongoing inflation could purchase sustainable reductions in the rate of unemployment. Evidence is cited which indicates that Milton Friedman was profoundly influenced by Phillips's analysis of inflationary expectations.

AB In previous issues of Economy and Society, Somerville and Durham debated the moralization of nec-liberal family policy. The conservative politics of the family has been moralized not only in Anglo-American societies but also in South Korea. From a neo-Confucian perspective, many conservative politicians and even scholars have found a convenient scapegoat in the nuclear family as the main cause of many recent social problems, in particular, widespread poverty and psychological difficulties among the elderly and children. In a situation where public services and social security programmes have been neglected For decades of growth-oriented developmentalism, conservative elites seem to derive a convenient excuse in the functionalist proposition that family nucleation nourishes individualism at the cost of traditional familial solidarity, and thus causes the alienation and abandonment of many dependent people. This paper refutes the neo-Confucian/liberal claim by showing that the thesis of family nucleation is untenable not only from a demographic but also from a sociocultural and economic perspective. This neo-Confucian society will be no exception to the need for a comprehensive package of public services and social security programmes if its industrial capitalism is to remain socially sustainable.

DT Article
AB This paper deals with sustainable energy technologies under restrictions on resources and environmental impact. We have developed a database to estimate life-cycle efficiencies and greenhouse gas emissions. Next, we define sustainability limitations on resource depletion and emissions. Based on these concepts, the present world energy system is judged to be unsustainable. Mitigation measures such as disposal of CO2 and solar power generation are evaluated utilizing the concept. We show how sustainability influences the cost-effectiveness of measures taken. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd.

DE energy efficiency; economic efficiency; New Zealand electricity sector
AB In this article, I review the diverse commentaries on New Zealand's ongoing electricity sector reform process, within the context of the government's energy policy objective, In doing so, my purpose is to highlight the interactions between the concepts of energy efficiency and economic efficiency In particular, I ask: how do the various commentators on reform define these concepts; what indicators do. they use to measure them; and, what level of each do they prescribe as appropriate? My main objective is not to decide whether any commentator is 'right' or 'wrong', Rather, I seek to identify the distinct 'world views', or 'paradigms', underlying the commentaries with respect to both energy efficiency and economic efficiency, I conclude that economic efficiency is consistent with a 'supply side paradigm', valuing economic growth, whereas those who value energy efficiency over economic efficiency subscribe to a (demand side paradigm', recognizing the limits to growth, Such a paradigm derives from the ethic of sustainability. I close by posing the (as yet unanswered) question: are these paradigms mutually exclusive? (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB A normative structure for the European electricity industry is discussed, This model builds upon proposals and experiences in several European nations (in particular the Netherlands and the UK), Two rivalling structures (vertical integration versus open competition) are compared, Our 'open structure' is specific in not allowing TPA (third party access) to the grid, and in making the necessary distinction among 'independent generators' and Independent Generators of Own Power IGOPS. Cost economies (scale, scope and density) are related to the three major functions of a power system (generation, transport, distribution), The performance of the rival models is assessed for five criteria: sustainability, economic efficiency, regulatory efficiency, equity, and institutional feasibility.

SO ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB The challenges of urban growth for mega-cities in Asia, now and over the next few decades, are examined with particular reference to the ability or inability of those in charge of cities, elected officials and administrators, to provide for the legitimate demands of citizens. Issues such as population growth, industrialization, urbanization, financing, employment, health care, social services, public safety, transportation, water supply, waste disposal, and cultural and recreational facilities are included. While sustainable development of cities is advocated strongly by environmentalists and administrators, the past history of urban growth is quite often the opposite. Why? This paper examines the severe constraints that urban developments are subjected to, and might be possible to change in order to create a better future, with particular emphasis on Asia. Finally, the important contributions made by environmental scientists and engineers towards more sustainable development are placed in context with the reality of urban growth.

AB The widespread prevalence of micronutrient deficiency is a major cause of poor human health in many developing countries of Asia. Integrating micronutrient-rich foods such as vegetables, fruits and livestock products into diets is the most practical and sustainable way to alleviate micronutrient deficiency. Vegetables are efficient sources of several important micronutrients, both with respect to unit cost of production and per unit of land area. However, vegetable consumption in most Asian countries is far below the level required to meet the micronutrient requirements. This is further aggravated by seasonal and annual fluctuations in vegetable production and consumption. The per capita consumption of vegetables has stagnated at low levels in most Asian countries, and real vegetable prices are on the increase. Policies to ameliorate micronutrient deficiency include reduction in the relative prices of vegetables, increase in income, enhancement of micronutrient contents in vegetables, generating awareness among consumers about the role of vegetables in human health, improvement in vegetable cooking and processing methods and improvement in the gestropolitics of micronutrient distribution. Enhancing vegetable supplies through low-cost production and marketing technology, and advance vegetable cooking and processing methods coupled with educational programs to promote a balanced diet is considered the most efficient strategy to solve the problem of mineral and vitamin deficiency, along with an increased food and income security, new jobs, food diversity, and enhanced sustainability of agricultural production systems that results from the diversification of these systems. Such efforts should not be targeted at a single vegetable or single micronutrient, but rather to enhance overall vegetable supplies, especially during the lean supply period, as well as to increase their diversity usually demanded by consumers when they start consuming more vegetables.

SO FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT

DE bottomland hardwood; timber harvesting; wet site
AB Environmentally acceptable and economical forest operations are needed for sustainable management of forest resources. Improved methods for harvesting and transporting timber are especially needed for wet sites. As the demand for hardwood lumber continues to increase, improved and alternative methods are needed to ensure acceptance of timber harvesting for the wet site conditions that are typical of bottomland hardwoods. Some alternative technological developments include grapple saw feller-bunchers, wide tires, larger forwarders, clambunk skidders, two-stage hauling, mats, cable systems, helicopters and towed vehicles and air-cushioned vehicles. These developments have the potential to improve the performance of the harvesting system and to reduce the negative effects of conventional operations on conventional sites and on difficult sites such as wet areas. Although many of these new alternatives are now operational, others are just concepts or evolving prototypes. More research is still needed to optimize these alternative technologies and to reduce costs associated with their implementation.

AB Sustainable management of bottomland hardwood forest ecosystems requires a knowledge of responses to management impacts, including timber harvesting. The effects of clearcutting and partial cutting on woody vegetation regeneration dynamics, surface and groundwater quality, soil physical properties, and soil respiration were tested in a bottomland hardwood ecosystem in southeastern Texas, USA, through comparison with non-cut control areas. Overstory removal only slightly affected composition of woody vegetation regeneration 1 year after harvesting compared with pre-harvest composition. Initial composition in both cutting treatments appeared to be the strongest determinant of post-harvest composition, at least for the first year after harvesting. There were few significant differences in groundwater properties when harvesting treatments were compared with control areas during a 17-month period following harvest. Turbidity, temperature, electrical conductivity, dissolved O-2, NH4-N, NO3-N, and PO4-P of streamwater did not vary significantly among treatments. Slight decreases in total and macroporosity were observed in association with higher bulk densities at 0-5 cm depth in the clearcut and partial cut treatments. Saturated hydraulic conductivity values did not decline significantly with treatment intensity. No significant differences among treatments in measured soil physical properties were observed at 5-10 cm depth. Although in situ soil respiration increased with harvest intensity, treatment had no significant effect on mineral soil respiration. In summary, most variables showed only slight response to harvesting, thereby indicating that harvesting practices can be conducted with minimal initial impacts on measured response variables.

ID WOODY MATERIAL
AB Dead wood belongs to the characteristic elements determining the structure of virgin beech forests. The present study aims at developing a concept for the cultivation and generation of dead wood in sustainably managed beech forests. As a first step a random test is carried out to quantify the dead wood of eleven beech forests aged between 133 and 193 years. The forests subject eo this study appear to have an average share of 9.3 fm/ha of dead wood, of which 95% are recumbent and only about 5% erect. It is impossible, though, to classify the distribution of dead wood without applying qualitative parameters as well. Therefore, as a second step, three different categories are established to differentiate between a) dead wood caused by forest management and bi dead wood primarily resulting from natural processes. Only an average of 17.2% of the dead Rood located in the investigated forests (1.6 fm/ha) may be classified as ''ecologically particularly important'' (category III). The low share of category III in the total volume of dead wood suggests that the natural generation of dead wood is severely affected by forest management. Additionally, the prospects of the future generation of dead wood are outlined by classifying living trees with respect to vitality (introduction of vitality classes, step 3).

AB Based on the complex of ecological soil parameters (E(h) and pH values, K+, Ca2+, NO3- activity in soil liquid phase (SLP) measured in situ with ion-selective electrodes) an attempt is made to assess changes in these parameters in different soils in agrocenoses (agricultural ecosystems) from their pristine analogues and to find the direction of the recent processes of soil formation. The relative degree of anthropogenic changes in physical and chemical properties of agricultural soils is: chernozem, 1; chestnut soil, 7; gray forest soil, 8; podzol, 12. The analysis of the suite of dynamic attributes show that during cultivation the processes of soil formation result in different types of soil agrocenoses, whose properties and ecological role (excluding chernozems) do not correspond to those of their pristine analogues.

AB Since 1989 Vietnam has been undergoing a process of re-engagement with the world economy. This liberalization process (doi moi) has been heavily concentrated on the two main cities of Vietnam, Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City and despite the Vietnamese being eager to avoid the creation of another Bangkok, with all of its environmental and social problems, the sustainability of the present urban-based economic growth is under threat. In many ways, this threat is disguised by inadequacies in the data base on urban population, which has in turn led to an official underestimation of the extent of some of the social and economic problems being faced by individual households. This paper examines the nature of this growth and contends that the present size of Ho Chi Minh City and Hanoi are much greater than official figures suggest. II then goes on to review the situation with regard to urban poverty, basic needs and the environment to illustrate the extent to which this unacknowledged growth is not only threatening the sustained expansion of those cities, but also the sustainability of the economic growth on which the country is so reliant.

AB The Badiat ash-Sham is discussed in terms of its inherent capacities by local users. These are predicated on the variations within the region, the climatic factors, its seasonal possibilities, and its long-term resilience. Herding is often seen as destructive, but herders see themselves as actively managing natural resources in a sustainable manner in the long-term. Varying market factors have had relevance to management. The historical depth of herding in the area is taken into consideration in the discussion. (C) 1997 Academic Press Limited.

TI The environment and welfare implications of trade and tax policy
SO JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT ECONOMICS

DT Article
AB Developing countries with comparative advantage in dirty industries face the risk of environmental degradation unless appropriate policies are implemented. Using applied general equilibrium analysis, we examine how trade influences the environment and assess the welfare and environmental implications of alternative pollution abatement policies for Indonesia. Our results indicate that unilateral trade liberalization by Indonesia would increase the ratio of emission levels to real output for almost all major pollution categories. More importantly, when tariff removal is combined with a cost-effective tax policy, the twin objectives of welfare enhancement and environmental quality improvement appear to be feasible. This sheds new and positive light on the role of trade in sustainable development.

AB Studies were conducted on celery plantings in 1992 and 1993 (experimental plantings) and 1995 (commercial field) that compared the benefit of current chemical standard pesticide practices with an integrated pest management (IPM) program based on B. thuringiensis. In experimental plantings at a field station, the chemical standard treatment consisted of 9 applications of methomyl and permethrin. The IPM program used 3 or 4 applications of B, thuringiensis, the need for which was determined by sampling insect populations for established thresholds. Each control program was evaluated for yield, crop value, and cost of the control strategies. A partial budget was constructed that determined net profits for all treatments. Both he chemical standard and IPM treatments reduced pest populations and damage, resulting in better yield and net profits as compared with the control treatment. The reduced input costs of the IPM program resulted in better economic returns in both years. In 1992, net profits were higher by $1,485/ha. In 1993, when celery prices were lower, net profits with the IPM program were higher by $614/ha. The program was validated in 1995 on a commercial celery operation in Ventura County California. The IPM program generated a net profit more than $410/ha higher than that of the grower's chemical program. Because reduced potential for insecticide resistance in the IPM program was not accounted for in the economic analysis, and the validation trials were conducted on a progressive operation using approximate to 40% fewer pesticides than most celery producers, the results of the economic analyses are conservative.

DE allocation schemes; game theory allocations; drainage water pollution;
   San Joaquin Valley
ID IRRIGATION; GAME
AB This paper evaluates schemes for allocation of joint environmental control cost among polluters using, as an example, the drainage pollution problem of the San Joaquin Valley of California. The analysis is conducted by comparing cost allocation schemes' performance in a regional context. Different schemes (proportional allocation, Nash-Harsanyi, allocation according to marginal cost, Shapley, the nucleolus and the Separable Cost Remaining Benefit principle) are used to allocate regional joint environmental control costs under two extreme states of nature scenarios, resulting in different pollution flows. The results provide clear empirical evidence that regional arrangements may vary with state of nature. Another important result is that the different allocation schemes have different outcomes in terms of their acceptability to the players, and in terms of their derived stability, as measured by the Shapley-Shubik Power Index, and by the Propensity to Disrupt. Therefore, implementation of environmental policy should also be examined based on its long-term sustainability, and taking into consideration only the cost recovery aspect.

SO JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY ECONOMICS

DT Article
DE limit cycles; intertemporal optimisation; externality
ID ENDOGENOUS GROWTH; MODELS; INDETERMINACY
AB This paper considers low dimensional (more precisely, one state variable) dynamic optimisation problems of competitive agents. These individual decisions lead to a dynamic externality for the evolution of the system. However, the impact of an individual and competitive agent is negligible and thus each agent considers this evolution as exogenous data. This leads, assuming rational expectations (perfect foresight due to the deterministic set up), to motions in the three dimensional space of state, costate and externality. Considering the fact that such externalities are widespread, e.g., R&D in the literature on new growth theory, pollution in environmental economics, etc., the incorporation of such externalities due to competitive markets is important, yet this incorporation may alter the stability of the system. Indeed, complex policies such as stable limit cycles are sustainable in such a low-dimensional economy, even for a separable and strictly concave model.

AB Organization of national immunization days (NIDs) in all countries in Latin America in which polio was endemic has been one of the key elements that led to the interruption of the circulation of the wild poliovirus in 1991 from the Americas. National initiatives for control or elimination of measles using similar strategies have emerged from the successful organization of NIDs for polio eradication and lead the way to the eventual global eradication of this major killer of children. The major reasons for the success of polio eradication in the Americas were the commitment of national authorities, well-defined strategies, sustainable effort, and the participation of ail sectors of society.

ID COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE; MOMENTS ESTIMATORS; GENERALIZED-METHOD; MARKET
   SHARE; MODELS
AB The authors study the impact of time-based product development on sustainable market share gains in a high-technology computer component industry. Three dominant firms, with international new product development and manufacturing facilities, have introduced more than 200 new products into this fast-cycle market in a five-year period. The authors systematically examine the leads and lags at critical stages of the product development process: concept generation, prototype completion, and volume production. Their main finding is that lead-time advantage affects market share positively, albeit differentially, at each stage. The benefit of lead-time gain is greatest at the volume production stage, followed by the concept generation stage. The authors also develop a new notion of lead-time threshold-a time period in which if a competitor catches up, no market share gain is achieved by the firm that introduces the product first. They endogenously estimate the magnitude of the threshold for each stage of the product development process, observing that a significant threshold is present at both the concept generation and volume production stages. Finally, the structure of the development process, which differs across the firms in the market, affords significant differential ability to catch up with competitors.

TI Materials for guitar back plates made from sustainable forest resources
SO JOURNAL OF THE ACOUSTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA
LA English
DT Article
ID ACOUSTIC PROPERTIES; CHEMICAL TREATMENT; WOOD
AB A new type of wood-based material for guitar back plates as a substitute for Brazilian rosewood was produced based on Japanese cedar logs with a small diameter, of which the utilization is limited despite its availability. The sapwood portion of logs with a diameter of 20 cm was processed to veneers of 2 mm thickness using a rotary lathing machine. The veneers were impregnated with a low-molecular-weight phenolic resin, laminated in parallel, and compressed perpendicular to their plane. When the veneers were treated with a 3% or 5% aqueous solution and compressed to a density of 0.8 without adhesives, the specific dynamic Young's modulus (E/gamma, ratio of stiffness to specific gravity) and tan delta (damping) of the materials became almost the same as those of Brazilian rosewood in the lower-frequency range, not only in the longitudinal direction but also across the longitudinal direction. However, the frequency dependencies of the specific Young's modulus and tan delta of the materials differed from those of Brazilian rosewood, which may be partially related to the higher values of E/G of laminated compressed wood as a result of the increased density induced by deformation of the cell walls.

AB A forester shares personal reflections on biodiversity, finding he must deal with the question of ''What is biodiversity?'' before dealing with ''What is biodiversity good for?'' Even before that, the complexity of the scientific and social aspects of biodiversity must be looked at to set a context. The author believes that biodiversity has scientific, recreational, wildness, natural history, and spiritual values and contributes to sustainability and productivity. Aesthetic values also are found to be very important, and the author concludes ''that biodiversity has values that are worth protecting, even in the face of scientific uncertainty. Personal reflection on environmental issues is necessary to fully understand what one believes, and to be an active participant in issues of environmental ethics.

AB Surface-water flooding occurs frequently in low-income urban settlements of developing countries, with impacts on public health and the local economy. In many locations, drainage systems are neither appropriate nor sustainable. A computer model of a small surface-water drainage catchment has been developed within a slum improvement programme in Indore, India. The model was calibrated and verified against flow-survey data, and was used to study the effects on performance of maintenance (as reflected in solids build-up in pipes) and site grading. The results confirm the critical importance of maintenance in drainage performance and the need for construction engineers to consider drainage carefully before changing site-grading plans. The results also suggest some general trends in drainage performance during floods.

AB This article uses the Porter-Dunning diamond model of international competitiveness to explain the current situation and further development of the international competitiveness of mainland China's manufacturing sector. The emergence of a relatively wide range of labour-intensive manufactures as China's most dynamic exports conforms well to the country's natural comparative advantage of low costs and th restructuring of the Asian newly industrialized economies. However, since competitive advantage based on basic/generalized factors is neither significant nor sustainable, the Chinese government needs to encourage the strategy of reaching beyond current factor endowments to plan for a future China which would be rich in skills as well as capital, and would have higher order competitive advantage. Greater participation of multinational business activity from the triad of the US, Japan and the European Union can speed up this process. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Developing invisible assets, and tacit knowledge in particular, is crucial in creating such advantages. This article first presents a framework for process organizing which focuses on the relationship between company vision, the creation of multifunctional teams and the complementary relationship between team members. It then presents a model for making process teams work by emphasizing a number of criteria which should he met in re-engineering work processes, and indicates managerial and theoretical implications.

AB The FOMTA (Fundamentals of Modern Telemedicine in Africa) project aims to promote the development of indigenous regional networks between R&D centres and universities of the Developing Countries (DCs) and their European counterparts. While FOMTA prepares the way for the use of broadband technology in Africa, it will also associate the DCs with the generation of knowledge, innovative and appropriate technologies needed to solve some of the specific problems, in order to achieve a sustainable economic development. Designed to eliminate the time-delaying lack of infrastructure, FOMTA will embark on the simulation of the Integrated Service Digital Network infrastructure. FOMTA will adopt measures to increase the awareness and stimulate the participation of the DCs in the telemedicine and health care telematics projects through demonstrations, pilot projects, workshops, training and exchange activities. This will demonstrate the feasibility of telemedicine services in the DCs, including trial of services in real-life circumstances, and will provide training possibilities for researchers in the use of methods and tools for advanced communication technologies and telematics. Undoubtedly, telediagnosis, teleconsultation and other areas of telemedicine would thrive in Africa both as remote testing grounds and fields of practical applications.

TI Slash-and-burn rice systems in transition: Challenges for agricultural
   development in the hills of northern Laos
SO MOUNTAIN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
ID SUSTAINABILITY
AB Slash-and-burn rice production systems in the hilly areas of Laos have changed little over the past decades except for a reduction in the fallow period which has caused a tremendous increase in labor requirements for weed control. From 1950 to 1990, the population density increased from 7.6 to 17.6 persons/km(2), fallow periods decreased from 38 to 5 years, and weeding requirements increased from 1.9 to 3.9 weedings/rice crop. Because of high requirements for weeding, the return to labor is only 5 kg rice/labor day for slash-and-burn systems compared with 13 kg/day in lowland rice production. Soil organic C levels are declining fast, with losses of 5 t/ha observed during a single rice crop. Improvements of the living standard of the farm population, food security stabilization of upland agriculture, and increased rice production are the main objectives of development agencies working in hilly areas. However, the options available are limited by the market opportunities and there is little chance that any of the technologies offered will be adopted on a significant scale. Hill farmers have a comparative advantage for livestock and timber production but generally lack the necessary resources to make long-term investments in either operation. Market, credit opportunities, and land tenure are key factors affecting the direction of future hill agriculture in Laos.

ID EROSION
AB A financial cost-benefit analysis has been carried out on differentsoil conservation practices that have been studied on experimental plots in northern Thailand since 1989. Only one system, intercropping coffee with rice, has given a positive net present value (NPV) when a 26% discount rate was used, reflecting the annual interest charged on loans within villages. A sensitivity analysis shows that another system, hillside ditches with coffee trees, and rice as a main crop, can also give a positive NPV, but only when a 0% discount rate is used. It is argued that, in the context of agricultural sustainability, parameters other than the NPV should also be considered when selecting soil conservation practices for extension programs. When all the practices are compared, using criteria such as productivity, production risk, environmental protection, economic viability, and social acceptability, the intercropping system compares favorably with the others. These results are in accordance with field observations which showed that intercropping perennial crops with annual crops is, for the moment, one of the few adaptations that farmers in the study area are willing to make to their land and crop management systems.

AB Livestock husbandry is by far the most important activity in the former and present economies of the Kyrgyz Republic. Agricultural production systems under the Soviet order were mainly controlled as state farms or collective farms or enterprises, although individual households kept livestock on their plots. Since independence a variety of new systems has been developing but some still resemble the former state enterprises in many respects. Livestock numbers, in the Soviet quest for ever higher ''production,'' built up rapidly to 1991 when they were well in excess of the carrying capacity of natural pastures and cultivated fodder areas. This process was obviously not sustainable and negative effects on the environment, especially on pasture production, were severe. Since independence livestock numbers have fallen dramatically, mainly by sale and slaughter to cover current consumption needs and to support crop enterprises by raising cash to buy;fuel and spare parts for machinery. This ''decapitalization'' provides an opportunity for pastures to regenerate, for their more rational and sustainable use, and for adjusting future stocking rates to carrying capacity.

TI Towards an Environmental Management System for ski areas
SO MOUNTAIN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB Environmental Management Systems (EMS) developed in response to dissatisfaction with environmental auditing as a means of preventing pollution. The EMS approach benefited from the influence of diverse fields such as law, accounting, quality management, and workplace health and safety. Although not yet a trend, the marriage of EMS with self-evaluation, self-improvement models could make EMS even more effective.
   This paper describes the components and elements of an EMS which are suited to use in mountain ski area operations. Using a case study approach, it also illustrates the value of an EMS in focusing the environment initiatives of ski areas. From a societal point of view the voluntary nature of the EMS suggested here represents a self-regulatory approach to encouraging mountain tourism organizations to become more effectively involved with the protection of environmental resources. The use of EMS strategies does not mean, however, that government regulation is unnecessary. It only adds to the set of forces needed to develop and maintain more sustainable tourism activities in mountain environments.

AB The limitation of symbiotic nitrogen fixation due to P deficiency restricts the development of a sustainable agriculture, particularly in Mediterranean and tropical soils. Common bean genotypes, APN18, BAT271, PVA846, POT51, G2633 and G12168, were grown in an aerated N-free nutrient solution at low (72 mu mol plant(-1) week(-1)) and control P supplies (360 mu mol plant(-1) week(-1)). Nitrogenase activity was estimated by in situ measurements of acetylene reduction activity (ARA) in a flow-through system. During the assays, maximum values of ARA (peak ARA) were reached between 20 and 30 min after exposure to C2H2, depending on P treatment and growth stage. Thereafter, a decline in C2H4 evolution was observed. This decline was most pronounced in low-P plants and there was a significant genotypic effect. ARA per plant was decreased by P deficiency, mostly because nodulation was delayed and the number and mass of nodules were reduced. The ARA decrease during pod filling was also activated by P deficiency. ARA per g dry weight nodule was increased by P deficiency in G2633 and G12168, unchanged in APN18, BAT271 and POT51 and decreased in PVA846. Except for the climbing type IV G2633, total N at harvest for all P treatments was correlated with the cumulative value of peak ARA and with peak ARA at early pod-filling which was the highest peak ARA throughout the growth cycle of type III bushy genotypes. We conclude that if phenology and growth habit are carefully considered, peak ARA is a reliable screen of genotypes for N-2 fixation tolerance to P deficiency. Selection of lines with early nodulation under P deficiency is also advisable, and the effect of P deficiency on the nodule functioning needs to be considered.

TI Road management systems: Guidelines for their specification and
   selection
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF CIVIL ENGINEERS-TRANSPORT
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper identifies the role of road management systems in supporting the management of roads in countries with developing or emerging economies. It draws on past practical experience of implementing such systems, which have often failed to produce sustainable solutions. The reasons for past problems with implementation are discussed under the headings of the socio-political context in which an organization is required to operate, the institutional arrangements put in place to effect its management, and the technical capability of the organization.
   The different types of management systems are described in terms of information systems' and 'decision-support' systems, A classification of systems is also proposed that groups systems according to their function in terms of planning, programming, preparation and operation.
   A structured approach to specifying and selecting systems is recommended which recognizes the need for commitment to make things work, and the need to set management systems within the policy framework adopted by an organization for managing its functions. Considerable emphasis is given to identifying the potential users of systems and identifying their needs in terms of output reports, On the basis of this, appropriate models and data requirements can be identified, Finally, computer requirements can be specified to support these requirements. It is noted that this approach is the opposite to that adopted for the implementation of many road management systems in the past: approaches have tended to specify computer requirements first, and then focused on data requirements before addressing real user needs.

AB In recent years, Australia has struggled to remain in the top twenty developed countries, globally. The reality is that Australia's natural resource and agricultural bases no longer serve to provide sustainable national competitive advantage. In the past decade, therefore, government initiatives have aimed to produce a range of industry policies, apparently designed to strengthen the economic base, enhance government and industry responsiveness and productivity, and to attract increased overseas investment. The modernization of Australian public sectors and the adoption of private sector business principles, especially commercialization and privatization, have been critical aspects of competitive reform. This article examines several of the key strategies adopted by Australian governments, especially those designed to enhance national competitive advantage, to determine which strategies may be working, or not working, and why. Particular emphasis is placed on the role of governments as corporate business managers and their ability to respond to commercial realities on a business management, as distinct from an ideological, basis.

AB The UNESCO Engineering Education and Training Programme is currently focusing its priorities on postgraduate training of energy engineering students (although much of the output is suitable for advanced undergraduates) and working engineers requiring retraining or updating. To meet the needs especially for educational materials for developing countries and for distance-learning purposes, a multi-media ''Learning Package'' is in preparation which consists of a textbook, multi-media products and software for self-training and distance learning. It is intended to train students in the field of renewable energies with some dozen packages in preparation or for which half of the textbooks have already been published.
   The Package will provide educational material of benefit to both industrialized and developing countries through a networking programme. It sets goals for energy education that include environmental awareness, ethical responsibility towards society and student-friendly tutorials to enhance learning. The paper also addresses areas for priority actions in the various energy fields and presents UNESCO's philosophy for promoting energy education and training at all levels in the coming century. The World Solar Summit Process (WSSP) 1993-96, ''can make a distinct contribution to the work of the U.N. and the system as a whole in support of sustainable development by focusing on the transfer and sharing of knowledge in the development of renewable energy technologies'' according to the Secretary-General of the United Nations. The WSSP International Organizing Committee is chaired by UNESCO, and education and training in energy engineering has been designated as one of its strategic projects.
   The ''Learning Package'' constitutes an important contribution to this project. Areas for priority action to be proposed to the World Solar Commission are specified, including the assessment of specific education and training needs in the identified energy disciplines, and the capability of existing institutions to meet these needs. Specific measures to ensure that women achieve their full potential are recommended, including the expansion of scholarships and fellowships for in-country and foreign study and exchange of students and faculty.

AB A vigorous campaign to educate the general masses on ''How to invite solar energy into their homes for various uses and comfort living'' had been carried out by UPNG students during July/August 1994. It was conducted with the help of visual displays and field surveys in and around the Port Moresby city. The campaign not only met with an overwhelming support from the public but also made a strong impact to their understanding of the ''Sun'' as a potential source of energy. As part of an overall exercise, the survey's aim was to gauge at public opinion on general approach to energy problems through a set of policy guidelines. The data, thus, collected from 1994 survey on ''energy-use preferences'' were analysed from various perspectives to compare the choices given for energy-use categories in the domestic sector. The results indicated a very high rating of appreciation for options dealing with technologies that encouraged direct or indirect entry of sun and fresh air to their dwellings, places of work and study. 'Sustainability through Efficiency Improvements' and the 'End-Uses of Energy Approach' came next tc, appealing serious considerations through government policies and programmes. Emphasis on the above strategies was in sharp contrast to only a handful of suggestions which advocated living through the enhancement of energy-supply systems.

AB There is a need for rapid methods of assessing changes in the quality of agricultural soils because of the need to monitor such changes under different land management practices. For example, the increasing interest in use of agricultural lands for application of coal combustion byproducts, such as fluidized bed ash, has led to concern that such use may be detrimental to the quality of soil organic matter. Pyrolysis-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS) techniques hold promise as rapid procedures for detecting changes in the organic matter composition of soils, which contrasts with the often laborious chemical methods used commonly for analyzing soil organic matter. To evaluate Py-GC/MS for this use, we characterized changes in the organic matter composition of bed ash-amended soils by both chemical and pyrolytic analyses. The chemical analysis of the soil samples had shown substantial degradation and loss of organic matter as a result of the ash amendments, and the pyrolytic analyses reflected these losses of soil organic matter by decreases in the total peak areas within the total ion chromatogram. Information on the changes in composition of soil organic matter was reflected by changes in peak area for individual pyrolytic products, and the identity of more than 40 pyrolytic products was determined from their mass spectral data. This permitted identification of various pyrolytic signature products for the protein, carbohydrate, and humic fractions of soil organic matter. The change in peak areas of these different signature products could be correlated with changes in the content of different constituents in the soil organic matter as measured by chemical analysis. The pyrolysis product furfural was correlated with changes in carbohydrate content. Changes in production of 2-methoxyphenol, guaiacol, vinylphenol, vinylguaiacol, and isoeugenol represented changes within the humic fraction. Nitrile and propane pyrolysis products were correlated with changes in protein content. The good agreement between classical chemical analysis and pyrolytic analysis indicates that Py-GC/MS can be used to monitor changes in the organic matter composition of agricultural soils subjected to environmental stress.

   area of North East Spain
SO SOIL TECHNOLOGY

DE soil conservation measures; terraces; soil loss; design; soil erosion
AB The Penedes and Anoia regions in NE Spain are important areas for the cultivation of grapes used in the production of high quality wines. The Mediterranean climatic conditions define a xeric soil moisture regime. Rainfall are concentrated in spring and autumn while the summer is warm and dry. The climate is characterized by high rainfall intensities, being one of the main factors responsible for soil erosion in the area. Since grape quality depends on the availability of water for the vineyards and since soil erosion is an important parameter dictating the sustainability of vineyards, soil and water conservation can not be forgotten in the area. The most widely used measure for soil conservation in the area is terracing (hillside ditches, local name rases). Local technical solutions have been studied and in this paper different types of terraces are described and analysed in terms of its effectiveness for runoff control. Mean potential soil losses are evaluated according to the USLE and compared with field measurements in experimental plots. The distances between terraces have been calculated using the criteria proposed by several authors. Owing to the wide diversity of results, an acceptable value for 'soil loss tolerance' (T-value) has been used in order to establish some criteria to make recommendations, taking the values of soil loss measures in the field as a reference. According to these preliminary results based on measurements taken over a period of two years, some advisable distance between terraces (rases) in vineyards can be proposed in view to improve local criteria. With a slope of 6%, a distance of is 28 m would be advisable, and in fields with a slope of 8% the distance should be 20 m. Bennett's criteria to calculate distances between terraces are the more advisable being closely related with experimental results in the area.

AB The ways in which issues of differential times and time-scales make themselves felt in environmental politics are explored. Official and industrial 'control' of time-scales within environmental regulatory processes is seen to be an important determinant of the forms such politics take in countries like the UK. It is argued that the opening up of 'time' debates carries far-reaching and positive implications for 'sustainability' aspirations in the industrial world.

AB This paper examines knowledge of and attitudes to environmental protection techniques and sustainable development and the nature of action taken to adopt the former to move towards the latter in a study of the existing Guernsey hospitality sector, a survey of which concentrates on the value added services it produces.
   An indication is given of the hospitality sector's current practice with regard to environmental performance in terms of materials and energy used and waste generation in existing premises as opposed to new development, The likelihood of what changes might be introduced to effect environmental protection is also explored.
   It is argued that given the evidence of their current attitudes, management strategies and methods, businesses are more likely to incorporate environmental objectives and practice if it can be demonstrated that benefits in the form of lower costs and/or higher revenues and profits result.
   Some key reasons for inaction are highlighted and the implications for the ways in which central and local governments, public sector bodies and the business sector itself can encourage sustainable development (SD) initiatives by individual enterprises are offered from a largely economic standpoint.

AB Innovation in tourism is a matter of limited research and political consideration. Nevertheless, an increased environmental concern advanced by consumers, local inhabitants and authorities provokes innovative action within the tourism industry. This article offers a typology of innovations related to the environment. The following types of innovation can be distinguished: product innovations, classical process innovations, process innovations in information handling, management innovations and institutional innovations. The article concludes that innovations are predominantly launched as part of defensive strategies by the tourism industry, In addition, new products or processes are often exclusively a result of innovative efforts undertaken in other branches, for instance suppliers, causing a certain delay of endogenous innovation in the core tourism industry.

AB Governance assumptions of the East Asian miracle may not be a sufficient or a necessary condition for effective economic reform or for solid growth to emerge in other Asian economies. This paper argues that in Sri Lanka, where the state is not strong, where it is not well coordinated, and is neither cohesive nor disciplined in organizational terms, strong political leadership proved critical in the second wave of reform from 1989-93 - even if it was essentially illiberal in the process of implementation. Technical and political imperatives are seen to be interrelated and parts of a single reform package. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

ID HERTZIAN
AB This paper reports a Hertzian indentation study of damage modes in zirconia-based plasma-sprayed coatings on metal substrates, with and without bond coats. The structure of the study is as follows: (i) measurement of Hertzian indentation stress-strain curves, first on individual bulk material components (controls) and then on the composite layer structures, to quantify the degree of plasticity; (ii) micrographic analysis of the corresponding subsurface damage modes, particularly of the yield zones, in both coatings and underlayers; (iii) finite element modelling of the elastic-plastic stress fields in the adjacent layers, again with a focus on the yield zones. It is demonstrated that the substrate can have a profound influence on the damage distribution, depending on the degree of elastic-plastic mismatch relative to the coating. The bond coat, by virtue of its relative thinness, plays a lesser role in the damage intensity, notwithstanding an apparent improvement in substrate adhesion. Indentation variables followed are applied load, to examine the evolution of damage, and number of cycles, to examine fatigue. The results indicate the power and simplicity of the Hertzian technique as a route to mechanical characterization of coating structures: for identifying damage modes, especially yield (but also fracture, in the present case delamination fracture); for evaluating damage parameters, such as Young's modulus and the yield stress, from FEM analysis of stress-strain curves and yield zone microscopy; and for quantifying design concepts, e.g. maximum sustainable bearing stress and damage tolerance.

TI Funding the NHS: Is the NHS sustainable?
SO BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
AB The survival of the NHS lies largely in the hands of government, and this article suggests steps that it should take to deal with pressures on the NHS in terms of funding, managing efficiency, and demands. Changes to the system of funding may be unfeasible, but management could be improved by research to allow greater understanding of the local effects of national policies. Alternatively health authorities could be given more freedom to manage funds, although this would have to be accompanied by stiff sanctions for those who failed. Demand could be contained by strengthening policies to ensure that new technologies are cost effective. The government could try to reduce demands arising from increased expectations by encouraging informed public debate about priorities and influencing the availability of private health care. All these efforts should be guided by the values underpinning the NHS, which should be debated and decided collectively and confirmed in a new charter for NHS's 50th anniversary in 1998.

AB Druzno Lake is a semi-natural, hypertrophic basin located on the Zulawy polders (delta of Vistula). Its area is 13-29 km(2), with a mean depth of 1.25 m. The lake is extremely polymictic and of throughflow character: the water retention time is very short (20 days!). Almost 90% of the bottom is overgrown by macrophytes. The productivity, especially of phytoplankton, is very high. The main factors of ecosystem stability are: There are very good oxygen conditions in the lake. Organic matter undergoes quick mineralization. Due to frequent resuspension and intensive throughflow a considerable part of the mineral and organic seston is 'exported' out of the lake.
   By dredging the navigable channel, additional amounts of suspended matter have been exported out of the system. Therefore these technical treatments slow down the processes of shallowing and aging of the lake and support the lake's existence.

SO BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
AB Priority criteria developed during a national project were used to conduct an audit of all 662 patients on waiting lists for coronary artery bypass surgery in New Zealand during spring 1996. Based on the observed distribution of priority scores, the cost of providing surgery to all patients down to various levels of priority was estimated. Descriptions incorporating life expectancy and quality of life implications of surgery were developed of the kinds of patients who would or would not receive surgery at each of several possible funding levels. Cardiologists and cardiac surgeons agreed that a threshold of 25 points was a reasonable clinical goal but to work with a threshold of 35, which can be sustained with current levels of funding. All agree that the gap between these clinically preferred and currently afforded thresholds is a subject for wider societal dialogue and decision. The ability to measure the size of the gap between clinical desirability and financial sustainability provides a new transparency to the problem of healthcare resource allocation.

AB The use of satellite remote sensing in Malaysian forestry and its potential are discussed under three headings (1) Application of satellite remote sensing in Malaysian forestry; (2) Current efforts in remote sensing research application; (3) Potentials of remote sensing techniques in monitoring logging operations and forest change; and remote sensing as a tool in rehabilitation and reforestation. It is concluded that there is a high potential of satellite remote sensing application in Malaysia, especially with the Landsat and SPOT data supported with aerial photographs. This is due to its fast delivery of relevant, timely and accurate information needed for sustainable forestry and a sound management decision.

ID OCEAN-ATMOSPHERE MODEL; CIRCULATION
AB Atmospheric weather systems become unpredictable beyond a few weeks, but climate variations can be predictable over much longer periods because of the coupling of the ocean and atmosphere. With the use of a global coupled ocean-atmosphere model, it is shown that the North Atlantic may have climatic predictability on the order of a decade or longer. These results suggest that variations of the dominant multidecadal sea surface temperature patterns in the North Atlantic, which have been associated with changes in climate over Eurasia, can be predicted if an adequate and sustainable system for monitoring the Atlantic Ocean exists.

TI Funding the NHS: Is the NHS underfunded?
SO BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
ID NATIONAL-HEALTH-SERVICE; ALTERNATIVES
AB Since 1948 there has been constant debate over whether the NHS is underfunded. The debate heats up when crises in the NHS hit the headlines as occurred last year. Various groups, of all shades of the political spectrum, have argued that the NHS is unsustainable with current funding increase because of demands from demographic change, new technology; and increasing expectations. The government is almost a lung voice in arguing that the NHS is sustainable but may not be doing enough to ensure that it remains so in future. This article examines seven broad approaches used to support the case that the NHS is underfunded and concludes that all have flaws. There is no satisfactory answer to the question of whether the NHS is underfunded because the answer requires value judgements that will inevitably give rise to disagreements.

AB Ni/BaTiO(3) catalyst has been prepared by solid phase crystallization (SPC) method and used successfully for partial oxidation of CH(4) into synthesis gas at 800 degrees C. The catalyst was further tested for 75 hrs with no observable degradation and negligible coke formation. The SPC method bestows the catalyst with high Ni dispersion over the perovskite as well as strong metal-support interaction between Ni and the perovskite, resulting in both high activity and high sustainability against coke formation.

AB This paper assesses the future energy needs of the world and examines options for sources that will be sustainable over generations from both supply and environmental points of view.
   It is demonstrated that for the supply of electricity, the preferred energy carrier, power from Space, i.e., solar energy captured in space and imported to the Earth, is likely to play a major role in providing base load energy. Energy from sustainably-grown biomass will play a modest role in base load supply, but requires too much land to provide the bulk of the energy in well-populated countries. Wind and solar energy captured on the Earth will provide useful supplies of peak load energy in many locations.
   A unique "distributed" characteristic of Space-Based Solar may permit access to this source with relatively low capital investments. That is, because of the wireless transmission link, part of the generating system is in space, and part is on the ground. Thus a potential user could finance and operate only the ground segment and buy "sunfuel", in radio frequency form, from an (international) enterprise which owns and operates the space segment.

AB Every year, an average of eight new civilian remote sensing satellite missions are launched. Cumulatively, over 250 such missions, each with a cost equivalent in current value to between $US 100 million to $US 1000 million, have been sponsored by space agencies in perhaps two dozen countries.
   These missions produce data and information products which are vital for informed decision making all over the world, on matters relating to natural resource exploitation, health and safety, sustainable national development, infrastructure planning, and a host of other applications. By contributing to better scientific understanding of global changes in the atmosphere, land surface, oceans and ice caps, these silently orbiting sentinels in the sky make it possible for governments and industries to make wiser environmental policy decisions and support the economic development needs of humanity.
   The international Committee on Earth Observation Satellites (CEOS) is the premier world body for co-ordinating and planning civilian satellite missions for Earth observation. Through its technical working groups and special task teams, it endeavours to:
   maximise the international benefits from Earth observation satellites; and
   harmonise practice in calibration, validation, data managment and information systems for Earth observation.
   CEOS encompasses not only space agencies (data providers), but also the great international scientific and operational programs which rely on Earth science data from space. The user organisations affiliated with CEOS, together with the mission operators, attempt to reconcile user needs with the complex set of considerations - including national interests, cost, schedule which affect the undertaking of space missions. Without such an internationally co-ordinated consensual approach, there is a much greater risk of waste through duplication, and of missed opportunity, or through the absence of measurements of some vital physical or biological parameter by space borne sensors.
   Mechanisms used by CEOS to carry out these tasks are built upon consensus and understanding, as well as on technology transfer between countries. An area of recent heightened endeavour in CEOS has been to determine and address the special needs of developing countries in respect of Earth observation data.
   In the next several years, a new wave of Earth observation will break, as the private sector, revitalised with decommissioned military technology, brings exciting new capabilities to international remote sensing. With rapidly burgeoning markets in spatial information or geomatics, as well as the continuing thirst of science programs for spatial information, there is a challenge upon the international space community to reassess continually, the most expedient and socially constructive means of making available in a fair and open way, geographically-reference information obtained with space observation systems.

AB The general process of nutrient cycling in forest stands is relatively well-known. Nevertheless, fluxes in representative ecosystems have not yet been quantified, certainly due to the amount of measurements required. The unavailability of such information is delaying the validation of models describing the ecosystem function.
   Numerous observations of nutrient stocks and fluxes carried out on a chronosequence of Douglas-fir stands in the Beaujolais mountains (France) were used: i) to quantify the main fluxes of the biological cycle of nutrients for the main stages of development of a single stand, ii) to characterize their dynamics during forest development and iii) to quantify the real amount of nutrients involved in forest growth and to identify their origins.
   The present soil nutrient reserves of the ecosystem studied were relatively low if compared to stand nutrient uptake. The biological cycle represents a key process in the maintenance of forest productivity under such conditions. Cumulation of fluxes during rotation was very useful in quantifying the real amounts of nutrients involved in tree nutrition, in demonstrating the efficiency of the system's use of the limited pool of nutrients needed to produce biomass and to show the relevance of the biological cycle in the soil function.
   These results will be helpful in understanding the nutrient behaviour in a highly productive forest plantation and thereby providing decisive information for their sustainable management.

AB Indigofera spinosa (Forsk.) is a key forage resource in the arid rangelands of northern Kenya inhabited by nomadic pastoralists. Because it is highly relished by livestock, it is subjected to heavy periodic and in some areas permanent browsing impact wherever it occurs. This study evaluated the effects of simulated herbivory on yield and reproduction of this species. Different levels of impact (light, moderate, moderately-heavy and heavy) were inflicted on individual shrubs at fortnightly and monthly intervals respectively. Results indicate that I. spinosa is highly resilient to browsing. Maximum regrowth compensation was achieved at the moderate level of impact. Heavy clipping reduced residual mass to an extend whereby the ability to compensate for lost vegetative organs was severely curtailed. A longer clipping interval tended to enhance regrowth, especially at the moderate intensity. Reproduction was significantly reduced by clipping impact. At the heavy clipping impact, reproduction was completely halted. irrigation mitigated the impact of clipping by increasing the amount of regrowth and reproductive activity. To optimise the production and utilisation of I. spinosa pastures during the growing (wet) seasons, if is recommended that grazing should be moderate to leave browse height of 10-15 cm. At this intensity, adequate reproduction will be stimulated while ensuring availability of residual mass critical for dry season feeding and long term sustainable production. Yield to browsers will also be optimised at this level of impact.

TI 'Fishing farmers' or 'farming fishermen'? The quest for household income
   and nutritional security on the Kenyan shores of Lake Victoria
SO AFRICAN AFFAIRS
LA English
DT Article
AB The paper considers the relationships between fishing and farming in providing household income and nutritional security among Luo communities on the shores of the Kenyan sector of Lake Victoria. In recent years the resources of Lake Victoria have come under severe pressure due to a variety of economic and ecological factors associated with over-fishing and a significant decline in fish species. Farming has increased in importance as households attempt to meet subsistence needs, but plot fragmentation, drought and low investment have led;to poor crop yields. Future development strategies need to enhance the sustainability of the resources of both lake and land, and possibly build upon traditional management methods and institutions.

AB Eucalyptus and Acacia are two tree genera that are commonly used in industrial plantations and as components of agroforestry systems in southeast Asia. These fast-growing trees are mostly grown in monocultures. However, questions are now being raised about the long-term sustainability of their growth as well as their effects on site quality. Losses of N and P from the site through biomass harvest and during site preparation constitute a major nutrient drain. As an alternative to monocultures, mixed-species cultures which include at least one N(2)-fixing tree species can improve plant productivity and soil N dynamics. Among the various aspects of N dynamics in such stands, export of N during biomass harvest and inputs by the N(2)-fixing component are the most important.
   Reported estimates of the amount of N fixed by acacia and other N(2)-fixing trees are highly variable, depending on inherited plant characteristics, tree age, site factors (e.g., drought), soil fertility (e.g., available P, metal toxicities) and unreliable methods of measuring N(2)-fixation. Of the available techniques for assessing N(2)-fixation by trees, the total N difference method (TND) is the simplest. The contribution of roots to assessments of N(2)-fixation is recognized but rarely measured.
   For short-rotation mixed-species plantations, the amount and time of N transfer from N(2)-fixing trees to non-N(2)-fixing trees are important issues to consider when attempting to develop productive nutrient management strategies. Based on limited information from trials in southeast Asia, it appears that acacia fixes substantial amounts of N during the first few years of establishment and a significant amount of that N is transferred to adjacent eucalypts, thereby improving the growth and nutrition of the eucalypts. The presumed transfer of N from acacias to eucalypts during the early stages of plantation development probably results from below-ground turnover of roots and nodules because aboveground litter decomposition is slight at this stage, and contributes little to the overall N dynamics.
   The available information on P cycling in mixed-species stands, during the early stages of stand growth, provides inconclusive evidence as to whether the availability of soil P increases, despite indications of higher levels of phosphatase activity in the fine roots of nitrogen-fixing trees. This would imply that additional inputs of P as fertilizer are required to remove any P deficiency in mixed-species stands. Long-term observations are required for better understanding of the nutritional and growth benefits of including N(2)-fixing trees in mixed-species stands.

AB Steeply sloping lands are widespread in the tropics. An estimated 500 million people practice subsistence agriculture in these marginal areas. Continued population growth has led to the intensified cultivation of large areas of the sloping lands, exacerbating the problem of soil erosion. Although research shows that alley cropping and other contour agroforestry systems can stabilize the sloping lands, these systems have not been widely adopted by farmers.
   The Framework for Evaluating Sustainable Land Management (FESLM) has been tested in sloping land areas in the Philippines. Sustainable land management must be productive, stable, viable, and acceptable to farmers, while protecting soil and water resources. Farms on which contour hedgerow intercropping has been adopted meet the multifaceted requirements of FESLM, whereas the farmers' current practice does not. Appropriate land management measures for particular locations depend on a complex suite of social, economic, and biophysical factors, and need to tx:developed in participation with farmers.
   The role of agroforestry in sustainable management of sloping lands is the subject of networks coordinated by the International Board for Soil Research and Management (IBSRAM) in seven countries in Asia (ASIALAND) and four countries in the Pacific (PACIFICLAND). We review selected outcomes from a wealth of network data. From these results the following conclusions about the sustainability of various agroforestry systems for sloping lands can be drawn:
   In the Pacific, soil loss from sloping lands due to water erosion under farmers' current practices is episodic, unpredictable, and possibly not severe;
   Agroforestry systems that utilize legume shrubs, fruit trees, coffee (Coffea spp.) or rubber (Hevea brasiliensis) provide useful economic returns, but are not an essential component in terms of soil protection because grass or pineapple (Ananas comosus) planted on the contour are equally effective in reducing erosion;
   Agricultural intensification will lead to nutrient mining, reduction of aboveground biomass, declining yields, and less soil protection unless external sources of nutrients are used; nitrogen can be effectively supplied using legumes;
   Cash derived from hedgerow trees and/or shrubs may provide an incentive for their adoption by farmers, as well as funds to purchase external inputs such as fertilizers;
   Labor may be a major constraint to the adoption of complex agroforestry systems.
   We also discuss the information management systems required to effectively manage and utilize the extensive sets of experimental and indigenous data being accumulated. We believe such information systems can facilitate technology transfer across and between regions, and improve the efficiency of research into agroforestry and other land-management approaches.

AB New initiatives in agroforestry are seeking to integrate into tropical farming systems indigenous trees whose products have traditionally been gathered from natural forests. This is being done in order to provide marketable products from farms that will generate cash for resource-poor rural and peri-urban households. This poverty-alleviating agroforestry strategy is at the same time linked to one in which perennial, biologically diverse and complex mature-stage agroecosystems are developed as sustainable alternatives to slash-and-burn agriculture.
   One important component of this approach is the domestication of the local tree species that have commercial potential in local, regional or even international markets. Because of the number of potential candidate species for domestication, one crucial first step is the identification of priority species and the formulation of a domestication strategy that is appropriate to the use, marketability and genetic potential of each species.
   For most of these hitherto wild species little or no formal research has been carried out to assess their food value, potential for genetic improvement or reproductive biology. To date their marketability can only be assessed by their position in the local rural and urban marketplaces, since few have attracted international commercial interest. To meet the objective of poverty alleviation, however, it is crucial that market expansion and creation are possible, hence for example it is important to determine which marketable traits are amenable to genetic improvement. While some traits that are relatively easy to identify do benefit the farmer, there are undoubtedly others that are important to the food, pharmaceutical or other industries that require more sophisticated evaluation.
   This paper presents the current thinking and strategies of ICRAF in this new area of work and draws on examples from our program.

AB Agroforestry systems (AFS) have received much attention from policymakers and others for their perceived ability to contribute significantly to economic growth, poverty alleviation, and environmental sustainability. Yet in many areas of the developing world where AFS have proven their agronomic potential, they have yet to be widely adopted. This paper approaches the issue with a focus on one such area - the western Brazilian Amazon, an area where economic integration within the region itself, across national boundaries, and between the region and the rest of Brazil ('regional integration') may soon vastly shift incentives to natural resource users. The paper addresses AFS adoption via a conceptual framework that argues for scrutinizing agronomic and socioeconomic characteristics of AFS and their potential adopters. This framework facilitates a priori assessment of whether specific AFS will be adopted, and if so, by whom and with what likely impact on the development objectives at hand. It highlights characteristics that lend socioeconomic and agronomic 'agility' - connoting flexibility to easily shift production systems and accompanying marketing strategies in response to unforeseen or rapid change (due to qualities of the AFS itself, or the producer). Financial performance indicators (net present value of AFS during establishment and for the life of a project, and years to positive cash flow) are presented for selected AFS, and juxtaposed to a livestock production system that is already gaining wide adoption in the area. This juxtaposition illustrates the practical effects of socioeconomic and agronomic characteristics posited as influential. Against this backdrop, trends in 'regional integration' are discussed, along with implications this integration process has for AFS adoption. The paper ends with a discussion of the roles and limitations of policy in promoting AFS adoption.

AB This paper reports on a study of local diversity and variation in indigenous agroforestry practices among Amazonian peasants in a traditional community near Iquitos, Peru. Data were gathered through in-depth interviews with agroforestry-reliant households (n = 36) on farming practices, demographic characteristics, income-expenditures and household wealth. Visits to crop fields and forest fallows (n = 329) allowed the reconstruction of extensive cropping histories. More in-depth assessments of crop occurrence, density and diversity were conducted on 83 fields. Our results indicate considerable variation in field characteristics, agroforestry-cycles, and household agroforestry portfolios. Agroforestry practice is found to be strongly related to access to land within the community: households holding more land use both potentially more sustainable and more lucrative swidden-fallow agroforestry systems. Our results question the view of indigenous agroforestry systems as intrinsically 'stable, equitable, and sustainable', and underscore the importance of studying local variation in indigenous agroforestry practices. Promising avenues are discussed for future research on the factors related to the successful adoption of sustainable agroforestry systems.
