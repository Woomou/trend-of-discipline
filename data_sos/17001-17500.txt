AB This paper explores some of the issues surrounding participation in and collection of, domestic waste for recycling and examines the motivation for individuals to recycle household waste, the ease with which this may happen, and the environmental impacts of the methods of recycling. This information is then used to suggest that it may be possible to engage individuals in the debate about sustainability by using recycling as a starting point for greater awareness of the wider and more complex issues. These issues are social as well as environmental and economic considerations. The paper suggests that, as recycling is increasingly recognised as a 'green' activity, it can be used as a model to encourage individuals to engage in similar activities.

TI International migration at the beginning of the twenty-first century:
   global trends and issues
SO INTERNATIONAL SOCIAL SCIENCE JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
AB Globalisation leads to increases in all kinds of cross-border flows, including movements of people. In recent years international migration has grown in volume, and is now an important factor of social transformation in all regions of the world. States classify migrants into certain categories, and seek to encourage certain types of mobility while restricting others. However, control measures are often ineffective if they are not based on understanding of the economic, social and cultural dynamics of migration. The article reviews causes and patterns of migration, and discusses some key issues: migration and development, international cooperation, settlement and ethnic diversity, and migration as a challenge to the nation-state. It is argued that most national governments have taken a shortterm and reactive approach to migration. Efforts at international regulation are also relatively under-developed. There is a need for long-term cooperative strategies to achieve agreed goals such as: ensuring orderly migration and preventing exploitation by agents and recruiters; safeguarding the human rights of migrants; making migration an instrument of sustainable development; avoiding conflicts with populations of migrant-receiving areas, and maximising positive aspects of social and cultural change.

TI Organic sugar - a growth opportunity for producers?
SO INTERNATIONAL SUGAR JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
AB Health and environmental issues have become a rapidly growing source of international concern as our understanding of the impact human activity on natural resources improves and the effects themselves become more pronounced. The side effects of the industrial model of agriculture made sustainability a key word in the discussion on the future of agriculture and the food industry. Organic farming provides foodstuffs produced using agricultural methods and processes that are considered ecologically sound.
   Sugar, for the time being, is only a sideline commodity in the fast growing world market of organic products. However, taking into account a rapid expansion of the latter on the one hand, and an overall importance of sugar (particularly in the form of sugar containing products) in the human diet on the other, one may suggest that its niche in the market of organic products will experience steady growth in future.

AB Two medium leaf size varieties of white clover (Trifolium repens L.) were grown in mixture with a range of grass species and varieties in a field experiment conducted over 4 years. The clovers were grown singly or as a blend in swards with a tetraploid perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.), a diploid Italian ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum? L.) or tetraploid hybrids between these two species (Lolium x boucheanum Kunth). These grasses were also grown in monoculture. Swards were managed in a regime involving two periods of sheep grazing, two periods of cattle grazing and a silage cut in the same year for 4 years. The objectives of this experiment were 3-fold: (1) to examine the yield and persistency of white clover in highly productive systems with modern perennial, hybrid and Italian ryegrasses; (2) to compare the performance of white clover varieties grown singly in mixture with grasses with their performance together as a blend, and (3) to examine the persistency of new Italian ryegrass varieties, exemplified by AberComo. The clover content of the sward remained high throughout the experiment, with a mean of 31 % overall. Differences in clover yield between plots were largely attributable to the effects of companion grasses. Total yields were very similar in plots containing different clover varieties and in plots where these varieties had been grown singly or as a blend. Grass yields in mixture were greater than those in monoculture but showed similar relative rankings. The diploid Italian ryegrass variety AberComo showed an unexpectedly high yield in the 4th year of the experiment. The implications of these results for strategies for productive, sustainable agriculture using modern white clover and ryegrass varieties are discussed.

SP European Inst Business Ethics, Nijenrode Univ, European Business Eth Network
AB The ethics of Public Relations is changing: the pragmatical approach is giving way to the dialogical approach. Pragmatical PR Ethics concentrates on issues and cases and hardly has a conceptual core. Dialogical PR Ethics concentrates on procedures and structures and uses symmetric communication as its core concept. Both approaches of PR ethics have their strong and weak points. A meta-ethical framework is presented to combine both approaches.
   Three examples of the dialogical turn in the practice of PR in the 1990- ties:
   1. Premature and idealistic deals with a paper factory in Katmandu caused sales problems for The Body Shop in the early nineties. The product did not belong in its line of business and after more than two years sales were still unacceptably low. Meanwhile the factory, solely depending on The Body Shop, grew out to be a social-economical pilar of Katmandu. Careful dialogue and cooperative research provided a win-win-solution for both companies in 1994.
   2. The Association for Professional Communication in the Netherlands awarded the Dutch Shell a price for communication. The company was praised for its willingness to change its strategic communication in 1996. This was shown by Shell's turn to start listening to important public groups and to start a dialogue on the social responsibility of corporations, also in effect of the Brent Spar affair. Groups of stakeholders were invited to join the discussion on parts of a new business code, which resulted in the adaption of human rights as a leading principle.
   3. Unilever vision on responsible entrepeneuring was presented in 1997 by the President of the Board of Directors M. Tabaksblat. "Unilever considers it of great importance to carry on a dialogue with consumers and public organisations on important social issues, like the application of biotechnological methods in the production of food and sustainable methods of production. Also the dialogue with co-workers of a different cultural background for Unilever is an important aspect of responsible entrepeneurial behaviour."

ID LANDSCAPES
AB A chequer-board pattern of fields is characteristic of much of lowland Britain and other parts of western Europe. The field boundaries are often composed of hedgerows which, by tradition, are regularly managed to provide a relatively compact, sustainable, stock-proof barrier. The management regimes of hedgerows are, however, extremely variable resulting in a range of features, from low, compact, dense lines of shrubs through to tall, open rows of small trees. As well as providing an agronomic benefit, this network of several hundred thousand kilometres, has been shown to be a valuable resource to wildlife and is important as an aesthetic contribution to the British landscape. Therefore, the maintenance of the British hedgerow network is important and survey is essential to monitor its continuity. The Countryside Surveys have been used as means of achieving this, as well as providing a rich source of information, for example, about landscape pattern and changes in this over time.
   Hedgerow data have been collected during sample-based field surveys in 1978, 1984, 1990 and 1993. National estimates of the length of managed hedgerow derived from these data showed a 23% reduction in the resource between 1984 and 1990. Much of this 'loss' appeared to be due to management regimes which have led to more overgrown hedgerows and rows of scattered shrubs. The proportion of mixed-species hedgerows increased between the two dates and there was a reduction in stockproof hedgerows but most other characteristics (e.g. height and management) remained constant. Landscape-pattern measures applied to the hedgerow network showed broad similarity across a range of landscape types in Britain although the density of hedges was greater in the pastural landscapes of the south and west. Measurement of 'connectedness', a feature of potential value in aiding species movement through the landscape, suggested that the British landscape is less-well connected in 1990 than previously. Hedgerows were found next to linear features, such as roads, as frequently as they were to any other land use.
   One of the most significant findings from analysis of 1984 and 1990 data was that there has been an increase in larger and more overgrown hedgerows, often to the point where they could no longer be defined as hedgerows. Overgrown hedgerows do have wildlife and other value but, to remain sustainable, hedgerows do require some degree of management. There is potential for using the Countryside Survey data further to provided better advice on the sustainable and sympathetic management of hedgerows. This is necessary to provide a rich and diverse network within a landscape or management unit.
   Countryside Survey hedgerow results have already been used to inform rural policy in Britain and have helped to underpin the introduction of policies and incentives which protect and enhance this landscape resource. These data are also being used to measure indicators of sustainable development and to provide a baseline against which changes in ancient and/or species-rich hedgerows can be assessed, as required in the UK Biodiversity Action Plan. The surveys have proved useful in gathering information on the hedgerows and other linear features in the British landscape. The approach could well be adapted to the needs of other countries where, for example, fencerows and roadside vegetation also provide an important ecological and landscape resource.

TI An agri-environmental phosphorus saturation index for acid
   coarse-textured soils
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY
LA English
DT Article
ID PHOSPHATE SORPTION; RUNOFF
AB Potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) is a high P demanding crop contributing to P saturation of acid coarse-textured soils. The P status is commonly assessed agonomically by soil testing of P (STP) and environmentally by soil P saturation or P solubility indexes. The aim of this work was to develop a P fertilizer recommendation model integrating P environmental risk and crop response probability, using P and Al extracted by the Mehlich-III soil testing method (mg P or Al L-1 of soil) and expressed as (P/Al)(M-III) percentage. The environmentally critical (P/Al)(M-III) percentage was 15%, corresponding to the critical degree of phosphate saturation (DPS) value of 25% (oxalate extraction procedure) proposed in the Netherlands. Using the Cate-Nelson procedure, the critical (P/Al)(M-III) percentage across 78 field experiments was 8.2% as determined by inductively coupled-argon plasma (ICP). Probability of potato response to P was close to 100% even above the critical STP values as shown by power tests on relative yields. The P recommendation model was computed from conditional expectations of 50 and 80% within each fertility group below 15% as (P/Al)(M-III) Above 15%, the model recommended 21 kg P ha(-1), the amount of P exported by a tuber harvest of approximately 42 Mg ha(-1) Using conversion equations with 114 soil samples for STP methods, fertility groups built for Quebec acid coarse-textured soils were found to be comparable with those currently used in the Netherlands and Lower Saxony (Germany). The (P/Al)(M-III) percentage provided a reliable and unifying criterion for making environmentally acceptable and agronomically efficient P recommendations for sustainable potato production.

AB The relationship between heart rate (f(H)) and rate of oxygen consumption ((V) over dot O(2),) was established for a marine diving bird, the common elder duck (Somateria mollissima), during steady-state swimming and running exercise. Both variables increased exponentially with speed during swimming and in a linear fashion during running. Eleven linear regressions of (V) over dot O(2), (ml kg(-1) min(-1)) on f(H) (beats min(-1)) were obtained: five by swimming and six by running the birds. The common regression was described by (V) over dot O(2)=10.1+0.15f(H) (r(2)=0.46, N=272, P<0.0001). The accuracy of this relationship for predicting mean (V) over dot O(2) was determined for a group of six birds by recording f(H) continuously over a 2-day period and comparing estimated (V) over dot O(2) obtained using the common regression with (i) (V) over dot O(2), estimated using the doubly labelled water technique (DLW) and (ii) (V) over dot O(2) measured using respirometry. A two-pool model produced the most accurate estimated db, using DLW. Because of individual variability within mean values of (V) over dot O(2), estimated using both techniques, there was no significant difference between mean (V) over dot O(2) estimated using f(H) or DLW and measured (V) over dot O(2) values (P>0.2), although individual errors were substantially less when f(H) was used rather than DLW to estimate (V) over dot O(2). Both techniques are, however, only suitable for estimating mean (V) over dot O(2) for a group of animals, not for individuals.
   Heart rate and behaviour were monitored during a bout of 63 voluntary dives by one female bird in an indoor tank 1.7 m deep. Tachycardia occurred both in anticipation of and following each dive. Heart rate decreased before submersion but was above resting values for the whole of the dive cycle. Mean f(H) at mean dive duration was significantly greater than f(H) while swimming at maximum sustainable surface speeds. Heart rate was used to estimate mean (V) over dot O(2), during the dive cycle and to predict aerobic dive limit (ADL) for shallow dives.

   among urban contraceptors in Bangladesh
SO JOURNAL OF HEALTH POPULATION AND NUTRITION

DT Article
DE fees and charges; contraceptive methods; contraceptive usage; prices;
   pricing
AB The study was carried out to review the experience with the existing user-fee (pricing) strategies and examine the socioeconomic and demographic factors associated with payment behaviour among contraceptors in urban Bangladesh for selected contraceptive methods, such as injectables, pill, and condom. Data for the study were drawn from a survey of more than 5,000 married women of reproductive age in Zone 3 of Dhaka city, Bangladesh, within the sample frame of the Urban Panel Survey of the ICDDR,B's former Urban MCH-FP Extension Project, The findings of the study showed that most (80%) urban contraceptors have been paying for selected family-planning services. This indicates the existence of a notable demand for contraceptives which suggests that there is scape for improved financial sustainability of the family-planning programme through charging appropriate user-fees far contraceptives with proper analyses of willingness-to-pay among the contraceptors and price elasticities of demand. Higher socioeconomic status of households, marked by higher levels of education and house rent, and location of residence in non-slum areas, is predictive of paying for contraception. Households having 1-3 living child(ren) are also more likely to make payment for the selected contraceptive services.

So what is the constant that they can use to keep a steady course through all the chaos? We suggest that the overarching constant is "community in the workplace." Although community building may have both short- and long-term benefits, it is not a strategy but a career-long philosophy, structure. and approach to help managers tie together all the facets of their daily work into a more meaningful and satisfying purpose.
   This article, part 2 in a 4-part series, explores the principles and characteristics of community and provides material for further study and discussion. Four conceptual cornerstones-philosophy, influence, culture, and inner transformation-are considered in relation to the community approach.
   Part 1 (April) described the negative dynamics that obstruct sustainable change and reasons for moving to community at work. Part 3 (October) will describe how to build community and will give options for implementing change in complex adaptive systems. The final article (November) presents case studies and discusses how community can be built in a unionized environment.

ID BEHAVIOR
AB The most serious long-term threat facing the world is the danger that human actions are producing irreversible, harmful changes To the environmental conditions that support life on Earth. if this problem is not overcome, there may be no viable world for our descendants to inhabit. Because this threat is caused by human population growth, overconsumption, and lack of resource conservation, social scientists have a vital role in helping our world escape ecological disaster and approach a sustainable level of impact on the environment-one that can be maintained indefinitely. Enormous changes to human lifestyles and cultural practices may be required to reach this goal. This article discusses major obstacles to this goal, describes a variety of motivational approaches toward reaching it, and proposes that we should view the achievement of sustainable living patterns as a superordinate goal-a war against the common enemy of an uninhabitable world.

AB Most programs to foster sustainable behavior continue to be based upon models of behavior change that psychological research has found to be limited Although psychology has much to contribute to the design of effective programs to foster sustainable behavior, little attention has been paid to ensuring that psychological knowledge is accessible to those who design environmental programs. This article presents a process, community-based social marketing, that attempts to make psychological knowledge relevant and accessible to these individuals. Further it provides two case studies in which program planners have utilized this approach to deliver their initiatives. Finally, it reflects on the obstacles that exist to incorporating psychological expertise into programs to promote sustainable behavior.

TI Factors encouraging the growth of sustainable communities: A Jamaican
   case study
SO JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY AND SOCIAL WELFARE
LA English
DT Article
AB The concept of sustainable communities assumes a process of social and/or economic development that has as a high priority, the needs of the future generation. However, models of social and economic development employed in developing countries, must rely heavily on political, social and psychological empowerment techniques being employed at the community level, in order to warrant any type of sustainability becoming apparent. A case study taken from Kingston, Jamaica recounts and examines the experience of a Social Work Unit/private company in partnership, becoming involved in a low-income community's drive for sustainable development. The paper will reflect on the intervention, the analysis of which suggests inclusion and acceptance of a 'third party' support mechanism by the community and the presence of visible political and economic support from the government as the two factors which impact directly on creation of sustainable development initiatives in communities such as this.

TI Farmers' perception of land-cover changes in NE Iceland
SO LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
DE farmers' perceptions; farmers' knowledge; land-cover; land degradation;
   Iceland
ID CONSERVATION
AB Land degradation is considered to be a major environmental problem by scientific and political institutions in Iceland. In past years, land degradation problems related to sheep and horse grazing have gradually come to the fore in public discussion of environmental questions. However, land degradation is often evaluated in different ways by different groups of people. This has led to a lack of consensus regarding rates and severity of land degradation. Therefore, it is important to study differences in environmental perception, and how these differences can be dealt with in the context of sustainable management. This paper aims to highlight farmers' perception of land degradation in Iceland, as perceptions of the environment determine the basis for human activities related to the land. A total of 100 farmers in NE Iceland were questioned and interviewed for their opinions on land degradation, its history, causes and severity. The results indicate that farmers consider land degradation to be a slow process, and not a catastrophic phenomenon. The understanding of the general ecological processes by the users affects their practices and concern for their environment. This feeds back on the land-use system and ultimately causes changes in land-cover. Therefore, if we are to increase our understanding of the processes that lead to land-cover changes we have to integrate the perceptions of land users and technical experts. In this way we may improve conservation practices and land-resource management policies. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

We argue that there is a role for transnational solutions as a supplement to national systems, and eve assess the conditions necessary to make this approach effective. We look at a variety of possible actors and arenas that could foster transnationalism and provide illustrations of transnational advocacy and regime building. We conclude that elements of a multilevel, public-private transnational regime are present in some parts of the world and that these elements can occasionally be knit together. We find that prospects for an effective and sustainable system of transnational multi-level regulation are greater when regional integration pacts such as the EU and NAFTA create transnational norms or forums. But, based on preliminary analysis of transnational advocacy and regulation in these two areas, we also conclude that no fully effective system has yet emerged.

AB Day/night zooplankton sampling in Kosterfjorden, Sweden, gave information on population succession, vertical distribution and feeding df Calanus finmarchicus over 17 months. Copepodid Stage 1 and 2 (C-I, C-II) were present from December to August, indicating reproduction during most of the year. Mating and breeding for the overwintering generation mainly took place in February/March, resulting in peak abundance of C-I in March/April. Secondary breeding periods were in April and July/August, but the resulting recruitment from these were low. The relative recruitment success in the first spring was around 13 times higher than during the second spring. Low temperature in the surface water early in the year and depression of the spring phytoplankton bloom may have caused the failure in the second year. Population biomass peaked at >15 g dry weight m(-2) during the numeric peak of the youngest stages in March/April. A more sustainable level of high biomass of 8 to 10 g dw m(-2) was gradually built up during summer, mainly due to a continuous accumulation of C-Vs. Adults and C-Vs comprised the overwintering population, with 7 to 14% and 85 to 93%, respectively, for the 2 years, but only C-Vs staying in the deep water were in a resting state. Adult males showed a strong diurnal vertical migration (DVM) of the usual type from spring to early autumn and a reversed DVM during the cold season. They were in a feeding state throughout the year. Adult females showed the usual type of DVM during summer to autumn, but commonly a reversed DVM during winter to spring. They were usually in a feeding state, with no pronounced differences between surface and deep water or between day and night. C-Vs aggregated in the deep water from October to March and performed DVM in April to June. They were commonly feeding in the deep water between March and June but showed no or very low feeding activity there from July to February. C-Vs in the surface water were commonly feeding and showed the highest proportion of feeding in autumn, when the population in the deep water was inactive. C-V constituted up to nearly 100% of the population biomass, and therefore must be of profound ecological importance. Defined by this dominant role, the population of C. finmarchicus can be characterised as having an active period of feeding, reproduction and development from February to July with a following 6 to 7 months of resting in the deep water, when development is arrested and no feeding occurs.

AB The precarious state of many of the world's important commercial fisheries have called into question the ability of government agencies to carry out mandates related to stock conservation and sustainability. This paper argues that the prominent role of government agencies in building fisheries management systems of the past few decades, has led to the prevalent situation that management is top-down and has fostered the view that these institutions are "in control". In that view, the fishing sector has generally been excluded from management and is depicted as fundamentally irresponsible with regard to resource sustainability. A paternal government-industry relationship diminishes the opportunity for the fishing industry to become a responsible partner in fisheries management. We argue that institutional arrangements are a major impediment to effective management change. We consider the problem of managing commercial fisheries under current institutional structures by examining the Canadian Department of Fisheries and Oceans as a case study. We outline the benefits of alternative bottom-up and participative decision making for fisheries and discuss the requirements for more effective institutional arrangements that would empower stakeholders toward building a real stakeholders-government partnership.

AB This paper examines the factors promoting the adoption of mitigation measures during long-term recovery following Hurricane Hugo in the United States. Recovery from disaster offers opportunities for improving community resilience to future disasters and for promoting sustainability. Various dynamics during recovery, however, can interfere with mitigation of hazards. In this study the adoption of mitigation during recovery in three case communities after Hurricane Hugo is evaluated, with a focus on the influence of various regulations on hazard mitigation. There is a very strong connection between development management and hazard mitigation; resource management also contributes to hazard mitigation. Conditions that influence advancement of hazard mitigation at the community level include local leadership, a linkage between well-established ways of doing things and new policies, adaptation to dynamic local conditions, monitoring and compliance strategies tailored to suit local conditions, recognition of local rights, and stakeholders' involvement in developing strategies.

We established a field experiment comparing the responses of four highly-valued cabinet timber species (Cedrela odorata, Agathis robusta, Flindersia brayleyana and Castanospermum australe) to phosphate fertiliser on a soil very low in chemically extractable phosphorus (4 mg P/kg soil). Similar soils derived from Palaeozoic metasediments are widespread throughout the humid tropics of northern Australia, south-east Asia and the south-western Pacific, and are typical of those on many sites available for plantation forestry in the region. Phosphorus fertiliser treatments (ranging from 0 to 300 g P/tree) were applied soon after planting to all four species, as was a basal fertiliser dressing supplying adequate levels of all other mineral nutrients, Two species (F. brayleyana and C. australe) maintained good growth even without additional P and showed little or no response in growth or foliar P concentration to increased P supply. The other two species (C. odorata and A. robusta) responded strongly in both growth and foliar P concentration to increasing P supply. In these responsive species, chemical analysis of foliage at 17 months after planting was shown to have potential diagnostic and prognostic value. Phosphorus concentrations less than 0.308 dry matter (DM) in the petiole plus rachis of young mature leaves of C. odorata, and less than 0.19% DM in the distal needle leaves of A. robusta. were associated with diminished growth of these two species both at the time of sampling and 21 months later. The results indicate that there are significant differences in the ability of tropical tree species to acquire and use phosphorus, and consequently that simple prescriptive applications of phosphorus fertiliser to young plantations, irrespective of soil type or tree species, are often inefficient.

AB Biomass,N,S,P,C, and Ca composition of shoots, litter, roots and coarse organic matter >1.3 mm diam., and <2 mm soil fraction are given for two trials under 61 different fertiliser and grazing treatments on a Pukaki/Tekapo high-country soil after 10-15 years. Effects were primarily related to fertiliser, secondarily to stocking rate, and rarely to the grazing method. While there was an increase in soil C and N and a decrease in C/N ratio of the <2 mm soil fraction with increasing fertiliser rate, the relationships were weak. Spring shoot biomass increased with S and P fertiliser rate and decreased with stocking rate. Surface litter (5-33 t ha(-1)) was slightly greater under lax grazing, but total soil root and coarse organic matter (6-57 t ha(-1)) increased with stocking rate, with an exponential decrease with soil depth. There were only small treatment effects on %N in organic components, %S in organic matter components increased with S fertiliser rates, and %P increased with P fertiliser rates, especially in the litter layer. There were active roots to 40 cm soil depth. The half-life of leaf litter decomposition of 10 species from April to September ranged from 0.2 to 38 years. The decomposition rate of litter was positively correlated with C/N and Ca litter concentration over the first fortnight after deposition and with %S in litter over the next 150 days. Microbial biomass decreased with fertiliser level. An incubation experiment indicated that nitrification was occurring. Grazing management treatments had greater effects on soil organic components than on inorganic components.

AB The nutrient fluxes, pools, and balances for N, S, P, and Ca were estimated for two sheep-grazed mixed species studies on a Pukaki/Tekapo high-country soil from measurements during the 10-15th years following initial development. One compared 30 combinations of 5 superphosphate rates (0-500 kg ha(-1) yr(-1)) x 3 stocking rates x 2 stocking methods x 2 spatial replications; the other compared 27 combinations of P and S fertiliser (0-100 kg element ha(-1) yr(-1)). The stock off-take under zero fertiliser was 1.1, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.4 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) for N, S, P, and Ca, respectively. Fertiliser inputs exceeded stock off-takes by 4-100-fold in fertiliser treatments. The 10-year stock off-take was similar to the 1-year spring shoot pool. C and N were principally in the soil fraction. Estimated N fixation was 150-223 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) in the fertilised treatments. Increases in the components of the S pools in the shoots and soil to 40 cm accounted for 46-56% of the applied S in the dryland fertilised treatments and 21% in the irrigated high fertiliser treatment. Residual elemental S accounted for 11-21% of applied S. Much of the P and Ca were in the coarse organic matter pools. P and Ca pools did not increase in proportion to fertiliser rates. There was an apparent loss of total P to levels similar to double the applied fertiliser rates, possibly from change in datum sampling depth due to measured soil expansion. There was less than 2% movement of nutrients into sheep camps.

AB Fish from lagoon and reef in New Caledonia are mainly caught by artisanal fisheries and subsistence fishing. The present study aimed at estimating these fish standing stocks, at finding the main factors influencing the spatial distribution of these fish, and at estimating the maximum sustainable yield with considerations for socio-economic aspects sensu late. A total of 1406 stations was surveyed in the Northern Province of New Caledonia. Sampling was stratified according to three zones (north, east and west) and three biotopes (coral reefs, near-reef areas and lagoon bottoms). This work demonstrates the existence of important fish stocks of commercial interest in reefal and lagoonal waters of the Northern Province, estimated at about 138 300 t. The standing stocks, which may be considered as non-exploited in the north zone, were mainly composed by large individuals belonging to slow-growing species ('K' strategy). The current catches of fish are globally very low, approximatively 10-times less than the pressure which would achieve a maximum sustainable yield. The characteristics of the local market for fish in New Caledonia, mainly in the Northern Province,:indicate that fish consumption directly reflects fishing pressure. Indeed, subsistence fishing (25.7 kg of fish per inhabitant and per year) represents 92 % of the total fishing pressure, thus the commercial fishing activities may be considered as a minor component. So, it seems that the demography and local feeding habits will probably be the most important factors which will determine the future variations of artisanal fishing activities and status of standing stocks in the northern Province of New Caledonia.

TI Animal production and rainfed agriculture in Asia: potential
   opportunities for productivity enhancement
SO OUTLOOK ON AGRICULTURE
LA English
DT Article
AB Asia is a region of dynamic economic changes, fuelled by rapid population growth, urbanization, increased incomes, demand-led processes and changing consumer preferences for foods of animal origin. The projected total meat and milk consumption levels for 2020 are far in excess of anticipated supplies, and place unprecedented pressure on the management of natural resources (crops, animals, land and water). Increased productivity in the future will need to come from improved per animal performance, appropriate animal production systems, and higher efficiency in the use of feed resources. Unlike the demand-driven, intensive and private-sector-led non-ruminant sector, ruminant production systems have lagged behind in productivity because they are largely in the hands of resource-poor small farmers. Since existing irrigated lands are overused, the potentially important rainfed lands will become increasingly important in the future for productivity enhancement, justifying increased resource use. A strong systems research approach to rainfed agriculture, together with interdisciplinarity, a holistic focus and community-based participation, is necessary. This effort needs to be supported by increased research investment and a policy environment that can provide for major socioeconomic benefits, improved livelihoods of the poorest of the poor, agricultural growth, and environmental sustainability.

TI The itinerary of soil nutrients in Africa: destination anywhere?
SO OUTLOOK ON AGRICULTURE
LA English
DT Article
ID KENYA
AB Despite the accelerating globalization of trade, environmental impacts and information, there remain huge disparities in the availability, cost and use of nutrients for plant production between rich and poor countries. The sustainability of African farming systems gives particular cause for concern, given the high cost and poor market opportunities faced by many small producers. Markets are essential if farmers are to be able to afford the purchase of necessary inputs. Raising productivity within African agriculture must address the challenge of tailoring policy and intervention to the diverse settings, strategies and practices found across the continent. Account must be taken of climatic risk, differences in soil quality, balancing the use of organic and mineral inputs, and returns from farming versus other activities, as well as providing a research and extension framework that supports joint learning with farmers in order to develop more sustainable cropping systems.

ID SHORELINE MANAGEMENT PLANS; STATUTORY APPROACH
AB This paper is concerned with the non-statutory approach to coastal defence in England and Wales. Particular attention is paid to the perceived benefits and shortcomings of both Coastal Defence Groups and Shoreline Management Plans.
   Six Coastal Defence Groups were selected as case studies, representing the major variations between the 18 groups currently evident. Analysis and evaluation of an extensive postal questionnaire survey and semi-structured interview schedule highlighted the key elements in the planning and management framework.
   The payer then puts forward a series of recommendations which are intended to: 1) assist the formulation and implementation of future shoreline management policy; and 2) facilitate improved interaction and co-ordination of this field with wider coastal and land-based initiatives.
   The paper concludes that, although not panacea, there have and will continue to be significant improvements since the emergence of Coastal Defence Groups and Shoreline Management Plans. Not least of these has been the shift towards a more co-ordinated and strategic approach, based within a sustainable longer-term framework.

AB The Wash is a large macrotidal bay located on the eastern side of Great Britain and bounded by three of the most agricultural. fertile counties in England-namely Lincolnshire, Cambridgeshire and North Norfolk. It is drained by four major rivers; the Witham, Welland, Nene and Great Ouse and together they drain approximately 10% of the British Isles.
   Managing the Wash on the Lincolnshire coast is a major task for the Environment Agency. As the main environmental regulator in the UK, it has a duty to work towards sustainable management of land, air and water. In addition to flood defence, it has to balance the needs of water resources, water quality, air quality, fisheries, recreation, conservation and waste regulation.
   In 1996 the Agency published the Wash Shoreline Management Plan [1] and for the first time, the SMP sought to establish coastal defence policies having taken account of natural coastal processes and land use. It concluded that the north side of the Wash was in a delicate balance of accretion and erosion, such that to continue with traditional flood defence construction would have a major impact on the valuable saltmarsh.
   Whilst predecessor bodies had always sought to hold the flood defence Line and in the Wash had actively advanced the line in order to create agricultural land, this was not now an acceptable way forward. In any event the agricultural needs of the UK had altered such that there was not a demand for more farmland. It had been shown on other estuaries in the UK that setting back flood defences and thereby creating saltmarsh helped absorb wave energy and reduce the need for heightened or strengthened flood embankments. Managed Realignment of front line defences was now a serious engineering option which could bring environmental benefits and provide more effective and sustainable flood defences.

AB The implications of the genetical similarities within the Sparidae are of overall interest in the Mediterranean aquaculture. This paper brings the cytological analysis of 10 species of Sparidae belonging to four genera, Dentex, Diplodus, Pagellus and Sparus as an attempt to identify karyologically and assess the similarities among these fish genera. These could imply basic guidelines for successful application in aquaculture, primarily in terms of sustainable aquacultural biotechnology.
   Standard cytogenetical methods were used. Specimen were caught along the southern Adriatic coast. Data were processed using the software STATISTICA.
   All species studied exhibited the modal number of 2n=48. The fundamental number ranged from FN=48 to FN=66. Cluster analysis was conducted to test the level of similarity among the studied species, using karyological data. The genus Pagellus was shown to be the most heterogeneous one, while the genus Diplodus was the most homogenous one. The karyological analysis of the two Dentex species indicated that this genus is rather heterogeneous. D. gibbosus, whose karyological characteristics are shown here for the first time, exhibited the karyotype with just one, while Dentex dentex had four pairs of metacentric chromosomes, thus being similar to Sparus aurata and Diplodus puntazzo.
   This analysis of Sparid karyology indicates a relatively high level of karyological homogeneity within the family. This could imply a rather high possibility of successful intergeneric hybridization, since the data on the karyology of different fish species hybrids indicate that the highest percentage of success were achieved with hybrids whose parents had similar karyological characteristics These data, if combined with ecological and biological characteristics of the species studied, could be well used in hybridization experiments and overall management of the species.

AB With the aim of promoting the wise and sustainable use of the Tay Estuary and adjacent coastal zone, the Tay Estuary Forum is the most recently created of the various coastal fora in Scotland. It severs a c. 200 km coastline of east central Scotland, which is governed by four riparian local authorities. Initiated through the work of a small group of people and launched via a conference in 1997, the Forum raised sufficient financial support from a variety of bodies to appoint a full time project Officer for one year from January 2000. This dedicated appointment has served to energise all aspects of the Forum's work. Perspectives from this newly-formed ICZM voluntary partnership are considered under the headings of participation, finances and the process of forum operation. The experiences of the Tay Estuary Forum have shown that the route towards ICZM is not made any easier by the fact that the voluntary partnership approach to ICZM is now well established in Scotland. The main concern is funding for the future. Continued success of the Forum will depend on its ability robe externally sustainable over the next few years, thereby permitting time for projects to develop, raising its profile and public awareness and gaining a greater more active audience and partnership than hitherto. It is evident that the Tay Estuary Forum is aiming to promote a sustainable environment within an unsustainable system.

AB Island sustainable development planning was promoted in Croatia in 1997 following the adoption of the National Island Development Programme (NIDP) by the Croatian Parliament. The NIDP summarizes economic and demographic processes on the Croatian islands, evaluates existing development level, sets the criteria for and modalities of further development management and lists tasks to be accomplished by the state administration. The NIDP was followed by the Island Act, adopted in 1999. Derived from the NIDP the Act refrazes most of its provisions and requirements and assigns tasks to a number of ministries, government agencies, public enterprises and bodies of local administration and self-government in the six island/mainland counties and their 44 island municipalities/towns.
   The NIDP states that islands stand on a development crossroad from which they can take either a path of fast growth and resource exhaustion or a path of full and sustainable use of their resources. The NIDP stands for the latter, defines island comparative advantages, limiting factors and development principles and goals. The main development goal is defined as complete and sustainable use of island resources coupled with continuous betterment of quality of island life. The NIDP also defines four types of development measures.
   The NIDP and the Island Act define infrastructure and suprastructure programmes to be performed by particular ministries and public enterprises and a set of economic measures aimed at attracting sustainable development investors to islands. It provides a list of sustainable economic activities and clearly shows which investments will be subjected to incentives such as tax exemptions, favourable loans and special transport tariffs. The NIDP and the Island Act also promote "programmes of sustainable development" which are to serve as compulsory development documents for every inhabitated island. In this way the economic programming is brought to the same level as physical planning. The quality of these documents and the abilities of their implementers will soon be on trial.

AB For socio-economic reasons, many rural and forestry areas of Mediterranean Countries suffered from migration of rural population to more industrialised regions. As a consequence, desert is being to be expanded in the abandoned territories, impairing local environment and affecting also the global climate. Most of abandoned lands can be reclaimed for a re-settlement of human communities, alleviating the overpopulation pressure that affects urban areas in many Countries. For re-settlement to be feasible, a sustainable and stable living environment should be created and maintained. This is possible since many abandoned regions have latent resources of water, energy, vegetation and attractive produces which, if properly exploited by means of advanced technologies, could lead to a flourishing of a new and modern rural system. In defining a land reclamation system, an integrated approach should be adopted which takes into account the strong interaction occurring among four sub - systems, i.e., water, energy, agro - sylvi - rural communities, industry. Three steps are deemed necessary for achieving the overall objective:
   1. A short - term step (18 months), consisting in setting a methodology, founded on real Countries' data, for identification of regions susceptible of intervention, and for planning land reclamation operational projects. This methodology will take into account all aspects that may contribute to a successful project implementation with particular emphasis to the deployment of Biomass and other Renewable Energy Sources.
   2. A medium - term step (2 years), consisting in establishing a permanent Working Party for land reclamation involving all the Countries of the Region and all the stakeholders for finding a political umbrella, defining operational projects, searching for funds, mobilising: entrepreneurs, establishing joint - ventures with local industry.
   3. A long - term step (10 years) for implementing the projects.
   Although limited to Mediterranean Countries, a systemic approach to abandoned lands could be of Value for approaching similar problems in developing Countries where at least three kinds of emergencies must be faced: a high migration flux from less developed Countries to more developed ones, overpopulation pressure, environmental impairing. Renewable Energy Sources, in particular biomass, can contribute heavily in solving these problems.

AB Environmental assessment of coastal regions has long been considered predominantly an exercise belonging to the realm of natural sciences, space planning, and, partly, to technology The purpose of environmental assessment has been considered a precursor to environmental management. Environmental management itself has been geared towards elusive goals, the sustainable use of coastal resources and to the prediction of the limiting carrying capacity.
   This paper is addressing the, often neglected, social and cultural components of environmental management. These components impose additional limitations to development. It is recognized that a multidisciplinary approach and interactive procedures are needed to define a crucial parameter: that of the carrying capacity. The social and cultural factors contribute to the assessment framework within which the carrying capacity could possibly be defined. However, there is yet a case to be shown where a practicable assessment of the carrying capacity has been demonstrated. Neglecting or avoiding assessment of this parameter reduces integrated coastal zone management to little more than a catchword phrase. References are made to recent publications in this area.

AB Growing populations imply increasing requirements for water supply and wastewater disposal, as well as the control and management of urban and rural runoff. In Perth, Western Australia, the population is expected to increase from its present level of 1.2 million to over 2 million by 2040. An important requirement for coastal waters of this region is the control of eutrophication and the implementation of strategies to allow for sustainable use of these waters.
   This is particularly relevant, as due to geographic reasons such as soil type and low river flows in summer, as well as historical reasons such as sea level rise over the last 10,000 years, the waters the coast of Perth are clear, shallow, flow to moderate energy and nutrient poor; very similar to Mediterranean waters.
   Enclosed estuaries and bays, such as the Peel-Harvey estuary and the Swan-Canning system where nutrient enrichment is occurring, have required management of nutrient sources as well as environmental manipulation. In contrast, the more exposed coastal waters of metropolitan Perth receive water nutrient loads from ocean outlets and are not similarly affected. Their management is based on a detailed understanding of the nutrient dynamics of the area, to ensure requisite environmental values are being maintained.

AB A user-friendly, five-stage protocol is presented as an aid to the identification of the sustainable development potential of undeveloped coasts. It is a knowledge based, pre-Environmental Impact Assessment scoping scheme advising the early involvement of scientists in site identification. Following the identification of Process Defined Management Units (PDMUs), it is designed to aid the identification of zones of development potential, which are ranked according to sensitivity. The underlying rationale is the recognition of extensive, worldwide insensitive coastal zone development. Future developments must learn from past mistakes and this protocol is a suggested route towards more informed decision making.

AB Some of the estuaries of the Basque Country (Northern Spain) have been areas of exploitation of clam populations, both by professional and illegal fishermen. There is a real possibility of overfishing, therefore the Department of Fisheries of the Basque Government needs to: (a) understand the situation relating to these populations; and (b) provide a tool to establish the most adequate management for the exploitation of clams.
   In order to simulate different alternatives for the exploitation, based upon scientific data on the population, the best tool available is a system dynamics model. Here the VENSIM(R) model was employed, utilising data on clam populations: summer stock in the Plentzia estuary, in 1998; winter stock in 1999; biomass in summer and winter; area occupied by the species; length and weight class distribution; number of fishermen; mean of biomass captured by the fishermen; natural mortality, by length class; maturation; fertility rate; etc. There exist previous experiences in modelling clam exploitation in the Mundaka estuary (1). These experiences have been improved in this paper.
   Following validation of the model, after running it for 1 and 10 years, some cases were simulated. This analysis was undertaken in order to establish the effect of modifying the number of fishermens, the aperture-close season of captures, and the minimum sustainable biomass. This approach is an initial proposal, which tries to establish the sustainable exploitation of the clam populations in the Basque Country.

AB While expecting three quarters of the world's population to live within 60km of the shoreline by 2020, the point at issue is how to protect our coastal resources. Currently, the role of economy in the environmental management is clearly defined and often accentuated as a priority. The fundamental question whether to punish or stimulate the users, is gradually reaching the answer. Regulative instruments, most widely used in environmental management, have shown poor results. According to the experience gained in different countries, the economic instruments with their potential incentive role are effective tools for the management of coastal resources and of the environment in general. Some successful examples of the use of these instruments will be presented in this paper There is no general answer on how to organise the application of these instruments. The level at which they should be organised depends on the organisation of the government and on the institutional culture of a particular country.
   Numerous international environmental agencies and organisations are emphasizing the enhancement of the use of economic instruments as their priority. An example is the new UNEP programme, SAP MED. One of its components is to develop and implement the economic instruments which are supposed to take actions in fighting to the land-based pollution by self-financing at the national level through revenue generation.
   Following this direction the application of economic instruments should be integrated in the planning and management of coastal natural resources on the national, regional and global level.

AB Croatia's islands represent the Mediterranean's second largest island area. Official 1991 census records show that 67 islands were inhabited with a total area 3,062 square kilometres. About 15 islands are temporarily populated which together with non-populated islands cover 143 square kilometres.
   During the past decades Croatia's islands have drawn the attention of many scientists from various scientific disciplines, evident in today's accumulation of research experience, in particular, methodology and new interdisciplinary scientific fields, e.g. nisology. Research by various scientific institutions confirm the alarming situation present on Croatian islands. Revitalisation is needed. Different solutions offered are very often somewhat dispersed. Research shows that a solution for the declining islands' population, even for the most seriously affected areas, can be sort through the development of tourism, agriculture and the fishing industry, etc. Research confirms that this should be urgently realised.
   Croatia's islands have unspoilt and ecologically clean nature, and provide a rich potential for the development of various forms of tourism. Rural tourism, as many other forms, suffers from a neglect among tourism researchers. Main component of the paper is an analysis of the natural and cultural resources and formation of the concept of sustainable development and regeneration strategies on the islands.

AB The new approach to the Croatian energy sector planning is founded on the counties as basic social units. The Adriatic littoral area has its specific energy needs and its development is based on the economic branches of tourism and agriculture, vitally dependent on clean environment.
   This work presents the new approach to the definition of the role of renewable sources in the sustainable development of the Adriatic littoral area. The place and the role of energy efficiency and renewable energy sources are considered within the energy supply of the Split-Dalmatia County as well as their influence on sustainable development.
   Presented are energy potentials of small hydropower plants, solar energy, wind energy and bioenergy, energy efficiency and cogeneration, including energy efficiency in building construction. Fields of application, economic evaluation and necessary measures and organisation of program implementation are described. The model presented can be applied to all coastal counties, and with minor alterations to all other counties.

AB The protection of nature and the environment plays an exceptionally vital role in coastal zone management since it is more than evident that natural resources and a preserved environment serve as a basis for future development.
   This work provides a review of the biodiversity, environmental protection and status of a number of environmental factors in the County of Primoje and Gorski Kotar. Regional planning, as a discipline which has traditionally represented the basis for coastal zone management, is experiencing a transformation through the introduction of environmental protection legislation aiming to achieve sustainable development. Based on such principles, the following new documents have been prepared: The Report on the State of the Envirnoment and the Regional plan which include recommendations for further activities in the coastal area and whose realization is a joint assignment and challenge for the 21(st) century.

AB Energy is often mentioned as one of the basic prerequisites for any economic development. As a part of an integral approach to coastal zone sustainable development, energy related issues shouldn't be neglected. If high environmental standards are to be met, only new and clean technologies must be used. Renewable energies can therefore play a significant role in tourism sensitive coastal areas. Specially, wind energy technology passed intensive and dynamic development last ten years, and now is mature enough for economically viable utilisation.
   All recent studies on wind energy potentials in Croatia have proved that Adriatic coastal zone is the most prospective area for its utilisation in Croatia. The most common application is electric energy production either for selling energy directly to the consumers or for usage in wind driven desalinisation systems. Minimum 1 TWh of wind potentials, along with enormous solar potential, existing and future hydro power plants and a gas presence as a matter of high civilisation level, could sufficiently fulfil the energy needs of Adriatic coastal region.
   A good platform for the realisation of such energy policy is recently proposed Energy Sector Development Strategy of the Republic of Croatia, which comprises organisational, legislative, institutional and all other changes necessary for restructuring and reorganising the Croatian energy sector. Referring to wind energy, mechanism of realisation is the ENWIND scheme (or National Wind Energy Utilisation Program). The paper gives main ideas on the ENWIND program, expected benefits and achievements so far. Finally, some identified barriers will be discussed, and future activities described in brief.

AB The exceptional geological landscape of the Gulf of Orosei (central-east Sardinia), characterised by many karstic features, and the faunistic and floristic elements have made of this area among the most requested tourist resorts of Sardinia, causing problems of nature conservation and preservation in the last twenty years.
   Among the most vulnerable localities can be reminded several white sandy beaches (Cala Fuili, Cala Luna, Cala Sisine, Cala Mariolu, Cala Biriola, Cala Goloritze, etc.), massively visited during the summer season and the Bue Marine coastal show cave, having almost 90.000 visitors from April to October.
   The purpose of this study is to evaluate the scientific and natural characteristics of this coastal environment and in particular of the pocket-beaches in order to obtain an estimation of their tourist carrying capacity.
   In conclusion the Authors present their model of sustainable tourist development for this area and in particular for these -beaches.

AB The Portuguese Coast is 845 km long, not accounting for the contour of the estuaries and lagoons, and can be divided in two main sections: the west coast, facing the Atlantic (675 km), and the south coast (170 km) running W-E to the Spanish border. There is historical evidence that the coast has undergone important morphologic evolution in the past resulting in a more regular coastline with few indentations.
   Within the framework of a sustainable coastal management, the Portuguese Coast Authority launched a programme to may the land at risk on the coast. The idea is not new and has been in the law since 1971. The time is opportune. Since 1993, several management plans have been developed for coastal stretches, covering the entire coast, and data and relevant material about the coast collected in the meantime.
   For mapping proposes and due to the length of the coast a division was made in coastal stretches that correspond approximately to the littoral cells that can be identified. Natural features and man made structures were used to define littoral cells. Ten littoral cells were identified on the coast. This methodology proved successful because most of the erosion problems are related to the littoral drift and the analysis should consider the whole of a cell.
   When identifying land at risk three main threats were considered: erosion, flooding and dune migration. Coastal erosion is particularly important in soft low-laying coastal stretches in the west coast. In some locations severe erosion rates, higher than 10 m/yr, were measured based on the comparison of coastline position at different dates. Some cases of land prone to flooding were also identified. Dune migration proved not to be a real threat in the Portuguese coast.
   The maps were constructed using ESRI products Arcinfo/Arcview to import material from different sources and formats. The analysis and interpretation for mapping the land at risk was done taking into account: the morphology of the coast, the geology, the coastline orientation, the natural protections, the local wave climate, the past events, the evolution trends and the field work. The threats are classified in three categories: low, medium and high. The presence of most of the coastal protection structures were considered in the mapping exercise.
   The maps "of land at risk" are delivered in CD-ROM using a Digital Map Publishing Service from IDS-Information Delivery Service. To view the maps absolutely no GIS or mapping experience or knowledge is needed. The Windows interface is similar to most applications and the only requirement is for the end user to have a PC running Microsoft Windows.

AB The paper presents the characteristics and hitherto results of the ongoing "Malta" project, implemented by MAP-UNEP within its Coastal Areas Management Programme (CAMP). The project is the first of the new cycle, focused on sustainable development, containing innovative Elements concerning: methodologies and tools specific fdr sustainable development; project activities; structure; and organization. Basic information is presented about: MAP involvement in integrated coastal management; CAMP; methodology of Integrated Coastal and Marine Areas Management (ICAM); and the concept and structure of CAMP projects.
   In the 1987-2000 period, MAP completed four pilot projects and eight CAMP projects in Albania, Croatia, Egypt, Greece, Israel, Syria, Tunisia and Turkey; the projects in Malta and Lebanon are ongoing.
   The dominating problems in Malta are: intensive, partly uncontrolled, development; pressures for further expansion; competition for coastal resources, dominating role of tourism in national economy, population increase, settlements expansion, illegal building, poor enforcement of regulations. The consequences are: resource overexploitation, loss of habitats, endangered biodiversity, pollution, soil erosion, destruction of marine parks, unsustainable practices of tourism. The "Malta" project is structured in individual activities: coordination/integration, data management, participatory programme, systemic sustainability analysis, sustainable coastal management, marine conservation areas, water resource management, erosion/desertification control management, tourism and health. After a 2-years preparatory period the project started in November 1999, the initial implementation phase was completed in June 2000. Hitherto results indicate good quality of interim outputs, providing basis for the formulation of the development policy, confirming the project sustainability and conceptual framework.

AB Among the many benefits that could be allocated to bioenergy, such as sustainability, carbon dioxide neutrality, availability and controllable supply also the factors increasing employment and earnings in rural areas should be mentioned, in the political vocabulary it is expressed as "creation of jobs", the economists and planners talk of "income formation" and "employment".
   New job openings, especially in the coastal zone and on islands are imperatives of the Croatian economic and social policies. Islands are a great treasure and special value in Croatia. At the moment their potential is being poorly made use of, their originality insufficiently protected, their opportunities not encouraged or even discouraged. Utilising biomass energy potential yields multiple benefits: it not only enables energy production with minimal environmental impact, but it also offers considerable possibilities for more job openings and can positively affect local and national economy, which has been recognised as one of major advantages of the BIOEN National Energy Programme.
   Preliminary results show that energy production from biomass could offer approximately 6000 new jobs in the year 2030 in total in Croatia. When considering biomass utilization for energy production for Croatian islands the most interesting are the following systems, which also can considerably contribute in achieving a number of different socio-economic benefits:
   Olive-oil refinery waste fired small cogeneration and heating systems (as additional fuel all other biomass types can be used),
   Biogas production from waste waters,
   Utilization of forestry waste and wooden mass from areas destroyed by forest fires.

AB With new developments in Albania a new metropolitan area in Tirana-Durres Region is going to be the most important inhabited region in Albania, where more than 1/3 of the population of the country is concentrated (about 1 million people). Two biggest cities situated at both ends of this region: Tirana (capital) and Durres (The biggest port of the country) nowadays are going to be linked together as a great metropolitan area. The new developments have to take into consideration the seismic risk reduction of expected strong ground motions for a sustainable development of this area.
   Durres City with about 100.000 inhabitants, situated on Durres bay on Adriatic coast, on very poor thick Quaternary sediments, represents one of the oldest cities. Durachium. The antique name of Durres, was one of the most important cities of Rome and Byzantine Empires. During it's long history of civilization the city suffered from strong earthquakes. One of the strongest earthquakes was the earthquake of the 1273-year, after which inhabitants of Durres were forced to leave the city and settle at Berat. The latest disastrous earthquake was that of December 17, 1926 (M=6.2, I-o=IX).
   Taking into account it's tectonic setting, on Adriatic seacoast, there is of interest the experiences got by big Albania-Montenegro earthquake of April 15, 1979 (Ms=6.8, Io=IX+).
   From seismic hazard point of view, Durres City, located close to the Durres Bay on Adriatic coast, on very poor thick Quaternary sediments, represents one of the most dangerous areas of coastal zone in Albania, with a lot of problems concerning expected seismic strong ground motions and soil instabilities as:
   Fault rupturing on free surface,
   New and induced landslides,
   Induced liquefaction phenomena on poor sandy deposits of Durres lagoon and Durres Bay area.
   Tirafia City, the capital of Albania, situated on Tirana-Ishmi Quaternary Depression, and partially on Tirana hills (of Neogen age), at legs of Dajti mountain (Cretaceous age)(1600 m high), represents an area where expected seismic hazard has to be taken into consideration for its long term and medium term further development.
   Tirana City has to experience different strong ground shakings during future expected earthquakes, which consequences and characteristics will depend on many factors as:
   The local site conditions: great thickness of surface layers of poorer sediments, poor layers of former swamps with shallow underground water level,
   The characteristics of active faults surrounding the City or just beneath it,
   The underground topography (steep slopes and sharpness) of baserocks.
   The results of studies carried out, were checked by the consequences of a moderate earthquake of January 9, 1988 (M=5.5, Io=VII+) that hit Tirana City.

AB The concept of structure is central to Giddens's structuration theory because it apparently accounts for the reproduction of the social system without derogating the lay actor in functionalist or structuralist fashion. In fact, the concept of structure involves the very derogation of the lay actor which Giddens highlights as the principal error of these objectivist social theories and which he wishes to avoid. However, although Giddens fails to recognize it, the concept of "practical consciousness" which Giddens also regards as central to structuration theory avoids this relapse into objectivism and offers a route to a sustainable social theory which highlights the agency of social actors.

AB Sustainability or collapse follow from the success or failure of problem-solving institutions. The factors that lead to long-term success or failure in problem solving have received little attention, so that this fundamental activity is poorly understood. The capacity of institutions to solve problems changes over time, suggesting that a science of problem solving, and thus a science of sustainability, must be historical. Complexity is a primary problem-solving strategy, which is often successful in the short-term, but cumulatively may become detrimental to sustainability. Historical case studies illustrate different outcomes to long-term development of complexity in problem solving. These cases clarify future options for contemporary societies: collapse, simplification, or increasing complexity based on increasing energy subsidies.

DE economics & finance; landfill; waste management & disposal
AB The pressures of recent UK and European legislation upon the waste hierarchy have to be balanced against the three coexisting elements of environment, economics and society in the quest for sustainable development. Disposal to landfill will surely become the 'least preferred option for disposal' due to both the implementations of national waste strategies and the reduction in availability of suitable landfill sites. This paper demonstrates, however, that the use of landfill taxes has not yet succeeded in redressing the balance of reversing the waste hierarchy, with three national examples indicating an increase in disposal to landfill despite considerable tax levies.

DE recycling of materials; waste management & disposal
AB A fundamental aim of EC and UK waste policy is to make waste management more sustainable by moving it up the waste hierarchy, the emphasis changing from disposal to recycling and recovery. This approach is based on the concept of adopting the best practicable environmental option (BPEO) for individual waste;streams and dealing with waste as close as possible to its place of production (the proximity principle). Change is being driven by legislative and economic instruments such as the Landfill Directive and landfill tax, which seek to restrict the use of landfill for biodegradable municipal waste and make alternatives financially viable in the market-glace. These developments have focused attention on the role of composting as the BPEO for dealing with organic waste, This paper focuses on the potential role of centralized waste composting as part of an integrated municipal waste strategy, It reviews composting options in general terms, including the alternative technology of anaerobic digestion, and comments on the role they can play in a sustainable integrated municipal waste system.

AB Decision-making to determine the preferred way of upgrading or constructing pew developments is becoming more complex. In the drive towards sustainability, the social, economic and environmental aspects now share equal weighting with the technical and cost-effective elements of each option. The process of evaluating trade-offs between, say, cost benefits and environmental or social disbenefits, has always been difficult, and it is now also important to demonstrate openness in decision-making, so that stakeholders can see the option selected is in fact the best possible within the constraints set. A simple multi-criteria approach, known as WISPS (wastewater integrated system performance score) has been applied in a theoretical study using actual data to decide which of four catchments in a Scottish water authority area should be prioritized for improvement. This approach follows closely the process which the engineers would use implicitly Ito make decisions, but has the benefit of formalizing the process, thus showing how these decisions were achieved. The robustness of the approach has been tested using two software packages: one or risk assessment (@ RISK) utilizing Monte Carlo simulation; and the other, a complex multi-criteria decision support tool (ELECTRE). The more complex analytical approaches demonstrated that the simple WISPS method produced reliable results.

DE recycling of materials; research & development; roads & highways
AB In the last few years there has been growing concern about the increasing demand placed upon finite resources. Many organizations and types of industry now encourage the practice of sustainability. With the introduction of the landfill tax, aggregate lax and the increasing cost of bitumen, highway authorities must now consider other methods to achieve better value for money. In highway engineering, reduction in use of aggregate and bitumen resources can be achieved by better understanding of pavement design and choice of materials used. It may also be facilitated by the reuse of bituminous materials that have been removed from the pavement structure as part of a maintenance programme. This is termed reclaimed asphalt pavement (RAP) and is permitted in hot-mix asphalt in accordance with the Specification of Highway Works Clause 902. A combination of these two approaches will enable the maximum reuse of this type of material without urning the highway into what may he termed a waste disposal location. This paper shows how clients such as local highway authorities are maximizing reuse opportunities. It also gives an example of how suppliers are now collaborating with academic institutions to develop new technologies to solve the client's problem. Two experimental trial road sections are detailed which were designed and constructed to evaluate the use of RAP in a hot and a cold bituminous mixture. This as enabled the authors to quantify the benefit of using recycled materials and technologies.

DE waste incineration; energy production; pollution; superheaters; real
   gasification; fossil fuels
AB Energy production, waste disposal, and the minimization of pollution are key problems that must be addressed for sustainable cities of the future. For the foreseeable future, fossil fuels will be the major source of energy, but due to the dwindling resources of oil and gas and the need for fuel security, coal is likely to become the major source of energy for heat and power. The need for clean coal technology precludes, the construction of new conventional pulverized fuel power stations and new technology is required. Coincidentally, the total heat content of municipal waste in Britain now totals about 30% of that of the coal used for present needs. The current best technology for the low pollution disposal of this waste is incineration with the production of electricity, and heat for district heating. Unfortunately, current electrical generation efficiencies for coal burning plant and waste incinerators are only about 37% and 20% respectively.
   In this paper various pyrotechnology systems are discussed which integrate the use of fossil fuels with waste processing in order to provide superior electrical power production efficiencies.
   The optimized integration of steam from an incinerator with the steam part of a conventional gas-fired combined cycle can provide a greater overall efficiency than that achieved if the fuels are used independently.
   Furthermore, a high temperature heat exchanger can be used in a recuperative gas turbine to achieve generation efficiencies of 60% without the use of a steam cycle.
   One integrated pyrotechnology system is proposed in which the steam from a conventional 'mass burn' waste incinerator is gasified with coal to yield a mixture of (environmentally clean) carbon monoxide and hydrogen which in turn is used in a combined gas turbine/steam cycle. Perhaps more significant than the efficiency improvement is the dramatic effect on pollution control. The massive investment in flue-gas clean-up in a conventional pulverized fuel power plant is no longer required. Sulphur, in particular, is removed in saleable, elemental form in place of landfill of the vast amounts of calcium sulphate presently produced. In the longer term, 'excess enthalpy' reaction principles may yield benefits for electrical energy production from the combustion or direct gasification of certain wastes.
   In addition to flue-gas clean-up, the need to clean or eliminate all discharges from the overall Waste, Energy and Pollution Control (WEP) plant requires the elimination of liquid effluents and conversion of ashes to usable products by thermal treatment. High waste transport costs and low pollution leads to the conclusion that plants based on these technologies can be acceptably located within cities. This not only reduces the electrical distribution losses but also permits the 'waste' heat to be used in the plant locality resulting in overall CHP efficiencies greater than 80%.

AB This article defines social resilience as the ability of groups or communities to cope with external stresses and disturbances as a result of social, political and environmental change. This definition highlights social resilience in relation to the concept of ecological resilience which is a characteristic of ecosystems to maintain themselves in the face of disturbance. There is a clear link between social and ecological resilience, particularly for social groups or communities that are dependent on ecological and environmental resources for their livelihoods. But it is not clear whether resilient ecosystems enable resilient communities in such situations. This article examines whether resilience is a useful characteristic for describing the social and economic situation of social groups and explores potential links between social resilience and ecological resilience. The origins of this interdisciplinary study in human ecology, ecological economics and rural sociology are reviewed, and a study of the impacts of ecological change on a resource-dependent community in contemporary coastal Vietnam in terms of the resilience of its institutions is outlined.

AB The aim of this study was to determine households' levels of prioritization and perception of malaria, ordinary mosquito nets and insecticide-treated nets (ITNs).
   A cross-sectional survey was conducted in five malaria hole-endemic communities in Enugu State, South-eastern Nigeria. The household heads or the representatives from randomly selected households were interviewed, using a pretested interviewer-administered questionnaire.
   The majority of the respondents had a good knowledge about malaria and the use of ordinary mosquito nets to prevent malaria. However, few knew about the existence of ITNs. Most respondents also stated that malaria was a priority problem and perceived some risk of contracting it. Despite the high level of knowledge about the use of mosquito nets, only 14.0%, 15.7%, 9.6% and 8.0% of the respondents from four of the communities had ever purchased any type of mosquito nets, except in Orba where the proportion was 50.3%. However, more than 80% in all the communities expressed a desire to buy insecticide-treated mosquito nets for the prevention of mosquito bites.
   There was considerable knowledge about malaria and the use of mosquito nets to prevent it. There were also high levels of prioritization of the disease, mosquito nets and ITNs which signalled the possibility of establishing sustainable community-based ITN programmes, especially as households wanted to buy the ITNs.

TI A radical new development for sustainable waste management in the UK:
   the introduction of local authority Best Value legislation
SO RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING
LA English
DT Article
DE best value; municipal solid waste; waste management industry; local
   authority; compulsory competitive tendering; contracts
AB Municipal solid waste (MSW) represents approximately 7% of the total amount of waste produced annually in the UK and the statutory responsibilities for this waste lie with local authorities. The waste services provided by local authorities are mediated via contracts between the authority and service provider under the compulsory competitive tendering (CCT) regime. New regulations are now coming into place under the label of 'Best Value', whereby local authorities will be obliged by law to consult local people on their services, review and report on how they have performed against targets, and embrace quality within their services. Best Value will impinge on the waste management industry by demanding the continuous improvement of their services in both quality and cost terms. This research has shown that there are eight key issues identified from a survey of different stakeholders for the management of MSW, arising from the forthcoming Best Value legislation. In overall order, they are working arrangements (most important), investment and resources, performance and benchmarking, consultation, innovation, contractual terms, consolidation and finally diversification (least important): these are analysed from each stakeholder's standpoint. The research illustrates that new working arrangements between the local authority and the contractor will be encouraged with contracts setting demanding targets for the management of MSW within a continuous improvement framework. Innovation and flexibility will be essential for contractors to reach these targets. There will be an increasing trend towards integrated waste management contracts, which will require substantial injections of capital and resources in order for local authorities to meet national and local targets for MSW. Diversification and consolidation will also affect sections of the waste management industry and company mergers will increase. Local authorities consider Best Value as a key driver for reaching targets to reduce the amount of MSW currently landfilled and for the introduction of more sustainable waste management practices in the UK.

AB The detailed characterization of household waste in the city of Uberlandia, Central Brazil, reveals the presence of 72 weight percent biodegradable organic matter. For the first time, this research contributes data on Uberlandia to national statistics. A new concept of reporting household waste composition was employed. The effect of informal collection was considered. A better estimate of the true generation rate of household waste in this country resulted. Technical and administrative shortcomings of the present models for household waste management were identified. In order to correct them, the philosophy of divided collection was developed, and the corresponding management model is detailed. The model was applied to a test community. Experiments were conducted with behavior management of people and with collection and sorting of waste. The model was deemed functional. II opens the prospect of diverting 84% of waste from landfill.

AB This research was conducted during the 1994/95 and 1995/96 growing seasons (Oct./Apr.), at the Estacao Experimental de Ituporanga/EPAGRI - SC, aiming to evaluate the pasture dynamics of 'Mott' dwarf elephantgrass (MDE) under four levels of forage on offer (FO). The actual levels of green leaf lamina dry matter (GLLDM) were 3.8; 7.5; 10.2 and 14.0 kg/100 kg LW/day, under continuous grazing, using steers of 8 to 10 mo through the put-and-take technique. A completely randomized block design with two replications was used. Forage on offer established average residues for green leaf lamina dry matter (RGLLDM) of 722, 1537, 2332 and 2542 kg/ha, respectively. The green leaf lamina dry matter accumulation, ground cover, plant diameter, tiller weight, plant height and internode length were increased by higher FO. Lower levels of FO increased soil apparent density and decreased in soil total porosity, and root system, with higher encroachment of annual species on MDE pasture. Forage on offer of 10 to 11 kg GLLDM/100 kg LW/day (RGLLDM of 2000 to 2300 kg/ha) allows for sustainable pasture condition of MDE, under continuous stocking.

The FO established average residues for GLLDM (RGLLDM) of 722, 1537, 2332 and 2542 kg/ha, respectively. Increasing FO conditioned accretion on the rate of GLLDM accumulation/ha/day and on the forage density. The FO of 11.3 kg GLLDM/100 kg LW/day (RGLLDM of 2200 kg/ha) maximized the animal performance at 1.06 kg average daily gain yield 5.6 kg of LWG/ha/day under sustainable JADE pasture conditions, on continuous grazing.

DT Article
AB This paper aims to give a comprehensive overview of the disinflationary process in Hungary during the second half of the 1990s. After the implementation of the much needed "Bokros" stabilization program in early 1995, sustainable disinflation was proclaimed as the chief goal of Hungarian monetary policy in the medium and long run. The National Bank of Hungary's disinflationary strategy is analyzed from theoretical and empirical viewpoints. Emphasis is laid on the need for economic policy and, in particular, monetary policy to be credible. We also emphasize the central role that the preannounced crawling band will play in achieving low one-digit inflation in the years to come. The effects of financial liberalization, especially on the room for manoeuver of Hungarian monetary authorities, is also discussed.

AB Ecology has a major responsibility in solving environmental problems In Mexico, scientific institutions need to contribute more to the practical use of their research findings, especially with regard to the rural management of ecosystems. Based on the framework of the Ecological Information System, two surveys were conducted among ecologists and nongovernmental organizations in Mexico. It was found that ecology has a great deal to contribute to environmental problem solving and that nongovernmental organizations function as links between science and rural producers, such as agriculturists cattle ranchers,forest extractors, hunters, gatherers, and fishermen, although these interactions should be strengthened Suggestions are made for the design of new forms of communicating science within scientific institutions that contribute to the utilization of scientific results.

AB Popular medical knowledge and practice exist in forms that people are able to remember, and that they use to manage their daily lives. This knowledge is fundamentally practical and relates to the patterns of everyday life and the rhythms of the body. The broad "polythetic" concepts of this knowledge system are typically drawn from both dominant and other medical knowledges, and combined in pragmatic, mnemonic ways that constitute a hybrid system. Such popular medical knowledge is attuned to local, family and cultural patterns of medical and other authority, and to the personal dispositions and environmental contexts of its users. Health promoters and educators who understand these formal, embodied and familiar dimensions of popular knowledge can potentially mimic this knowledge system, making their interventions a sustainable part of everyday family life.

AB With the growth of programs aimed at participatory development and stakeholder-based approaches to natural resources management, there is increasing interest in the development of indicators of environmental quality. These indicators not only allow local management of natural resources, but can also be useful as a tool for local empowerment in issues of natural resources management. They can be helpful to local people trying to determine whether community activities are degrading or improving environmental integrity and can help to widen the circle of people in the community concerned about natural resource issues.
   A stumbling block, however, is that indicators that are considered scientifically accurate are often dependent on larger environmental bureaucratic structures to develop this information. These structures are often lacking in rural communities; thus alternative indicators are needed.
   Various efforts have developed locally meaningful indicators that are scientifically valid as indicative of ecosystem states and changes. Natural resources indicators are part of a larger project of sustainable community development.

AB Residual mineral N after the dry season (DS) crop in an intensive rainfed lowland is lost upon flooding for rice (Oryza sativa L.) planting. The conservation and recycling of this N are essential for maintaining groundwater quality and system sustainability. Experiments conducted in rice-sweet pepper (Capsicum annuum L.) cropping systems in farmers' fields aimed (i) to quantify the Levels of soil mineral N after the incorporation of residues of different dry-to-wet (DTW) transition crops in combination with two formulations of fertilizer N, as well as their effects on rice yields and N use efficiencies, and (ii) to estimate the soil N balance. Significant amounts of NH4-N accumulated in soil at 15 d after incorporation of residues of indigo (Indigofera tinctoria L.) alone (12 kg ha(-1)) and indigo mixed with mungbean (Vigna radiata L.) residue (24 kg ha(-1)), and at 60 d after incorporation of maize (Zea mays L.) residue (8 kg ha(-1)). Soil NH4-N in treatments with maize residue was lower than that from indigo and mungbean, but it was improved, when maize residue was mixed with fertilizer N. Nitrate N peaked in the upper soil leger before flooding occurred, followed by its Leaching and disappearance later. Crop residues incorporated in the plot maintained low NO3 throughout the soil profile. The crops during DTW transition reduced N losses by 33 to 72%, and residue incorporation supplied N equivalent to 87 kg ha(-1) to rice. The results suggest that a transition crop alone cannot completely reduce the N losses; therefore, strategies for reducing N fertilizer rates to better match N demand of the DS crop are needed.

AB The development of sustainable forestry practices and credible certification systems relies on continuous monitoring of indicators. In the present study, carried out at the Petawawa Research Forest (Ontario, Canada), we evaluated the impacts of three intensive silvicultural treatments: scarification, fertilization, and herbicide treatment, applied alone or in combination-on indicators of organic layer quality, foliar nutrition, and tree growth-10 yr after establishment of eastern white pine (Pinus strobus L.) and white spruce [Picea glauca (Moench) Voss] plantations. We compared these 10-yr results with measurements made 3 to 4 yr after plantation establishment. In both 1989 and 1996, the herbicide treatment had the greatest effect on organic layer quality. In 1996, compared with the no-treatment control, herbicide application reduced organic C mass by 46%, total N mass by 15%, and acid phosphatase activity by 63%. These negative effects were offset when herbicide was applied in combination with fertilizer. The negative impart of herbicide on microbial biomass C noted in 1990 was no longer evident in 1996. In herbicide-treated plots, the nitrate-dominated cycle observed 1989-1990 was replaced by an ammonium-dominated cycle in 1996. Although herbicide application negatively affected soil quality, it increased tree growth and generally improved foliar nutrition; thus organic layer and tree responses were not correlated. The indicators used were sensitive to changes in the ecosystem over time and signaled soil impacts that could have consequences for long-term productivity.

AB Forest soil Ca depletion through leaching and vegetation uptake may threaten long-term sustainability of forest productivity in the southeastern USA. This study was conducted to assess Ca pools and fluxes in a representative southern Piedmont forest to determine the soil Ca depletion rate. Soil Ca storage, Ca inputs in atmospheric deposition, and outputs in soil leaching and vegetation uptake were investigated at the Panola Mountain Research Watershed (PMRW) near Atlanta, GA. Average annual outputs of 12.3 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) in uptake into merchantable wood and 2.71 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) soil leaching exceeded inputs in atmospheric deposition of 2.23 kg ha(-1) yr(-1). The annual rate of Ca uptake into merchantable wood exceeds soil leaching losses by a factor of more than five. The potential for primary mineral weathering to pro,ide a substantial amount of Ca inputs is low. Estimates of Ca replenishment through mineral weathering in the surface 1 m of soil and saprolite was estimated to be 0.12 kg ha(-1) yr(-1). The weathering rate in saprolite and partially weathered bedrock below the surface 1 m is similarly quite low because mineral Ca is largely depleted. The soil Ca depletion rate at PMRW is estimated to be 12.7 kg ha(-1) yr(-1). At PMRW and similar hardwood-dominate forests in the Piedmont physiographic province, Ca depletion will probably reduce soil reserves to less than the requirement for a merchantable forest stand in approximate to 80 yr. This assessment and comparable analyses at other southeastern USA forest sites suggests that there is a strong potential for a regional problem in forest nutrition in the long term.

TI Yields and nitrogen dynamics in a rice-wheat system using green manure
   and inorganic fertilizer
SO SOIL SCIENCE SOCIETY OF AMERICA JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
ID CROPPING SYSTEMS; SOILS; TRANSFORMATIONS; RESIDUE; TEXTURE
AB Integrating fertilizer N (FN) with legume green manures (GR I) can foster sustainable and environmentally sound agricultural systems in subtropical, semiarid soils low in organic matter. A 4-yr replicated field experiment with irrigated rice (Oryza sativa L.) and wheat(Triticum aestivum L.) rotations was conducted on a sandy loam soil in the Punjab of India to evaluate the effects of incorporating cowpea (Vigna unguiculata L.) or sesbania (Sesbania aculeata L.) GM on crop productivity, N-use efficiency, and NO3 leaching. Rice grain yields with pretransplant incorporation of 20 and 40 Mg GM ha(-1) (GM(20) and GM(40)) ranged from 5.18 to 5.81 Mg ha(-1), which were equivalent to the 5.40 Mg ha(-1) obtained with 120 kg FN ha(-1) (FN120). Rice yield with 60 kg FN ha(-1) (FN60) and GM(20) was double the control yield and 6% greater than the FN120 treatment. Nitrogen utilization by rice was greater for GM(20) than FN, as indicated by greater fertilizer N equivalents and an apparent N recovery by rice of 79 vs. 63%. While FN had no residual effects, residual GM produced greater wheat yields, indicating that FN applied to wheat could be reduced by 25%. Soil NO3-N leaching to 60 cm in the rice crop was apparently used by the subsequent wheat crop, which has a deeper and more extensive rooting system. After 4 yr, use of FN120 for both crops resulted in 35 kg of residual NO3-N ha(-1) in the 150 cm soil profile (74% below 90 cm), whereas only 19 kg NO3-N ha(-1) remained with GM(20) plus FN60. Use of GM(20) with FN60 for a rice-wheat rotation demonstrated greater yields of rice and wheat, 25 to 50% reduction in fertilizer N use, and decreased potential for groundwater NO3 contamination.

AB The eastern wild turkey ((Meleagris gallopavo silvestris) experienced population declines in the United States beginning in the 19th century and continuing through the early 20th century. Transgeographic reintroduction efforts have reestablished eastern wild turkeys throughout most of their historic range but effects of reintroductions on genetic composition of resulting populations are unclear. Most reintroduced populations are maintaining self-sustainable populations. However, for unknown reasons, the population in southeastern Oklahoma decreased by 77% from 1980 to 1994. We used multi-focus DNA fingerprinting to evaluate levels of similarity, heterozygosity, and allelic diversity within and among wintering flocks occurring on the Pushmataha Wildlife Management Area in southeastern Oklahoma. Results from two restriction enzyme-probe combinations revealed mean similarity, heterozygosity, and allelic diversity similar to those in other outbred avian populations. Therefore, the decline of wild turkeys in southeastern Oklahoma is not related to reduced genetic variability, but may be due to biotic and abiotic factors not accounted for in this study.

SO SYSTEM DYNAMICS REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
AB This article highlights the strength of the basic system dynamics tools (system structure, unquantified variables, the reference mode, and Beverage points) by testing the original World2 (1970) and World3 (1972) analyses against 30 years of history. Critical feedback structures in those models are revisited in the context of the current 'sustainable development' agenda. Time cannot yet confirm or reject the "overshoot and collapse" reference mode of behaviour for the standard world-model run, but the tendencies and pressures that produced it still persist. The article closes with the identification of possible leverage points for attaining sustainable development in the expected fields of education, eco-efficiency, and resource management and energy policies, and speculates on possible others that the new millennium may offer.

TI The WTO and China's ban on foreign investment in telecommunication
   services: a game-theoretic analysis
SO TELECOMMUNICATIONS POLICY
LA English
DT Article
DE China; WTO; foreign direct investment (FDI); game theory
AB China's telecommunication services sector was closed to foreign direct investment (FDI) during the 1990s. The official ban on FDI persisted despite China's enormous demand for capital to build out its telecommunication infrastructure. It remained in place despite statements from Western analysts that it was not sustainable and repeated predictions that it was about to be relaxed. What created the ban, why did it stay in place so long, and why did China suddenly offer, in its World Trade Organization accession agreement with the United States, to change it significantly? This paper identifies the domestic policy bargains that supported the FDI restriction. A simple game theory model is used to analyze the way four players - (1) the Chinese slate, (2) the Ministry of Information Industry/China Telecom, (3) Telecom's domestic rivals, and (4) foreign strategic investors - interacted over access to foreign capital and technology. We contend that this analytical framework provides a much more solid understanding of the forces shaping Chinese telecommunications policy than simplistic extrapolations of Western notions of liberalization and privatization. The model is then used to assess whether China's willingness to open up to foreign strategic investment in the sector was driven primarily by its own domestic reform process, or by the external pressures generated by its desire to join the WTO. Our model predicts that China would not have opened up to foreign investment in telecommunication services without the need to bargain for WTO accession. It is our conclusion that the state's desire for WTO accession tipped the game's equilibrium sufficiently to alter the FDI ban. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A series of solid-state reactions is reported of gaseous or solid amines with aldehydes to give imines, with solid anhydrides to give diamides (therefrom imides) or amidic carboxylic salts or imides, with solid imides to give diamides, with solid lactones or carbonates to give functionalized carbamic esters, with polycarbonates to give degradative aminolysis, and with solid isothiocyanates to give thioureas. Diamides give imides by solid-state thermolysis or acid catalysis. Various double, two-step, 3-cascade, and sequential reactions are reported in the solid state without melting. The yields are quantitative in 53 reported reaction examples and no workup (except for washings in four cases) is required in the 100% yield reactions. Three initially solid-state reactions but with liquid product were not quantitative. An upscaling to the kg scale shows promise of the technique for large scale applications. Supermicroscopic analyses with AFM elucidate the solid-state mechanism by virtue of far-reaching anisotropic molecular movements in three-step processes. Gas-solid aminolyses of polycarbonates are also studied with AFM. The implications to sustainable chemistry are discussed. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Ley farming (pastures in rotation with crops) is a traditional management strategy for sustainable farming, used Tot centuries in temperate and Mediterranean areas of the world. For nearly 50 years, it has been the subject of research, development and extension in the subtropics of southern inland Queensland.
   The apparent slow rate of adoption of ley pastures as a means of maintaining or restoring soil fertility, particularly amongst those with mixed grain and livestock enterprises, has been a concern to people involved in these studies. The reasons are not clearly identified but are most likely to he factors such as short-term profitability of rotations involving livestock, management complexity of leys, reluctance to change, looking to easier options, availability of nondegraded lands, and bloat fears with temperate legumes. Growers are, however, aware of fertility decline and that many of their paddocks have reached an age when restorative practices are required if wheat yields and proteins ale to be maintained. Most recent trends show increasing areas of ley pasture.

ID STOCKING RATE
AB The view of pastures as a crop to be selected, sown, grown and harvested by grazing animals was common among scientists, government agency staff and livestock producers during the 1960s. Consequences of this view include the search for 'magic bullet' pasture species and the indiscriminate introduction and widespread testing of introduced germplasm in Australia. A number of serious environmental weeds have resulted. Another consequence was the almost complete dependence on cultivation, sowing, fertiliser application and herbicides as the only means of manipulating species composition in pastures.
   The view that both the manager and the livestock are part of a complex grassland ecosystem has been gaining acceptance in recent years. The goals and perceptions of the manager as well as the activities of the livestock affect the functioning of this ecosystem in many ways. Further important consequences of this change in attitude have included the recognition of the power of grazing animals in manipulating the species composition of grasslands and a more sustainable approach to the management of grazing lands.

AB The importance of water in satisfying many consumption needs, the vagaries related to ifs natural occurrence, and the stress an the environment resulting from the development of human societies are serious. The future will depend on the sustainable development of all the natural institutional, and financial resources available. Manageable mathematical optimization techniques are an extremely important aid to the decision-making process, contributing to a more efficient use of these resources. The advances made in operations research in the second half of the 20(th) century have helped to solve many of the problems related to the rational utilization of various types of resources. Two particularly sensitive systems must be addressed in the context of satisfying a population's water requirements, if optimized planning and management are the goals. This paper concentrates on the application of suitable optimization techniques in the development and management of groundwater systems and water distribution systems. The implications of using optimization techniques are described and the models that have been developed for application in similar cases are evaluated for the benefit of water development practitioners. Analysis of the methodological advances achieved and the reliability associated with decisions reached through operation research methods suggest that the gap between research and practice in the planning and managing of aquifers and water distribution systems may be narrowing.

AB Since the inception of the "new" field of conservation biology in the mid-1980s, there has been a long-standing discussion about the differences between conservation biology and the disciplines of wildlife biology and ecology. Events related to management for biodiversity and sustainability have made synthesis ne rigueur across disciplinary lines. The developing concept of ecosystem management and preservation of biodiversity has produced a convergence of biological fields, at least where synthesis is essential to task accomplishment. However, all of these fields, individually and collectively, fall short of their potential in terms of relating to social and economic factors.

DT Article
AB Geographic information is today being extensively used in decision making processes because it has become a fundamental element to provide better understanding about one's surroundings. Sustainable development relies on the control,of the consequences of public decisions regarding natural resources, people and the involved interrelationships. More importantly, geographic information is a tool of democracy, which must be used in public debate as it enables visualization of the impact of planning decisions on society and to explain the rationale behind a particular decision. Today, most of the countries are set to exploit the potential of mapping technology. The present paper provides a SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats) analysis of the Indian geographic information situation using the international scenario as a backdrop.

SO JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY

   systems; integrated resource planning; Kansas water management
AB This paper presents a synthesis of water sustainability issues from the hydrologic perspective. It shows that safe yield is a flawed concept and that sustainability is an idea that is broadly used but perhaps not well understood. In general, the sustainable yield of an aquifer must be considerably less than recharge if adequate amounts of water are to be available to sustain both the quantity and quality of streams, springs, wetlands, and ground-water-dependent ecosystems. To ensure sustainability, it is imperative that water limits be established based on hydrologic principles of mass balance. To establish water-use policies and planning horizons, the transition curves of aquifer systems from ground-water storage depletion to induced recharge of surface water need to be developed. present-day numerical models are capable of generating such transition curves. Several idealized examples of aquifer systems show how this could be done. Because of the complexity of natural systems and the uncertainties in characterizing them, the current philosophy underlying sustainable management of water resources is based on the interconnected systems approach and on adaptive management. Examples of water-resources management from Kansas illustrate some of these concepts in a real-world setting. Some of the hallmarks of Kansas water management are the formation of local groundwater management districts, the adoption of minimum streamflow standards, the use of modified safe-yield policies in some districts, the implementation of integrated resource planning by the City of Wichita, and the subbasin water-resources manage ment program in potential problem areas. These are all appropriate steps toward sustainable development. The Kansas examples show that local decision-making is the best way to fully account fur local variability in water management. However, it is imperative that public education and involvement be encouraged, so that system complexities and constraints an better understood and overly simplistic solutions avoided.

AB Enzymatic degradation and polymerization using an enzyme were analyzed with respect to the establishment of a sustainable chemical recycling system for poly(epsilon-caprolactone) (PCL) which is a typical biodegradable synthetic plastic. As the typical example, the enzymatic degradation of PLC having an (M) over bar(n) of 110 000 using lipase CA in toluene containing water at 70 degrees C for 6 h afforded a unimodal oligomer having an (M) over bar(n) of about 1000 quantitatively consisting of liner and cyclic oligomers. This was again polymerized by lipase CA in toluene under restricted water concentration to produce PCL having an (M) over bar(n) of greater than 70 000.

AB Crop heterogeneity is a possible solution to the vulnerability of monocultured crops to disease(1-3). Both theory(4) and observation(2,3) indicate that genetic heterogeneity provides greater disease suppression when used over large areas, though experimental data are lacking. Here we report a unique cooperation among farmers, researchers and extension personnel in Yunnan Province, China-genetically diversified rice crops were planted in all the rice fields in five townships in 1998 and ten townships in 1999. Control plots of monocultured crops allowed us to calculate the effect of diversity on the severity of rice blast, the major disease of rice(5). Disease-susceptible rice varieties planted in mixtures with resistant varieties had 89% greater yield and blast was 94% less severe than when they were grown in monoculture. The experiment was so successful that fungicidal sprays were no longer applied by the end of the two-year programme. Our results support the view that intraspecific crop diversification provides an ecological approach to disease control that can be highly effective over a large area and contribute to the sustainability of crop production.

AB Impacts of different management strategies on long-term site productivity over a period of 240 years were simulated using the ecosystem Model FORECAST for lodgepole pine forests of the central interior of British Columbia (BC). Results suggested that the sustainable management strategies for maintaining long-term site productivity in lodgepole pine forests would be 80-120-year rotation lengths, with either stem-only or whole-tree harvesting. However, because of more nutrient conservation stern-only harvesting can achieve higher productivity (3.5-8.5%) than whole-tree harvesting does. The thinning strategy (from 4000 to 1000 steins/ha) would not increase total productivity over a period of 240-year simulation. Thinning, however, can increase the habitat value for Caribou. The best thinning strategies await further simulations on effects of various stocking levels in a broader context. The simulations also showed that organic matter and below-ground woody debris are critical for maintaining long-term site productivity in lodgepole pine forests in the study area, and a significant removal of such material may cause yield decline.

AB To meet the challenges of the emerging information-rich society, landscape ecology must become a holistic problem-solving oriented science by joining the transdisciplinary scientific revolution with a paradigm shift from conventional reductionistic and mechanistic approaches to holistic and organismic approaches of wholeness, connectedness and ordered complexity. Its central holistic concept is the Total Human Ecosystem as the highest level of co-evolutionary complexity in the global ecological hierarchy, with solar energy powered biosphere and fossil energy powered technosphere landscapes as its concrete systems. Landscape ecology could contribute to their structural and functional integration into a coherent sustainable ecosphere and thereby to the establishment of a sustainable balance between attractive and productive biosphere landscapes and healthy and livable technosphere landscapes for this and future generation. By utilizing new insights in self-organization of autopioetic systems and their cross-catalytic networks in the Total Human Ecosystem for synergistic benefits of the people, their economy and landscapes, such holistic landscape ecology together with other mission-driven transdisciplinary environmental sciences could serve as a catalyst for the urgently needed post-industrial symbiosis between nature and human society. This would ensure also their further biological and cultural evolution. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Landscape ecology has the potential to contribute towards a holistic approach in landscape architecture. Such an approach can simultaneously inform, guide and inspire designers towards landscapes that are environmentally sustainable as well as being culturally and aesthetically appropriate. This paper reviews two possible ways in which landscape ecology can advance landscape architecture: (a) by providing a holistic and dynamic framework that contributes towards an alternative landscape design (e.g. ecological landscape design); and (b) by establishing the scientific knowledge (e.g. landscape heterogeneity biological and ecological diversity and ecological networks) that can inform the design process at the local and regional levels.
   Both contributions were tested at the Bahrija Project in Malta. The methodology of ecological design is applied, initially to allow for a comprehensive understanding of the local landscape, and subsequently to assist in the formulation of a preliminary landscape master plan. The paper argues that conservation policies should necessarily be complemented with a proactive approach, which can accommodate the needs of contemporary development while ensuring the protection of natural and cultural resources.

AB Starting with a holistic analysis of the nature-human ecosystem, the importance of the new information-based economy for sustainability is elaborated. A major bottleneck in the present development is the availability of people who understand the functioning and essentials of the new economy. Closely Linked to the availability of these 'new key people' is the necessity to revitalise and preserve ecosystems, even within cities. But favourable developments do not occur on their own. A new link is elaborated which would allow nature in a region to benefit proportionally to regional economic growth. This link becomes practical due to the new economy, which can use resources and land area much more effectively than established industries, and new information and communication technologies foster lifestyles which free land areas for other uses. Examples confirm that this link is a realistic possibility. The conclusions are based on integrated regional and urban projects, management consultation and systems science.

TI Paradigms of participatory enhancement of rice productivity: Suggestions
   based on a case study in India
SO CURRENT SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
AB Tribal areas in Orissa are rich in crop diversity including rice. Farmers require rice varieties with preferred cooking properties. Modern high-yielding varieties do not fulfil this need. Therefore local varieties and landraces rich in genetic diversity are still grown. Increasing costs of cultivation and livelihood disrupt this practice, consequently hastening genetic erosion. In this back-drop, providing them a sustainable livelihood is a prime concern. The results of a designed study of rice production under farmers' management and practices have suggested a few paradigms of participatory genetic enhancement outlined in this paper.

AB The new paradigm of pollution prevention dictates that we develop new techniques for producing valuable commodity chemicals that are sustainable and present minimal wastes. One appropriate technique is solvent replacement. Within this paper, we investigate the use of supercritical carbon dioxide as a replacement solvent for hydroformylation, used commercially in the oxo process to produce over 1 x 10(9) kg of aldehyde annually. Unfortunately, commercial hydroformylation catalysts are not soluble in supercritical CO2, thus we describe the development of a heterogeneous catalyst for use with this reaction. Rhodium, supported on activated carbon, is active for the hydroformylation of propene to butanal, but it is not selective. Two different activated carbons are used to provide information as to the role of the support in promoting this reaction. A two-step reaction pathway is defined, and the effect of temperature and pressure are quantified based on the proposed pathway. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Research on the effects on firm performance of "best practices" of environmental management, which are supposed to enable firms to simultaneously protect the environment and reduce costs, has so far ignored the roles of existing firm resources and capabilities. Drawing on the resource-based view of the firm, this study analyzes whether complementary assets are required to gain cost advantage from implementing best practices. Results based on survey data from 88 chemical companies indicate that capabilities for process innovation and implementation are complementary assets that moderate the relationship between best practices and cost advantage, a significant factor in determining firm performance.

AB Drawing on the strategic issue interpretation literature, this study examined links between managerial interpretations of environmental issues and corporate choice of environmental strategy among 99 firms in the Canadian oil and gas industry. Environmental strategies ranging from conformance to regulations and standard industry practices on the one hand to voluntary actions for environmental preservation on the other were found to be associated with managerial interpretations of environmental issues as threats or as opportunities. Differences in managerial interpretations were influenced by certain factors in the organizational context, including the legitimation of environmental issues as an integral aspect of corporate identity and the discretionary slack available to managers for creative problem solving at the interface of the business and the natural environment.

AB This paper describes a Tropical Pasture Simulator. This is a simple mechanistic model representing the growth of vegetative tropical pastures under rotational or continuous grazing with responses to N fertiliser, temperature and irradiance that can be used as a tool to study management options for the development of sustainable grazing systems. The model was derived as an adaptation of the 'Hurley pasture models' which were originally designed to simulate the growth of ryegrass. The model incorporates the processes of light interception and photosynthesis, leaf area expansion; growth, ageing and senescence of plant tissues, recycling of substrates from senescing tissues, nitrogen uptake, mineralisation of soil organic N, N leaching and grazing. The paper discusses the main structure of the model, its components and the main adaptations required to simulate the growth of tropical pastures. The model was parameterised for kikuyu grass (Pennisetum clandestinum) growing in dairy systems in highland regions of Costa Rica. This paper also discusses the sensitivity of parameter values and the development of minimum parameter datasets for time and cost-effective implementation of the model. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB Most of the projected global population increases will take place in Third World Countries that already suffer from water, food, and health problems. Increasingly, agricultural water management must be coordinated with, and integrated into, the overall water management of the region. Sustainability, public health, and environmental protection are key factors. More storage of water behind dam and especially in aquifers via artificial recharge is necessary to save water in times of water surplus for use in times of water shortage. Municipal wastewater can be an important water resource but its use must be carefully planned and regulated to prevent adverse health effects and, in the case of irrigation, undue contamination of groundwater. While almost an liquid fresh water of the planet occurs underground its long-term suitability as a source of water is threatened by nonpoint source pollution from agriculture and by aquifer depletion due to groundwater withdrawals in excess of groundwater recharge. Water short countries can save water by importing most of their food and electric power from other countries with more water, so that in essence they also get the water that was necessary to produce these commodities and, hence, is virtually embedded in the commodities. This 'virtual' water tends to be a lot cheaper for the receiving country than developing its own water resources. Local water can then be used for purposes with higher social or economic returns or saved for the future. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V, All rights reserved.

AB Intensive vegetable farming has the potential to damage soil health, leading to poor productivity and large environmental impacts. This paper reports on changes in soil properties after three and a half years of vegetable cropping and discusses the implications for sustainability. A vegetable fanning-systems experiment began in 1992 at Somersby, in NSW, Australia. The aim of the experiment was to compare five different approaches to vegetable cropping in terms of their productivity, profitability, soil effects and environmental impact. The experimental treatments represent whole production systems, intended to simulate real farms, but under more controlled conditions than is possible on farms. The systems are defined by the goals and values of the farmer rather than by the management practices employed. The actual management practices - nutrition, tillage, rotations, pest and weed management, etc. - were selected to satisfy these goals and values. For instance, to satisfy the goal of 'maximise profit', fertilisers and pesticides were applied in excess to ensure high yields of large, undamaged produce which receive the best prices. Conversely, one of the management practices used to satisfy the goal 'optimise profit while minimising environmental impact' was to grow cover crops regularly in rotation with vegetable crops. A range of chemical, physical and biological properties of surface soil (0-10 cm) from the farming-systems were measured and compared to baseline measurements. The two alternative systems, which received large inputs of compost, had higher soil organic carbon, microbial biomass. total nitrogen, total phosphorus, exchangeable nutrient cations, water-holding capacity and aggregate stability than the conventional systems. The system that received the largest mineral fertiliser inputs, and the most tillage, had the highest available phosphorus levels, the lowest phosphorus sorption capacity and lower aggregate stability than the alternative systems. Consequently this high input system had the greatest potential to lose sediments and phosphorus to the environment. The two other conventional systems had smaller fertiliser inputs and maintained a phosphorus sorption capacity that was no different from the alternative systems. These more carefully managed conventional systems offer hope that relatively small changes in management can have significant environmental benefits. Yet the broad improvement in soil health achieved by the biological approaches should provide better long-term fertility and lower off-site impacts. It may be wise to make use of both these approaches to management in attempting to balance the short and long-term viability of intensive vegetable farming. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB The necessity of on-farm research to assess the relationship between shade ecological features and yields has been broadly recognised. On this basis, a more sustainable coffee system could be developed, with better conservation of natural resources. An on-farm research project was conducted in the municipality of Chilon. Chiapas, Mexico, with the objectives of investigating the effect of shade structure on coffee grain yield and assessing the potential uses of associated plant species.
   Results showed that shade cover percentage and coffee shrub density had significant effects on yields. Maintaining coffee shrub density as a constant, a regression equation related yield to percentage shade by a quadratic polynomial. Coffee density had a significant effect on yields but shade tree density had no effect. Coffee cultivar, age of coffee stand, species richness, shade tree density, basal area, slope and aspect did not have significant effects on coffee yields. Shade tree cover had a positive effect between 23 and 38% shade cover and yield was then maintained up to 48%. Production may decrease under shade cover >50%. A total of 61 shade species were found, with an average density of 260 trees per hectare, the majority of them being indigenous species, used as food, construction materials and as firewood. The role of ecological features associated with shade on yields and availability of natural resources obtained from coffee systems are discussed. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

DE agricultural intensification; agrotechnologies; cropping frequency;
   farming systems; intensity index
ID SLASH-AND-BURN; DEFORESTATION
AB Agricultural intensification is a process of raising land productivity over time through increases in inputs of one form or another on a per unit area basis. Its study is important for several reasons, many of which relate to agroforestry objectives. However, the concept of intensification often is poorly defined in the literature and existing methods and approaches to measuring agricultural intensity are problematic, making it difficult to precisely compare particular farming systems. This paper examines the concept of agricultural intensity, its relevance to efficient and sustainable land use, and the ways it can be measured. A review of existing approaches and methods for measuring intensity, such as those based on output, cropping frequency, and agrotechnologies, revealed that these feature a number of problems. Some of these problems relate simply to imprecision and inaccuracy. But others are due to the unsuitability of these approaches in the context of farming environments, such as frontiers, which are characterized by limited production data; unconventional cropping cycles; myriad production strategies, cropping patterns, and crop-fallow cycles on a single farm; and a high level of system dynamism and production variability over time. A modified approach to measuring agricultural intensity, based on fieldwork in Peten, Guatemala, is presented. This approach, which is better suited to frontier regions, employs an agricultural intensity index to help evaluate the intensity of particular farm units based on the technologies and practices used by the farmer, and the degree to which they are used.

DT Article
DE forest policy; environmental policy; NGO; forest certification
AB For several years, environmental NGOs in Germany have been dealing with forest policy questions. The survey of the most important ones (Greenpeace, Robin Wood, WWF, Bund fur Umwelt und Naturschutz Deutschland. Naturschutzland Deutschland) shows that their activities are not restricted any mure to the development of concepts for the protection and sustainable management of the forests. Using direct actions well-known fi om other fields of environmental policy (e.g. e-mail actions, demonstrations) to an increasing extent, they are trying to urge forest owners and forest politicians to change forest policy and forest management towards sustainability in a broad sense. All of these organisations have developed an own profile in forest policy involvement. However, especially in the case of forest certification, there is a close cooperation. Due to personal disagreements and slight differences between the concepts, a close coalition of the NGOs in forest policy questions cannot be seen at the moment. With the help of strategic alliances, environmental NGOs try to find out possibilities of cooperation with the forest sector. At the same time, they are investing a lot of resources in the field of private environmental standard setting. Buyers groups and organizations for the marketing of certified forest products are increasing the pressure on forest owner to implement sustainable forestry as defined by the NGOs. in addition, detailed systems of monitoring (e.g. the European Forest Scorecards of the WWF) are urging forest policy makers to compare their forest policy activities with "benchmarks" in other countries. Taking into account the professionalization of the organizational structures, it can be stated that the interest of the NGOs in German forestry will be a standing element of their policies.

AB This paper presents an economic model of sustainability defined as intergenerational fairness. Assuming that intergenerational fairness is an obligation of each generation, a recursive optimization problem is obtained. The problem has the advantage that uncertainty can readily be incorporated in the model and it can be solved numerically for a wide range of specifications. The possibility of trade-offs between efficiency and sustainability are discussed. Under plausible conditions, it is shown that a sustainability obligation is met only if there is the expectation of economic growth.

TI Outcomes of the learn, share & live breast cancer education program for
   older urban women
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH
LA English
DT Article
ID MAMMOGRAPHY USE; SCREENING MAMMOGRAPHY; RECOMMENDATIONS; BARRIERS;
   WHITE; STAGE
AB Objectives. This study assessed whether the Learn, Share & Live breast cancer education program resulted in favorable, replicable, and sustainable outcomes.
   Methods. The program was implemented at index (year 1) and replication (year 2) sites. Baseline interviews (year 1; n = 240) and 2 follow-up telephone interviews (years 2 and 3; n = 337 and 323) were used to assess postintervention changes.
   Results. From baseline to year 2, mammography adherence and stage of adoption improved at the index site relative to the replication site. Knowledge scores and percentages of respondents reporting that a friend had spoken with them about mammography improved significantly. Improvements were sustained through year 3 (2 year postintervention). In year 3, replication participants showed improvements in regard to knowledge and perceived mammography benefits, and there was a trend toward increased adherence. Site differences in postintervention from respective choices of follow-up activities.
   Conclusions. The study outcomes affirm the impact of Learn, Share & Live, indicating a replicated and sustained program effect. Future studies should continue longer follow-up and explore the importance of providing mammography opportunities along with education.

TI Determinants of the exercise endurance capacity in patients with chronic
   obstructive pulmonary disease - The power-duration relationship
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF RESPIRATORY AND CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
ID BIOELECTRICAL-IMPEDANCE ANALYSIS; RESPIRATORY PROFILE; REHABILITATION;
   INTENSITY; LUNG
AB To characterize the determinants of the power-duration (W over dot -t) relationship in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), we evaluated 8 nonhypoxemic patients (FEV1 = 1.27 +/- 0.26 L) and 10 healthy controls. After an initial maximum-incremental exercise test on cycle ergometer (peak), the subjects underwent four high-intensity constant-load tests to the limit of tolerance (t), each on different days. The W over dot -t relationship was found to be hyperbolic in both groups. Absolute values of both the critical power asymptote (theta(F)) and the curvature constant (W') were lower in patients than in control subjects. However, when expressed as percentage of peak work rate theta(F) was significantly higher in patients compared with control subjects (81.8 +/- 3.3% versus 67.5 +/- 3.7%, respectively, p < 0.01). There were severe reductions in t in the patients that were consistently associated with higher breathlessness scores and V over dot (E)/MVV ratios. Interestingly, all patients were able to sustain exercise at BF for 20 min despite near-maximum physiological and subjective stresses. We conclude that the reductions of both parameters of the hyperbolic W over dot -t relationship (theta(F) and W') in patients with COPD were due to the ventilatory constraints and their sensory consequences. Importantly, theta(F) separated a "sustainable" from a "nonsustainable" exercise-intensity domain: this parameter consistently occurred closer to peak work rate in patients than the healthy control subjects.

   MANAGEMENT; ECONOMICS; LIZARD; MODEL
AB Demographic analyses suggest that chelonians will have a low ability to withstand harvesting, although most have been based on stationary or declining populations. In contrast to this prediction, a population of Testudo graeca grew at the instantaneous rate r = 0.137 from 1980-1990, with a doubling time of 5 years. r was similar in both adult and 10 cm animals, showing that this high rate was not due to changes in population structure, and may thus be taken as an intrinsic rate of increase (r(m)). r(m) was higher than that of most large mammals, and suggests that sustainable harvesting would be a viable conservation strategy for chelonians if tightly regulated. Ranching or farming operations for chelonians would be even more likely to succeed, given their high fecundity. A resumption of trade in Mediterranean tortoises is, however, unlikely to be economically sustainable.

AB Soil health is the capacity of soil to function as a vital living system, within ecosystem and land-use boundaries, to sustain plant and animal productivity, maintain or enhance water and air quality, and promote plant and animal health. Anthropogenic reductions in soil health, and of individual components of soil quality, are a pressing ecological concern. A conference entitled 'Soil Health: Managing the Biological Component of Soil Quality' was held was held in the USA in November 1998 to help increase awareness of the importance and utility of soil organisms as indicators of soil quality and determinants of soil health. To evaluate sustainability of agricultural practices, assessment of soil health using various indicators of soil quality is needed. Soil organism and biotic parameters (e.g, abundance, diversity, food web structure, or community stability) meet most of the five criteria for useful indicators of soil quality. Soil organisms respond sensitively to land management practices and climate. They are well correlated with beneficial soil and ecosystem functions including water storage, decomposition and nutrient cycling, detoxification of toxicants, and suppression of noxious and pathogenic organisms. Soil organisms also illustrate the chain of cause and effect that links land management decisions to ultimate productivity and health of plants and animals. Indicators must be comprehensible and useful to land managers, who are the ultimate stewards of soil quality and soil health. Visible organisms such as earthworms, insects, and molds have historically met this criterion. Finally, indicators must be easy and inexpensive to measure, but the need for knowledge of taxonomy complicates the measurement of soil organisms. Several farmer-participatory programs for managing soil quality and health have incorporated abiotic and simple biotic indicators. The challenge for the future is to develop sustainable management systems which are the vanguard of soil health; soil quality indicators are merely a means towards this end.

AB Various cultural practices, including the use of cover and rotational crops, composts, tillage systems, and others have been promoted as management options for enhancing soil quality and health. All cultural practices are known to directly or indirectly affect populations of soilborne pathogens and the severity of their resultant root diseases. Soil biology is a major component and contributes significantly to soil quality and productivity. The major activities of soil microbes include the decomposition of organic materials, mineralization of nutrients, nitrogen fixation, suppression of crop pests and protection of roots, but also parasitism and injury to plants. Thus, there is a great need to assure that the introduced soil management practices to improve soil quality will also result and maintain a healthy soil. The latter include the abundance and diversity of total soil microbes, high population of beneficial organisms and low population and/or activities of crop pests. Production of vegetables and other food crops is often significantly affected by several soilborne pathogens that require control. The incidence and severity of root diseases is an indirect assessment of soil health for specific commodity/soil use. In addition, understanding and selecting the appropriate cultural practices that limit or prevent damage of root diseases is essential for the long-term and sustainable management of soil quality and health. Case-study examples are presented to illustrate the impact of cover crops and their green manures on the density and damage of root-knot and lesion nematodes to vegetables; and also tillage, soil amendments, crop rotation, and cover crops on bean yield and root rot severity.

AB Soil quality is not a purchased technology; instead, it is a concept that can be used in making land management decisions. Researchers have generally agreed upon the soil properties that determine soils' capacity to function and have emphasized that soil quality must be understood in context. Soil quality research has included the following: (1) soil management research, where the effects of management on soil properties and dependent processes are assessed; (2) measurement development for soil quality assessment to be carried out by the farmers themselves, by advisors, or consultants and (3) systems assessments, that consider the physical and cultural contexts that impact soil quality decision-making. Because stewards of the land ultimately determine whether soil quality is improved, maintained, or diminished, many research projects in the US have included the active participation of fanners in efforts to develop the soil quality concept. More effort has been spent on soil management and on the development and testing of farmer oriented measurements than on system assessments. There is growing consensus that the development of soil quality assessments to be used by farmers to solve problems within individual fields will be challenging. Organic matter and organic matter-dependent properties are the most promising indicators for use in a soil quality assessment where the information will be used in management decisions. Unfortunately, the successful development of on-farm measures may not be sufficient to guarantee that soil quality is maintained because there is a mismatch in the temporal and physical scales over which soil quality and farm security are achieved. Educational materials that highlight soil contributions to farm, landscape and global functioning coupled with dialoguing between practitioners, scientists, and policy-makers can communicate the importance of soil quality to sustainability. Successful soil quality efforts will relate soil properties to soil function in a way that fosters stewardship among individuals and builds public support for polices that promote soil management to ensure agriculture, industry, and the natural environment are sustained. Strategies and priorities are expected to vary according to audience, land-use constraints and the intended scale of application (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

ID RANGELAND SOILS
AB Soil quality appears to be an ideal indicator of sustainable land management. Soil is the foundation for nearly all land uses. Soil quality, by definition, reflects the capacity to sustain plant and animal productivity, maintain or enhance water and air quality, and promote plant and animal health. By reflecting the basic capacity of the soil to function, it integrates across many potential uses. Nonetheless, few land managers have adopted soil quality as an indicator of sustainable land management. There are a number of constraints to adoption. Most could be overcome through a concerted effort by the research community. Specifically, we need to address the following issues: (1) demonstrate causal relationships between soil quality and ecosystem functions, including biodiversity conservation, biomass production and conservation of soil and water resources. True calibration of soil quality requires more than merely comparing values across management systems; (2) increase the power of soil quality indicators to predict response to disturbance. Although then are many indicators that reflect the current capacity of a soil to function, there are few that can predict the capacity of the soil to continue to function under a range of disturbance regimes. Both resistance and resilience need to be considered; (3) Increase accessibility of monitoring systems to land managers. Many existing systems are too complex, too expensive, or both; (4) Integrate soil quality with other biophysical and socio-economic indicators. Effective early-warning monitoring systems will require not just the inclusion of both biophysical and socio-economic indicators, but also the development of models that incorporate feedbacks between soil quality and socio-economic conditions and trends and (5) Place soil quality in a landscape context. Most ecosystem functions depend on connections through time across different parts of the landscape. In conclusion, soil quality is a necessary but not sufficient indicator of sustainable land management. Its value will continue to increase as limitations are diminished through collaboration between scientists, land managers and policymakers. Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Drawing on academic literature and personal experience, the authors highlight trends emerging from sustainable agriculture efforts in developing countries, involving research institutions, action agencies, and communities, to provide recommendations for advancing a soil health movement. They argue that multi-disciplinary and -institutional efforts on soil health that link research. practice, and political action will de needed for improved agriculture and more promising futures.
   During this century soil research has concentrated on soil chemical and physical factors, with comparative neglect of biological factors. Consequently, there is relatively limited understanding of how best to capitalize on the dynamics and potentials of soil biology so as to enhance the regenerative capacity of soil systems for agriculture. More agronomic research and empirical experience for biologically-based agriculture are called for.
   Although better understanding and practices can serve immediate on-farm needs, they alone would unlikely achieve the desirable changes in farming systems. Policies and institutional arrangements profoundly influence agricultural research and practice, so effective soil health initiatives must also engage broader social and political considerations. In particular, the author's argue for greater balance in research and teaching to emphasize biology and ecology, enhanced linkages between research and extension, new inter-institutional partnerships and collaboration, and increased stakeholder involvement in policy formulation and implementation.

AB Objective: The objective of this paper is to outline the conceptual background and strategy of intervention for a systematic and sustainable approach to mental health promotion in secondary schools.
   Method: The conceptual origins of the Gatehouse Project are described in terms of the epidemiology of adolescent mental health problems, attachment theory, education reform research and health promotional theory and practice. The elements of health promotional work are described in terms of structural change and priority setting; implementation at multiple levels within the participating schools is described.
   Results: The conceptual framework of the Gatehouse Project emphasises healthy attachments with peers and teachers through the promotion of a sense of security and trust, effective communication and a sense of positive self-regard based on participation in varied aspects of school and community life. A school social climate profile is derived from a questionnaire survey of students. An adolescent health team uses this information to set priorities for change within the school. Interventions may focus on the promotion of a positive social climate of the whole school or in the classroom. Curriculum-based health education is also used and based on materials that are relevant to the normal developmental experiences of teenagers. These are integrated into the mainstream curriculum and incorporate a strong component of teacher professional development. Lastly, the intervention promotes linkage between the school and broader community with a particular emphasis on the needs of young people at high risk of school drop-out.
   Conclusions: Educational environments are complex systems undergoing continuous and simultaneous changes. The Gatehouse Project will provide unique information on the relationship between the social environment and the emotional wellbeing of young people. More importantly it outlines a sustainable process for building the capacity of schools to promote the social and emotional development of young people.

AB Aldo Leopold's land ethic has proved more complex and subtle than he envisioned. Nevertheless, Leopold launched what, facing a new millennium, has proved urgent on the global agenda: an environmental ethics concerned in theory and practice about appropriate respect for values carried by the natural world and human responsibilities for the sustaining of these values. A blending of anthropocentric and biocentric values continues to be vital. These duties toward nature involve analysis of ecosystem integrity and evolutionary dynamism at both scientific and philosophical levels; any responsible environmental policy must be based on plausible accounts of ecosystems and a sustainable biosphere. Humans and this planet have entwined destinies. We now envision an Earth ethic beyond the land ethic.

AB Areas set apart for nature conservation in Britain are broadly categorised according to their cultural purpose, and names are assigned to these in this paper. Nature reserves may be similar to zoos and botanic gardens in aiming to maintain the diversity of species and if so are termed 'biodiversity reserves'. This tradition understands nature as a static collection of entities apart from humans. Maintaining traditional management at a site is arguably a good way to sustain species, it also retains old ways in which humans and nature were integrated in the life of the nation and so are called 'historic countryside parks'. There is growing interest in 'wilderness areas', where nature is seen as primarily processes protected from human interference. Despite the strength of each of these, they suffer from attempting to restrict nature to a ghetto, a process that is economically and environmentally costly. 'Companion places' are places which set sustainable examples of integrating human life and economic activity with maintaining biodiversity and offering an opportunity to encounter wild processes at the heart of life. The language of these four types, or vectors, of nature reserves is offered to help the discussion of our place in nature.

AB The diversity of native species assemblages and that of indigenous cultures that once characterized the temperate forests of southern Chile have experienced a process of homogenization ever since the Spanish conquest. Today this process continues to erode both biotic and cultural diversity. With the goal of linking ecological research with actions to conserve the biological and cultural richness of this region, we established the Institute of Ecological Research Chiloe. The Institute's philosophy and activities involve three approaches: (1) participation of professional ecologists in environmental education and decision making, through collaboration with the community at local, regional, and global scales. (2) programs of ecological education, which include planting indigenous trees in urban areas and creating a local botanical garden with representative Chilean forest species. (3) critical analyses of the narrow economic and utilitarian environmental ethics that currently prevail in Chile, and often in other Latin American nations, and examination of traditional or novel alternative ethics and perspectives that address multiple interrelations between biological and cultural dimensions.

ID FORESTS
AB Torreya taxifolia is a coniferous tree that is endemic to the 35 km stretch of bluffs and ravines along the east side of the Apalachicola River in northern Florida and adjacent southern Georgia. This formerly locally abundant tree declined during the 1950s and 1960s as a result of disease and is currently on the US Endangered Species list. For sparsely distributed species it can often be difficult to determine both current and historic population sizes. Historical descriptions of the distribution (203 km(2)) and relative abundance (14.2% of dominant ravine trees) of T. taxifolia are used along with current measures of forest structure to estimate the pre-decline population density (30 trees/ha) and size (similar to 0.3-0.65 million individuals). Survey information from five extant stands is used to estimate current population size (similar to 500-4000 individuals). The surveys were conducted in areas with known high tree densities such that a simple extrapolation to the entire distribution would produce a gross over-estimate of population size. We therefore use a variety of assumptions to produce a range of estimates for total population sizes. Regardless of the particular model, our estimates suggest that T. taxifolia has lost at least 98.5% of its total population size since the early 1900s. We discuss these results in relation to the potential difficulties likely of restoring sustainable populations of this species. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID SOUTHEASTERN AUSTRALIA; GROWTH; PINE; WASHINGTON; IMPACT; DAMAGE
AB Soil compaction has been considered a principal form of damage associated with logging, restricting root growth and reducing productivity. The rate and extent of soil compaction on skid trails was measured at six field locations covering a range of dry and wet forests. Data was collected for up to 21 passes of a laden logging machine. A similar extent of compaction, averaging 0.17 g.cm(-3) increase in total soil bulk density (BD), was recorded for all field sites despite substantial site and soil differences. On average, 62% of the compaction in the top 10 cm of the soil occurred after only one pass of a laden logging machine. The environment under which soils had formed played a major role in determining the BD of the undisturbed soil. Compaction was strongly related to the original BD, forest type, and soil parent material. Soil strengths obtained in the field fell below levels found to restrict root growth. However, reduction in macropores, and the effect of that on aeration and drainage could reduce tree growth. On the wettest soils logged, machine forces displaced topsoils rather than causing compaction in situ. Recommended logging methods and implications for the development of sustainability indices are discussed.

ID LENTIL
AB Crop production systems that include field pea (Pisum sativum L.) in rotation are important for sustainable agriculture on acid soils in northwestern Canada. Greenhouse experiments were conducted to compare the ability of liquid inoculant applied to the seed, powdered peat inoculant applied to the seed, and granular inoculant applied in a band with the seed to establish effective nodulation on field pea grown at soil pH(H2O) 4.4, 5.4 and 6.6. Plants were grown to the flat pod stage, and then total plant biomass dry weight, dry weight of nodules, number of nodules, plant nitrogen content, and proportion of plant nitrogen derived from the atmosphere (%Ndfa) were measured. Granular and powdered peat inoculants produced greater nodule numbers and weight, plant nitrogen content, %Ndfa and total biomass than liquid inoculant in at least two of the three experiments. Only granular inoculant was effective in establishing nodules at soil pH 4.4, but granular and powdered peat inoculants were effective at pH 5.4, and all three formulations were effective at pH 6.6. The results showed that granular inoculant has potential for effective nodulation of field pea grown on acid soil.

AB Computer decision support systems are computer applications designed to aid clinicians in making diagnostic and therapeutic decisions in patient care. They can simplify access to data needed to make decisions, provide reminders and prompts at the time of a patient encounter, assist in establishing a diagnosis and in entering appropriate orders, and alert clinicians when new patterns in patient data are recognized. Decision support systems that present patient-specific recommendations in a form that can save clinicians time have been shown to be highly effective, sustainable tools for changing clinician behavior. Designing and implementing such systems is challenging because of the computing infrastructure required, the need for patient data in a machine-processible form, and the changes to existing workflow that may result. Despite these difficulties, there is substantial evidence from trials in a wide range of clinical settings that computer decision support systems help clinicians do a better job caring for patients. As computer-based records and order-entry systems become more common, automated decision support systems will be used more broadly.

SO CLIMATIC CHANGE

ID SEA-LEVEL RISE; WATER
AB Three types of adaptation can influence significantly a system's prospective longevity in the face of climate change. The ability to cope with variation in its current environment can help a system adapt to changes over the longer term. The ability to take advantage of beneficial changes that might coincide with potentially harmful ones can play an even larger role; and focusing attention on maximizing a system's sustainable lifetime can highlight the potential for extending that time horizon and increasing the likelihood that an alternative structure might be created. A specific economic approach to adaptation demonstrates that research can serve two functions in this regard. Research can play an important role in diminishing future harm suggested by standard impact analyses by focusing attention on systems where adaptation can buy the most time. It can help societies learn how to become more robust under current conditions; and it can lead them to explore mechanisms by which they can exploit potentially beneficial change. Research can also play a critical role in assessing the need for mitigating long-term change by focusing attention on systems where potential adaptation in both the short and long runs is so limited that it is almost impossible to buy any time at all. In these areas, switching to an alternative system or investing in the protection of existing ones are the last lines of defense. Real "windows" of tolerable climate change can be defined only by working in areas where these sorts of adaptive alternatives cannot be uncovered.

AB Spruce budworm (Choristoneura fumiferana Clem.) outbreaks cause severe mortality and growth loss of spruce and fir forest over much of eastern North America. The spruce budworm decision support system (DSS) links prediction and interpretation models to the ARC/INFO GIS, under an ArcView graphical user interface. It assists forest managers to predict budworm outbreak effects on forest structure and productivity, forecast forest growing stock and sustainable harvest levels, optimize protection (biological insecticide use) programs, and use silviculture and harvest scheduling to restructure forests to reduce future damage. The spruce budworm DSS has been operationally implemented on 8 million ha of susceptible forest in the province of New Brunswick, and is being implemented on test landbases in Quebec, Ontario, and Alberta. The use of inventory and monitoring data in the DSS will be described in four areas, stand growth model calibration; model validation; pest monitoring; and forest stratification for calculating marginal timber supply benefits.

AB The conservation of biological diversity has become one of the important goals of managing forests in an ecologically sustainable way. Ecologists and forest resource managers need measures to judge the success or failure of management regimes designed to sustain biological diversity. The relationships between potential indicator species and total biodiversity are not well established. Carefully designed studies are required to test relationships between the presence and abundance of potential indicator species and other taxa and the maintenance of critical ecosystem processes in forests. Other indicators of biological diversity in forests, in addition or as alternatives to indicator species, include what we call structure-based indicators. These are stand-level and landscape-level (spatial) features of forests such as stand structural complexity and plant species composition, connectivity, and heterogeneity. Although the adoption of practices to sustain (or recreate) key characteristics of forest ecosystems appear intuitively sensible and broadly consistent with current knowledge, information is lacking to determine whether such stand- and landscape-level features of forests will serve as successful indices of (and help conserve) biodiversity. Given our limited knowledge of both indicator species and structure-based indicators, we advocate the following four approaches to enhance biodiversity conservation in forests: (1) establish biodiversity priority areas (e.g., reserves) managed primarily for the conservation of biological diversity; (2) within production forests, apply structure-based indicators including structural complexity, connectivity, and heterogeneity; (3) using multiple conservation strategies at multiple spatial scales, spread out risk in wood production forests; and (4) adopt an adaptive management approach to test the validity of structure-based indices of biological diversity by treating management practices as experiments. These approaches would aim to provide new knowledge to managers and improve the effectiveness of current management strategies.

TI Why poor logging practices persist in the tropics
SO CONSERVATION BIOLOGY

ID REDUCED-IMPACT; FOREST MANAGEMENT; DAMAGE; INDONESIA; AMAZON
AB Despite abundant evidence that both the environmental damage and the financial costs of logging can be reduced substantially by training workers, pre-planning skid trails, practicing directional felling, and carrying out a variety of other well-known forestry practices, destructive logging is still common in the tropics. Based on our collective experience with loggers in tropical forests, we discuss seven possible reasons for this seemingly irrational behavior. The principal reason poor logging practices persist is apparently that the widely heralded cost savings associated with reduced-impact logging relative to unplanned logging by untrained crews may not be realized under some conditions. In particular, where compliance with logging guidelines restricts access to steep slopes or prohibits ground-based timber yarding on wet ground, reduced-impact logging may be synonymous with reduced-income logging. Given that under such conditions loggers may not adopt reduced-impact logging methods out of self-interest, fiscal mechanisms for promoting sustainable forest management may be needed.

AB We evaluated seed removal by terrestrial mammals and the fate of removed, threaded seeds (as a measure of dispersal) in two neighboring tropical rain forest sites in the Caribbean lowlands of Costa Rica. Both sites have been selectively logged but differ in their degree of protection from human intrusion and habitat connectivity: La Selva is protected from hunting and connected to a national park, whereas Tirimbina remains unprotected and is not connected to a park. The two study sites are similar in logging intensity, elevation, and canopy tree structure and composition. We predicted that rates of seed removal and seed dispersal would be higher at the connected and protected site. For seven tree species (six of which are timber species), we determined that patterns of seed removal under an exclusion experiment (semipermeable cages vs. uncaged) varied both within species across sites and within sites across species, suggesting site differences in abundance, degree of animal activity, or presence of particular mammal seed consumers. Rates of seed removal and dispersal were largely species-specific. Most of the study species showed neither site nor treatment effect, whereas others had disproportionately higher removal rates at La Selva. For all species combined (covering a 6-month period due to phenological differences among the study species; n = 920 seeds per site), twice as many removed seeds were dispersed at La Selva (5.3%) than at Tirimbina (2.2%). Only one timber species, Pentaclethra macroloba, did not appear sensitive to site differences in rates of seed removal, most likely because its seeds are toxic to animals. Two timber species, Carapa nicaraguensis and Lecythis ampla, whose seeds are consumed by large scatterhoarding rodents, had 2.5% and 13%, respectively, of their removed seeds dispersed at La Selva, whereas no seeds were dispersed at Tirimbina. In northeastern Costa Rica, where forest cover is fragmented and selective logging is currently underway, the biological sustainability of timber species dispersed by terrestrial mammals may be more likely in sites protected from hunting and/or adjacent to protected areas than in forested patches subjected to hunting.

AB Fresh water is a renewable resource, but it is also finite. Around the world, there are now numerous signs that human water use exceeds sustainable levels. Groundwater depletion, low or nonexistent river flows, and worsening pollution levels are among the more obvious indicators of water stress. In many areas, extracting more water for human uses jeopardizes the health of vital aquatic ecosystems. Satisfying the increased demands for food, water, and material goods of a growing global population while at the same time protecting the ecological services provided by natural water ecosystems requires new approaches to using and managing fresh water. In this article, I propose a global effort (1) to ensure that freshwater ecosystems receive the quantity, quality, and timing of flows needed for them to perform their ecological functions and (2) to work toward a goal of doubling water productivity. Meeting these challenges will require policies that promote rather than discourage water efficiency, as well as new partnerships that cross disciplinary and professional boundaries.

AB The theme of this feature-the land-water interface: science for a sustainable biosphere-provides a forum to highlight the relationship between science and resource management, using restoration of the Kissimmee-Okeechobee-Everglades (KOE) ecosystem of south Florida as a case study. This subtropical ecosystem encompasses 16 counties and 44 000 km(2), from the Kissimmee Chain of Lakes in central Florida to the shallow estuarine waters of Florida Bay, and is within the jurisdiction of the South Florida Water Management District. During the next two decades, the floodplain and channel of the Kissimmee River will be re-coupled into a meandering river system with riparian wetlands and a more natural hydrology. An evaluation program on this restoration has been designed using ecological concepts and will provide opportunities to corroborate river/floodplain theory and document the varied responses of biotic communities to hydrological restoration. The evaluation program will provide the information needed for adaptive management of the river/floodplain ecosystem. Scientists and engineers are testing an array of ecological hypotheses on Lake Okeechobee, a central feature of the KOE ecosystem, to reduce uncertainty in predicting responses to nutrient loading, lake stage variation, and exotic species invasion. Research on the lake has clarified the linkage between physical factors, nutrient levels and biotic variables, and the frequency of algal blooms. This information has been used to support decisions and plans for managing the lake and its watershed. Restoration of the Florida Everglades is grounded in a diverse suite of scientific projects that are contributing to wetland science, ecosystem modeling, and restoration ecology. Studies on the effects of nutrients on wetland ecosystem structure and function have provided information at several spatial scales which is being applied directly to management issues. Findings from research and monitoring have been crucial in supporting decisions on the completion of six large stormwater treatment areas in the Everglades Construction Project. At the southern edge of the ecosystem, Florida Bay has been the focus of intensive research leading to changing paradigms on the relative effects of nutrients, turbidity, physical factors, and fresh water on the functions of this unique estuary. Scientific findings on the bay support the current direction of management actions to increase freshwater inputs from the southern Everglades, although much remains to be learned about this subtropical system.
   Management-oriented research has contributed to a large increase in the rate of scientific publication on the KOE ecosystem. Approximately 1500 articles have been published on the system in the 1990s, and these have contributed to advancing basic science as well as resource management. Ecological reports being published on the ecosystem use state-of-the-art approaches to time and space scales and appropriate blends of monitoring, experimentation, and modeling. Peer review and interagency cooperative planning have fostered relevant, timely, and objective science. The application of science to decision making in adaptive resource management plays an important role by clarifying those facts and concepts with the most significant predictive value for management and heuristic value for fundamental science. Improvement of the science-management linkage in south Florida and elsewhere awaits better interaction between scientists and managers in planning research and more effective communication of research findings. Relevant scientific information of high quality, particularly when published in the peer-reviewed literature, cannot be distorted easily and is vital to support informed and equitable social choices in the decision-making process.

AB Sustainable coastal management requires that the goals and means of management be made operational and specific. We use Waquoit Bay, Massachusetts, as a case study, to suggest a decision-making process that brings updated scientific results forward while incorporating stakeholder concerns. Land-derived nitrogen loading is the major agent of change for receiving estuaries in the Waquoit Bay estuarine complex, so control of nitrogen loading rates is a principal goal of land management plans. We can establish the relationships of land use pattern to nitrogen loading rates, and of loading rates to mean annual concentrations of nitrogen in the estuaries. The latter, in turn, can be related quantitatively to mean annual production and biomass of phytoplankton, macroalgae, and eel-grass. We propose that phytoplankton, macroalgal, and eelgrass production and biomass are suitable end point measures that can be made meaningful to stakeholders. We define the relationship of agent of change vs. end point measure, and then have policy makers and stakeholders decide which critical end point is desirable or acceptable for the selected end point measures. Thus, science results and stakeholder opinion are merged to establish management goals. Having chosen a desired critical end point, we can use nitrogen loading models to assess the degree to which different management options can alter nitrogen loading rates to levels that meet the agreed-upon management goals. These modeled simulations will identify the effects on loading rates from each management action and, hence, permit an assessment of a suite of management actions that can be used to meet the management goals. These procedures incorporate ecological knowledge with cultural, political, and economical imperatives and force identification of what is acceptable as an end result. These strategies furnish one way to design reasonable, and ecologically and socially sustainable plans for the inevitable use and management of coastal watersheds.

AB Long-term change in nitrogen storage in densely populated rural landscapes of China's Tai Lake Region was investigated by comparing soil and sediment N storage within an entire village ecosystem under traditional vs. contemporary management. Contemporary data were gathered on site from 1993 to 1996 by field surveying and sampling. Traditional period data, similar to 1930, were obtained from historical sources, interviews, and back estimation. N storage in the top 40 cm of soil and in low-density sediments (depth to density >1.3 g/cm(3)) was estimated within 35 village landscape components that were then aggregated into village-scale estimates and compared using Monte Carlo uncertainty analysis and a data quality index. Our results demonstrate with 76% probability that village soil and sediment N storage has increased from 1930 to 1994, most likely by 25% over the 1930s level, or similar to 1.4 Mg N/ha on average. A 20% increase in agricultural soil N concentrations caused more than half of the increase, potentially improving soil fertility. Sediment: accumulation in village canals, ponds, and marshes caused the remaining N storage increase, after sediment use for fertilizer ended in 1982, increasing the risk of flooding and impeding irrigation. Sedimentation at current rates will fill most canals within 25 years, and N concentration in agricultural soils may now be declining. Compounding these problems, village food security is threatened by a 30% decline in agricultural soil N per person since 1930 and a doubling in the proportion of village soil N under buildings and infrastructure, from 5% in 1930 to 11% in 1994. Village landscapes in the Tai Lake Region sequestered 1.7 Tg N and 16 Tg C between 1930 and 1994, forming a significant regional sink that may become a source of atmospheric C and N emissions, if organic N use continues to decline.

AB The paper gives a methodological overview of The VALSE Project, which was a European programme of research into valuation procedures for aiding the formulation and evaluation of sustainability policy. A notion of 'valuation from the point of view of Complexity' is built up through emphasising the permanent co-existence of multiple perspectives and, more particularly, the permanent possibility of shifts in perspective. Scientific enquiries and analyses are 'tested' - validated or invalidated - partly by reference to 'internal' norms of coherence and rigour, and partly by reference to 'external' considerations relating to the particular social and ecological context of the enquiry. Through reference to the four VALSE case studies, it is shown how the application of a chosen method of analysis structures the enquiry, while the researcher also learns about the reality through listening to what is said about the situation and about the research method itself from 'other points of view'. This demonstrates an approach to the design and implementation of environmental valuation studies that fully reconciles scientific and political dimensions of a social science process.

AB This paper reports on an empirical study that investigated the value, or significance, attributed to a rural woodland, and the social mechanisms by which this value may be transmitted (or lost) through time. A survey-interview enquiry was conducted which combined a data questionnaire with in-depth interview procedures, centred around: (i) the transaction price for the privately owned plots of trees and (ii) the disposition of wood-lot owners towards eventual sale of their plots, and the circumstances under which they would envisage such transactions. The forest value needs to be understood in patrimonial perspective, as a collective investment. The woodland as a whole, and the plots individually, are carriers of meaning - elements of family and communal heritage - proudly inherited from the previous generations and destined to be passed on to future generations. The case study illustrates a more general proposition, that evaluation of alternative uses of environmental resources, and their benefits and costs, is inseparable from the question of the distinct communities of interest to be, or not to be, sustained.

AB The paper introduces an on-going doctoral research study aimed at facilitating the operationalisation of sustainable energy systems. The study focuses upon the analysis of existing and development of new methods for the incorporation of socioenvironmental considerations into large-scale investment decision-making in the energy sector. The final output of the research study, to be completed by the end of 2001, will be a Framework for Sustainable Energy Sector Investment Analysis and Decision Support. The Framework will be designed for application by energy companies in decision-making processes concerning the selection of new power generation alternatives. In order to broadly identify decision-making parameters applied in energy sector decision processes, primary data collection for the study involves the retrospective analysis of decision cases. The results of one portion of information gathering undertaken as part of the aforementioned data collection are presented in the paper. A retrospective case study analysis was carried out on an investment decision-making process concerning the Flintranen biomass-based district heating plant in southern Sweden. To analyse the case study da ta, an analytical module was developed. Examination of the Flintranen case using the analytical module revealed several weaknesses in the decision-making methods applied to the planning of the facility, originating primarily from the incorporation of only a limited number of decision parameters or considerations into investment calculations. Furthermore, analysis showed that, had appropriate socio-environmental decision-support methods been incorporated into the decision process, considerable financial and internal environmental costs associated with the facility could have been avoided, and environmental risk linked to its operation decreased. Lessons learned from the Flintranen case will be utilised as input into the ongoing identification and development of parameters considered as important for inclusion in the Framework for Sustainable Energy Sector Investment Analysis and Decision Support.

ID EFFICIENCY; NETHERLANDS; INDUSTRY
AB Dematerialisation is assumed to contribute significantly to the alleviation of environmental problems. One of the possible causes of dematerialisation is a change in the consumption patterns of households. The aim of this article is to analyse changes consumption patterns of Dutch households in the period between 1948 to 1996 in order to discover whether these changes haven influenced the energy intensity of society. Due to the rise in consumption, the total household energy requirement per capita grew on average by 2.4% per year over a period of 48 years (this figure ignores efficiency changes in the supplying sectors). In the same period the total energy intensity of households fluctuated but on average changed from 5.6 to 6.3 MJ/NLG, an increase of 0.25% per year. If we exclude the direct energy consumption we find a slight decline in the indirect energy intensity, namely from 3.8 to 3.6 MJ/NLG (-0.14% per year). No significant trends to a lower energy intensity are found and there is no indication of dematerialisation of the consumption patterns. If governments pursue a policy of sustainable development they have to take into account the fact that dematerialisation of the consumption pattern does not seem to be an autonomous process.

AB Sustainable forest management (SFM) represents a new paradigm for forestry. Traditional forestry objectives aimed at sustainable yield management are being replaced with those of a sustainable ecosystem management. This paradigm shift in forest management requires an effective transfer of results from researchers to forest managers. To predict the potential impacts of future changes in global environment (such as climate, land use, fire disturbance, and forest harvesting) on the sustainability of forest ecosystems, forest resource managers will require forest simulation models. There have been two basic approaches to modeling forest vegetation growth and dynamics: empirical and mechanistic forest simulation models. This paper reviews and compares three major types of forest simulation models: (1) growth and yield models (empirical approach); (2) succession models (empirical-mechanistic hybrid approach); and (3) process models (mechanistic approach), and describes three case studies as examples. The advantages and disadvantages of the different modeling approaches are discussed. The case studies deal with predicting future forest stocks under different management options, simulating the potential effects of climate change, and effects of fire disturbance on structure and function of forest ecosystems in Canada. There is still a gap between foresters and ecologists in developing and using forest simulation models. Diversified modeling approaches integrated into a decision-support system, which will become an important tool for evaluating the sustainability of forest ecosystem in a changing environment, is emphasized.

AB This article makes two arguments. First, that social justice constitutes an inherent part of the conception of sustainable development that the World Commission on Environment and Development outlined in Our Common Future (1987). The primary goal of the Commission was to reconcile physical sustainability, need satisfaction and equal opportunities, within and between generations. Sustainable development is what defines this reconciliation.
   Second, it is argued that this conception of sustainable development is broadly compatible with liberal theories of justice. Sustainable development, however, goes beyond liberal theories of justice in many respects. It is based on three assumptions, which are for the most part ignored in liberal theories: an accelerating ecological interdependence, historical inequality in past resource use, and the 'growth of limits'. These assumptions create a conflict between intra- and intergenerational justice, which is ignored in liberal theories, but which sustainable development tries to solve. It does so by imposing duties on developed countries that goes beyond liberal demands, and by abandoning the focus 'solely on protection' that dominates non-anthropocentric approaches to environmental sustainability.

ID SCIENCE
AB Sustainability calls for the globe as a relevant unit of analysis, and systems thinking is an appropriate theoretical framework for this task. Yet systems thinking is employed in two contrary ways. The 'accommodating' systems approach is closely linked to the classical concept of science. It bases its credibility on the exclusion of values or any other subjective elements. The 'creative' way explicitly requires a subjectively recognised leading principle, according to which the system organises itself. Following the 'creative' approach, the paper argues that sustainability should be interpreted as a quest for conscious adoption of a global systems identity. It is this assigned system purpose that gives single actions and judgements within systems their meaning. Since subjective elements will always remain antagonistic in any classical approach, only a 'creative' approach offers possibilities for integrating cybernetic systems thinking, giving rise to a concept of systems guided by meaning.

AB Long-term experiments are leading indicators of sustainability and serve as an early warning system to detect problems that threaten future productivity. A non-decreasing trend in yield is necessary to call a system sustainable. The stability of yield is also an important characteristic to be considered when judging the value of a cropping system relative to others. In a long-term crop rotation experiment set up in 1961 the effects of seven crop sequences and five fertilisation treatments were studied on the yields of maize (Zea mays L.) and wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and on yield stability. In the two-factorial split-plot experiment the main plots consisted of crop sequences, namely maize and wheat monocultures, three dicultures, one triculture and a Norfolk crop rotation (maize-spring barley-peas-wheat). Apart From the control the fertiliser treatments represented various fertilisation systems, namely organic manuring (farmyard manure or recycled crop residues supplemented with NPK) and high levels of NPK fertilisation. The long-term experiment was analysed by conventional analysis of variance procedures and stability analysis. The yields of maize and wheat were lower in all cases in a monoculture than in a crop rotation. Reductions in maize yield in a monoculture were chiefly recorded after a dry winter, particularly if the summer was also dry. The reduction in wheat yield in a monoculture could be attributed mainly to pathogenic factors stimulated by the weather. The yield-increasing effect of crop rotation was inversely proportional to the ratio of maize or wheat in the sequence and was greatest in the Norfolk rotation, followed by the alfalfa-maize-wheat triculture, the wheat-maize, the alfalfa-maize and the alfalfa-wheat rotation. Farmyard manure and the recycling of crop residues (maize stalks, wheat straw) with NPK supplementation are efficient ways of fertilising maize and wheat. Significantly higher yields were obtained at high levels of NPK fertilisation, especially in rotations where the proportion of maize or wheat was 50% or higher. The yield-increasing effect of crop sequences compared to the wheat monoculture was not affected by fertilisation. In maize crop sequences, however, fertilisation reduced the rotation effect by almost half. Further research will be required to determine the biological explanation of this phenomenon. The regression method of stability analysis shows that the stability of various crop sequences differed significantly from those of monoculture. The difference can be attributed mainly to the significant differences between the intercepts. The results show that stability analysis is a suitable method for the interpretation of the significant environment x treatment interactions observed in variance analysis models of long-term crop rotation experiments. Both the variance and regression methods of stability analysis contributed to the characterisation of the stability of the experimental treatments in various environments.

AB Forage and ruminant production in Western Europe have increased significantly since World War II. However, in the last decade the livestock production sector has come under increasing pressure as the European Union introduced the milk quota system, effectively curbing total national and individual farm production volume, and national governments increasingly took measures to reduce the losses of nutrients from these systems to the environment. In the late 1980's in the Netherlands a project was initiated with the objective to design, test and further develop a farming system that can serve as a starting point for the development of dairy farms on dry sandy soils with average milk production (system 'De Marke') using the method of 'prototyping'. First, a number of farming systems have been identified that, in theory, meet the formulated objectives. From this theoretically acceptable set one of the technically and economically most attractive and, from a research point of view, most interesting was implemented at the experimental farm 'De Marke' in 1992. The functioning of this system is monitored in quantitative terms by measuring flows of dry matter and nutrients. The results so far suggest that on dry sandy soils strict environmental standards for losses of nitrogen and accumulation of phosphorus can be attained within a short time while maintaining the current milk quota. Grass, maize and fodder beets could be grown in such a way that the norms for nitrate losses could be met. Improved utilization of animal manure and lower manuring levels allowed a reduction in the use of fertilizer-N of 74% compared to current practice. The input of P in feed and the output in milk and meat could be more or less balanced: P-surplus was only 18% of that on the current farm. To obtain reliable results the research will be continued for a longer period of time because the system has to stabilize, the soil nutrient and organic matter stores and soil fertility react slowly to changes in management, and weather conditions are always variable.

AB Two recent major drivers of change in the food industry, particulary with plant-based foods, have been gene technologies and the entry of intellectual property into many areas of strategic and applied biology of the principal food plants. It seems likely that for the next few years advances in food processing will rely on plant breeding which takes advantages of the increasing knowledge base coming from gene technologies but which does not rely on the involvement of introduced transgenes. New diagnostics and assays will allow grains and other foods to be equipped with changes in their protein, lipid, starch and other biochemical components so that they better fit food functionalities and product quality requirements. Subsequently, genetically modified foods are likely to be accepted as consumers become more familiar with what is actually involved in bringing about the production of better and safer foods by these methods. Importantly, many improvements will involve adjustments without the addition of any new components. These will assist acceptance of the technologies. It seems inevitable that transgenic crops will eventually be the norm in our food production systems because the new technologies promise such significant gains in efficiencies on farm with corresponding increases in the sustainability and reliability of the production system. They also will provide for an unprecedented differentiation of raw materials designed to meet the demands of the increasingly discriminating consumer.

AB Organic matter is of primary importance to the sustainability of long-term site productivity in forest ecosystems. In boreal forests, organic matter accumulates at the surface as mor humus. This may represent a substantial portion of the total nutrient capital of a site, and its decomposition is essential for the short-term availability of nutrients for tree growth and long-term site fertility. However, organic matter accumulation at the soil surface can also effect the forest ecosystem by immobilizing nutrients making them unavailable for plant uptake, and by creating physical and environmental conditions that can impede seedling establishment and survival. Therefore, it is necessary to understand the processes of humus formation and decomposition in order to manage these soils in a manner that will maintain or improve site productivity.
   This paper provides an overview of (i) the composition of humus, (ii) the conditions in the boreal forest that result in the surface accumulation of humus, (iii) decomposition processes and (iv) the effects of humus on nutrient (especially nitrogen) availability. Questions relating to the detrimental role of surface organic matter accumulation, the effects of natural disturbances (e.g., fire) and harvesting disturbances on humus loss and accumulation and management practices that can maintain long-term site productivity will also be discussed.

DT Article
AB The unintended impacts of human appropriation of the planet's resources have become so numerous, voluminous, and entangled in feedback loops that they often overwhelm the capacities of decisionmakers to cope with current crises, much less prepare for a sustainable future. The difficulty may be alleviated by viewing global change from a broader perspective than is normally offered either by specialists (whose views are necessarily narrow) or by mainstream media (whose interests are usually fragmentary and parochial). From this broader perspective, it can be seen that four "megaphenomena" began sweeping the planet in the past century. Graphed on a time-line of millennia rather than years or days, they appear as four enormous "spikes" - of human population, materials/energy consumption, carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere, and extinctions of species. These megaphenomena account for the proliferation of afflictions swamping humanity at the outset of the 21st century. Understanding the nature of the spikes may offer the most viable means of managing - by attacking the roots - of what could otherwise escalate into an increasingly disastrous cascade of impacts.

AB Single-flowered vetch (Vicia articulata Hornem.), a crop native of the Mediterranean area, is widespread mainly in south Europe, in west Asia and Australia for forage, green manure and human food. In Italy this crop was still cultivated in the 1950s but, later, no records concerning its cultivation were available. This strongly suggested to place V. articulata among the Italian crop species that disappeared in the 20th century. In the course of a collecting expedition in Sardinia, a relic population, mistaken for lentil, was found. This population has been characterised from a botanical, nutritional and cytological point of view. V. articulata appears to be lower in nutritional quality than lentil. However, within the framework of a sustainable agriculture, V. articulata could find interesting opportunities. In fact, its role in soil conservation and rescue of marginal areas could be interesting, as well as its potentialities as a source of useful genes in breeding programmes.

AB The development of large-scale irrigation agriculture in the arid region of Central Asia, which was initiated in the 1960s under the former Soviet Union, has resulted in soil salinization in irrigated farms and their vicinity. In order to establish an appropriate countermeasure against soil salinization, we investigated the distribution pattern of salt-affected soils and their forming processes in rice-based cropping fields and their surroundings in four former state farms in the R. Ili and R. Syr-Darya basins in southern Kazakhstan. In the farm along R. Iii, two types of distribution patterns of salts in the soil profiles were observed. The first process was observed in cultivated and uncultivated fields adjacent to the irrigation,canal, and characterized by an accumulation of gypsum and/or soluble salts at/near the soil surface, suggesting an upward movement of water with a high concentration of salts. The second process was observed in uncultivated fields far from canals. Salt accumulation was observed in deeper horizons in combination with a low-salt, alkalinized layer on top, indicating that the soils were formed by leaching with a positive reaction for residual sodium carbonate. In the surface soil layer under upland cropping, amounts of soluble cations was 16.6 +/- 3.4 (SE) cmol(c) kg(-1) in the farm located in the lower part of R. Syr-Darya, which was much higher than that in the farm along R. Iii (4.8 +/- 0.4 cmol(c) kg(-1)). In the latter, the annual rate of salt accumulation during the first year of upland cropping was roughly estimated to 45 kmol(c) ha(-1) year(-1), while in the second year the accumulation was about 15 kmol(c) ha(-1) year(-1). The contents of soluble salts decreased to 2.0 +/- 0.6 cmol(c) kg(-1) during the period of rice cultivation in the farm along R. Iii, showing that water-logging in this phase was effective to leach out the salts accumulated during the upland phase. The soils in the paddy field in the R. Syr-Darya basin showed, however, still a high salinity level, i.e. 5.6 +/- 1.2 cmol(c) kg(-1), presumably because of the incomplete drainage conditions. These results suggested that the rice-based irrigation agriculture studied is sustainable provided that an adequate supply of irrigation water and an appropriate drainage system are available.

AB In the study of environmental policy and sustainable urban development there has been an increasing emphasis upon notions of 'the local' as a key site of intervention. However, the rationale for this is rarely stated in policy terms and has barely been addressed from a theoretical perspective. In correcting what amounts to significant lacunae in the analysis of local environmental policy, we suggest that, in terms of both policy and discourse, 'the environment' is undergoing a process of governance rescaling within the state. Although this rescaling process can be understood as integral to the problem of social regulation in after-Fordism, it clearly also has important implications for the governance of local economies and the local form of environmental policy. Although the rescaling of environmental policy appears to be predominantly downwards (i.e. a process of localization),'the environment' has become a particular object of regulation and focus of struggle at a variety of spatial scales. In order to understand the uneven development of local environmental policy making and sustainable development, it is necessary to examine the immediate, local contexts of governance and social regulation. Drawing upon work in political economy, we suggest that a 'reconstructed urban regime theory' approach offers a means of conceptualizing the form of local environmental policy and economic governance; at the same time it can make the necessary connections to regulatory processes operating at a variety of spatial scales.

AB The definition and reinforcement of boundaries is the first stage in the development of successful management systems for common property resources. The policy makers of the European Union (EU), when formulating the Common Fisheries Policy, opted to make relatively little use of spatial boundaries to regulate access to resources. The EU has sought to create a fisheries exploitation system that ignores sovereign claims to the resource under a property rights regime driven by 'equal access'. The regime is regulated within a common boundary by means of controls of fish catches, limitation of fishing effort and the implementation of conservation techniques. However, as problems of fisheries management in the EU have escalated, the issue of boundaries has come to the fore. This is reflected in the activities of organisations within the industry that are developing strategies to survive the downturn in benefits flow from the fishery at local, regional and national levels. The analysis developed in the paper demonstrates the difficulties of creating a national boundary based on the concept of a 200-mile exclusive zone. At the regional level, while the boundary that relates to Shetland has created benefits for the local fishermen, it is still a weak institution. The strongest boundary is that of the crab fisheries of the western English Channel. Through the collective will of the resource users this boundary comes closest to achieving the theoretical ideal of establishing a congruence between ecosystem and governance.

SO GEOFORUM

ID WORKPLACE; SPACE
AB The increasing use of cars by women, especially mothers, is one of the more significant transport trends of the past decade. This paper suggests the need for a fresh approach to this issue, namely one that emphasises culture. It demonstrates the potential insights offered by this approach by using it to interpret a small-scale, qualitative case study of suburban mothers' motor vehicle use in Sydney, Australia. It suggests that the car is used as a 'management tool', an aid in managing complex daily routines and to implement notions of 'good mothering'. The study underlines the need for further, culturally aware, research on motor vehicle use and of the difficulties facing the development of successful sustainable transport policies.

AB The fish biomass on the continental shelf off the eastern USA and Southeastern Canada has shifted towards a higher proportion of pelagic fishes in the 1990s. This study provides estimates of consumption by 12 piscivorous fishes on Atlantic mackerel (Scomber scombrus), Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus), butterfish (Peprilus triacanthus), sand lance (Ammodytes sp.), short-finned squid (Illex illecebrosus), and long-finned squid (Loligo pealei during 1977-1997. Results suggest that total consumption tall prey) by the 12 predatory fish species is probably large relative to standing stocks of the above prey. Total consumption by these piscivores (all prey) ranged from 1.5-3.0 million tonnes during this period. The flow of fish biomass from these prey pelagic species to these 12 predators is an important and large fraction of the overall energy budget of the Northeast USA shelf ecosystem. The abundance of prey fishes and squids was reflected in the diets of individual predators; for example several prey species, such as sand lance and Atlantic herring, were very prominent at specific times during the period 1977-1997. Consumption of pelagic fish and squid by predatory fish appears to equal or exceed landings in most years from 1977-1997. In several cases, notably for long-finned squid, Atlantic herring and butterfish, consumption by piscivores may approach or exceed the current estimates of maximum sustainable yield, suggesting that changes in predator abundance may have important implications for long-term fishery yields of pelagic species.

AB Variable bit-rate (VBR) MPEG video traffic is highly bursty due to group of pictures structure, and shows time-variant statistical characteristics due to scene changes. These characteristics make it more difficult to manage network resources, and leads to the significant reduction in network utilization. In this paper, me deal with the issues related to efficiently transmitting VBR MPEG video traffic over asynchronous transfer mode networks, while maintaining consistent visual duality and improving network utilization on the basis of real time applications. First, we propose a joint encoder and channel-rate control scheme that comply with not only negotiated traffic parameters, but also constraints imposed by encoder and decoder buffers. Second, we propose a dynamic bandwidth renegotiation method by combining the above scheme with a traffic smoothing method that can make the peak rate close to the sustainable rate. The efficiencies of the proposed methods are compared with a few other competitive schemes such as transmission methods for unconstrained VBR and the constant bit-rate scheme with average bandwidth equal to that of the proposed methods.

AB This paper attempts to identify attributes that are considered essential for a development of sustainable forest management practices in the Siberian forests. This goal is accomplished through an analysis of net primary production of phytomass (NPP), which is used to classify the Siberian ecoregions into compact and cohesive NPP performance classes. Rough Sets (RS) analysis is used as a data mining methodology for the evaluation of the Siberian forest database. In order to interpret relationships between various forest characteristics, relationships known as interesting rules are generated on a basis of a reduced problem description.

AB The information revolution has opened a new era in decision support: the Internet and the World Wide Web have emerged as powerful new media for collecting, disseminating, and accessing information related to the sustainable development of life support systems. Web-based decision support tools are useful for addressing large scale, complex, and indeterminate problems, such as global climate change, that have consequences across physical, biological, and social dimensions. In this paper, we provide algorithms to extend the capabilities of Web-HIPRE, a Java-applet for multiple criteria analysis, developed by [17], so that it constitutes a flexible and effective tool for environmental decision analysis under uncertainty. This tool is demonstrated using a case study of forest management in the province of New Brunswick, Canada: alternative forest utilization policies are evaluated in the context of ecological and socio-economic objectives. A new approach for multiple criteria decision analysis is put forth that investigates the robustness of policy alternatives to uncertainty. Numerical and theoretical results show that Web-HIPRE is a valuable instrument to promote ecological sustainability.

AB This paper extends the standard generational accounting methodology by incorporating prospective changes in the economic environment, assigning the benefits of government purchases to generations, distinguishing between public consumption and public investment, and transforming the generational accounts into government budgets. It applies the methodology to the Netherlands. An expected increase in labor-force participation almost offsets the adverse effect of aging on the sustainability of the Dutch public finances. Since the rise in labor-force participation occurs before the bulk of the aging, the government will have to run sizable fiscal surpluses in the next decades in order to create the budgetary room for higher age-related government expenditures in later decades.

AB In spite of increasing parental participation in their children's education, and the growing research interest in this trend, the study of one of the central components of parental involvement, namely, parental expectations of teachers, has been scarce. The present research focuses on this important, albeit neglected, topic. We examined the effects of the sex of the parent and the sex and grade level of the specific child on parental expectations of teachers. Seven hundred and sixty-five Israeli parents of students attending 31 educational institutions participated in the study. They completed the Expectations of Teachers questionnaire, consisting of 12 items describing behavioural characteristics of teachers subsumed under three broad categories: Help and Assistance, Teaching Competence, and Fairness. Greater expectations for Help and Assistance were reported by the parents, followed by Teaching Competence and Fairness on the part of the teacher. Mothers hold higher Fairness and Help and Assistance expectations as compared with fathers. Help and competence expectations were higher for parents of female students as compared with parents of boys. Conclusions from our study call for increasing efforts geared toward the building of a sustainable and beneficial partnership between teachers and parents for the best interest of the students and for the further elucidation of teachers expectations of parents.

DE Brazilian tropical wetland; ethnographic methods; fish kills; limnology
AB 1. Participatory research methodologies incorporating local knowledge are important to the success of ecological research and the sustainable management of natural systems. However, methods of this type are not commonly employed in the natural sciences.
   2. We adopted a scientifically rigorous ethnographic research methodology to incorporate local knowledge into understanding a natural limnological phenomenon in the Brazilian Pantanal. Known locally as 'dequada', it is associated with fish kills.
   3. Using primarily open-ended questions and semi-structured interviews, 30 older head-of-household men were interviewed, by the same interviewer, in a small community representative of the few local riverside settlements. Their opinions were then contrasted with current scientific knowledge.
   4. In concordance with the scientific community, the local community cited decomposition of organic material as the principal cause of fish mortality due to the dequada. Local people therefore can have a well-founded understanding of their environment.
   5. This study demonstrates the importance of incorporating local knowledge to corroborate and, often, to guide the process of scientific inquiry. In this case, local knowledge added to scientific knowledge by providing a more complete understanding of the management and conservation of a natural system. We recommend that ecologists should be ready to acknowledge that local understanding can be greater than that of 'outsiders'.

ID DESERTIFICATION
AB Early-warning indicators of rangeland health can be used to estimate the functional integrity of a site and may allow sustainable management of desert rangelands. The utility of several vegetation canopy-based indicators of range land health at 32 Great Basin rangeland locations was investigated. The indicators were originally developed in rangelands of the Chihuahuan Desert. Soil resources are lost through wind and water-driven erosion mainly from areas unprotected by plant canopies (i.e. bare soil). Study sites in Idaho had the smallest bare patches, followed by sites in Oregon. The more arid Great Basin Sagebrush Zone sites in Utah had the largest bare patches. Several vegetational indicators including percent cover by vegetation, percent cover by life-form, percent cover by sagebrush, and percent cover by resilient species were negatively related to mean bare patch size and are potential indicators of Great Basin rangeland condition. Plant community composition and the range of bare patch sizes were different at sites in the three locations in Idaho, Oregon and Utah. Therefore, expected indicator values are location specific and should not be extrapolated to other locations. The condition of study sites were often ranked differently by different indicators. Therefore, the condition of rangeland sites should be evaluated using several indicators. (C) 2000 Academic Press.

AB The paper presents a novel transdisciplinary approach to investigate non-sustainable civilisation-nature interactions in the context of global change. The approach rests on the decomposition of intricate dynamics of Global Change into problematic patterns civilisation nature interactions ('syndromes') this is done by an iterative process of observations, data and theoretical system analysis and GIS-based modelling attempts. These syndromes of global change characterise endangering and risky developments of civilisation nature interaction and represent a baseline for measuring and indicating 'non-sustainability'; in order to have a sustainable development it is necessary to have a far-reaching absence of syndromes. They encompass the core problems of global change, e.g. soil degradation, climate change, threats to biodiversity or global deforestation. Patterns are defined as characteristic constellations of global change trends ('symptoms'). Cause-effect schemes of symptoms and their interrelations are constituted as complex phenomena resulting from interactions over the different spheres of the Earth system (biosphere, atmosphere, hydrosphere, population, pedosphere, economy, psychosocial sphere, social organisation, science and technology). The approach is illustrated by an analysis of civilisation-nature interaction patterns relevant for global deforestation. Global forest ecosystems have been chosen for this investigation because of their important role in the global carbon cycle and their importance for biological diversity. The resulting geographical patchwork of the combined dispositions and intensities of the different syndromes describes current and future regional threats to forests by their underlying global cause-effect patterns of civilisation-nature interaction.

AB In response to the serious scarcity of Ocotea bullata (Burch.) Baillon (Lauraceae), an important medicinal plant in South Africa, Cryptocarya species (Lauraceae) are frequently used as substitute plants. Our investigation was aimed at a pharmacological comparison of O. bullata and the Cryptocarya species C. latifolia Sonder, C. myrtifolia Stapf., C. transvaalensis Burtt Davy, C. woodii Engl. and C. wyliei Stapf, in terms of in vitro cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibition, as an indication of O. bullatus' repute as a remedy against headache. Furthermore, we also compared bark and leaf extracts of the species investigated in order to address the problem of destructive ring-barking. The utilization of leaves instead of bark would help in the management of threatened medicinal plants. All Cryptocareya species were superior to O. bullata with regard to bark extracts. C. woodii bark extracts showed outstanding equipotent activity towards COX-I and COX-2. The activity of extracts of fresh leaves was comparable to the activity of the respective bark extracts. Drying the leaves before extraction resulted in a loss of activity, with the exception of C. wyliei. Extracts of dried C. wyliei leaves exhibited high inhibitory activity, with a COX-2/COX-1 ratio of 5.8. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

SO JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY ECONOMICS

DT Article
DE ecological stability; species survival; inter- and intraspecies
   competition
AB Whoever exists belongs to a species, which did not become extinct, has a (geno-)type, which should be well adjusted, and lives in a habitat which has been sustainable for a long time. We do not only analyze interspecies competition and the conditions for species survival, but also intraspecies competition of (geno-)types as in evolutionary biology and game theory. Survival in inter and intraspecies competition together with sustainability define ecological stability, a concept which we illustrate by an example of solitary and social grazers who compete for food supply and who are endangered by the same predators. Although our approach is inspired by empirical evidence, no systematic attempt is made to apply it to some specific ecology. JEL-classification: C70, C72.

TI Criteria and standards for sustainable agriculture
SO JOURNAL OF PLANT NUTRITION AND SOIL SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
DE sustainable agriculture; environmental compatibility; criteria;
   tolerability ranges; guide values
AB This paper presents an assessment system which on the basis of quantifiable criteria and appropriate orientation values describes the risk potentials of farming as far as environmental protection and sustainability is concerned. The procedure addresses the most significant risks and suggests ranges for their tolerability. By this way farmers can recognize principal shortcomings of their management and look for appropriate countermeasures to cope with them. The guiding principle is a way of farming which uses the available resources and the production potential as efficiently as possible, while keeping the unfavorable impacts on soils, water, air and biota within acceptable limits. Several years of investigations in about 125 different farms have shown that non-tolerable impacts of fanning on the environment are predominantly due to avoidable managerial mistakes. The suggested assessment system provides criteria for the actual magnitude and the tolerability of the different risk potentials and may thus help to substantiate the compliance with such general principles as "good farming practice".

AB No-tillage (NT) cropping systems are becoming increasingly important in the Brazilian savanna. To evaluate their sustainability we compared soil chemical properties in 1- to 3-year-old NT systems following 9 to 11 years of conventional tillage (CT) with systems where CT was continuously in place for 12 years. In the rainy season 1997/98, NT was cropped with soybean and CT with corn while in the rainy season 1998/99 both systems were cropped with soybean. Soil solid phase samples were taken from the 0-0.15, 0.15-0.3, 0.3-0.8, 0.8-1.2, and 1.2-2 m layers on three spatially Separated plots under each of NT and CT. Soil solution samples were collected weekly at 0.15, 0.3, 0.8, 1.2, and 2 m soil depth during two rainy seasons (14 October to 28 April 1997/98 and 1998/99). We determined soil moisture contents, pH, the concentrations of exchangeable cations, the electrical conductivity (EC) of the soil solution, and the concentrations of Al, C, Ca, Cl-, K, Mg, Mn, Na, NH4+, NO3-, P, S, and Zn in solid soil and soil solution samples. Differences in soil solid phase properties and moisture content between NT and CT were small, few were significant. Under NT, the average solution pH was significantly lower (5.5), Al (26 mu g l(-1)), Mn (17 mu g l(-1)) and total organic C concentrations (TOC, 65 mg l(-1)) were higher than under CT (pH: 6.0, Al: 14 mu g l(-1), Mn: 14 mu g l(-1), TOC: 5.5 mg l(-1)). Irrespective of the different crops in the first rainy season, under NT, the EC (205 mu S cm(-1)), Ca (17 mg l(-1)), and Mg (2.9 mg l(-1)) concentrations at 0-0.3 m depth were lower than under CT (EC: 224 mu S cm(-1), Ca: 25 mg l(-1), Mg: 5.6 mg l(-1)). At 1.2-2 m depth, the reverse order was observed (EC: 124 mu S cm(-1) under NT and 84 mu S cm(-1) under CT, Ca: 11 mg l(-1) under NT and 7.5 mg l(-1) under CT, Mg: 3.1 mg l(-1) under NT and 1.8 mg l(-1) under CT). Our results indicate that enhanced soil acidification because of higher rates of organic matter mineralization and a more pronounced nutrient leaching because of increased pore continuity may limit the sustainability of NT.

DE groundwater; lithofacies; aquifer management; Calcutta and Howrah
AB The twin city of Calcutta-Howrah is underlain by a succession of Quaternary sediments consisting of clay, silt, fine to coarse sand and occasional gravel. Below these sediments at depths beyond 296 m, there is a thick sequence of Pliocene clay. The top clay bed of Quaternary sequence contains peaty intercalations indicating bog or marshy condition at depths of 2 - 5 m and 12 - 12.6 m. The peal layers were deposited during the period c.3990 years B.P, to c. 7030 years B.P. Grain size analysis of the sandy horizons indicates that the sands were deposited in a fluvial environment. Lithofacies analysis of the Quaternary sediments indicates that the gravelly sand horizons occurring in E - W and NNE - SSW trends in the depth range of 80-120 m are potential aquifer zones. These two trends of deposition of very coarse sediments probably indicate the route of sediment movement where high energy condition prevailed. The sandy sediments at a depth span of 24 to 81 m are yellowish to brownish coloured suggesting oxidising conditions of deposition. The sediments occurring above and below this horizon are grey to light grey in colour indicating reducing conditions of deposition. The over-extraction of groundwater from the aquifer has resulted in the change of the groundwater flow pattern from an "open" system in 1956 to a "closed" one in 1993 with the formation of a groundwater trough in the south-central part of Calcutta. Based on depth of the aquifers, status of the piezometric surface, lithofacies and grain size ratio, an aquifer development plan has been proposed fora sustainable groundwater development in the twin city.

DT Article
ID CAPITAL THEORY; ECONOMICS
AB This paper examines two Pacific Island cultures, Easter Island and Tikopia, and the relationship between natural resource systems, human-made capital, population growth, and institutional change. Easter Island followed a preindustrial society pattern of overshoot-and-collapse. However, Tikopia evolved cultural practices leading to zero-population growth and sustainable resource use. Using a modified Lotka-Volterra, predator-prey model; we find (I) investment in human-made capital does not necessarily eliminate the boom- and bust-cycles of economic activity and population observed in. many past societies; and (2) institutional adaptation and resource conservation can be critical in achieving population stability. (Q20).

ID SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT; PERFORMANCE; MANAGEMENT; FRAMEWORK; FIRM
AB Arguments can be made on both sides of the question of whether a stringent global corporate environmental standard represents a competitive asset or Liability for multinational enterprises (MNEs) investing in emerging and developing markets. Analyzing the global environmental standards of a sample of U.S.-based MNEs in relation to their stock market performance, we find that firms adopting a single stringent global environmental standard have much higher market values, as measured by Tobin's q, than firms defaulting to less stringent, or poorly enforced host country standards. Thus, developing countries that use lax environmental regulations to attract foreign direct investment may end up attracting poorer quality, and perhaps less competitive, firms. Our results also suggest that externalities are incorporated to a significant extent in firm valuation. We discuss plausible reasons for this observation.

AB The study explored the implementation of workplace health programmes in 14 NHS Trusts (hospitals), it sought to identify different approaches to implementation and measures that could be used to guide future development. The study comprised inter-related elements examining the process of implementing workplace health and the impact on staff. An innovative action research approach was applied to the evaluation. The aims of the evaluation were to generate activity and learning within the organisations which was sustainable (long term) and transferable outside the study organisations. The study is described in terms of the multiple methods and the ways in which these have been brought together in the analysis. The approach has been informed by a shift from an individualistic perspective towards one which sees the health of workers within the broader context of organisational development and management. The research identified a number of dilemmas for workplace health with its focus on the health of the individual. A typology was developed which describes different approaches to workplace health and their impact on sustaining such initiatives. It suggests that for workplace health to be successful it must address the organisational context as well as individual staff needs. Results from a survey of staff in the 14 trusts seems to demonstrate an association between the approaches, described in the typology, and an impact on staff. Workplace health programmes need to shift towards approaches where the individual's health is seen within the wider context of the organisation.

AB Andean landscapes are rich with examples of traditional land uses that have proven sustainable over centuries, contribute to biodiversity and other natural values, and are living examples of cultural heritage. These landscapes and the diverse array of values they represent are, however, exceedingly vulnerable. As countries in the region strengthen existing national systems of protected areas, protection of these working landscapes-places where people live and work (Figure 1)-deserves greater attention and requires new and innovative approaches to conservation. Emerging trends in conservation and protected areas management are creating new opportunities to engage local people in the stewardship of the natural and cultural heritage of working landscapes. This type of community-based approach builds on years of experience yet extends conservation strategies in new ways and holds great promise as a foundation for sustainable land stewardship.

AB Conservation of agricultural biodiversity has become an important paradigm in efforts to promote sustainable development throughout the world. This is especially the case in Andean countries, where ex situ conservation of crops has been a focus of attention since the 1970s. In Peru in the early 1990s, researchers and development specialists also focused on in situ conservation and the participation of campesino communities in mountain development processes. They designed the Cajamarca model as a result of several years of experience in rural development projects. This model includes so-called seed fairs (Figure 1) and encourages the creation of local seed banks managed by a conservationist campesino association. The HimalAndes Project, which promotes technical cooperation to support exchange of seeds and local knowledge between mountain agriculture ecosystems, is another recent project with a partial focus on agrobiodiversity conservation in Andean and other countries.

AB The Nanda Devi Biosphere Reserve (NDBR) in the western Himalaya has a high level of biological and cultural diversity. The Bhotiya community, whose livelihood is highly dependent on local natural resources, inhabits the buffer zone of NDBR. Bhotiya practice seasonal and altitudinal migration and stay inside the buffer zone of NDBR for only 6 months (May-October). A survey was conducted in 1996 in 5 villages in Pithoragarh District of the buffer zone, where Bhotiya cultivate medicinal plants on their agriculture fields. The aim of the survey was to understand the socioeconomics of medicinal plant cultivation and evaluate the future prospects of this practice in promoting sustainable development among the local community. Of a total of 71 families, 90% cultivated medicinal plants on 78% of the total reported cultivated area (15.29 ha). At the time of the survey, a total of 12 species of medicinal plants were under cultivation, of which 6 were being marketed while the remaining 6 were still under nursery plantation for future propagation. On average, a family earns about Rs.2423 +/- 376.95 per season from the sale of medicinal plants (Rs.38 = US$1 in 1996). Based on the average productivity (kg/ha/y), we estimated that an average family could earn between Rs.4362 and Rs.86,500 from the sale of medicinal herbs. Encouragement of medicinal plant cultivation at high altitudes in the Himalayas would help to generate better monetary returns as well as conserve these herbs in the wild and preserve traditional ethnomedicinal knowledge among local people.

TI Applied plant sciences in Hungary (past, present and future)
SO NOVENYTERMELES
LA Hungarian
DT Article
AB In the 20th century the most important field of applied plant sciences were crop production, horticulture, forestry, plant breeding and plant protection. The principal objective was to promote the economical and sustainable use of the Hungarian agricultural area of 8 million hectares. At the end of the 20th century the greatest global challenges were the accelerated development of molecular biology and biotechnology: globalisation, the patenting of basic research results, improved quality and the maintenance of sustainable development. Special problems facing Hungary today are the expected consequences after joining the EC, the transitional overproduction, the diversified size of landed properties and the decrease in the average yield of major crops.
   In the second half of the 20th century Hungary held a more significant position in global agriculture output than could be expected from its size. This can be partially attributed to the high internationally recognised standard of applied plant sciences. The efficiency of research sharply decreased after the democratic transformation in the nineties. The main reasons for this are discussed in text.
   At the beginning of the next century new governmental regulations will be needed to overcome these difficulties in scientific research. As regards applied plant sciences this must include a declaration of the areas where the international competitiveness of Hungarian research must be maintained. The following research topics in applied plant sciences are suggested:
   Collection, investigation and preservation of plant genetic resources.
   Biotechnology and genomics of the most important species in Hungarian agriculture, horticulture and forestry.
   Classical plant breeding, variety qualification, certification of seed and reproductive materials.
   Local, regional and long-term experiments including both extensive and intensive technologies as well as bioproduction and post-harvest processes.

DE recycle; energy; material; flow; sulfur
AB Environmental protection or recycling is currently one of the key issues for many industrial firms. Sustainable development, zero-emission and inverse manufacturing are becoming very common keywords used in the justification of today's projects. However, those who use these words are more often than not world lenders in the consumption of energy and natural resources. One is led to the conclusion, therefore, that these people must be hypocrites or ignorant or, alternatively, that the phrase sustainable is misused and should be restricted to a very concise meaning. If the paradigm of sustainability is not well defined, then if serves no purpose. Countries of OECD members are responsible for about a half the total energy consumption.
   The goal of "zero-emission" is impossible in view of thermodynamics and the practicalities of engineering. The only way to achieve the true sustainability on the planet, therefore is to set industrial activity to within some equilibrium magnitude of energy supplied to the planet by the solar system.

AB Sainsbury's recently completed millennium store on the Greenwich peninsula sets out to redefine supermarkets both in terms of environmental performance and appearance. Its low energy design features-such as a naturally lit sales floor, passive ventilation, combined heat and power plant and groundwater cooling system-help to deliver a building that uses up to 50% less energy than a similar-sized conventional store. This paper describes how civil and structural engineers contributed to this ground-breaking project by adapting both modern and historic structural solutions to develop, design and construct what should set a new benchmark for environmentally friendly and sustainable construction.

AB Urbanization and the ability to manage for a sustainable future present numerous challenges for geographers and planners in metropolitan regions. Remotely sensed data are inherently suited to provide information on urban land cover characteristics, and their change over time, at various spatial and temporal scales. Data models for establishing the range of urban land cover types and their biophysical composition (vegetation, soil, and impervious surfaces) are integrated to provide a hierarchical approach to classifying land cover within urban environments. These data also provide an essential component for current simulation models of urban growth patterns, as both calibration and validation data. The first stages of the approach have been applied to examine urban growth between 1988 and 1995 for a rapidly developing area in southeast Queensland, Australia. Landsat Thematic Mapper image data provided accurate (83% adjusted overall accuracy) classification of broad land cover types and their change over time. The combination of commonly available remotely sensed data, image processing methods, and emerging urban growth models highlights an important application for current and next generation moderate spatial resolution image data in studies of urban environments.

AB The Internet has become a major source and vehicle for technological transfer and project development during the 1990s. Three Pacific Island countries - Fiji, Samoa and Vanuatu - were connected through Pactok, an inexpensive computer-mediated communication (CMC) system originally developed for non-government organizations (NGOs) through the Pacific Sustainable Development Networking Project (PSDNP). The PSDNP was established by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in 1993 and funded by the UNDP until December 1996. Content analysis of the Project Document indicated that although the PSDNP aimed to improve access by these countries to scientific and technical information, an important underlying theme was to ensure these Pacific Island countries were connected to the Internet. It also appeared that the agency was keen for organizations in these countries to increase access to international information, with little regard for local and regional sources. Subsequent analysis of Pactok sites early in 1997 showed that the PSDNP had encouraged the project's primary stakeholders - regional organizations and NGOs - to join Pactok. However, international agencies such as the UNDP and other foreign assistance agencies also have access to Pactok and are able to disseminate agency ideologies, objectives and priorities directly to users in Pacific Island countries.

ID SYSTEMS
AB A review of global experience suggests that information technology (IT) has great potential to contribute to public sector reform. However, the Indian reality-like that for many countries-has been more problematic, with many failures of IT-related reform; failures that can be described as total, partial or failures of sustainability and replication. Many factors help explain such failure, but a key component is the approach to IT and reform adopted by senior public officials. A 'four Is' model of approaches is described: the non-IT approach of 'ignore' and the IT-related approaches of 'isolate', 'idolize' and 'integrate'. Analysis of Indian cases suggests it is the last approach that is most likely to deliver reform objectives; yet it remains the least commonly adopted. Changes are therefore required in current strategies for public administration training and in the planning and management of change. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Research suggests that borrower 'ownership' of reforms is highly correlated with the success of reforms in developing countries. One of the most important components of ownership is the nature of public-private relations and consultation with interest groups. Yet participatory reform must overcome several political dilemmas, including problems of credibility, collective action, and distributive (in)justice. The characteristics of reforms also affect the possibilities for participation. Democratic governments interested in making policy reform more participatory and presumably more sustainable can draw on several strategies, including the selective use of incentives and compensation, public education and communications, capacity building in society, institutional mechanisms for consultation, and political sequencing of reforms. These strategies have implications for the foreign aid agencies who often fund reforms. They suggest that donors need to recognize the political rationality behind cross-payments and spending to maintain important constituencies; that political sustainability may require reform sequences that are out of step with current orthodoxy; that policies ought to create winners before creating losers; that democratic consultation will require much more time in achieving consensus; and that outside actors need to refrain from intervening too directly in the political process by throwing their support behind particular interests.

AB There is a growing concern about the rapid development of infrastructure and building projects and their likely impacts on the environment. Particular concerns have been raised about office building developments and energy consumption issues. In recent years, there has been increasing interest in using daylight to save energy in buildings. Lighting control integrated with daylighting is recognised as an important and useful strategy in terms of energy-efficient building design. It is believed that proper daylighting schemes can help reduce the electrical demand and contribute to achieving environmentally sustainable building developments. This paper presents a simple method for estimating the likely energy savings in electric lighting due to daylighting and the possible cooling penalty. Vertical solar radiation and illuminance data measurements are described. Cumulative frequency distributions of daylight availability are reported. The likely energy savings in office buildings are determined based on on-off and top-up controls, and the energy and environmental implications are discussed. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

DE Byzantine medicine; medical manuscripts; hospitals; hospital texts; the
   classical inheritance; preservation and transmission of texts
AB Scholars, past and present, have belittled Byzantine medicine for its perceived static and derivative nature. Applied to the medicine of the centuries immediately before and after the year 1000, these criticisms, though apparently sustainable, fail to recognize its underlying vigour. It was a practical craft medicine, and one which used elements of magic and religion to compensate for the intractability of the many diseases that were not amenable to medicine. These centuries were a time when hospitals flourished in Byzantium, and this paper assembles and describes some of the manuscripts that can be associated with them. The influence of Islamic medicine, which had hitherto borrowed from Byzantium, is also examined. If the Byzantine medicine of this period could not claim great originality or innovation, it had none the less distilled what was best and most useful from the long and often complex medical writings of antiquity, ensured its transmission, and preserved much from earlier times that would otherwise now be lost.

TI Beyond environmental moralism and policy incrementalism in the global
   sustainability debate: Case studies and an alternative framework
SO SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB Global strategies for sustainable development remain caught in an interplay between environmental moralism and policy incrementalism. The former is evidenced in the continuing proliferation of international sustainability declarations; the latter in the design of local programmes approaching sustainable development in scattered, piecemeal policies where the goal - sustainability - remains unclear or only loosely defined. This paper points to the problems and perils of the dual process, underscoring the risks of environmental moralism implicit in such practices and highlighting the costs of formulating sustainability programmes only vaguely attached to its core concept. It initially focuses on the effort to promote Local Agenda 21 (LA21) - one model of sustainable urban practice - among towns and communities throughout the world and then contrasts Local Agenda 21 with the Aalborg Charter, a competing model for urban sustainability. In order to explore the success to date in implementing Local Agenda 21, the paper offers an overview of four exemplary programmes of community sustainability. The final section presents a critical assessment of LA21's successes and failures judged against an alternative sustainability framework developed by the Center for Sustainable Cities and informing the Aalborg Charter.

AB Neo-Malthusianism advocates 'population control' as the solution to all major global problems. While overpopulation is a serious problem, blaming the population growth in the South as the prime cause for the destruction of the environment is hypocritical. Rather than the 'bottom billion', it is the 'top billion' population from the 'affluent' West - and their 'effluence' - that is inflicting greater environmental injury to the earth. In the patriarchal system of free-market economy, aborigines and women are marked inferior. Given the strong preference for male children in many Third World countries, the statistics on 'missing girls' explain the sad situation of female infanticide and underreporting of female births. Most contraceptive research is aimed at women only. Furthermore, newly developed contraceptives would be first tested on poor women of colour, often without their knowledge or consent. However, after the 1994 Cairo Population Conference, reproductive rights and empowerment of women are recognized as key issues in controlling population growth. There must be a radical change and paradigm shift in policy-making at every level from subjugation and subordination to partnership in order to solve most of the world's problems.

AB Using a new conceptual framework, this study demonstrates that sustainable development depends on two factors: (i) the deintensification of energy and material use/polluter emissions; (ii) appropriate economic growth. We generally emphasize deintensification of energy and material use, or carbon dioxide (CO2) and other polluter emissions, but often neglect the control of economic growth.

TI Should monitoring be compulsory within voluntary environmental
   agreements?
SO SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB The emerging concept of business accountability implies a duty to demonstrate responsibility to stakeholders. Signing a voluntary environmental agreement is a method of pledging commitment; however, few voluntary environmental agreements contain monitoring mechanisms to demonstrate performance against that commitment. Some voluntary environmental agreements in the industry and business sector incorporate monitoring mechanisms and these are examined in order to discover lessons that can be learned. A monitoring mechanism, such as Environmental Reporting via hardcopy and the World Wide Web provides a useful and flexible mechanism that could be utilized to a much greater extent within other sectors. Higher education sector agreements such as the European COPERNICUS Charter and the global Talloires Declaration in particular are assessed using survey evidence to demonstrate the need for additional stimuli to ensure commitment. Flexible and incremental monitoring and reporting via a variety of cost effective communication media could provide the way forward in terms of establishing both credibility and sustainability of the voluntary environmental agreement mechanism.

TI Water supply in the UK: Towards a more sustainable future?
SO SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper reviews the impact of increasing environmental concerns on the UK water industry over the 30 years from early research in the 1970s to the present. From being supply driven 30 years ago, with demand being regarded as an exogenous variable, the focus is now very much on demand management. The sustainability of the freshwater environment is now the central concern. After laying down some basic principles, the impacts of this switch in focus are identified in the context of the present situation. Some key areas of environmental pressure are analysed together with current policy stances in relation to both demand management and system expansion. The impact of the introduction of domestic metering and related pricing strategies is a particular concern in relation to the former as is new water saving technology. The paper concludes with some thoughts for water resource planning in the 21st century, particularly in the context of new housing provision.

AB This paper sets out to uncover some relationships between reflection, discourse and action. By challenging and synthesizing some polemical arguments concerning the creation, maintenance, and transformation of self and society, a model of self-society dynamics that operates through reflection, discourse, and action is developed. The model of self-society dynamics brings together aspects of self-reflection and ideology-critique (explored in the paper), which it is suggested are required for any intervention (transformative action) to be grounded in locally meaningful ways. By creating a dialog community in which self- and group assumptions can be subjected to validation through discourse, it is proposed that a dynamic balance between individual needs and broader societal aims may be achieved. If individuals can be open to such discourse (i.e., they can become critically self-reflective), then it is argued that possibilities for achieving sustainable change will be significantly enhanced.

AB Macau is the newest Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China. The objective of this study was to critically analyse the spatial, socioeconomic, environmental, political and planning implications of recent transport and infrastructure developments for the future of the territory. I argue that although these projects have undoubtedly increased the quality of life of local residents and created a more competitive economic edge, they have also increased the problems with over-urbanisation. The main finding is that although adequate transport and infrastructure projects are critical in shaping the development of urban regions, environmental sustainability should be the cornerstone of all new development strategies.

TI NGOs, social change and the transformation of human relationships: a
   21st-century civic agenda
SO THIRD WORLD QUARTERLY
LA English
DT Article
AB Globalisation shifts the balance of power from public to private interests, including NGOs. However, sustainable development requires a change in power relations that runs much deeper than this: a shift from using power over others to advance our selfish interests, to using power to facilitate the self-development of all. This demands constant attention to personal change, and a series of reversals in attitudes and behaviour. In this paper we argue that NGOs-as explicitly values-based organisations-have a crucial role to play in supporting these changes through their programme activities, constituency-building work and organisational praxis. The decline of paternalistic foreign aid and the rise of more genuine international co-operation provide an excellent opportunity to advance this agenda. The paper provides a detailed rationale for these claims and a set of examples that show how power relations could be transformed by civic-led approaches in economics, politics and the structures of social power.

AB Though unevenly spread, many developing countries are experiencing a decline in aid flows. This paper explores and compares NGDO responses in regions and countries in or entering a 'beyond-aid scenario'. The comparison shows that, despite a diversity of contexts and histories, the quest for self-sustainability has become a common and dominant concern. Within a framework of options, examples show what is being attempted in terms of NGDOs altering their resource profile and the problems they encounter in doing so. Emerging evidence suggests that NGDOs are more likely to sustain themselves if they (a) look beyond finance to adopt an integrated, capacity-based approach to sustainability and internal organisational reform and (b) put effort into making good their 'relational deficit' with a wider array of domestic constituencies.

ID NITROGEN; CONSEQUENCES
AB Stand structure and tree species composition influence not only the volume flux of soil water but also the concentration of dissolved minerals in the soil solution. We found much higher element fluxes under spruce than under beech stands. This is mainly caused by different activities of nitrate in the soil solution and by different deposition rates of nitrogen and acids from the atmosphere which were +/-60% lower in beech stands than in spruce stands. In old spruce stands, the acid output with the seepage water was more or less equal to the input, whereas in beech stands most of the acid deposition was buffered. The nitrogen balance in beech stands was characterized by a net uptake of about 60% to 75% of the input. In spruce stands only 40% of the nitrogen input was incorporated. In a clear-cut, a high mobilization rate of nitrate was found in the first 5 years, resulting in nitrate concentrations above the threshold for drinking water quality. The cutting of even a single tree in a spruce stand caused heavy mineralization and nitrification for at least 2 years, which indicates that the system is near nitrogen saturation.

ID ECOLOGICAL RESEARCH; IRRIGATION
AB Meeting future water demand without degrading ecosystems is one important indicator of sustainable development. Using simulations, we showed that compared to existing policy, more sustainable water supply options are similar or cheaper in cost. We probabilistically forecasted the Mexico City metropolitan zone population for the year 2015 to be 23.5 million and total required water supply to be 106 m(3) s(-1). We optimized existing and potential supply sources from aquifers, surface water, treatment/reuse, and efficiency/demand management by cost to meet future supply needs; the applied source supply limits determined the degree of sustainability. In two scenarios to supply 106 m(3) s(-1) the business-as-usual scenario (zero sustainability) had an average relative unit cost of 1.133; while for the most sustainable scenario (it includes reducing potential supply basins' exploitation limits by 50%), the value was 1.121. One extreme scenario to supply the forecast's 95% confidence value (124 m(3) s(-1)) showed little unit cost change (1.106). The simulation shows sustainable policies can be cost-effective.

DT Article; Proceedings Paper
CT 9th PTS-CTP-Deinking Symposium
CY 2000
CL MUNICH, GERMANY
AB The current growth in the European paper industry will not be stopped by the internet and other new media. Different growth rates for individual paper grades as well as changes in the composition of raw materials are going to cause a significant increase in the use of recovered papers as a resource for the paper industry. Forecasts predict a rise in the consumption of recovered papers in CEPI countries by about 15 mio tons within the next 10 years.
   As a raw material for high-quality graphic papers, recovered papers must meet extremely stringent quality requirements. The technical requirements to deinking processes will increase as well.
   To supply the extra amounts of recovered papers needed, it is necessary to competitively extend and develop the recovery systems of those countries whose recycling rates are currently below average. Under the guiding principle of sustainable economic development the paper industry assumes responsibility for its products by voluntarily committing itself to recycling. It invites all partners within the paper chain to participate in these efforts.
   The present lack of a clear legal definition as to when recovered papers cease to be waste hampers efforts to increase the use of recovered papers. This issue therefore needs to be clarified soon on a European level. Ongoing developments regarding an amendment of the EU directive on packaging and of the packaging ordinance will be presented.
   The author comments on the renaissance of environmental taxes which have an effect on raw materials.

AB Although there has been increasing interest in trying to link the livelihoods of people living near natural resources to the conservation of those resources, there has been little attempt to systematically assess or measure this linkage. We develop a conceptual framework for defining the linkage between livelihood activities and conservation. We then develop a scale to assess the strength of linkage across Rye dimensions: species, habitat, spatial, temporal and conservation association. We test the framework and scale by evaluating 39 project sites in the Biodiversity Conservation Network. Finally, we discuss the relevance of linkage to designing appropriate conservation strategies.

SO WORLD DEVELOPMENT

ID CONSERVATION
AB Sasi, the spatial and temporal closure of fields, forests, reefs and fishing grounds, is a conspicuous feature of many Moluccan societies. Despite increasing domestic and international awareness and praise of what is considered by many analysts to be an exemplary indigenous resource conservation tradition, the practice is in decline in many parts of the Thousand Island province, and in many villages has disappeared altogether. This study examines the practice of managing Trochus niloticus (Topshell) harvests in Ohoirenan, a village on the eastern coast of Kei Besar in the District of Southeast Maluku. Trochus is one of the most important sources of cash income For Kei villagers, and until recently, for the district government as well. Since 1987, trochus has been classified as a protected species in Indonesia, and regulations have been issued to regulate the cultivation, harvest and transport of this and other protected species. This article briefly introduces Kei customary law and property relations, followed by a description of sasi and its application to reef habitats and trochus harvests. Examining a territorial conflict between Ohoirenan and a neighboring village, and more recent contention arising from government efforts to protect the species, the article explores issues of society-nature and state society relations as pertain to natural resource management in Indonesia. Sasi continues to function as an exemplary common property resource (CPR) management institution in Ohoirenan, assuring equitable distribution of the benefits deriving from controlled extraction of a local resource. But, erratic acid uneven enforcement of "one-size-fits-all" centralized conservation policy and law, combined with collusion and self-interest on the part of various parties, combine to threaten both the resource and the institutions that have successfully and sustainably managed it in this region. Within the context of a centralized, state-led natural resource management system, the national species protection precludes the establishment of sensible, mutually beneficial co-management regimes that could serve the interests and employ the inherent knowledge and capabilities of local communities, traders, and government agents.

ID ENSEMBLES
AB We compare the degradation of InAs/GaAs quantum well (QW) and quantum dot (QD) laser diodes following irradiation by high energy (8.56 MeV) phosphorous ions. Over a fluence range of 10(8)-10(11) ions/cm(2), the degradation of the low temperature QD photoluminescence and electroluminescence emission is greatly suppressed relative to that of QW based devices (X100 and x 1000, respectively at the highest dose studied). Irradiated QD laser diodes demonstrated lasing action over the entire range of fluences, and 2 orders of magnitude beyond the maximum dose sustainable by QW devices. The improved damage response of QD based structures results from efficient collection and localization of electrons and holes by QDs in the active region, which limit carrier transfer to nonradiative centers. This work suggests the suitability of QD device architectures for use in radiation environments, and in high power applications, wherever nonradiative processes promote the degradation or failure of traditional QW devices.

AB A long-term survey of energy, carbon and nitrogen budgets in a grassland has been carried out since 1974 at the National Grassland Research Institute, Japan. Based on the survey, a system model describing energy and matter flows was constructed. Sustainability of grassland ecosystems in relation to productivity was evaluated by simulations. The results indicated that at low and high levels of animal productivity the grassland ecosystems were able to accumulate carbon in soil year by year, and there was no appreciable indication of decrease in the nitrogen content in soil provided that a given amount of fertilizer was applied to the grassland. The heterogeneity in plant biomass can be described by a gamma distribution. Grasslands grazed by domestic animals such as cattle and sheep display a strong spatial heterogeneity. This characteristic is caused by the uneven deposition of excreta by grazing animals, uneven use of the grassland by grazing animals, and uneven dispersal of plant seeds by grazing animals over the grassland. It was suggested that such unevenness may accelerate energy and matter cycling, and then contribute to grassland sustainability. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Efforts to test the hypothesised positive link between ecosystem services and functions and biodiversity are increasing in order to forecast the consequences of the present erosion of biodiversity on ecosystem functions and to provide an additional basis for the conservation of biodiversity. These efforts have been, however, modest in marine ecosystems. An examination of seagrass communities, which are simple assemblages with a limited membership of about 50 species worldwide and < 12 species in any one community, provides, however, strong evidence for the existence of such positive link between species richness and ecosystem functions. Ecosystem functions are, however, dependent on the particular membership of the community, rather that its number, for the functions are species-specific properties. Yet evidence, is provided, that an increasing species richness should be, on average, linked to an increase in the functional repertoire present in the community, will lead to a more efficient use of resources and a greater capacity to ensure the sustainability of ecosystem functions under disturbance or ecosystem change. Closer examination indicates that the functional variability of mixed-species seagrass assemblages is correlated to the variability in species size, whereas species of similar size tend to show similar functional capacities and, therefore, a greater degree of functional redundancy. In addition, the demonstration of positive interactions in seagrass communities, which are also dependent on the presence of engineering species in the community that facilitate the growth of other species, provides increasing grounds to expect an enhanced functional performance of mixed communities over that expected from a simple additive contribution of the community members. Multispecific communities also hold, within the functional repertoire they contain, many unrealised functional potentials that may prove instrumental to ensure the sustainability of ecosystem functions in the presence of disturbance or a changing environment. The arguments offered, illustrated for the comparatively simple seagrass communities, provide strong reasons to expect a strong - if difficult to test experimentally - positive relationship between species diversity and the functions of marine ecosystems and, thereby, the services they yield to humanity.

AB Steel scrap follows iron ore as an important raw material for steelmaking. But, as regards availability and preparation, steel scrap requires more expenditures than iron ore coming from big deposits ensuring rather homogeneous quality. Steel scrap has to be handled with great cave so as to exploit all sources, visible or hidden, for the recycling or to prepare it to meet the requirements of further processing. On the other hand, steel scrap helps to save the resources, the iron ore deposits, for future generations. This is of great importance not only as far as the pure material balance is concerned. Every generation demands the right to exploit only those resources which ave most interesting from the economic point of view, thus worsening the situation for following generations. Recycling is one means to protect resources, another being the more effective re-use of the produced and used materials. Sustainable development, even in the production and application of steel turns our step towards a future conscious of ecology. In this regard, steel is a big factor.

AB For sustainable development, it is requisite not only to assess multi-dimensional items such as environmental impacts, process safety, product safety, and so on, required from human society, environment, and markets, but also to feedback assessment results to product and process design/development. Through the investigation about requirements for manufactures at each stage in product lifecycle, it becomes clear that PDCA (plan-do-check-action) cycle is necessary to take actions properly from viewpoints of ecosystems, business systems, and society. We clarify required functions of supporting system of PDCA cycle, and then propose material supply chain models of hierarchy structure composed of unit process models. Based on proposed system and models, evaluations of PET bottle recycle system and greenhouse sheet recycle system are implemented as trials. Furthermore, we show the directions of future scope.

ID MINLP FORMULATION
AB Today's optimization of continuous process industries should be exerted on the scope of whole enterprise supply chain, from the raw material purchase stage to product distribution stage, with sustainability considerations. Sustainability involves the multiple objectives of social, economic, resources and environmental sustainability; some of them are conflicting. In this study, goal programming (GP) model is proposed to address this multi-objective problem with the integration of non-relaxable constraints and relaxable constraints. The analytic hierarchy process (AHP), a multi-objective decision making method, is used to evaluate the priorities of goals and weights of deviation variables. The application of this approach is illustrated through a case study on sustainable supply chain optimization and scheduling of a petrochemical complex. The results obtained show that this approach is a viable tool and offers good communication with decision-maker. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Making process systems engineering decisions that are ecologically conscious requires analysis of both industrial and ecological processes. Traditional methods in process engineering usually fall short of meeting this requirement due to considering the environment as secondary to economic objectives. Life cycle assessment and design methods have broadened the scope of traditional methods by considering the environmental impact in the entire life cycle of a product or process. These methods focus primarily on the environmental impact of emissions and ignore the contribution of ecological products and services. This paper presents a thermodynamic approach for including the input from both ecological and economic resources, and for analyzing industrial and ecological processes together. This approach is based on the fact that growth and sustenance of both industrial and ecological processes are limited by the available energy and its conversion to useful work. Thus, the embodied energy (emergy), that is, the energy used directly or indirectly to make a product or service is a measure of ecological cost. Emergy analysis of industrial and ecological processes provides insight into the environmental performance and sustainability of the industrial process or product. Emergy-based life cycle assessment is developed to combine the benefits of both methods. The proposed framework is broadly applicable and is illustrated by the emergy based life cycle assessment of soy bean growth. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI An algorithm for optimising the servicing of products with constrained,
   multiple defects
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
AB The twin pillars of sustainable development are the conservation of natural resources and the management of waste. Waste is generated whenever a product is serviced or repaired, or when it is ultimately discarded at the end of its useful life. In order to manage such waste, the servicing options and costs must first be ascertained. This paper presents an algorithm for the generation of optimal disassembly and re-assembly sequences for the servicing of products with multiple defects, subject to constraints such as inaccessible components. The multiple service action (MSA) algorithm determines the minimum total servicing cost for a product network based on Floyd's Algorithm, a shortest path algorithm. Well-established shortest path algorithms, which compute the shortest route between any pair of nodes in a network, are unable to handle multiple defects. The product network is first constructed, depicting the components and subassemblies as nodes, and embodying in directed arcs, the labour, materials and tooling costs associated with disassembly and re-assembly, as well as the cost to repair, reuse, recycle or dispose the defective components. The MSA algorithm was tested on seven different product networks representing multiple defective components that can be serviced by different feasible routes. For each feasible service route, associated costs were computed. It was established that the algorithm was able to generate optimum disassembly and re-assembly routes for the servicing of products with multiple defects subject to constraints.

AB In September 1999 the MRC Institute for Environment and Health hosted a multidisciplinary seminar on the harmonisation of strategies to protect environmental quality and human health. The objectives of the meeting were to share information about ways in which the protection of the environment and human health can be harmonised, and, by bringing together an audience representing a range of disciplines, interests and sectors, to explore how these may be integrated to inform policy, decision-making and the management of risks. Key conclusions from the seminar focused on the importance of sustainable development, harmonising risk assessment and the role of stakeholder involvement. The necessary move from an expert-based to a dialogue-based process will require concerted efforts on the part of scientists, policy-makers, regulators, industry and the public.

SO AQUACULTURE

AB Predicting the occurrence of disease outbreaks in aquacultural farms can be of considerable value to the long-term sustainable development of the industry. Prior research on disease prediction has essentially depended upon traditional statistical models with varying degrees of prediction accuracy. Furthermore, the application of these models in sustainable aquaculture development and in controlling environmental deterioration has been very limited. In an attempt to look for a more reliable model, we developed a probabilistic neural network (PNN) to predict shrimp disease outbreaks in Vietnam using farm-level data from 480 Vietnamese shrimp farms, including 86 semi-intensive and 394 extensive farms. We also compared predictive performance of the PNN against the more traditional logistic regression approach on the same data set. Disease occurrence (a 0-1 variable) is hypothesized to be affected by a set of nearly 70 variables including site characteristics, farming systems, and farm practices. Results show that the PNN model has a better predictive power than the logistic regression model. However, the PNN model uses significantly more input (explanatory) variables than the logistic regression. The logistic regression is estimated using a stepwise procedure starting with the same input variables as in PNN model. Adapting the same input variables found in the logistic regression model to the PNN model yields results no better than the logistic regression model. More importantly, the key factors for prediction in the PNN model are difficult to interpret, suggesting besides prediction accuracy, model interpretation is an important issue for further investigation.

AB The aviation industry plays a critical role in modem society, supporting global, regional and local economies and facilitating long distance travel for business and leisure. However the environmental impact of the industry is significant and this threatens the sustainability of future growth and the consequential benefits which could arise from it. Technological. operational and infrastructure improvements designed to reduce emissions and noise from aircraft are continually being eroded by the rapid growth of the industry, with the result that the environmental impact of air travel is increasing. Consequently, the sustainable development of the aviation industry will require that in future, technological innovation and fleet replacement continues at a rapid pace and that the highest priority is given to achieving a 'step change' in aircraft technology.

AB Soil erosion coupled with productivity decline: is considered a major constraint to sustainable vegetable production in Southeast Asian steeplands, yet soil conservation technologies acceptable to vegetable growers have not been developed. Effectiveness of high-value contour hedgerows species [(Asparagus (Asparagus officinalis L.), pineapple (Ananas comosus (L.) Merr.), pigeon peas (Cajanus cajan (L,) Millsp.), lemon grass (Cymbopogon flexuosus (Nees ex Steud.) Wats.), and tea (Camellia sinensis (L.) O. Kuntze)] on control of steepland erosion was evaluated in a replicated researcher-managed field experiment, and 12 farmer-managed erosion-runoff plots from 1995 to 1998 across the landscape of the Manupali watershed in Mindanao, the Philippines. Annual soil loss from 42% slopes with superimposed researcher-managed high-value contour hedgerows treatment (45.4 Mg ha(-1)) was lower by 30% compared to the conventional practice of up-and-down cultivation (65.3 Mg ha(-1)). Annual soil loss measured in farmers' plots ranged from 1.4 Mg ha(-1) to 52.5 Mg ha(-1) on slopes ranging from 16 to 65%. Soil pH, organic C, total-N, and P downslope were greater by 7, 28, 13, and 10%, respectively, compared to upslope. Total-N, organic C, soil pH, Mg, and K measured at the end of the experiment in the researcher-managed contour hedgerows plots were lower by 35, 20, 30, 53, and 70%, respectively, compared to initial values. The Erosion-Productivity Impact Calculator (EPIC) model was used to assess the effects of annual cropping sequences under a contour hedgerow system on slopes ranging from 15 to 65%. The cabbage (Brassica oleracea var. capitata L.)-tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.)-cabbage sequence (the first crop planted in January) resulted in an average simulated annual soil loss of 28.1 Mg ha(-1) across slope ranging from 15 to 65%, whereas tomato-cabbage-tomato resulted in an annual simulated soil loss of 98.3 Mg ha(-1). The cropping sequence of tomato-cabbage-tomato lost 3.0 Mg ha(-1) more soil at 15% slope than did the cabbage-tomato-cabbage sequence, while at 65% slope, the tomato-cabbage-tomato sequence lost 181.2 Mg ha(-1) more than the other sequence. On average, two-thirds of the total soil loss occurred during September-December. In order to reduce soil loss acid increase productivity in steep sloping lands, high-value contour hedgerows with sequential cropping sequences that include either corn (Zea mays L.) or cabbage rather than tomato during the most erosive period of the year and variable fertility management strategies along the slope positions are suggested. The coincidence of predicted to actual soil loss from farmer-managed plots, based largely upon model development from researcher-managed plots, and the acute awareness instilled amongst farmer cooperators of the magnitude of soil loss, strengthen the argument for farmer participatory research.

AB For a cropping system to be sustainable, should not only the soil nitrogen (N) content be preserved but also the N runoff be minimised. Finding a simple but robust way to estimate N runoff would thus be a great advantage when evaluating cropping systems. In this study all major N flows in six different cropping systems, each covering 0.18 ha of a separately pipe drained field lysimeter, located in southeast Norway, were either measured or estimated over a period of X-years. The effect of the cropping system on the soil N content was evaluated using mass balances of total N, and the usefulness of such N balances to predict N runoff(total N losses via drainage and surface water) was investigated. The experiment included systems with conventional arable cropping (CON-A), integrated arable-cropping (INT-A), ecological arable cropping (ECO-A), conventional forage cropping (CON-F), integrated forage cropping (I:VT-F), and ecological forage cropping (ECO-F). All the arable cropping systems resulted in a net reduction in the calculated soil N pool, and the reduction increased with decreasing N input. The only system, which did not alter the soil N content, war; CON-E The largest net reduction was estimated fur EGO-A and ECO-F, which averaged 45 and 43 kg N ha(-1) per year, respectively. The N runoff from the systems was in the range of 18-35 kg N ha(-1) per year, with highest losses from the two conventional and lowest from the two ecological systems and INT-E The forage systems had lower N runoff than the arable systems. The INT-F system appeared to be the most favourable system in terms of both soil N balance and N runoff.
   When the annual (May-April) N balance, calculated as N-fertiliser+N-slurry-N-harvest. the annual precipitation and the precipitation from the previous year were used as predictors in a linear regression model, 87 and 65% of the variation in N runoff could be explained from the arable and forage cropping systems, respectively. The average N balance calculated for all years, on its own predicted 86% of the variation in N runoff from the arable systems. Mass N balances were thus found to be a useful tool for predicting N runoff, especially in systems with mainly arable crops. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Although assistance to farming remains the dominant method for supporting the rural sector in the UK, there has been a shift in policy towards agri-environmental schemes which attempt to reconcile competing demands on the countryside as a simultaneous provider of feud, rural livelihoods and environmental goods and services.
   Many of these issues and challenges facing UK and European agriculture are evident in the intensively farmed Fenland of East Anglia, eastern England, a low-lying area of 5000 sq km which has been reclaimed from swamps over many centuries.
   Using the Fenland as a case study, this paper examines the hydrological requirements and likely financial and economic effects of a change in land use associated with the restoration of wet grassland as a means of achieving environmental enhancement in otherwise intensively farmed areas. Significant financial incentives are necessary to encourage farmers to switch to alternative land uses, hut these are consistent with payments made under existing agri-environmental schemes in UK. Furthermore, comparative advantage for commercial arable farming on the one hand, and social and institutional factors on the other, act as constraints to the conversion of arable land to livestock and grassland systems. Most wet grassland restoration is likely to occur on less productive land and to be associated with changes in land tenure or proprietor circumstances. (C) 2000 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Genetic modification (GM) of crops provides new crop management options (production traits) and crops with industrial, pharmaceutical, and neutraceutical applications are likely to follow. The environmental benefits and risks of growing GM crops have drawn considerable, often polarized debate. This review seeks a balanced appraisal of environmental issues, and looks at principles associated with several GM production traits. Environmental assessment needs to consider the nature of the introduced trait, in the context of the biology of the plant and the environment it will be grown in (e.g., prospects of gene flow into other species). Interactions with the target ecosystem, including the possibility of cummulative impacts from organisms already released into the ecosystem (e.g,, prospects for gene pyramiding) need to also be included in assessments. Current agricultural management practices and ecosystems have their own impacts on the environment, and it is against this background that the benefits and risks of releasing GM organisms should be judged. Before release, data collection on imparts of GMOs is temporally and spatially constrained, so caution must be exercised in decision making. Potential impacts also need to be monitored after release and the post-release monitoring framework needs scope to identify unforeseen impacts. The environmental sustainability of using GMOs will depend largely on wise management practices and monitoring must provide appropriate data to support continuing adaptation of management and regulation of GMOs.

AB While globalization threatens many of the historical drivers of rural American economies, it also opens up new opportunities for economic development. In particular, globalization increases the ability of rural communities to establish sustainable forms of economic development. "Sustainable development" refers to practices that simultaneously create economic vitality, environmental stewardship, and social equity. Rural communities have increasingly embraced the concept of sustainable development as a mantra for expressing their desired pattern of development. In this article, the author draws on his experiences at Colgate University with a project called the Hamlets of Madison County to develop a theoretical model that outlines the conditions and factors that shape the ability of rural communities to develop sustainable economies.

ID VENTRICULAR ASSIST DEVICE; CIRCULATORY SUPPORT; CHILDREN
AB A patient with acute fulminant lymphocytic myocarditis and cardiogenic shock was successfully treated by mechanical offloading of the left ventricle. A nonpulsatile left-heart bypass was undertaken with an implantable centrifugal blood pump. Careful weaning resulted in device removal on the seventh day. Left and right ventricular function is sustained at 7 months. Widespread application of this method depends on the availability of an inexpensive user friendly blood pump, appropriate weaning protocols and emerging strategies to promote sustainable myocardial recovery.

ID ECOTOURISM; BENEFITS; VENDORS
AB Ecotourism in protected areas is viewed as a sustainable alternative to mass tourism and as a means of providing benefits to local communities which bear the greatest opportunity costs of protection. However, these ideals have rarely been tested. This study used small-scale survey methods to examine the magnitude and distribution of tourism employment and revenue generation in communities in an Indonesian park. Results suggest that distributional inequalities favor external operators and urban gateway residents rather than rural villagers. Just as the local economy remains peripheral to regional and national centers, so core-periphery relations also exist within the local context. Development around the park has yet to re-orient itself to the goals of ecotourism. Keywords: ecotourism, host benefits, development theory, community participation, visitor expenditure.

AB The Himalayas in Nepal have become popular destinations for international tourism, which has rapidly increased in recent years with serious socioeconomic and environmental consequences. In the light of the recently concluded Visit Nepal 1998 Year, it is important to reconsider the environmental impacts of tourism, and reformulate strategies that would make tourism a viable industry and a sustainable alternative in this country. Drawing from the experience of the three most popular destinations in the Nepal Himalayas, this paper discusses some national level policy and management issues. The paper concludes by stressing the need for more scientific research and forging a partnership between local people, the service industry, and tourism professionals. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB This article discusses the findings of a Delphi survey of owners and managers of historic properties, officers of heritage-based organizations, consultants, and academics from across the United Kingdom. The purpose of the study was to investigate the major constraints and imperatives relating to the long-term management of built heritage attractions. Three related issues were assessed: the fundamental mission of heritage attractions; the factors which impact upon decisions relating to charging for tourist entry and the perceptions of heritage managers as to the respective roles of such attractions and public agencies in funding tourism management and heritage conservation programs. The paper then considers the significance of these issues in assessing potential strategies for moving heritage tourism toward sustainability.

AB We examined the rates and sustainability of methyl bromide (MeBr) oxidation in moderately low density cell suspensions (similar to 6 x 10(7) cells ml(-1)) of the NH3-oxidizing bacterium Nitrosomonas europaea. In the presence of 10 mM NH4+ and 0.44, 0.22, and 0.11 mM MeBr, the initial rates of MeBr oxidation were sustained for 12, 12, and 24 h, respectively, despite the fact that only 10% of the NH4+, 18% of the NH4+, and 35% of the NH4+, respectively, were consumed. Although the duration of active MeBr oxidation generally decreased as the MeBr concentration increased, similar amounts of MeBr were oxidized with a large number of the NH4+-MeBr combinations examined (10 to 20 mu mol mg [dry weight] of cells(-1)). Approximately 90% of the NH3-dependent O-2 uptake activity and the NO2--producing activity were lost after N, europaea was exposed to 0.44 mM MeBr for 24 h, After MeBr was removed and the cells were resuspended in fresh growth medium, NO2- production increased exponentially, and 48 to 60 h was required to reach the level of activity observed initially in control cells that were not exposed to MeBr, It is not clear what percentage of the cells were capable of cell division after MeBr oxidation because NO2- accumulated more slowly in the exposed cells than in the unexposed cells despite the fact that the latter were diluted 10-fold to create inocula which exhibited equal initial activities, The decreases in NO2--producing and MeBr-oxidizing activities could not be attributed directly to NH4+ or NH3 limitation, to a decrease in the pH, to the composition of the incubation medium, or to toxic effects caused by accumulation of the end products of oxidation (NO2- and formaldehyde) in the medium. Additional cooxidation-related studies of N. europaea are needed to identify the mechanism(s) responsible for the MeBr-induced loss of cell activity and/or viability, to determine what percentages of cells damaged by cooxidative activities are culturable, and to determine if cooxidative activity interferes with the regulation of NH3-oxidizing activity.

AB Traditional needs theories centre around hierarchies ranging from "lower-level" needs for security, existence, or hygiene through to "higher-level" needs for self-actualisation, achievement, and growth. As applied to the organisational domain, such theories tend to assume that an employee's personal need for challenge and development is the best source of work motivation. Based on social identity and self-categorisation theories, this paper interprets needs hierarchies as reflections of the variable definition of self. It suggests that the motivational impact of different needs changes as a function of the salience of norms and goals associated with self-categories defined at varying levels of abstraction (personal, social, human). As a result, no one level of need is inherently more relevant to employee motivation than any other. This analysis also suggests that group-based needs will play an especially important motivational role in situations where an individual's social identity is salient. Following work by Tyler, data that support this argument are provided by a study in which employees' willingness to engage in citizenship behaviour increased following manipulations of group-based pride and respect. Results point to the productive and sustainable potential of self-actualisation at a collective rather than just a personal level.

ID AGGREGATING DEVICES
AB Since fifteen years the introduction of anchored Fish Aggregating Devices (FADs) has been an important component in the development of the small-scale fishery of many tropical island countries. Results however, have not always been as good as expected. In this paper we propose the use of a method to assess the diversity and complexity of changes caused by the FADs on one side, and the sustainability of this innovation process on the other side. The concept of sustainability includes both ecological and socio-economical purposes. The first aims to preserve the resource, the second to secure the innovation process. The assessment framework is based on a grid of twenty-one key parameters of biological, technical, economical and sociological nature. A value ranging from zero to three is given to each parameter according to its effect (no effect, doubtful effect, sustainable effect). An example of this grid is presented by combining experts' viewpoints in three cases (Comoros, Reunion Island, Vanuatu), which are representative for the diversity of FAD projects. A graphic representation is given for an easier reading of the grid and to improve its use for decision making.

AB Some indigenous fruit trees, in the drylands of southern Africa are worthy of interest because of their adaptation to environmental conditions prohibitive for traditional crops. Their fruits or their derivatives are traditionally used as an additional income by rural population, but little information is available about the properties of the soils that support their growth, although this information is necessary if the trees are subjected to sustainable domestication. Several soil properties are, however, to be considered as a whole and discriminant analysis provides a helpful tool to individuate the best conditions for the tree growth. Thirty-five soil samples were taken in areas where the trees naturally grow and produce, and the analytical data of the surface layer were used to relate soil properties to tree species. Four groups of trees were well separated using two discriminant functions that takes into account both the fertility characteristics (pH, organic C, N, texture, and properties of the exchange complex) and the Fe contents and distribution among the oxide forms. The discriminant functions allow a very acceptable reclassification of the data (more than 80% of cases correctly reclassified) and the classification coefficients were used to build an empirical equation that may help to identify the most suitable tree to be introduced at a new site.

AB Animal agriculture is at a crossroads in time. Demand for food of animal origin is roaring in the developing countries. Environmental impact of animal production is causing concern. In addition social needs like demand for rural space and perceptions of animal welfare require an integrated approach to development of multifunctional animal agriculture. Animal nutritionists are challenged in the new millennium to provide new technologies supporting food production, sustaining the environmental resources and accommodating the socio-economics needs of mankind.

AB There are many changes, both qualitative and quantitative, chemical as well as biochemical (enzymatic) in spent substrate during the growth and fructification of fruiting fungi. Depending upon the species/strain, culture condition, and substrate used the spent substrate is more soluble, containing 3-5 times more free sugar and 2-3 times more free amino acids than undegraded substrate. Decreases in cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin contents and increase in the ash content are concomitant. Certainly, these substrates possess a variety of degradatory enzyme like cellulase, hemicellulase, oxidizing enzymes and protease. Several applications of spent substrates are proposed, including sound use of this material in a sustainable agricultural system. The nutrients composition of substrate used during full spawn run, after harvest for 1 month, and spent substrate were analyzed. Most of energy content, fat and fiber fractions percentages declined, while protein content rose in substrate of Pleurotus sp. but not of P. abalonus. Eventhough substrate of Lentinus edodes has as good nutrients composition as the others it is not recommened to substitute for commercial diet in growing quail ration. Spent substrate of P. ostreatus and Ganoderma sp. can replace up to 30% with no significant difference in growth performance. Most spent substrates can be 10 similar to 20% of the ration for 10-20%, depending on species of fruiting fungi.

AB Major objectives of researchers for poultry nutrition are to improve the performance and efficiency of gain and quality of products. Because feed is the major cost in poultry production, even a small improvement in feed efficiency is economically important. In addition, to produce enough for human consumption, the products of the poultry industry are required to be safe for human health, and the poultry industry has to be sustainable and benign for the ecosystem of the environment. Therefore, this review focuses on 1) the development of new feedstuffs and additives, especially on re-evaluation of by-products which are not evaluated highly because of some weak points, and biomass, organic acids, beta-agonist and organic and chelated minerals, 2) enzymes to improve the utilization of phytate P, oligosaccharide and cellulose and proteins, 3) quality of poultry products to enrich the contents of vitamins, n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, to reduce egg yolk cholesterol, and fortification eggshell strength, and 4) taste of meat and eggs.

DE farmed deer; decision support systems; model development
AB Decision support systems (DSS) provide for effective transfer of new information and technology in addition to evaluating management scenarios to aid in end-user decision making. The latest FEEDMAN (Version 3) software package has been developed to provide a deer module, in addition to an existing beef management DSS template, applicable for use in pastoral-based animal production systems in southern Queensland. FEEDMAN incorporates results from research on grazing systems for both beef cattle and more recently deer, and has been released commercially to aid in decision making and strategic planning for farmers and agricultural consultants. The package considers input data and parameters for a specific farm and essentially evaluates feeding management strategies for both beef cattle and deer in sub-tropical Queensland. Since it is a repository of past research it is an aid to information transfer and to the adoption of sustainable pastoral animal production based on deer and or cattle. While existing and potential deer farmers will benefit from use of this package, an ultimate goal is to encourage more commercial size deer enterprises seen as essential for a sustainable and viable deer farm industry in Queensland.

DE livestock; products; systems; demand; environment; opportunities
AB The demand for meat and milk is predicted to at least double over the next two decades. The increase in demand will be characterised by products that are intensively produced on grain feeds such as pork, poultry meat, milk and eggs, although there will be also a less dramatic increase for meat from large and small ruminants. The demand is spread globally but quite unevenly. This so called "livestock revolution" will produce challenges to the ability and capacity of our livestock systems to meet the demand, as well as opportunities and threats to livestock producers, policy makers, scientists, and environmental integrity. The opportunities lie in the potential to increase human health and welfare. generate income, increase food security and develop new sustainable practices and technologies. The potential threats lie in the changing attitudes and priorities in the wealthier countries towards food production and the environment, and the impact that the need to increase production will have an other input and output components of the food chain (fuel, fertilisers, extension services, acceptance of inputs derived from "genetic engineering technologies", consumer perceptions and desires), as farmers endeavour to lift grain production by around 50% in the next decade. Animal scientists have an important role to play in both the technical and the social issues that will be increasingly debated.

TI German energy policy in deregulated Europe
SO ATW-INTERNATIONALE ZEITSCHRIFT FUR KERNENERGIE

DT Article
AB The author argues in Favor of a more fact-oriented German energy policy:
   Firstly, German energy policy must accept the new European framework of a market economy. This means that German utilities must no longer be burdened with the implementation of political objectives. The German power industry needs a level playing field for competition on a European scale. Consequently, also the European partner countries should not limit themselves to the minimum conditions of the Single Market Directive in opening their markets.
   Secondly, German energy policy must develop new forms of cooperation with the power industry so as to maintain domestic employment and the addition of value despite considerably stronger competitive pressure. Also the conflicting targets of sustainability, continuity of supply, and economic viability must not only be discussed, but must be turned into productive approaches.
   Thirdly, this means that there must be no inadmissible solution in matters nuclear! If the German power industry is to remain strong, in the industry of domestic jobs and opportunities for the future, it must not lose any more domestic market share to other European companies.
   Fourthly, we need a new energy policy which takes cognizance of the results of market development in a more rational, less emotional way. In this respect, it should be limited henceforth to supporting renewable energies and technologies so as to enhance energy efficiency in line with market requirements.
   Fifthly, German energy policy must not commit the mistake of enforcing deregulation and, at the same time, exempting large segments of the market from competition. Thus, the planned expansion of renewable energies, and the increase in cogeneration to more than thirty percent of the German electricity generation, by way of quotas and revenues for electricity from these sources fed into the public grid, are incompatible with competition in Europe. The electricity tax within the framework of the eco tax, the regulations on protection of cogeneration, and the rising payments for electricity from renewable sources fed into the public power grid total approx. DM 11 billion in the current year. This offsets a large part of the DM 15 - 20 billion savings arising to electricity consumers as a result of competition.

AB At the 1992 Rio 'Earth Summit: Australia joined other nations in committing to processes leading to the formulation of 'Local Agenda 21s' (LA21s) by 1996. Subsequently in the latter year, Whittaker carried out a national survey of local government authorities to evaluate what progress had been made. Whittaker's conclusion was that progress in Australia had been slow, but ten 'leading-edge' Victorian councils were identified through a self-reporting process. In this paper we discuss the concept of LA21, analyse ill closer derail the 'progress' that has been made in the ten Victorian councils, and discuss some of the broader forces that, me argue, have made LA21 formulation increasingly difficult, particularly in the state of Victoria in the recent past.

TI Technology acquisition, firm capability and sustainable competitive
   advantage: A case study of Australian Glass Manufacturers Ltd, 1915-39
SO BUSINESS HISTORY
LA English
DT Article
AB In 1915, Australian Glass Manufacturers Ltd (AGM) adopted a strategy of technology acquisition to ensure its survival and to establish a sustainable competitive advantage. By 1935, AGM was largely vertically integrated and its core container glass business was an Australian monopoly. AGM had also diversified into commercial glass and consumer goods production and was Australia's first manufacturer of flat glass. The analysis adopts the framework of the new institutional theory of the firm and focuses on the sourcing, assessing and securing of appropriate technologies. It is argued that operationalising the strategy crucially depended on developing managerial and technical know-how. It required the development of specialised teams and new effective precedents, and involved an extended period of learning by doing. AGM also comprises a limiting case for the historiographical stereotype of Australian manufacturing firms as inward looking and largely reliant on British technology in the inter-war period.

AB Recently, the sustainability area of public finance has been launched as a simplifying screening device for the analysis of fiscal sustainability. In this comment, it is argued that the novel notion of the sustainability area (reflecting, in turn, a simple notion of public debt sustainability) does not, by itself have any bearing on the sustainability of public finances: being positioned within the sustainability area cannot serve as a reasonable criterion of fiscal sustainability.

DT Article
ID CROP PRODUCTION; POLLUTION; IMPACTS
AB This paper examines the economics of the adoption of sustainable production practices for soil erosion control. The research was conducted on three case farms within the Saint-Esprit watershed in Quebec using a two-stage process. The first stage involved the use of GIS (Geographical Information Systems) to record erosion characteristics (slope, etc.) for these farmers' fields. This erosion information was then included as input information in the second stage of the process. Mixed integer linear programming (MILP) was used to model both individual farms and the watershed. Increasing erosion constraints were applied to these models to investigate changes in crop production mixes for farms and the watershed. A comparison of the results (farms versus watershed) was used to investigate policy questions concerning an optimal erosion constraint for society. Results generated indicate that farms with higher net incomes would be advantaged by erosion constraints set at the watershed level, whereas farms with lower net revenues would be disadvantaged. Thus, trading of pollution permits could be encouraged.

ID MELOIDOGYNE; POPULATION; SOIL
AB Root damage from Pratylenchus penetrans causes economic losses in many crops. Rotation with poor or non-hosts is a control method that can reduce the use of fumigant nematicides. Short-term experiments were conducted to identify potential non-host sorghum and miller hybrids. In a field experiment, forage pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum L. 'CFPM 101'), grain pearl miller ('CGPMH-1'), grain sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L. 'CGSH-7') and rye (Secale cereale L. common) were grown in rotation with tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L. 'Delfield'), a known intolerant host. One rye treatment was fumigated prior to tobacco planting in 1998. P. penetrans numbers were lower in forage and grain pearl millet plots than in grain sorghum or rye plots in the year of planting. In the subsequent tobacco crop year, root nematode counts in plots where forage and grain pearl millet were grown were similar to counts in fumigated rye plots and lower than counts in plots where non-fumigated rye and grain sorghum were grown. Tobacco leaf yield was negatively correlated with soil nematode counts from November 1997 to July 1998 (r = -0.48, P = 0.0001), as well as with root counts from July 1998 to September 1998 (r = -0.40, P = 0.0015). This is the first report of P. penetrans suppression by P. glaucum in the field. Further investigation of nematode suppression by pearl miller lines and development of this potentially sustainable farming system is warranted.

AB During the 1990s, the lowest sustainable rate of unemployment (LSRU) in Canada declined from the 7.5 to 8 percent range to perhaps around 6 percent. Barring an international recession and excessive rigidity on the part of the central bank, Canada could achieve this 6 percent unemployment level within a few quarters. There is a good presumption that eliminating macroeconomic unemployment and keeping the unemployment rate close to the LSRU level could help reduce structural unemployment.

AB Phytoremediation is a site remediation strategy, which employs plants to remove non-volatile and immisible soil contents. This sustainable and inexpensive process is emerging as a viable alternative to traditional contaminated land remediation methods. To enhance phytoremediation as a viable strategy, fast growing plants with high metal uptake ability and rapid biomass gain are needed. This paper provides a brief review of studies in the area of phytoaccumulation, most of which have been carried out in Europe and the USA. Particular attention is given to the role of phytochelators in making the heavy metals bio-available to the plant and thier symbionts in enhancing the uptake of bio-available heavy metals.

AB Abandoned metalliferous mine wastes can result in severe pollution and have aesthetic impacts on the local environment. Use of a vegetation cover gives a cost-effective and environmentally sustainable method of stabilising and reclaiming wastes such as mine-spoils and tailings. Many characteristics of metalliferous wastes are often inimical to successful vegetation establishment, most notably phytotoxic levels of residual heavy metals, low nutrient status and poor physical structure of the substratum. Current approaches to revegetation and reclamation involve both ameliorative and adaptive strategies to allow plant establishment and encourage subsequent vegetation development. Different techniques of revegetation are available for temperate and arid, subtropical regions depending on the characteristics of the waste. These include direct seeding with commercially available plants, use of cover and barrier systems and the enhancement of natural revegetation processes. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB Extensive in situ reclamation treatment technologies are appropriate for a large proportion of contaminated land in place of total removal or complete containment of soil. In this paper, initial results are presented of site descriptions, tree survival and metal uptake patterns from two field planting trials on a highly industrially contaminated site adjacent to a metal refinery and on old sanitary landfill sites. Survival rate was high in both trials but factors besides heavy metals were particularly significant. Uptake patterns of metals into foliage and woody tissues were variable, with substantial uptake in some species and clones supporting the findings of earlier pot experiments. It is argued that there is sufficient evidence to consider the use of trees in reclamation as part of a realistic, integrated, low-cost, ecologically-sound and sustainable reclamation strategy for contaminated land. This is an opportunity to bring a large number of brownfield sites into productive use? which otherwise would be prohibitively expensive to restore. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB South Africa's coastal resources offer important opportunities for contributing to the much-needed uplifting and transformation of society and the economy. Government, in partnership with the private sector and civil society, has developed a new policy for managing the coast that aims to promote sustainable coastal development through integrated coastal management. This policy introduces a new approach to coastal management in South Africa. Rooted in extensive public participation, research, and analysis, the policy outlines a vision for the coast, as well as principles, goals, and objectives for coastal management. It also presents a plan of action for implementing the policy. This article provides a brief introduction to the policy formulation and adoption process as well as key elements of the policy. It also highlights the significance of the policy formulation process and its findings for South Africa and coastal management, and for public policy making more generally.

ID ECOSYSTEM MANAGEMENT; PRINCIPLES; RESOURCES
AB Forest exploitation in British Columbia is currently unsustainable. Economic analysis is frequently used to justify the high rate of cut by documenting the revenue, job and wage benefits of current industrial forestry. However, Hicks' definition of income implies that it is poor accounting practice to count the consumption of natural capital as income. Yet in BC, economic analysis fails to make adjustments for the consumption of forest capital. Such analysis provides society with misleading signals of future economic prospects. By reference to landscape ecology, conservation biology, forest ecology, and ecosystem-based management, this paper sets out requirements for a forest management regime that maintains forest capital intact and for determining a rate of cut that would likely maintain ecosystem structure and function. This ecologically sustainable rate of cut can be seen as an 'extraction ceiling'. Extraction beyond this ceiling is considered to involve natural capital consumption. This extraction ceiling is used to divide the proceeds from timber extraction into 'interest' and 'depletion' streams. The interest stream is consistent with maintaining capital intact, and can be considered true income. The depletion stream involves capital consumption. Basing economic analysis of the forest industry on an extraction ceiling encourages debate about defining sustainable extraction levels and about how to make the transition to sustainable forestry. It also shows that the timber industry overstates its contribution to government revenues and to the province's economic well-being. Critics of industrial forestry in BC have yet to take full advantage of how proper accounting for natural capital depletion can show the advantages to moving towards an ecoforestry approach. By insisting that economists make adjustments where natural capital depletion is projected to occur, advocates of ecoforestry can ensure a more level playing field for the comparison of industrial forestry and ecoforestry.

ID ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
AB Attempting to develop processes for the formulation of sustainable development policy is imperative in contemporary society. Ecological economics offers the opportunity to consider the integration of economic, socio-cultural and environmental aspects of problems in sustainable development policy processes. Practical engagement in the integration of these various facets of a problem requires a release from disciplinary and institutional rigidity. To enable this release requires an enhanced understanding of our cultural referents that have historically promoted these divisions and hierarchys in knowledge claims. This paper proposes that more effective sustainable development processes can be sought by collectively considering the key ecological economic concepts of sustainability, transdisciplinary and methodological pluralism. These concepts facilitate the critique of conventional policy processes, which then give way to a reformulated sustainable development policy process, termed the 'discursive community'. Through genuine stakeholder collaboration, based on learning processes, the 'discursive community' is able to articulate strategy for sustainable development. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB There is cause for concern that many current practices in the strategic use of advanced manufacturing technologies are unsustainable since they lead to increased resource consumption in the aggregate. This article examines the ways the current generation of production technologies structure the formation and growth of product markets and explains why firms, driven to stay competitive, are adopting manufacturing strategies based on reducing the time it takes to develop and manufacture new products. As experience in the use of advanced manufacturing technologies has accumulated, distinctive patterns in market organization have emerged, which, in turn, cause more firms to adopt these technologies. In effect, the markets and productions systems have co-evolved. Faster product cycles presage new product variants and faster product obsolescence linked to intensified customers' needs. This interdependency of market needs and the strategic use of manufacturing technologies has significance for drafting sustainable consumption policy. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB The ecological footprint (EF) has received much attention as a potential indicator for sustainable development over the last years. In this article, the EF concept has been applied to Benin, Bhutan, Costa Rica and the Netherlands in 1980, 1987 and 1994. The results of the assessment are discussed and used to discuss the current potential and Limitations of the EF as a sustainable development indicator. The originally defined methodology has been slightly adapted by the authors, who focus on individual components of the EF (land and carbon dioxide emissions) and use local yields instead of global averages. Although per capita and total land use differs among the four countries: available data suggest increasing land use in all four countries while per capita land use decreases. The EF for carbon dioxide emissions increases for all four countries in both per capita and absolute terms. Differences in productivity, aggregation (of different resources) and multi-functional land use have been shown to be important obstacles in EF application - depending on the assessment objective. However, despite the obstacles, the study concludes that the EF has been successful in providing an interesting basis for discussion on environmental effects of consumption patterns, including those outside the national borders, and on equity concerning resource use.

AB To understand the social driving forces that lead to environmental change, we must account for the role of social interactions, the development of norms of behavior and the institutionalization of rules and norms - the development of 'social capital'. This paper demonstrates the utility of social capital theory by articulating linkages between human decision making at individual and collective levels and social vision, an important research focus within the emerging ecological economics research tradition. Social capital theory clarifies relationships between social interactions and outcomes that contribute to the production of environmental quality, public peace and economic prosperity, necessary factors for long-term social and ecological sustainability.

DE scale; distribution; equity; ecological footprint
ID AGRICULTURE; ISSUES
AB This paper examines the relationship between scale and distribution issues. It is argued that since achieving a sustainable scale requires economic activity to stay within biophysical limits, considerations of equity should not be limited to the distribution of monetary measures such as income, but should include the distribution of scarce environmental services as well. In order to make this point this paper examines how differences in diet across populations lead to inequality in the distribution of environmental impact. First, the distribution of food consumption across the world's population is examined using national data. Next, ecological footprints are estimated in order to ascertain how differences in diet affect the distribution of environmental impact. The results show that the meat-intensive diet enjoyed by many in the industrialized world leads to a greater degree of inequality in the use of environmental services than is apparent from examination of the distribution of food consumption across countries.

AB This study documents the utilization aspects and distribution of ethnobotanical knowledge of the local people of Morogoro, Tanzania, as a first step towards sustainable utilization and conservation of tropical woodlands. A total of 133 arborescent species in 31 families was identified of which 69% had a variety of uses. These uses were classified into 12 categories and major uses were charcoal, firewood, medicine, and poles. Most tree species have occasional uses, but a few are exceptionally useful and thus their levels of utilization may far exceed their regeneration and production. The questionnaire survey indicated that 62% of the respondents agreed that traditional medical services were more available than modern sen ices. Utilization surveys indicated that wooden poles are the building,material used in 98% of the dwellings and storage structures, wild foods were useful for food security especially during drought years, and high quality timber trees have been depleted in the forest because of earlier exploitation by pit-sawing. The distribution of ethnobotanical knowledge indicated that muck of the relevant ethnobotanical and utilization information was held by more aged members of the society and hence there is a clear need to capture this knowledge before it is lost, This study has shown that resources are defined by use and culture, and some components of ethnobotanical knowledge have potential for the sustainable management of miombo woodlands.

TI Effect of building re-entrant shape on performance of air-cooled
   condensing units
SO ENERGY AND BUILDINGS
LA English
DT Article
DE air-conditioner performance; energy and flow simulation
AB Provision of split-type air-conditioners in high-rise residential buildings has become fashionable in Hong Kong. Building re-entrants are most popular for placing the outdoor condensing units. Heat energy dissipated by these condensing units induces a buoyant airflow. Inadequate displacement of air may lead to an elevated temperature environment at the re-entrant, which could significantly affect the condenser performance at the upper floors and subsequently result in a degradation of the overall capacity and efficiency of the air-conditioners. In recent years, some innovative building designers go for sustainable housing design. Re-entrants of various shapes thus evolve. One of their concerns is whether these various shapes would incur more difficulties in the airflow and thereby, would intensify the condenser heat dissipation problem. This paper describes some investigations on different re-entrant shapes making use of the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) techniques together with an energy evaluation model. The results show no evidence that the new re-entrant shapes will have adverse effects in comparison with the conventional design. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science S.A. All rights reserved.

TI Energy system assessment with sustainability indicators
SO ENERGY POLICY
LA English
DT Article
AB The paper presents an attempt to select, define and apply a set of sustainability indicators for the energy system assessment. Starting from the general sustainability concept, a set of indicators is defined reflecting specific criteria for the energy system evaluation. Particular attention is devoted to the resource, environment, social and economic criteria. Among these groups of criteria there are individual indicators emphasising respective aspect of the sustainability concept. This approach has its limitation due to the lack of data for serious consideration of the system. But it should be anticipated that these excises might serve as the guidance for the eventual future application. Also, this methodology for the assessment of energy system will become an useful tool only if it proves useful in the engineering practice. The example under consideration is an island with only individual consumption to be satisfied with solar, wind, biomass and oil-fired power plant which represent four options under consideration. The set of indicators is defined and determined with the aim to demonstrate the method of decision making procedure in selecting the option which meet selected indicators numerical values and constrain reflecting the non-numeric information of weighting factor for the determination of general criteria for the selection of appropriate option.

AB Marginal aquatic systems (wetlands) of the Po River (Italy) have become the target of a renewed interest because of their value for recreation, natural reserves, and deposits of sand. To preserve these sites. wise management must be the objective of local administrations. In this paper a strategy for the sustainable use of 11 wetlands is presented. It uses simple economic analysis and multiple criteria techniques and provides suggestions to promote sustainability in terms of conservation of natural resources, economic self-sufficiency. and minimization of potential conflicts about the use of the wetlands. In the understanding that sustainability is framed in a long-term perspective, stability analysis is also considered and performed by means of loop analysis, a qualitative technique. Conditions for stability are then dis cussed about management opportunities.

AB Evaluating the overall environmental health of a region invariably involves using databases from multiple organizations. Several approaches to deal with the related technological and sociological issues have been used by various programs. Flexible data systems are required to deal with rapid changes in technology, the social and political climate for sharing and integrating data, and expectations of diverse users. Here we describe how the Environmental Monitoring and Assessment Program and the Chesapeake Bay Program manage their data for regional studies. These programs, which encompass areas of different geographic scales but face similar issues, have adopted some solutions in common, but also have tried some unique solutions suited to their needs. Understanding the tribulations and successes of these programs may help others attempting similar assessments. Both these programs have embraced distributed data systems that are managed by the organizations owning them. Both use common guidelines and policies that assure consistency and quality of data and information. These principles and tools comprise a flexible, sustainable approach that meets modern challenges of data management.

AB A long-term field experiment commenced in 1979 at Wagga Wagga, NSW, Australia, to study the sustainability of a range of rotation, tillage and stubble management systems on a red earth. This paper presents results on lupin growth and grain yield in relation to rotation, tillage and stubble management between 1979 and 1992 during which time annual rainfall ranged from 311 to 799 mm.
   Mean annual grain yields of lupin varied from 0.26 to 3.15 t ha(-1). In a wheat-lupin rotation, highest mean grain yield (1.59 t ha(-1)) over all years was obtained from direct drilling into burnt stubble. Direct drilling resulted in significantly higher yields than conventional cultivation (three passes) in 1979, 1980, 1981, 1982, and 1988, which was generally related to increases in total dry matter production. Retaining, rather than burning stubble when direct drilling, usually resulted in lower plant density at emergence and maturity, but this did not always translate into similar effects on grain yield. Grain yield was significantly reduced by retaining stubble in 1986, 1987, 1989, 1990, and 1991, but significantly improved in 1980 and 1988. When the incidence of brown leaf spot was high or when rainfall during growth was excessively high resulting in waterlogging, yield benefits from direct drilling and stubble retention were apparent. The effect of early incorporation of stubble following summer rain with a one-way disc was not consistent, producing significant yield advantages in 3 years (1983, 1989, and 1990), a significant decrease in 1985, but no mean difference across years. There was no clear effect of the long rotation (wheat-wheat-lupin) on grain yield, but it increased average plant density across years.
   The effects of rotation, tillage and stubble management were seasonally related and though often promoting major differences in plant number, the subsequent differences in grain yield were usually reduced due to compensatory effects of pod number per plant.

AB Weed problems are currently solved by using inputs such as herbicides and soil tilling and by improving our knowledge of the ecophysiological process governing weed infestations and their competitive outcome on crop yield. In this paper, we review three different approaches for studying weed population dynamics (demographic, mechanistic and long-term studies) and discuss some of the advances in weed management strategies deriving from them. We present encouraging examples of successful strategies designed from population studies in annual and perennial weeds, as well as some ideas of how we should expand our knowledge base to achieve sustainable weed management strategies.

AB In the pursuit of more sustainable approaches to agricultural management, there is an obvious need to integrate knowledge of the agricultural sciences and ecology. We used recent findings on ecological correlates of seed characteristics as a framework to discuss the impact of shifting from soil ploughing to farming with reduced or zero tillage on weed communities. In the future, knowledge about seed bank ecology may become increasingly applicable towards improving the way we manage weeds. It is also possible that the effects of cultural activities on moulding weed characteristics will become more apparent. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Weed management opportunities can be found in responses such as seed germination, development of canopy architecture, flowering, and seed production and dispersal. However, there are still research challenges to be addressed before prediction of crop and weed phenology can be reliably used in weed management strategies. In this paper we will focus on those ecological processes where we believe research efforts hold the greatest promise for the use of phenology prediction: succession, evolution, and interference. Research challenges for new management strategies are finding ways to forecast future weed populations in response to environmental changes, and to engineer crop cultivars capable of producing the desired environmental changes and responses to biotic and abiotic interactions.

AB A multidisciplinary assessment of benthic rockfishes (genus Sebastes) and associated habitats in deep water was conducted in Sequel Submarine Canyon, Monterey Bay, California. Rock habitats at depths to 300 m were identified by using bathymetric and side-scan sonar imaging, verified by visual observations from a manned submersible, mapped and quantified. Species composition, abundance, size, and habitat specificity of fishes were determined by using a video camera and parallel laser system along transects made by a submersible.
   We counted 6208 nonschooling fishes representing at least 52 species from 83 10-min strip transects that covered an estimated 33,754 m(2). Rockfishes represented 77% of the total number of individuals, and included a minimum of 24 species, Six distinct habitat guilds of fishes were manifest from habitat-based clustering analysis: small species were associated with mud and cobble substrata of low relief, and larger species of rockfishes were associated with high-relief structures such as vertical rock walls, ridges, and boulder fields. There was remarkable concordance between some of the guilds identified in Sequel Canyon and the results of other habitat-specific assessments of fishes along the west coast of the United States from central California to Alaska. These generalities are valuable in predicting community structure and evaluating changes to that structure, as well as in applying small-scale species-habitat relationships to broader-scale fishery resource surveys. Additionally, establishment of these groups is critical when incorporating the concept of essential fish habitat (EFH), and negative impacts to it, into the management of fisheries in relatively deep water, as required by the Sustainable Fisheries Act of 1996. High numbers of large rockfishes (e.g. Sebastes chlorostictus. S. levis, S. rosenbblatti and S. ruberrimus) were locally associated with rock ledges, caves, and overhangs at sites having little or no evidence of fishing activity. Abundance and size of several species were lower at fished than at unfished sites. We suggest that rock outcrops of high relief interspersed with mud in deep water of narrow submarine canyons are less accessible to fishing activities and thereby can provide natural refuge for economically important fishes, as exemplified in Sequel Canyon.

AB Soppina Betta Forests (SBFs; foliage forests) are minor forests allowed by the State for the Areca-grower's use as organic support in the Western Ghats area of Karnataka, South India. Sustainable utilization of these for foliage and litter (to make composted leaf-manure) and firewood (to boil Areca nuts before drying) would ensure the farmer to stand on his own and prevent him from unduly pressurizing the State Forests. Ten hamlets in Sringeri area of the Western Ghats were selected at random, from each of which nearly 10 farmers were interviewed by PRA technique for a socio-economic survey of the purpose, benefits and management of their individual SBFs. One representative SBF from each of the 10 hamlets was taken up for phytosociological survey and the results were compared with a natural forest benchmark selected nearby. Species diversity at all levels was higher in the SBFs than in the natural forest. Stand densities too were higher, but basal coverages were lower. The farmers were found to promote select species like Aporosa lindleyana, Memecylon umbellatum, Syzygium cumini and S. caryophyllatum for their foliage requirements, The benefits derived, lopping patterns, protection and planting attitudes of the farmers were marked with a differentiating scheme and the relative scores on these four heads of management attributes were summed up into a management value index (MVI). MVI was found to increase with the Areca-landholding status of the farmers, and optimization of the MVI was observed at an Areca-landholding to SBF ratio of 1 : 1.5-2.5 for the low (0-1 ha), intermediate (1-2 ha) and rich (>2 ha) Areca-landholding categories. The optimization was most pronounced for the low landholding group of farmers. The average size-class distribution of tree species individuals of the 10 SBFs described the expected L-shaped curve similar to that of the natural forest, but possessed larger number of individuals in most of the size-classes.

ID ECOSYSTEM MANAGEMENT
AB A mail survey was conducted of local residents of a forest-dependent region (Fraser Fort George Regional District, n=974), provincial (British Columbia, n=1208) and Canadian (n=1672) publics to compare their values for forests and preferences for forest management (overall response rate=45.2%). While the local public tended to place a significantly higher (p<0.05) emphasis on economic values and clearcutting practices relative to provincial and national publics, all publics held quite similar views on forest management overall. All publics support a multi-value/ecosystem management over a single-value/timber management approach to forest management, do not support maximisation of economic returns from timber regardless of the impacts and agree forest managers should be more responsive to local resident values than the values of more distant groups. Responses also reflected a lack of public confidence in government natural resource agencies. Results suggest residents from forest and non forest-dependent communities share similar forest values, that current forest management practices such as clearcutting do not reflect the values of local, provincial or national publics, and that forest managers should be especially responsive to the values of the local public when making forest management decisions.

ID SEA-LEVEL RISE
AB Flooding in Venice is an internationally renowned problem, and an icon for the threats that climate change and the associated sea-level rise might bring. This article chronicles the ideas that dominate the debate about providing flood protection for this important world heritage city. These include the famous proposal for mobile gates between the Lagoon and the sea and the counter arguments that stress the need for more sustainable solutions. Central to this analysis also is the complexity of political intrigue that surrounds everything in Venice, and the way that this discourse has fostered the constant shifting of opinions and decisions. Recent trends and 'final' pronouncements suggest that the gates will never be built, but nothing is certain in Italy and re-crossing this Rubicon may indeed prove not to be sacrosanct.

ID HEALTH
AB Public Health systems in developing countries are in a field of tension between two poles: sustainability and accessibility. A several months check on hospitals run by the Lutheran Church in Tanzania led us to conclude, however, that the great majority of these institutions have neither a survival chance nor have they made any substantial contribution to the status of public health care for the poor. Basing on the results of this check we discuss a few measures to transform church-run public health systems in developing countries in accordance with the goals of sustainability and accessibility. It is, however, evident that it will not be enough just to increase the technical efficiency of existing hospitals. What is needed - acid this seems indeed to be the only feasible way - is to effect a complete reorganisation in the sense of Primary Health Care. It is only then that church-run Public Health Care may survive in these countries and that provision of adequate health care can be ensured for many patients.

AB Colorado potato beetle (CPB; Leptinotarsa decemlineata-Say) is a serious pest because it has developed resistance against insecticides. Three transgenic eggplant (Solanum melongena L,) lines bearing a mutagenized Bacillus thuringiensis; Berl, gene coding for the Cry3B toxin, and the nontransformed control DR2-line were tested in field trials to assess their insect resistance. The transgenic lines 3-2, 6-1, and 9-8 were tested at two different locations in a randomized complete-block design. Samples were taken biweekly to assess the level of CPB and the presence of other insects. At harvest, total yield and fruit number per plot were recorded. Two transgenic lines showed high levels of resistance at both locations, as measured by CPB abundance and yield, Fruit production was almost twice as great in the highly resistant lines (3-2 and 9-8) as in the nontransformed control. The 6-1 transgenic line showed an intermediate Level of resistance: it was similar to the control under heavy CPB pressure and was comparable to the other transgenic lines under milder infestations. Analysis by double antibody sandwich-enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (DAS-ELISA), performed on different tissues, revealed a fewer amount of Cry3B protein in the 6-1 transgenic line than in lines 3-2 and 9-8, No detrimental effects on nontarget arthropods (including the chrysomelid Altica) were evident. Field observations confirmed that Bt may be able to control CPB infestation in eggplant, representing a potential effective and environmentally safe means of pest control.

TI Constructing an NGO sector in transitional contexts - The reach of
   NGO-donor 'partnerships' in post-Soviet Georgia
SO IDS BULLETIN-INSTITUTE OF DEVELOPMENT STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
AB This article considers NGO-donor relationships in the former Soviet Republic of Georgia. Both NGOs and aid donors have emerged only recently as meaningful actors in post-Soviet space. More particularly, they have emerged together: NGOs are essentially the product of donor intervention and are the vehicles of donors' aspirations for the creation of a sustainable and autonomous 'civil society' in Georgia. The article explores the NGO-donor 'partnership' this gives rise to, seeing this as a relationship that includes functional linkages and a deeper set of socio-cultural exchanges. The nature of the partnership, in which donors are much the stronger partners, is shown to pervade NGOs' wider relationships and shape their development to such an extent that it acts in some ways to undermine the achievement of the very outcomes donors most desire. While the NGO sector is rapidly expanding, it is not developing the social, political or economic roots to become sustainable and autonomous in the near future. This indicates the need for a profound re-think of the NGO-donor partnership in Georgia, and in particular the need to move towards a deeper and less generalised understanding of the context.

TI Strengthening local organisation - "Where the rubber hits the road"
SO IDS BULLETIN-INSTITUTE OF DEVELOPMENT STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
AB As aid agencies embrace the concept of strengthening local organisation as an end rather than a means for achieving project objectives, there is need for wider understanding of best practice and lessons learnt in organisational development at the grassroots level. Four case studies are examined here from the international non-governmental organisation world (Haiti, Peru, Mall and Nepal). Key implications for practice and policy are drawn from these examples. In marginalised rural areas, local organisation seems to take hold more firmly, with a process approach that permits people to define their own priorities and organise themselves around appropriate solutions and structures. Integrated, synergetic programmes that include economic initiatives such as credit and savings yield stronger local organisations than single-sector or technology-driven programmes, and are more likely to include women and the poor. Sensitivity to context, flexibility and adaptability are among other important variables. The implications of these lessons for policies and partnerships within the international aid community are far reaching. If donor agencies are serious about strengthening local organisations and enhancing problem-solving capacities on a long-term, sustainable basis, and wish to make the growth of civil society as important as meeting sectoral goals, there is a need for fundamental changes in the way aid funding and partnerships are understood, negotiated, structured, limed and assessed.

DT Article
AB The manufacturing of organic coatings in Uruguay has adopted the concept of sustainable development, incorporating and adapting new technologies trusting that technical adjournment and environmental respect will also contribute to its competitive profile.
   Given the present regional conditions and the high rate in technological improvements, we can only project two years although it may seem too short a period of time.
   We have programmed the following regional activities for the next couple of years:
   . Industry activities level:
   Continue with the marketing and placement of products:
   free of lead and chromium,
   free of E glycols
   powder coating: super durable polyesters and thin coatings
   water thinnable
   solventless
   Keep updated information on the TGIC toxicity to determine its replacement
   Introduce the following technologies:
   liquid paints UV cured if the furniture industry requires it
   anticorrosive powder primers
   . Institutional level:
   Continue promoting the following activities in Uruguay and the Mercosur:
   legal limitations for the use of mercury, lead and chromium VI in paints
   agreement on products specifications
   performance evaluations on painting systems
   In a globalized business framework, ten paint companies have 60% of the world market share. Our challenge is to keep on developing friendly environmental technologies that also support our competitive profile while simultaneously generating new business opportunities.

AB Objectives: The aim was to review the literature with regard to the effectiveness of intervention programmes for the prevention of aggravation of back disorders or prolonged duration of sickness absence. Methods: A systematic search of the literature was performed using three groups of key words and inclusion/exclusion criteria. Effectiveness was evaluated using two measures: the difference between intervention and referent groups in return to work, and the fraction of sickness absence among referent groups that could be prevented if these referents had undergone the same intervention (preventable Fraction). Results: Twelve articles with quantitative information on the effect of ergonomic interventions on return to work were included. In eight studies, introduction of a back-school programme was the preferred intervention, combining exercise and functional conditioning, and training in working methods and lifting techniques. III seven out of eight back-school studies, return to work was significantly better in the intervention group. Intervention after 60 days, in the subacute phase of back pain. showed the most promising results. In these studies the preventable fraction varied between -11% and 80%, largely depending on the stage and phase of back disorders and the time of follow-up. The success of intervention also depended on the profile of the referents when left untampered. In all studies compliance during the intervention was fairly good, but there was a lack of information on sustainability of the intervention during the follow-up and on recurrence of back complaints and consequent sickness absence. Conclusions: Few studies were performed to assess the outcome return to work after ergonomic intervention. However, there is evidence that intervention in the subacute phase of back pain is preferable. Future intervention studies should address intervention sustainability and recurrence of sickness absence due to back pain over at least a 1-year follow-up period.

AB Applying the general environomic methodology presented in the first of this series of two articles (i.e. Part I [1]), details of the environomic model for a district heating network based on centralized and decentralized heat pumps are presented. A complete set of results for the optimal synthesis, design and operation of the network is given and discussed. The resulting solution space is highly nonlinear and noncontiguous and is effectively searched using a genetic algorithm. Results are shown for various district heating user distributions as well as fuel and electricity prices. When properly optimized, solutions with heat pumps are economically very close to traditional district hearing solutions, particularly when the main pollution costs are internalized. For comparison purposes, the same approach and models can be used to identify the life cycle exergetic optimum, which is also given. These results illustrate the power of this nem, engineering tool for the synthesis and design of more sustainable energy systems and networks.

ID DOTS STRATEGY; SUCCESS
AB In 1998 the Government of Bangladesh changed its health and population sector strategy from a project-oriented approach (the Fourth Population and Health Project-FPHP) to sector-wide management (the Fifth Health and Population Sector Programme-HPSP), This article describes the development and achievements of the tuberculosis programme during the FPHP, and discusses the potential opportunities and challenges anticipated by the programme from the reformed health service delivery of the HPSP. 'Further strengthening of tuberculosis and leprosy control services' was one of the 66 projects of the FPHP. As part of the FPHP, the National Tuberculosis Programme policy was revised in 1992 and the project was implemented in phases. By mid 1998, 90% of the population was covered, and more than 200 000 tuberculosis cases had been diagnosed and treated with 80% success. We describe the reasons for this success and analyse the pitfalls of the project.
   The objective of the reforms in HPSP is to provide cost-effective, sustainable, quality services to those in need through an essential service package that includes control of communicable diseases such as tuberculosis and leprosy. Tuberculosis services will become more accessible as community clinics deliver essential health services for every 6000 population. Non-public health care providers, who contribute significantly to health services in the country, will be involved in service delivery. The main challenge is to maintain the quality of successful projects, such as tuberculosis control, during the transition period.

DT Article
AB The article shows that the text of Rio's Agenda 21, which gives a prominent place to the role of information, views that information differently in different parts of the report. The first two parts, devoted to technical issues, focus largely on information flowing from top to bottom, from the international and the national to the local level. The third part, which focuses on actors, deals with the right of access to information. The last chapter pursues that theme by considering everyone to be both a user and a provider of information. It is essential that information be brought to the very heart of decision-making since it is a major element of governance. Information must be operative locally; it must flow not only from top to bottom, but from bottom to top as well as horizontally within the networks exchanging observations and experiences. One must be sensitive to language barriers and to the richness of multilingualism. To satisfy these various objectives, the Internet offers a variety of opportunities, notably through the use of meta-information systems such as protocols and thesauri, and through the development of local resource centers.

AB During the 20th century, agricultural engineering became a really multidisciplinary field of science. Besides traditional mechanical engineering, fundamental developments in microelectronics, systems and control engineering, chemical engineering and physics have opened wide perspectives for agricultural engineering. During the last century, agricultural engineering has effected major changes in agriculture with regard to labour productivity and specialization in the different sectors of plant production and livestock production. Public concern for environmental issues, e.g. emissions of volatile compounds, water pollution through plant nutrients and agrochemicals, has resulted in research and technology development in the held of environmental engineering. In developing activities for more sustainability in production, agricultural enterprises have to reclaim the trust of society and earn 'the licence to produce'! Agricultural engineers have the chances to contribute in this process. They must be also aware that new technologies and techniques require thorough full technology assessment procedure to make clear aspects of acceptability to different groups in the community. To achieve optimal results for agribusiness and the society, the expertise of agricultural engineers must be integrated with expertise from the biological and socio-economic sciences. In agricultural engineering, a dynamic balance between economy, technology and ecology must always be found in order to satisfy the requirements of government and the changing preferences of consumers. Recognition of trends in the society and networking and participation in debates are important activities for agricultural engineers in the 21st century. 'Breakthrough' technologies are needed for agricultural enterprises to meet the increasing list of standards and norms, for example in the areas of energy, animal welfare, product quality, water and volatile emissions.
   As this was the case in the last century, agricultural engineering has therefore to keep pace with trends in science and technology, e.g. fundamental developments in the information and communication technology, biotechnology, materials technology, microelectronics and mechatronics. Technology watch, networking and cooperation are key words for agricultural engineers.
   In line with these challenges, strategic themes for the agricultural engineering science are: the concepts for sustainable bioproduction systems in the greenhouse and livestock sector; the further progress in precision agriculture; the use of biomass and wastes as energy sources: electronic communication with models and databases without human interference (green net); and innovative measurement and biomonitoring systems.

Basic knowledge about the interdependence between technology and plants, animals and microbiology, must be put together in the functional design and layout of facilities, which also meets requirements for: visual impact and aesthetic quality; environmental implications and sustainability; economic competitiveness of enterprises and several other requirements.
   However, external factors often determine prices and income, such as the marketplace, government policy, international trade, the World Trade Organisation and the world food situation, leading to a continuous trend of structural change and the relocation for the agri-food system. Infrastructure investments designed by agricultural engineers, driven by technological, economical and political changes are the cutting edge of structural change for shaping the future farming.

AB Dryland sustainable agriculture in the arid zone of India depends upon the choice of suitable cultivars for pure and mixed crop stands. Field experiments were conducted for two years to examine the response of two contrasting cultivars each of pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum) and clusterbean (Cyamopsis tetragonoloba) in pure stands and in mixed pearl millet-clusterbean stands. The differential response of cultivars of both crops to pure and mixed stands resulted in a significant genotype x cropping system interaction. Reduction in seed yield of both clusterbean cultivars was greater in mixed stands with tall and long duration pearl millet MH 179 than with medium statured and early maturing HHB 67. The degree of reduction was greater in Naveen, the branched clusterbean cultivar, than in RGC 197, the single stemmed cultivar. Mixing of pearl millet HHB 67 with medium duration clusterbean cultivar Naveen produced maximum pearl millet equivalent total yield. Higher land equivalent ratios (LERs) were also observed when clusterbean cultivars were mixed with early maturing and short statured pearl millet HHB 67.

AB An assessment of time-trends in yield parameters is essential to the utilization of data from long-term field trials for the comparison of different crop rotations and input regimes, and the identification of sustainable production systems. The barley-vetch rotation established at Breda in northern Syria has provided the basis for estimation of the time-trends in yield data from selected treatments in a two-course crop rotation trial. The model used for the estimation accounts for the effect of rainfall, a major determinant of each annual yield value, and the first-order autocorrelation structure in the errors arising from the same plot over time. An expression for the minimum number of cycles required to detect a significant time-trend has been obtained. Results from the barley-vetch rotation under two fertilizer regimes have been discussed.

AB The catalytic performance and characterization of YBa2Cu3O7-delta and YBa2Cu3O7-deltaXsigma for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane (ODE) to ethene have been investigated. Under the reaction conditions of temperature = 680 degrees C, C2H6/O-2/N-2 molar ratio = 2/1/3.7, and contact time = 1.67 x 10(-4) h g ml(-1), YBa2Cu3O7-0.21F0.16 showed 84.1% C2H6 conversion, 81.8% C2H4 selectivity, and 68.8% C2H4 yield; YBa2Cu3O7-0.18Cl0.13 showed 92.5% C2H6 conversion, 72.0% C2H4 selectivity, and 66.6% C2H4 yield. The sustainable performance during a period of 40 h on-stream reaction at 680 degrees C demonstrated that the F- and Cl-doped catalysts are durable. X-ray powder diffraction results indicated that the undoped YBa2Cu3O7-delta and halide-doped YBa2Cu3O7-deltaXsigma were of triple-layered oxygen-deficient perovskite-type orthorhombic structure. The results of the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, thermal treatment, thermogravimetric analysis, and O-18(2)-pulsing studies indicated that the incorporation of halide ions into the YBa2Cu3O7-delta lattice enhanced the activity of lattice oxygen. According to the O-2 temperature-programmed desorption and temperature-programmed reduction results, we conclude that the oxygen species desorbed at 610-710 degrees C are active for the selective oxidation of ethane and those desorbed below 610 degrees C are active for the total oxidation of ethane; a suitable oxygen nonstoichiometry and Cu3+ concentration in YBa2Cu3O7-deltaXsigma, are required for the best catalytic performance of the catalysts.

AB Although a major contributor to economic development, the mining industry in China produces a large amount of derelict land, and causes pollution of water and soil erosion as well as other environmental damage. Large areas of degraded mining land remains barren preventing agricultural, social and economically sustainable development in affected areas. As land is under short supply in China, exacerbated by the rapidly expanding population, it is now policy to restore or reclaim land degraded by mining. The aim is to develop sustainable and healthy arable-land ecosystems. This paper outlines the principles and approaches to ecological restoration, which have been adopted in Shanxi Province with reference to three typical surface mines. (C) 2000 Academic Press.

AB Market oriented production is a key factor driving land-use intensification in the Middle Mountains of Nepal. The results of a GIS-based case-study indicates historic, large-scale deforestation followed by afforestation. The area under cultivation has increased, but the expansion of irrigation has been limited by water availability. Rainfed agriculture has expanded onto steep upland slopes while irrigated cultivation expanded on slopes less than or equal to 10 degrees. The farming systems have become more intensive; double and triple crop rotations are applied where water is available, and increased vegetable production and the marketing of milk are indicators of intensification. Seventy percent of the surveyed households now grow cash crops, and 45% sell buffalo milk. Market oriented agriculture is more demanding of soil and water resources, and concerns about resource degradation are emerging. Sixty percent of surveyed farmers reported a lack of irrigation as their main production constraint. Agro-chemical use has increased, soil acidification related to the use of ammonium based fertilizers is a concern, and stream eutrophication is common during the dry season. Commercial milk production has increased demand for animal fodder, placing additional pressure on forest and rangelands, with 55% of female farmers reporting fodder shortages during the dry season. Potential management options to minimize the impact of intensification include improved agricultural extension, N-fixing plants, improved composting, liming, and water use efficiency. Market-driven agricultural production provides a source of income to the rural poor, but the sustainability of these intensive systems is dependent on addressing soil and water degradation.

AB Ocotea bullata (Lauraceae), one of the top-ten traditional medicinal plants used in KwaZulu-Natal, is close to extinction through high demand and destructive harvesting methods. The stem bark is traditionally used to cure headaches, urinary disorders and stomach problems. Substitution of leaves for bark provides a possible resource management solution for this threatened medicinal plant. One aim of this study was to compare the chemical composition of O. bullata leaves and bark using TLC, HPLC and GC-MS analysis. The characteristic analytical fingerprints of leaf and bark extracts showed great similarities. A second aim was to investigate the pharmacological properties of O. bullata as a remedy against headaches. Leaf and bark extracts were tested in terms of cyclooxygenase-1 and 5-lipoxygenase inhibition. Extracts from the bark exhibited moderate inhibitory activity in both test systems. Extracts from fresh leaves were superior to bark extracts in terms of their in vitro inhibitory activity against cyclooxygenase-1 and 5-lipoxygenase. Volatiles obtained from n-hexane extracts of leaves and bark showed better inhibitory activity towards cyclooxygenase-1 and especially towards 5-lipoxygenase than the original n-hexane extracts. Volatiles were therefore recognized as one of the main active principles in O. bullata with regards to the anti-inflammatory properties of this medicinal plant. This lends support to the traditional usage of O. bullata bark as an inhalant or snuff. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Population growth, urbanization and the unrestricted collection of medicinal plants from the wild is resulting in an over-exploitation of natural resources in southern Africa. Therefore, the management of traditional medicinal plant resources has become a matter of urgency. In southern Africa the most frequently used medicinal plants are slow-growing forest trees, bulbous and tuberous plants, with bark and underground parts being the parts mainly utilized. A strategy which would satisfy the requirements of sustainable harvesting, yet simultaneously provide for primary health care needs, would be the substitution of bark or underground parts with leaves of the same plant. This paper outlines the concept of plant substitution, using preliminary results of our recent investigations into four of the most important and most threatened South African medicinal plants - Eucomis autumnalis (bulb). Siphonochilus aethiopicus (rhizome), Ocotea bullata (bark), and Warburgian salutaris (bark) - as a demonstration of the kind of research necessary. Extracts of various plant parts were compared chemically using TLC-analysis, and pharmacologically in terms of antibacterial activity and cyclooxygenase-1 inhibition in vitro. The importance of the concept of plant part substitution as a strategy for the conservation of medicinal plants in southern Africa is discussed in terms of the results obtained.

AB The future more sustainable management of coastal resources is an important policy goal for all governments of countries with coastlines. Coastal areas are under intense environmental change pressure with extensive feedback effects between the natural systems and the human systems. It could be argued that there is just one jointly determined and coevolving system that needs to be studied and managed. Understanding the interactions between the coastal zone and environmental change cannot be achieved by observational studies alone. Modelling of key environmental and socio-economic processes is a vital tool, required to buttress coastal management institutions acid practice. Three overlapping procedural stages can be identified in the coastal resource assessment process. The scoping and auditing stage, implemented via a 'pressure-state-impact-response framework, details, among other thing, problems, system boundaries and value conflicts. The framework is itself based on a conceptual model, which lays stress on functional value diversity and the links between ecosystem processes, functions and outputs of goods and services which are deemed 'valuable' by society. The two subsequent stages are integrated modelling, combining natural and social science methodologies, and evaluation of management options and related gains and losses. An overview of a research project, which utilised the pressure-state-impacts-response (P-S-I-R) framework and supporting concepts and methods, is presented in the last section of the paper, together with some generic 'lessons' for interdisciplinary research.

AB The solid-state reactivities of the hydrazine-hydroquinone 1:1 complex and of hydrazine hydrochloride with solid aldehydes, ketones, carboxylic acids, thiohydantoin and 4-nitrophenyl isothiocyanate were investigated. Only the hydrazine complex provides quantitative additions, condensations, ring openings and ring closures. The solid-state mechanisms were investigated by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and the Ear-reaching anisotropic molecular movements are correlated with the crystal packing, both on the hydrazine complex surface and on the surface of two benzaldehydes. The hydrazine moves into the aldehyde crystals for chemical reaction without melting. Characteristic surface features are created by the common phase rebuilding and phase transformation on both the hydrazine-donating and -accepting crystals. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Traditional explanations for the variability, and limits to sustainability, of fish stocks focus on the early planktonic life history. Recently, these models have been challenged. Here, the arguments for the locus of regulation in fish stocks are reviewed. New material is presented, of North Sea plaice, indicating that only the fittest larvae survive, and that there is an increased predation on weaker larvae. It is concluded that the main source of regulation is in the planktonic phase, and that this is where research needs to be.

AB Direct agricultural markets, predicated on face-to-face ties between producers and consumers, are often seen as central components of local food systems. Activists and academic analysts often assume that trust and social connection characterize direct agricultural markets, distinguishing local food systems from the "global food system". This article examines that premise about direct agricultural markets, using the concept of social embeddedness from economic sociology to analyze the interplay of the economic and the social. Specifically, it draws on Block's (1990) elaboration of the concepts of marketness and instrumentalism to qualify the concept of social embeddedness. Taken together, and augmented by consideration of how they relate to power and privilege, these concepts provide an analytical framework that more accurately describes the social relations of two types of direct agricultural markets - the farmers' market and community supported agriculture. In providing an alternative market, farmers' markets create a context for closer social ties between farmers and consumers, but remain fundamentally rooted in commodity relations. In attempting to construct an alternative to the market, as reflected in an explicit emphasis on community and in the distinctive "share" relationship, community supported agriculture moves closer towards the decommodification of food. Nonetheless, in both types of direct markets, tensions between embeddedness, on the one hand, and marketness and instrumentalism, on the other, suggest how power and privilege may sometimes rest more with educated, middle-class consumers than with farmers or less-advantaged consumers. Recognizing how marketness and instrumentalism complicate social embeddedness is critical for understanding the viability, development and prospects of local food systems.

AB Background. Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) are associated with aging and atherosclerosis. AAAs arise through a degenerative process characterized in part by depletion of medial smooth muscle cells (SMC), suggesting that generalized aging and SMC senescence represent potential mechanisms contributing to aneurysmal degeneration. It is not yet known whether SMC from AAA tissue exhibit a difference in proliferative capacity compared to SMC from nonaneurysmal vessels or to what extent such differences might be due to aging alone or other patient-specific factors.
   Materials and methods. Aneurysm wall tissues were obtained from 15 patients undergoing AAA repair. In each case, a segment of the adjacent (nonaneurysmal) inferior mesenteric artery (IMA) from the same patient was used as a control. Paired AAA- and IMA-derived SMC strains were obtained by explant techniques and their proliferative capacities were compared during serial passage in culture.
   Results. Sustainable SMC cultures were established from all IMA explants but from only 9 of 15 AAAs (P < 0.05), The interval required to achieve primary explant growth was longer for AAAs than IMAs (16.4 +/- 2 vs 6.4 +/- 1 days; P < 0.001), but it was unrelated to patient age, gender, or aneurysm size. AAA-derived SMC appeared larger and rounder than the corresponding IMA-derived SMC, even after repeated passage in culture, and their maximal proliferation was reduced by 44.2 +/- 8% (n = 5 pairs, P < 0.05). Serum-stimulated [SH]thymidine uptake in AAA-derived SMC was also reduced by 54.9 +/- 7% (n 5 pairs, P < 0.01) but flow cytometry revealed no differences in SMC viability, apoptosis, or necrosis. While IMA-derived SMC continued to proliferate beyond passage 20 during serial subculture, all AAA-derived SMC developed replicative senescence by passage 12,
   Conclusions. AAA-derived SMC exhibit a distinct morphologic appearance in culture, a diminished proliferative capacity compared to SMC from the adjacent IMA and a limited in vitro life span. These differences reflect an intrinsic alteration in SMC growth capacity independent of age alone, Tissue-specific processes leading to accelerated replicative senescence may therefore contribute to the selective medial SMC depletion observed in AAAs.

TI Powder processing, rheology, and mechanical properties of feedstock for
   fused deposition of Si3N4 ceramics
SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CERAMIC SOCIETY
LA English
DT Article
ID FABRICATION
AB Fused deposition of ceramics (FDC) is a technique in which green parts are fabricated directly from CAD designs. The feedstock for FDC is a 1.778 mm diameter filament that requires a low viscosity and high column strength. This study explores the powder processing science, as well as the rheological and mechanical properties required for a successful FDC feedstock material. GS44 Si3N4 powders were dispersed in RU9 binder using oleyl alcohol (OA). The viscosity of the RU9/OA/Si3N4 mixture was measured as a function of temperature, solids loading, and OA concentration. The mechanical properties of the filament feedstock were evaluated in compression to establish FDC process limits. The feedstock material shows a shear thinning behavior with OA acting mainly as a plasticizer. The viscosity of GS44-filled RU9 decreases with temperature, and increases with solids content. At 185 degrees C and 55 vol% loading, the viscosity was found to be in the range of 49-7 Pa.s for a corresponding shear rate of 70-1128 s(-1). This was sufficiently low for FDC. Based on pressure requirements for FDC extrusion (Delta P), and maximum sustainable stress without buckling by the filament (sigma(E)), it has been found that for successful FDC of RU955, 1.1 Delta P < sigma(E).

AB Land degradation and pollution caused by population pressure and economic development pose a threat to the sustainability of the Earth's surface, especially in tropical regions where a long history of chemical weathering has made the surface environment particularly fragile.
   Systematic baseline geochemical data provide a means of monitoring the state of the environment and identifying problem areas. Regional surveys have already been carried out in some countries, and with increased national and international funding they can be extended to cover the rest of the land surface of the globe. Preparations have been made, under the auspices of the IUGS, for the establishment of just such an integrated global database.

AB Quail populations are declining in North America. Hence, we modeled the viability of northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus) populations subject to weather catastrophes and harvest to help focus management and research efforts to reverse the decline. We examined northern-latitude (winter weather catastrophes) and southern-latitude (summer weather catastrophes) populations separately because winter survival is lower and density-dependent production is stronger in northern- than in southern-latitude populations. Under a criterion of quasiextinction at less than or equal to 14 birds (1 covey), the demographic capacity required for at least a 95% probability of persistence for 100 years was about 100 birds with summer weather catastrophes, about 500 birds with winter weather catastrophes, and about 800 birds with both winter and summer weather catastrophes. Given assumptions underlying the model, populations subject to summer weather catastrophes were sustainable under a less than or equal to 30% harvest rate if demographic capacity in autumn was about 700 birds. Populations subject to winter weather catastrophes could persist at less than or equal to 40% harvest rates and a demographic capacity of about 400 birds. Northern populations were more vulnerable to extinction in the absence of harvest, whereas southern populations were more vulnerable to extinction in the presence of harvest.

AB Landsat TM images were employed to characterize land-cover types and land-cover changes in Fuqing City and its adjacent areas in Fujian Province, southeast China. Three TM scenes from 1991, 1994 and 1996 were used to cover the city and the adjacent areas and a five-year time period. Socio-economic data were also integrated with remotely sensed data for the study. Digital image processing with assistance of GIS has produced three classified image maps. The comparison of the three maps reveals that the urban expansion was very rapid, a large number of arable lands have been lost, and deforestation has taken place in the study area during the five study years. The main driving forces to the urbanization appeared to be the rapid economic development and traffic infrastructure. The suggestion on the regional sustainable development for the county is also presented. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB This paper synthesizes the findings of a workshop which sought to consider the issues of poor uptake, adoption and adaptation of soil and water conservation techniques by farmers post-project by examining the experiences of projects which had research and extension elements. Critical factors contributing to the adoption and adaptation of soil and water conservation techniques by farmers are identified as
   a more flexible approach and which enables learning within projects;
   a process rather than output driven approach to soil and water conservation;
   demonstration of immediate and tangible benefits of soil and water conservation to farmers (production, income, risk-minimization); and
   avoiding a narrow focus on soil and water conservation-alternatives are 'better land husbandry' or 'sustainable rural livelihoods' approaches.
   A number of areas are 'identified as priorities for further research which would aid the successful adoption of sustainable agricultural techniques and which should guide future research, development and extension, bringing more sustained benefits to farmers, particularly in humid and subhumid hillside regions.

TI How can policy take into consideration the "full value" of forests?
SO LAND USE POLICY
LA English
DT Article
DE forest policy; sustainable development; environmental valuation;
   participatory approach
AB It is generally considered that sustainable forest development needs to lake into account the 'full value' of forests, and that forest policies should promote the consideration of this 'full value'. But for the moment, nobody knows exactly how to measure this 'full value', which is largely based on subjective moral values and qualitative assertions. The paper discusses the concept of 'full value', and analyses the different ways it is presently used for the promotion of a new kind of forest policy. A special emphasis is placed on two rationalist instrumental approaches which have been developed in the forestry field. The first one is based on the concept of the total economic value of forests and its individual components of value, as developed through a framework matrix combining the forest products and forest-use classifications adopted in multiple use forestry. The second is based on a mapping method for qualitatively assessing the overall value of forests, which consists of attributing an overall score that measures the economic quality of wooded areas derived from a scoring system for the various contributors to this quality, including for instance protective capacity against erosion and aesthetic contribution to the landscape. In fact, the concept of 'full value' is a very precise economic one, which does not have a lot to do with the way the decision-making process works in forestry field. For policy decisions, there is neither full nor total(in the sense of additive) value, there is an implicit deduction which is made during the negotiation between actors and which is more or less correctly (generally rather less) translated into monetary terms, due to a poor assessment of public benefits and externalities. An incremental conceptual framework, which takes into consideration as many needs and interests as possible and which associates all the various actors to decision-making and implementing through a negotiation procedure is thought to be a more suitable way to construct a forest policy. A mixed model for forest policy formulation is discussed. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The total value generated by a forest consists of wood and non-wood goods and services. The profit-oriented forest owner considers in his management plan only those forest products for which he can expect a market price; non-market forest goods and services are provided as positive externalities of the production of market goods. Since many unpriced forest values are of utmost importance to society, their sufficient provision in terms of quantity and quality also has to be ensured. This paper discusses several options aiming at a better utilisation of the forest potential and proposes research needs in this context. One option is to transform non-market goods into market goods. The marketability of goods is a given physical fact having to do with the exclusion of the goods and the rivalry of consumers. If one can easily exclude those from consumption, who do not pay ('free riders'), one can market a good. This is the case for private goods as well as club goods. Many forest services such as biodiversity, and protection against erosion, are public goods. Once public goods are provided, it is difficult to exclude others from enjoying them. By marketing they can be transformed into local public goods and toll goods ('impure public goods') for which a price can be charged. The success mostly depends on the entrepreneurial behaviour of the forest owners. If more 'impure public goods' are needed, or if there are still unpriced forest goods and services which are not marketable, the welfare-optimising state has to intervene by appropriate regulatory, economic and informational means at the national and supra-national levels in order to overcome the prisoner's dilemma situation. A special informational means which has received much attention in the international deliberations on forests are national forest programmes (NFPs). At the international level, a central authority does not exist, which could enforce the sufficient provision of forest public goods in forest management through legally binding instruments. But it could be established, if there is an incentive for a group of participants to overcome a problematic situation through agreement on a legally binding instrument for forests. The international deliberations on forests could benefit from analyses to evaluate the outcomes of existing and new legal instruments and policy tools. Collective action to sustainably manage forests for timber and public goods without an external authority to offer incentives or impose sanctions can also be provided by 'common-property regimes'. They seem to be promising for the management of common-pool resources such as forests. Common-property regimes on forests arose during history by trial and error in many mountainous areas of Europe. Both the users of timber and public goods hold private rights to use a given forest and come to some agreement on compatible uses which meet their competing interests. Research on individual case studies of successful and failed common-property regimes would facilitate the implementation of this tool. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The forest industries are among the more important industrial sectors in Europe. They are the customers for the bulk of the wood produced in Europe's forests. The sale of wood to them is the source of the major part of the revenue that forest owners derive from their forests. Even though the non-wood goods and services of the forest are of increasing importance, it is inevitable that wood production will continue to figure prominently in most management plans. Consequently, the maintenance of a healthy forest industry is a key element in achieving the economic, social and environmental sustainability of Europe's forests. This paper is in two parts. The first describes in broad terms the role of the forest as source of industrial raw material. the use of the raw material by the wood-processing industries and their place in national economies. This will serve to highlight the inter-dependency between the forest resource and the wood-processing industries. The second part will consider the policy implications of this inter-dependency, particularly from the paint of view of the relative importance of the wood-producing function of the forest and in the context of the economic, social and environmental sustainability of forest management under European conditions. The hypothesis will be explored that in a region such as Europe, with a high density and economically advanced population, the maintenance of a healthy forest-industries sector is a key element in achieving sustainability of Europe's forests.

AB Due to storm events, spills and careless practices, nutrients from animal Feeding operations have denigrated water quality in the United States, Governments at all levels are taking action to reduce pollution problems from these operations. The numerous legislative and regulatory responses have not been directed at employing nutrients from animal wastes in crop production. Instead, the command and control provisions respond to some of the concerns voiced by the public, but their generalized coverage makes them costly and imposes expenses on producers who are not causing any problems. Governments need to consider alternative strategies that would incorporate a relationship between crop land and the animal wastes from feeding operations to more accurately account for environmental costs from excess nutrients.

AB Fifty years ago animal foods were considered complete foods and important for human health. In most developed countries substantial dairy cattle and milk production industries existed which made major contributions to human welfare including the provision of cow milk to infants and young children. Then, over the last forty years, hypotheses have been developed largely by the medical profession and associated fields of research on the unfavourable roles of dietary cholesterol (DC), animal fats and serum cholesterol (SC) in coronary heart diseases (CHD). These postulates resulted in new and strange equalities such as DC + animal fat = SC = CHD. These hypotheses were followed by simplistic dietary recommendations with warnings against animal fats. These warnings have been heeded by the medical profession in many developed countries and under medical authority large sections of the public have made dietary changes and the per capita consumption of milk has fallen. More recently other risk factors have been found for CHD, and knowledge of their relative importance has increased. Understanding has grown over the question of versatility, optima and interactions between nutrients. Other new factors in this field include: the minor effect of DC on SC, the U-shaped effect of SC on total mortality in men with no effect in women less than 50 years of age, positive effects of other milk constituents on SC, different effects of high density C (HDL-C) and low density C (LDL-C) and of saturated, monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids (SFA, MUFA, PUFA) on CHD risk, the harmful effects of trans-FA, the meaninglessness of the P/S ratio, the medical and non-medical side effects of lowering SC and the high heritability of SC. These new recoveries have not been given the publicity accorded to the original hypotheses. It is the aim of this paper to seek a balanced review of the subject in the light of new scientific evidence. Further the broader implications of the topic for society, human development and well-being are also considered. Thus there are two main theses in this paper. One is to review the hypotheses of the relationship between cow milk and human coronary heart disease. These hypotheses are examined and their original historic deficiencies are discussed. This is followed by the new and emerging scientific evidence to support, question or refute these original hypotheses. The second major thesis in this paper deals with the impact which these hypotheses have had upon the pattern of human nutrition which are reflected in many important economic, social and other nutritional issues, all of which merit attention. It is considered inadequate to base general recommendations in the field of human health and well-being solely or mainly upon postulations about the relationship between milk and CHD without taking into account the larger and more complex issues. In addition to the general field of human health, the consequences of these hypotheses include the responses of the dairy production and processing industries. For example, if the hypotheses are reliable, tested and to become basic components of human nutrition, then the milk production industry has to reshape its system to produce a product more suited to the changes in consumption. If however, the assumptions are not substantiated permanently the such a re-tooling of milk production is futile. Milk production represents a major component in global food production and the implications of change are enormous.
   Issues to be considered include the efficiency of dairy cow in converting plant material, inedible to humans, to a human food of high nutritional value, the economic and nutritional contribution of dairy cattle production systems to beef production, the strong genetic correlations between the fat content, the protein content and the yield of milk per cow, the slowness of achieving changes in milk composition in bovine species with low reproductive rates and long generation intervals, and interactions between nutrients. Further, there are other broader issues including the incidence of other human conditions and diseases besides CHD, which can be affected by the presence or absence of milk in the diet, the genetic differences between individuals and human races, the need to address the hunger of the world's human population and further economic, social and psychological factors. Many questions need research to find sustainable breeding goals and milk production systems which are related to the reality of how milk contributes to human development and welfare. The paper concludes by considering the negative impact which the questionable hypotheses have had upon an important component of food production, namely dairy cattle farming which historically has contributed enormously to human development and welfare. The author considers there is a vacuum of knowledge here which cannot be filled simply by expertise in the medical field alone. The issue is a prime candidate for interdisciplinary research.

AB In Australia, responsibility for sustainable management of the surrounding oceans and for reconciliation with Indigenous people are currently both high on government policy agendas. This paper critically evaluates how these two related areas of policy development interact in Australia's offshore zone. 1998 saw the passage of the Native Title Amendment Act as well as the publication of a series of discussion papers outlining a framework for an emerging oceans policy. International developments at the interface between Indigenous rights and sustainable development are discussed as is the current "backlash" against demands from Indigenous groups for native title in the offshore zone. Comparisons with recent developments in Canada are highlighted. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park (GBRMP) is an ecosystem whose ecological features are recognized internationally. There is a need to evaluate the impacts of historical and contemporary changes in land use on the GBRMP. This paper quantifies pesticide inputs in the Herbert River catchment of North Queensland in the context of changes in land use over the last 100 years. We show that three major phases of rural land use and land cover change have occurred, with large areas of native vegetation converted to agricultural production. The increase in agricultural land has seen a corresponding increase in the area receiving pesticides, We present data showing application histories for organochlorine, organophosphate, phenoxy, triazine, urea, mercurial and azole group pesticides. While the fate of these pesticides in aquatic and marine systems is largely unknown, these trends pose a significant challenge for agricultural industries in complying with the principles of ecologically sustainable development (ESD).

ID FARMERS
AB Over recent decades, research has been directed to assessing the impacts of land uses on valuable natural assets, such as the Great Barrier Reef. Land managers in adjacent areas are expected to adopt practices to minimize any adverse affects on downstream environments. Conversely, researchers are being pressed to provide answers to the problems. In response, researchers and environmental managers are bombarding land managers with information regarding the potential environmental implications of their practices. Is this an effective mode to achieve on-ground change?
   Collaboration between all groups - research, industry and extension - may be more effective in developing and implementing practical solutions to these more complex issues, A change from the research and extension models currently used may be needed to achieve positive resource management outcomes.
   Research, development and extension initiatives underway in the Australian sugar industry to improve farm practice and reduce the potential for adverse impacts on downstream environments are discussed. Case studies provide some insights into how science and extension skills work best together and how an industry group can respond to a community concern. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

ID MANAGEMENT
AB In the Philippines, coral reef fisheries provide livelihood for more than a million small-scale fishers who contribute almost US$ 1 billion annually to the country's economy. The rapidly growing population needs increasing amounts of fish and other marine organisms. However, overfishing, destructive fishing methods and sedimentation have damaged or destroyed many reef areas. Fish catches have fallen well below the sustainable levels of healthy reefs. The economic losses to the coastal fishing population are considerable. Various programmes have and are trying to counter coral reef decline by establishing sustainable management regimes. The economic benefits of such programmes appear to exceed their investment costs. As an example, the start-up and maintenance costs of a successful island marine reserve project have been compared to the losses caused by reef destruction and the gains from reef management. The results clearly show that the economic benefits from a managed reef area due to higher catches and revenue from small-scale tourism far exceed costs. Coral reefs are also a major attraction for an increasing number of local and international tourists. In addition to providing income for the tourism industry, these reef visitors are often willing to contribute to the costs for reef management. The annual willingness-to-pay assessed in three popular diving destinations are significant. An estimated US$ 300 000 could be collected annually as entrance fees or donations in Mabini, Batangas alone. It is estimated that the 27 000 km(2) of reef in their degraded condition still contribute at least US$ 1.35 billion annually to the economy. Reef management involving local fishing communities, local governments and other concerned organizations is a cost-effective way to alleviate the pressure on the numerous threatened coral reefs. In addition, economic valuation and cost-benefit analysis can pro,ide essential information to support more investment in reef conservation. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Considering the car as a theme of urban history, the author tries to assess the impact of the automobile on the evolution of Paris and its suburbs during the 20th century, especially through the new equipments of the streets. Refusing the traditional interpretation of the classical historiography, which only focused on the conflict, this text aims to demonstrate the wide and sustainable acceptance of the automobile in the metropolitan society. Coping with the increase of general mobility and the development of an uniform urban landscape, the automobile became a competitive mode. As far as the history of representations is concerned, the massification of the automobile hid the social question of its effective democratisation in the allday life. Old and recent protests against car system through citizens' associations are not ignored but the perspective is reordering in a much significative way of integration.

AB Acquisition reform initiatives changed the way we buy logistics are bought Structured military standards and regulations were replaced with performance specifications to enable determination up front of the best logistics resources for a system as a function of the systems engineering process. ne emphasis is on planning the acquisition to know "what, how, when, where, and why" before the contract is written. The need is to incorporate "guidance" in the contract to eliminate future supportability and sustainability issues and problems. The goal is to reduce redundancies in deliverables, use and enhance what is available, and to be flexible and innovative in meeting logistics requirements.

DE European Union; biotechnology; genetically modified (GM) crops; risk;
   environmental protection; precautionary approach; sustainable
   agriculture
AB In the risk debate over genetically modified (GM) crops, their status as "environmentally-friendly products" has been controversial The 1990 precautionary legislation of the European Union was designed to anticipate potential harm from GMOs in advance. Yet the acceptability of harm - or even its definition - has been contentious in evaluating commercial products. The legislation has been interpreted in ways which implicitly link concepts of precaution and "sustainable development".
   In the mid-1990s risk regulation, the European Union framed "risk" within a commitment to intensive agriculture. Its familiar hazards were accepted as a normal baseline for evaluating the effects of CM crops. The regulatory procedure regarded choices of crop protection measures as irrelevant or interchangeable, and therefore regarded some future options as dispensible, regardless of whether they would be environmentally preferable. Al least implicitly, safety claims presupposed environmental advantages of GM crops in reducing agrochemical usage.
   That risk-framing came under challenge from widespread protest and expert disagreements. In response, some governments applied more precautionary measures. They broadened the definition of the "adverse effects" which must be avoided, devised market-stage precautions for such effects, and increased the burden of evidence for demonstrating safely. Soon the EU-wide procedure began to formalize such approaches.
   In the contested definitions of relevant harm, there are deeper issues about the sort of environment which should be protected, sustained or created. Thus GM crops have become a test case for environmental norms, within a broader debate about how to construct a sustainable agriculture.

AB The Canadian Swift Fox Reintroduction Programme lasted from 1972 to 1997. From 1983 to 1997, a total of 841 captive-raised swift foxes and 91 translocated swift foxes were released in the Canadian Prairies. In South Central Saskatchewan, 406 captive-raised animals and 14 translocated animals were released from 1990 to 1997. This area was used to develop new release methods (in particular, portable protective shelters (PPS)) and saw the co-operation of a nongovernmental organization (NGO) (Cochrane Ecological Institute (CEI)) with two levels of government (Heritage Canada (Grasslands National Park) and the Government of Saskatchewan). A 1996-97 survey of swift foxes in South Central Saskatchewan estimated the population to be 87 animals. No attempt has been made to establish if this population level is sustainable.

AB Shoals of four golden shiners, Notemigonus crysoleucas, were fed daily at a fixed time, which could be the beginning, middle, or end of a 12-h artificial day, or beginning, middle, or end of a 12-h artificial night, depending on the shoal. Almost all shoals showed food-anticipatory activity (FAA), that is, a gradual increase in locomotor activity near the feeder, starting on average 4.5 h before mealtime. FAA started before the time of lights-on or lights-off even in shoals that were fed 1 h after these times. Increases in activity near the feeder generally did not appear at times unrelated to feeding, except for some shoals that were fed around the time of either lights-on or lights-off and that showed high activity at both of those times simultaneously. When food was withheld but the light-dark cycle was preserved, FAA persisted at the old clock time in 78% of the shoals. When the light-dark cycle was eliminated (fish placed in constant darkness), with or without a concurrent removal of the scheduled feeding, FAA persisted at the old clock time in only 22% of the shoals. These results can be explained by a model whereby the animals possess a circadian oscillator that is entrained by the light-dark cycle, with only weak potential for self-sustainability, and where a representation of the normal phase of feeding can be stored in memory. The possibility that FAA was generated by a food-entrainable oscillator can only be reconciled with the data by postulating that this oscillator is normally linked to a light-entrainable oscillator, and that the damping out of the Light-entrained oscillator disrupts the action of the food-entrainable one.

DT Article
DE sustainability; engineering education; accreditation
AB This paper begins by reviewing representations of sustainability, and suggesting a revised concentric model which places techno-centric (micro economic and micro thermodynamic) concerns at the core, limited by socio-centric (macro economic) concerns, which in turn are ultimately limited by eco-centric (macro thermodynamic) concerns. This new model has important consequences for how the context and impact of engineering practice might be viewed, and therefore what engineering education priorities ought to be. Accepting this new model requires a paradigm change in engineering education: sustainability cannot be presented as an add-on in engineering curricula. The new model dictates that sustainability is presented as a way of thinking, integrated throughout the course. Accreditation processes can facilitate or stifle the use of models such as that proposed in this paper because they are important drivers for course content and delivery in professional degrees such as engineering. Recently, there have been significant changes in engineering accreditation practices in Australia and North America. A critique of current accreditation documentation shows that UK-based chemical engineering processes lag Australian and North American institutional reforms for their capacity to promote sustainability as an overarching theme.

ID LIFE-CYCLE ASSESSMENT
AB Despite numerous actions worldwide which call for adoption of more sustainable strategies, relatively little has been done on a practical level so far on the pretext that the issue is too complex and not fully understood. This paper follows the argument that it is important that today's decision-makers address the issue of sustainability, however imperfectly, as ignoring it may only exacerbate the problem for future generations. In particular, the paper concentrates on measuring the level of sustainability of industry with the aim of further informing the debate in this area. It proposes a general framework with a relatively simple, yet comprehensive set of indicators for identification of more sustainable practices for industry. The indicators cover the three aspects of sustainability-environmental, economic and social-and among others, include environmental impacts, financial and ethical indicators. The framework is applicable across industry; however, more specific indicators for different sectors have to be defined separately, on a case-by-case basis. It allows a modular approach for gradual incorporation of the framework into the organizational structure. The life cycle approach ensures that the most important stages in the life cycle and their impacts are identified and targeted for improvements. The framework also provides a link between micro- and macro-aspects of sustainable development through appropriate indicators. Thus, it serves as a tool which can assist companies in assessing their performance with regard to goals and objectives embedded in the idea of sustainable development.

AB The theme of this paper is that there are lessons to be learned for the promotion of sustainable development from experience gained in the application of risk control concepts to health and safety at work. The starting point was the enactment of the Health and Safety at Work etc Act of 1974. The fundamental change introduced by the Act was to place primary responsibility for risk control with those who create the risks. It promoted the development of improvements through an informed dialogue between the regulator and the regulated. Such a dialogue is essential where uncertainties prevail so that professional judgements are necessary as to the level of risk. Furthermore, a wider consultation is necessary where it is felt that the choice of control option needs to reflect stakeholder values. These features are evidently applicable also to decision-making on sustainable development. This paper reviews the developments in arrangements for risk control and expands on their relevance to promoting the concept of sustainable development.

ID RISK COMMUNICATION; CREDIBILITY; PERCEPTION
AB At the dawn of the 21st century, industry, not least the chemical industry, faces new challenges in terms of its communication with the public. Sustainability emphasizes a need for a new relationship between the engineer and society. This paper discusses the basis of this new relationship in terms of the changing expectations of the public regarding opportunities to be involved in decision-making, increasing personal access to information with the development of information technology, and the declining basis of trust in industry and decision-makers. The paper reviews the new processes of public participation which stress the provision of greater opportunities for debate and dialogue. it considers how the industry may utilize sustainable communication, and the implications not least in terms of expertise and the training of engineers.

ID INCINERATION
AB Integrated Waste Management is one of the holistic approaches to environmental and resource management which are emerging from applying the concept of sustainable development. Assessment of waste management options requires application of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). This paper summarizes the methodology for applying LCA to Integrated Waste Management of Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) developed for and now used by the UK Environment Agency, including recent developments in international fora. Particular attention is devoted to system definition leading to rational and clear compilation of the Life Cycle Inventory, with appropriate 'credit' for recovering materials and/or energy from the waste. LCA of waste management is best seen as a way of structuring information to help decision processes.

AB Energy sources of various kinds heat and power human development, but also put at risk the quality and longer-term viability of the biosphere as a result of unwanted, 'second order' effects. These side effects give rise to potential environmental hazards on a local, regional and global scale. Consequently balancing economic and social development with environmental protection is at the heart of the notion of sustainable development as set out in the London Communique; the 1997 declaration by 18 chemical engineering societies from around the world aimed at harnessing their skills to improve the quality of life. In this context, the principles and practice of sustainability are examined as they apply to the energy sector. Conflicts between the moves towards energy market liberalization and the needs of sustainable development are outlined in the light of recent experience in the United Kingdom. The likely options for a sustainable energy strategy cue described, as well as some of the challenges that such approaches would pose for the engineering profession.

TI Matching people and information resources: authentication, authorisation
   and access management and experiences at Macquarie University, Sydney
SO PROGRAM-ELECTRONIC LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article
AB New horizons are beginning to emerge in terms of matching people and information resources in a networked service environment. Librarians, publishers, subscription agents, database hosts and information service aggregators are now actively engaged in rethinking information landscapes, in harnessing Internet technologies, and in finding ways to link institutional legacy systems to the web technologies in a manner that will appear transparent to the user. There is, as yet, no coherent view of the new service models and this paper attempts to foreshadow a conceptual framework on which to build sustainable service models and technical infrastructure. In doing so, particular attention is paid to the key issues of authentication, authorisation and access management which are basic building blocks for the creation of a secure and efficient networked information service environment. The experiences gained at Macquarie University with projects such as LIDDAS and PRIDE have helped in the development of the ideas presented in this paper.

TI The UK landfill tax: Financial implications for local authorities
SO PUBLIC MONEY & MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB Local authorities in the UK are responsible for waste management. Since the introduction of the landfill tax in 1996, the costs of disposing of municipal solid waste in landfill has increased markedly. The money collected is being paid to central government, through Customs and Excise. Some remission of landfill tax money can be claimed by commercial organizations to develop sustainable waste management, but local authorities, which also have an important role in this, cannot do so. The authors explain why the hypothecation of landfill tax revenue would be helpful and why local authorities need additional funds to develop sustainable waste management projects.

LA English
DT Article
DE integrated rural development; sectoral policies; differentiated rural
   space; appraisal methodology
ID SUSTAINABILITY; SPACES
AB This paper reports on the development of a methodology for assessing how sectoral policies work to progress wider rural development objectives. Taking Scotland as a case study, the methodology emerges out of an in-depth analysis of all relevant sectoral policies affecting rural Scotland, and the development of a four-stage method which applies a series of parameters to policy sectors and their specific Instruments. This provides a basis for focusing policy debates, and potentially future policy developments, around key trade-offs, gaps and contradictions in policy delivery, and the relative policy sensitivities to differences in rural conditions. Finally, the dynamic utility of the method is assessed. It is argued that with the confluence of both the questioning of rural development objectives (e.g. discourses on integrated rural development), and the devolution process in the UK, it is important to develop more effective and multi-dimensional means of policy evaluation. This is necessary to facilitate the direction and delivery of more integrated and sustainable rural development policy.

DT Article
DE material flow analysis; MFA; paper flow; wood flow; final consumption;
   end use calculations; statistical analysis
AB Current production structures require large amounts of primary materials and are not likely to be sustained without large implications for the environment. A good understanding of societal metabolism is likely to contribute to more sustainable production and consumption. Material flow analysis (MFA) intends to support this understanding by providing insight in material flows. In this article a new method for analyzing materials flows, called STREAMS, is tested. The method is applied to analyze the paper and wood flow through the economic system of The Netherlands. The method is based on data available from the so-called supply and use tables; these tables are made available by Statistics Netherlands and describe the economy of a country in terms of annual supply and use of goods and services by industries and consumers. The method proves to be very useful in analyzing the paper and wood flow in The Netherlands. The method provides detailed information about the final consumption of paper and wood, even for packaging materials and product parts made out of paper and wood. Trends are visible that statistical offices collect less physical data about material flows. This will make the construction of material flow analyses like this one more difficult in the future.

AB This paper investigates the sustainability of Pareto optimal policies for the replenishment of renewable resources shared by two countries with asymmetrical wealth. It does so within a two-country neoclassical growth model with externality. In the absence of commitment, it identifies simple self-enforcing mechanisms that implement social optima for a typical international resource (clean air) and a parametrization of the model to the United States and a country five times poorer. Such mechanisms are trigger strategies involving transfers of wealth between countries and threats of economic isolation in case of defection. Necessary transfers can represent up to 2.6% of U.S. wealth. (C) 2000 Academic Press

DT Article
AB The two sites in northwestern Madagascar, where Ramanantsoa (1976) observed "sacred lemurs", were revisited in order to assess the present status of Eulemur macaco and the possible impact of human beliefs and practices on conservation. All the sacred relationships towards lemurs described in 1976 are still in practice, and very similar descriptions about the benefic (or malefic in case of non-respect) effect of the "sacred lemurs" have been quoted by our informants. A direct impact on lemur conservation, and utilisation of study sires for scientists, as suggested by G.-A. Ramanantsoa, do not appear as realistic options, considering the remote location of both sites. In contrast, a further study of religious practices concerning lemurs should be an important contribution for shaping sustainable development programmes involving local populations.

AB Lands that have become unusable because of contamination with long-lived artificial radionuclides require special measures aimed at their monitoring and rehabilitation. In such areas, specific processes in the biota are associated with the direct effect of ionizing radiation on some species, secondary changes depending on the ecology of organisms trophically connected with these species, and side effects explained by the regime of isolation established in radiation reserves. The dynamics of floras and faunas in radiation reserves are determined by successional changes in plant communities, migration of radionuclides, and the protective status of these territories.

AB This' paper deals with an approach to the integration of science (with technology and economics), ethics (with religion and mysticism), the arts (aesthetics) and Nature, in order to establish a world-view based on holistic, evolutionary ethics that could help with problem solving. The author suggests that this integration is possible with the aid of "Nature's wisdom" which is mirrored in the macroscopic pattern of the ecosphere. The corresponding eco-principles I represent the basis for unifying soft and hard sciences resulting in "deep sciences". Deduction and induction 2 will remain the methodology for deep sciences and will include conventional experiments and aesthetic and sentient e.upel-iences. Perception becomes the decisive factor with the senses as operators for the building of consciousness through the subconscious. In this paper; an attempt at integrating the concepts of the "true", the "right" and the "beautiful" with the aid of Nature's wisdom is explained in more detail along with consequences.

TI Rolling back the state and physical development planning: The case of
   Barbados
SO SINGAPORE JOURNAL OF TROPICAL GEOGRAPHY
LA English
DT Article
ID POLITICS
AB The focus of this paper is the recent preparation of the Third National Physical Development Plan for Barbados. Interestingly, this blueprint for the future development of the country was prepared by Canadian consultants, under the auspices of Inter-American Development Bank funding, and thereby ostensibly represents the rolling back of the State in the context of physical development planning. The paper briefly examines the origins of town and country planning in Barbados and the wider Caribbean before critiquing the Third Plan produced in 1998. Emphasis is placed on salient issues such as operationalising sustainable development, the involvement of local stakeholders, the role of Environmental Impact Assessments (EIA) in the planning process, and the production of Community Plans. Throughout, it is shown that whilst the State appears to have been "rolled back", government has retained its strong-hold over the course of physical development planning, principally by "tactics" which have served to minimise the degree to which members of the public and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) have been able to participate.

AB In this paper I give an account of the major welfare concepts and social reporting concepts of the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s. In conclusion I discuss possibilities and limits of social reporting today. Quality of life and qualitative growth were the welfare programs of the 1970s. The next decade saw a trend to individualization, subjective well-being and plurality of life styles. In the last decade the quality of society once more came into the forefront in concepts like sustainable development, human development and social capital. From the far-reaching program of the "social indicators movement" social reports are the most visible results in many countries whereas ambitious plans like national goals accounting failed. In the 1980s we watched a kind of "dissolution by diffusion" and in the 1990s a revival in several fields. Overall, the monitoring and enlightenment function still is the most important contribution of social reporting but today on a higher level of data, methods and international comparisons.

TI Resource, arcadia, lifeworld. Nature concepts in environmental sociology
SO SOCIOLOGIA RURALIS
LA English
DT Article
AB In environmental sociology three strands of nature conceptualization can be distinguished: the resource, the 'Arcadian' and the constructionist approach. In the resource approach, the instrumental values of nature as a sustenance base are central, and social theory focuses on the way society can be geared to the conditions of sustainability as they are determined by natural science. In the 'Arcadian' approach, non-instrumental, aesthetic and ethical values are central, and social theory focuses primarily on the defense of these values. In the constructionist approach the values of nature, whether instrumental or non-instrumental, are investigated and criticized as social constructions. The article offers a tentative framework for bridging the gap between constructionism and the other nature approaches. As far as noninstrumental nature valuation is concerned, this framework puts an emphasis on lifeworld experiences of nature.

ID ENTITLEMENTS; INSTITUTIONS; DYNAMICS
AB Despite economic progress made in quite a number of countries in the former 'Third World', between 20% to 50% of the world population is still excluded from this progress. By taking sustainable livelihood as a point of departure and by paying attention to actor-structure interactions, this paper conceptualizes these processes of social inclusion and exclusion. Livelihood is represented as a whole of dynamic interactions between actors and five vital capitals i.e. human, natural, physical, financial and social capital. These vital capitals are embedded in a social, economic, political and ecological structure. Interaction between actors and structure occurs via access and agency and results in processing of capitals to build livelihood. Livelihood is sustainable if it is capable of adequately satisfying self-defined needs and securing people against shocks and stresses put on capitals by structural factors. Livelihood strategies develop in arenas of conflicting or co-operating actors. Because livelihood strategies are multiple, individuals may belong to different interest groups and therefore social inclusion and exclusion is never rigid. Globalization is interpreted as localization, meaning a dose association between homogenization and diversity or between the global and the local. Diversity it is not limited to socio-cultural domains but observed in economic and political domains too. Globalization-localization has important consequences for livelihood. The importance of the international and the local level;will increase to the detriment of the national level. On the one hand, livelihood will become increasingly world wide and therefore multi-local. The different levels of scale in vital capitals and in structure come closer to each other and perhaps will even fuse. The arena will become increasingly global and livelihood strategies will become more homogenous. On the other hand, certain local characteristics of the arena remain or will even become more marked, and consequently livelihood strategies will need to become more specific too. Nevertheless, it is doubtful whether social exclusion will become a thing of the past Therefore, global governance should have an important role in promoting sustainability of livelihoods. Global governance is explained as a global co-ordination by supra-regional and international governmental institutions of national governments balanced by an emerging international 'civil society'. Both have a task in the regulation of global markets and development co-operation will have to develop towards a global social security system. As a result, it is concluded that research on sustainable livelihood will increasingly have to become multi-dimensional, multi-local and reciprocal.

AB Recurrent themes in agrifood literature examine the shifting relationships between globalization, regulation and locality. Drawing on lessons from New Zealand's pipfruit sector and the activities of the rural lobby group United Fruit, this paper evaluates the relative success of local contestation of the terms of neoliberalism and globalization. Arguments are made for reconceptualizing rural phenomena as inexorably linked to wider socio-economic processes of transformation in New Zealand and elsewhere.

SO SOIL SCIENCE SOCIETY OF AMERICA JOURNAL

DT Article
ID TILLAGE; SEQUENCES; RESIDUE
AB Sustainability is influenced in many production systems by the variation of soil organic C (SOC) content and dynamics, and crop rotations. We hypothesized that arable layer SOC under conventional tillage can be managed through the amount of residue C (RC) returned to the soil as affected by tillage and fertilization. Soil organic C dynamics of a complex of Typic Argiudoll and Petrocalcic Paleudoll soils under conventional tillage between 1984 and 1995 at Balcarce, Argentina was studied for 16 crop sequences. Crops included were spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.], sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.), and corn (Zea mays L.). Eleven years of conventional tillage decreased SOC 4.1 to 8.8 g kg(-1) without supplemental N and 2.8 to 7.2 g kg(-1) when N fertilizer was applied. Soil organic C loss increased when soybean (1.2 Mg RC ha(-1) yr(-1)) was present in the sequence and decreased when corn (3.0 Mg RC ha(-1) yr(-1)) was present. The amount of RC returned by the sequences correlated with SOC in 1995 (r = 0.84, P < 0.01) and with SOC at equilibrium (r = 0.76, P < 0.01), but the sequences with two summer crops (soybean, sunflower, or corn) every 3 yr showed lower SOC in 1995 (28.9-33.8 g kg(-1)) and at equilibrium (24.0-34.4 g kg(-1)) than sequences with none or one summer crop (29.7-35.0 g kg(-1) either in 1995 or at equilibrium) for the same range of RC (1.4-2.6 Mg RC ha(-1) yr(-1)). The difference between sequences in the relationship between RC and SOC were attributed to tillage timing. Under conventional tillage, arable layer SOC can be managed through the selection of the crops in the rotation and N fertilization, but the timing and intensity of tillage have to be taken into account.

AB The problems of developing countries are well documented and they appear to be growing in magnitude. Although science and technology (S&T) offers a glimmer of hope in dealing with problems of developing countries, policy formulation and implementation have not yielded the desired results. The reasons advanced for the failure of S&T to aid in national development tend to be fragmented and are usually based on the mechanistic worldview. This tends to perpetuate mistakes in policy formulation and implementation. A systemic framework is thus advanced in this paper to enable us to understand the problems encountered in S&T policy formulation. It is hoped that the framework will enable us to start trying to solve the right problem rather than the wrong problems advanced by mechanistic thinkers. The systemic framework advances the following set of problems as critical: inappropriate norms of a nation, inappropriate worldview, and human behavioural constraints in managing complexity. These problems manifest themselves as Kenneth Boulding's (1966) pathologies of intellectual productivity - spurious saliency, unproductive emulation, and cultural lag - resulting in ineffective S&T policy.

AB Organizations have become the most powerful institutions in contemporary society; we no longer have 'organizations in society' brit rather 'a society of organizations'. This implies critical examination of their role until now. Three movements-developed to address different concerns-are indicating a trend rewards this examination: total quality, management, sustainability and accountability. Taken together, an underlying 'quest for quality' becomes visible towards what is herein called 'modern quality management'.

TI Women, travel and the idea of 'sustainable transport'
SO TRANSPORT REVIEWS
LA English
DT Article
ID GENDER; PATTERNS
AB Women form an increasingly large proportion of both the populations of the US and of European countries. This, together with the changing role of women in modern society, has important potential implications for transport policy. Looked at from the micro level, women have different travel patterns from men, reflecting factors such as lower labour force participation, lower income levels, their traditional role in the family, the decision-making structure within households, the current age distribution and physical vulnerability. The situation is changing and this will have implications on transport demands. The female population is also, on average, getting older. Traditional travel modelling spends much time on modal attributes, such as speed and cost, but for many women this may not be the central issue. Security is often important. Standard traffic models only implicitly allow for gender (e.g. travel time is valued different from work and non-work trips). With the increased complexity of life styles and the growth in multi-purpose trips by women, the conventional approach to travel time valuation may need to be rethought. This paper looks at some of the emerging issues regarding women and travel and puts them in the context of the emerging ideas concerning sustainable transport.

AB The increasing trend of charging for aircraft noise nuisance to encourage the sustainable development of the air transport industry has resulted in a need to evaluate the real social costs of such externalities for the formulation of effective charge mechanisms. After comparing the current charge mechanisms at world airports as well as reviewing existing externality measurements, mathematical models are developed to calculate the noise social cost in monetary terms, and noise charge mechanisms are subsequently established. The hedonic price method is applied to calculate the annual social cost of aircraft noise during the landing and take-off stages of the flight. This is done by estimating the implicit costs of aircraft noise imposed through a decline in property values in the vicinity of the airport. The empirical results, using Amsterdam Airport Schiphol as the case study, show that the current noise charge level imposed by the Dutch Government is lower than the actual noise social cost resulting from aircraft movements. Several noise charge mechanism scenarios are derived according to the modelling results, as well as the environmental objectives of the airport related authorities. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

ID USE EFFICIENCY; SOUTH-AFRICA; FREE STATE; VELD; PRODUCTIVITY
AB The impact of different botanical composition classes;, viz. poor, moderate and good. on soil-water balance, water-use efficiency (WUE: crude protein produced per unit of evapotranspiration), productivity and soil temperature were determined in a semi-arid grassland during four growing seasons(1995/96 to 1998/99), In addition, the same measurements were also made on an undisturbed bare soil surface and soil cultivated twice per annuum, only for the last four years. Evapotranspiration was determined by quantifying the soil-water balance equation with the aid of runoff plots and soil- water content measurements. Crude protein content calculated front N-content (Kjeldahl-method) of the leaves, stems and seed was determined. Though the percentage crude protein content of grassland in good condition was generally lower (P<0.01) than that of grassland in poor condition, crude protein production was still significantly (P<0.01) higher when expressed as total quantity of above-ground phytomass produced. Water-use efficiency declined significantly (P<0.01) with grassland degradation. Grassland in good condition averaged a WUE of 0.29 kg crude protein.ha(-1).mm(-1) during four growing seasons. Higher surface runoff occurring in grassland in poor condition due to less vegetation cover, caused soil-water content to be much lower than that of grassland in good condition. Soil-water storage increased by 31% due to cultivation. Veld degradation resulted in soil temperature increasing up To 8.5 degrees C at a depth of 50 mm during December. An important requirement for sustainable grassland production in semi-arid climates, is effective soil-water management, which is only possible when the veld is in good condition.

AB Nearly optimal solutions of linear programming models provide useful information when some of the relevant objectives and constraints are not explicitized in the models. This paper presents a three steps framework to study nearly optimal solutions of linear programming models developed for land use exploration. The first step is to define low dimensional vectors called 'aspects' to summarize the solutions. The second step is to generate a group of optimal and of nearly optimal solutions. Three methods are proposed for generating nearly optimal solutions. Method i proceeds by minimization of sums of decision variables that are non-zero in the optimal solution and in previously generated nearly optimal solutions. Method ii proceeds by maximization of sums of randomly selected decision variables. Method iii is targeted at searching nearly optimal solutions with very different values for the aspects. Finally, the third step of the framework is to present graphically the values of the aspects of the generated solutions. The framework is illustrated with a case study in which a linear programming model developed for land use exploration at the European level is presented. First, an optimal solution is calculated with the model by minimizing nitrogen loss with constraints on area, water use, product balances, and manure balances. Then, 52 nearly optimal solutions are generated by using methods i, ii, and iii with a deviation tolerance of 5% from the optimal Value of nitrogen loss. Each solution is summarized by three different aspects that represent the allocations of the agricultural area among two regions, among five types of crop rotation, and among five production orientations respectively. Graphical presentation of these aspects and principal component analysis show that nearly optimal solutions can be very different from the optimal solution in terms of land use allocations. For example, the agricultural area allocated to the north of the European Community varies from 10.9 to 50.2 x 10(6) ha among the 52 generated nearly optimal solutions, whereas this area is equal to 26.5 x 10(6) ha in the optimal solution. The comparison of methods i, ii, and iii shows that the solutions generated with method iii are quite more contrasted than the solutions generated with methods i and ii. The case study presented in this paper illustrates how our methodological framework can be used to allow a stakeholder to select a satisfactory solution according to issues that cannot be quantified in a model.

AB Canadian research contributions to quantity, quality and ecology of surface waters during 1995-1998 (182 items) are summarized under six headings: understanding the pristine hydrological system (49); climate variability and hydrological systems (23); streamflow data, modelling and simulation (23); regional, international and flood hydrology (31); land use effects on the hydrological system (35); and sustainability of hydrological systems (21). The most encouraging developments have occurred in increased understanding of the inter-connectedness of components of the hydrological cycle and, especially, of the links between biosphere and hydrosphere. Canadian hydrologists also have played a significant role in global environmental change research and in applied development research. The most discouraging development has been the collapse of the national water monitoring programme and the decay of integrated experimental research areas. The overall impression is that hydrology in Canada is a maturing discipline; the physical, chemical and biological components are becoming less isolated; and anthropogenic impacts on surface water are more frequently considered to fall within the purview of hydrological science. The role of hydrology in relation to sustainability is increasingly actively debated. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Approximately 42% of Canada is covered by forests, which in turn can be subdivided into nine distinct forest ecozones. Many forested ecozones are located in northern Canada, where cold winters and cool summers provide forest environments that are less well-understood that those in more temperate locations. A number of major developments in recent years have stressed the need for enhanced understanding of hydrological processes in these forest landscapes. These include an increased emphasis on sustainable forest management in Canada as well as major scientific initiatives (e.g. BOREAS) examining water, carbon and energy fluxes in forest ecosystems, with a particular focus on boreal and subarctic forests. Recent progress in our understanding of forest hydrology across Canada is reviewed. Studies of hydrological processes across the spectrum of forest ecozones are highlighted, as well as work on hydrological responses to forest disturbance and recovery. Links between studies of hydrological processes in Canada's forests and other fields of research are examined, with particular attention paid to ongoing efforts to model hydrological impacts and interactions with the climate, biogeochemistry, geomorphology and ecology of forested landscapes.

TI Predicting monthly and seasonal rainfall, onset and cessation of the
   rainy season in West Africa using only surface data
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY

   and amounts
ID THUNDERSTORMS; NIGERIA
AB New empirical long-range schemes for the prediction of dates of onset and cessation and of the monthly and annual amounts of rainfall are developed for Kano, in the West African Sahel, using only surface synoptic data. They are based on variations in equivalent potential temperature, theta(e), which occur as a result of the seasonal, monthly and daily variations of moisture in the summer monsoon flow over West Africa. Agricultural activities may begin about 72 days after the day the anomalies of theta(e) (i.e. theta') first become positive for at least 15 days, essentially signifying the beginning of adequate moisture supply associated with a well established monsoon flow.
   The new schemes ensure that both the cessation date and the annual amount of rainfall can be predicted prior to the onset of the rains, thus providing, in conjunction with the onset date, very important and useful information for reliable and effective planning of agricultural and water resource activities. Performance tests using an 11-year independent data set indicate that the schemes possess reliable skill.
   Because the weather over Nigeria is very typical of the entire West African region, being affected by the same wind regime and weather phenomena, these prediction schemes will provide tremendous assistance for enhanced and sustainable agriculture, as well as for efficient water resources management, if extended to the whole area. Furthermore, the methods have the important advantage that, bearing in mind the fact that the majority of West African countries have very sparse, if indeed, any upper-air data, the surface synoptic data needed for their use are readily available in all of the countries.

TI Optimising product recycling chains by control theory
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION ECONOMICS

DT Article
DE recycling; control theory; product chain; sustainability; optimisation
AB In this paper, a modelling method is described for production chains including recycling. It consists of elementary models of standard production operations, connected by market modules. The models are analysed using methods from control theory. These methods allow us to investigate essential properties of the chain concerning its dynamical behaviour, particularly with respect to stability and controllability. These properties are prerequisites for effective chain management, as in the evaluation of recycling policy. A case study on paper recycling was carried out to demonstrate the applicability of this method to practice. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Aims. To observe the natural history of traumatised war veterans.
   Methods. A clinical audit of 147 World War II psychiatric war pensioners.
   Results. Of these veterans only 37% have a clinically sustainable DSM diagnosis of chronic post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Trauma-related and somatic symptoms of severity attributable to active war service, were volunteered by 48%. These symptoms were insufficient to fulfil DSM diagnosis criteria for PTSD.
   Conclusions. PTSD is a robust clinical entity, yet many victims of trauma appear to suffer chronic sub-syndromal PTSD. The clinical spectrum of trauma response is more variable than is currently diagnostically acceptable by DSM criteria.

AB The strategies proposed for delaying the development of resistance to the Bacillus thuringiensis toxins produced by transgenic maize require high levels of gene flow between individuals feeding on transgenic and refuge plants. The European corn borer Ostrinia nubilalis (Hubner) may be found on several host plants, which may act as natural refuges. The genetic variability of samples collected on sagebrush (Artemisia sp.), hop (Humulus lupulus L.) and maize (Zea mays L.) was studied by comparing the allozyme frequencies for six polymorphic loci. We found a high level of gene flow within and between samples collected on the same host plant. The level of gene flow between the sagebrush and hop insect samples appeared to be sufficiently high for these populations to be considered a single genetic panmictic unit. Conversely the samples collected on maize were genetically different from those collected on sagebrush and hop. Three of the six loci considered displayed greater between-host-plant than within-host-plant differentiation in comparisons of the group of samples collected on sagebrush or hop with the group of samples collected on maize. This indicates that either there is genetic isolation of the insects feeding on maize or that there is host-plant divergent selection at these three loci or at linked loci. These results have important implications for the potential sustainability of transgenic insecticidal maize.

ID SOL-GEL COMPOSITES; AEROGELS; GLASSES; DENSITY
AB Drying-step in sol-gel processing was bypassed by exchanging alcoholic solvent in forsterite alcogel directly with MMA. By in-situ polymerization of the MMA organic-inorganic nano-composite of PMMA-forsterite tvas prepared. As porous nature of inorganic networks in the gel was preserved and fixated in the composite, spherical morphology of PMMA was resulted. The PMMA-forsterite composite was optically transparent, machinable, mechanically sustainable, and thermally more stable than pristine PMMA. When doped with Eu+3 inorganic moiety in the composite provided site environment that is very different from that in pristine PMMA. Prominent D-5(0) --> F-7(0) transition at 578 nm, broken degeneracy in D-5(0) --> F-7(1) and D-5(0) --> F-7(2) transitions suggested that Eu+3 was exclusively doped in the inorganic moiety of the composite, which had lower symmetry than the organic counterpart.

ID MANUFACTURING SYSTEMS
AB Global competitive priorities are undergoing a marked shift from productivity and quality to flexibility and agility. This has resulted in a growing number of manufacturing companies realizing the importance of building customization capabilities into their production systems. Flexible assembly systems (FASs), consisting of a variety of processors such as assembly, inspection, packaging, and interactive operator consoles, provide a significant opportunity for improving product flexibility and, thereby, gaining sustainable competitive advantage. This paper formulates a decision problem for designing FASs and proves it to be NP-complete. A heuristic, called the pick and rule (PAR) heuristic, is presented to minimize the total number of processors, while determining the number of processors of each type, the sequence of the processors, and the operations to be performed at each processor. A lower bound for the minimum number of processor is derived, and used to assess the effectiveness of the PAR heuristic. An algorithm to compute this bound is also presented. An exact branch and bound algorithm is formulated to find optimal solutions and to provide guidance on the source of the gap between the PAR heuristic and the lower bound results. Computational results with the PAR heuristic, the lower bound algorithm, and the branch and bound algorithm are reported. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The worldwide steadily increasing steel demand will even in future be met by running the two main production routes. The BOF route starting from the ore reducing blast furnace and the electric are furnace technology with its capability of recycling steel scrap complement each other most favourably. Profitability and market demands predominating at the individual location determine the respective ratio. Above all, the ideal process technological possibilities of scrap recycling by using primary energy, the processing of DRI and the relatively low investment and energy costs are advantages of the EAF process.
   Further distribution of EAF technology is limited by both availability and quality of steel scrap. Future will show whether and to what extent these limits can be overcome by employing DRI. As regards sustainable development and the included demands for an environmentally friendly steel production, the drastically lower CO2-emmision of the EAF and its contribution to the balance of steel industry's CO2-emissions represent another convincing advantage. All these potentials, benefits and the incorporated chances have to be strengthened by new developments and improvements.

AB A 3.3 m(2) experimental system for the intensive land-based culture of abalone, seaweed and fish was established using an integrated design. The goals were to achieve nutrient recycling, reduced water use, reduced nutrient discharge and high yields. Effluents from Japanese abalone (Haliotis discus hannai) culture tanks drained into a pellet-fed fish (Sparus aurata) culture tank. The fish effluent drained into macroalgal (Ulva lactuca or Gracilaria conferta) culture, and biofilter tanks. Algal production fed the abalone. The system was monitored to assess productivity and nitrogen partitioning over a year. The fish grew at 0.67% day(-1), yielding 28-kg m(-2) year(-1) The nutrients excreted by the fish supported high yields of U. lactuca (78-kg m(-2) year(-1)) and efficient (80%) ammonia filtration. Gracilaria functioned poorly. Ulva supported an abalone growth rate of 0.9% day(-1) and a length increase of 40-66 mu m day(-1) in juveniles, and 0.34% day(-1) and 59 mu m day(-1) in young adults. Total abalone yield was 9.4 kg year(-1). A surplus of seaweed was created in the system. Ammonia-N, as a fraction of total feed-N was reduced from 45% in the fish effluents to 10% in the post-seaweed discharge. Based on the results, a doubling of the abalone:fish yield ratio from 0.3 to 0.6 is feasible. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

ID HISTORY; GROWTH; IMPACT
AB The viability of the many civilisations of Europe has depended, to a very large extent, on an adequate supply of wood. In the Ancient World, this supply was secured through the exploitation of forest reserves, the conquest of new territories and, when these opportunities no longer presented themselves, through the conservation of diminishing resources. Ultimately, civilisations collapsed because of the shortage of wood. Although some silvicultural techniques were known in the pre-Christian era, the scientific management of forests was not widely practised until the late 18th century. It is argued that the controlled exploitation of 'nature', on sustained yield principles, only became possible when men came to view the forest, not as a nuisance, an Arcadia or a pagan horror, but as a centre of wood production, a biological factory.
   The emergence of scientific forestry, however, did not put an end to the exploitation of forest resources. Unregulated felling and traditional practices such as litter raking exerted an insidious, negative influence on the fertility of the soil. The impact of human exploitation has often been underestimated by scientists, in recent decades, in particular, in the context of forest decline.
   While sustainable management, seen as sustained yield of wood supply, has been practised in forestry for centuries modern ideas of sustainability are broader in scope, embracing all the goods and services of the forest. Increasingly, forests are being managed as multifunctional ecosystems, often for amenity purposes.
   Forest ecosystem research, which developed from a range of traditional, highly focused disciplines, requires, if it is to make a meaningful contribution to forest management, long-term interdisciplinary studies. It provides the basis for ecologically intelligent management decisions and as such, is central to the development of sustainable forestry management. Central to the successful implementation of research findings is their efficient transfer from the researcher to the manager. If the research community identifies such an interchange as an important part of their duties, it will be a decisive step towards the better use of forests in Europe.
   It is only by deepening our knowledge of the past, accepting the challenge of the present and acknowledging that, as researchers, we have also a responsibility to communicate with users, that we can foster the growth in wisdom which is fundamental to the wise use of Europe's forests in the next millennium.

DE ecosystem disturbances; self regulation; corrective interventions;

AB Various socio-economic functions are ascribed to forests, based on the differentiated needs of the human population. Apart from the defined forest functions human welfare benefits from the diverse environmental effects of forests. The capacity of an ecosystem to sustain a specific function depends on the characteristics of its individual dynamics.
   Sustainable forest management concepts must take into account the: compatibility between forest function and ecosystem characteristics. Incompatibility causes either dysfunction and ecosystem degradation or the need of corrective management interventions which may exceed tolerable economic limits. A detailed understanding of the destabilising and stabilising processes intrinsic to the ecosystem is necessary, for their regulatory interactions, and their responses to exogenous disturbances and perturbations, which emerge from forest management and environmental conditions.
   The study of mechanisms involved in the dynamics of forest ecosystems and their sub-systems, the evaluation of these mechanisms in the light of forest ecosystem diversity, forest function and forest management, would help forestry to successfully cope with the obstacles arising from nature, changing environments and socio-economic forces.

AB We review the effects of human impact on biodiversity of European forests in the light of recent views on disturbances and succession in ecosystems, and discuss recent ideas on how biodiversity affects ecosystem functions such as productivity and ecosystem stability. With this as a background we discuss how to better manage European forests for both production and biodiversity. We argue that the next generation of forestry practices need to understand and mimic natural disturbance dynamics much better than the present ones. Of particular importance is the fact that most species in European forests have evolved in forests that were to a large extent influenced by large grazers, first by megaherbivores and later, in historic times, by domestic animals. We highlight several areas where new knowledge and management tools are urgently needed: (i) How do species survive and adapt to the natural disturbance regimes in different regions and forest types? (ii) How can new and imaginative forest management practices be devised that take natural disturbance regimes into account? (iii) How does forest biodiversity affect ecosystem function and stability in a changing world, in particular in the light of predicted climate changes? (iv) How are ecological processes at different levels and scales related to diversity, and how do different management practices affect biodiversity? (v) How can efficient agroforestry methods be developed to preserve biodiversity? (vi) What is the role of humans and human behaviour for sustainable management of ecosystems?

AB Our understanding of forest production and forest growth is incomplete. Present yield tables have not predicted the recent changes in boreal and temperate regions of Europe. We argue that we need to have a causal understanding built upon a mechanistic knowledge of important processes. Using a carbon/nitrogen model as a framework, important components and processes of the forest ecosystem are discussed and the new knowledge needed is identified. Present soil chemistry may not be fully relevant in describing plant/soil relationships, It has been shown that the near-root environment deviates from the conditions described by bulk chemistry. Modelling is discussed as an important tool for increased understanding and prediction.
   Sustainability of forest production is usually treated from a long-term perspective. Long-term changes can lead to deficiency or even excess of mineral nutrients, which will affect the resistance of the tree or stand to drought, frost as well as attacks of insects and pathogens. Recent ideas of tree vigour or vitality in relation to insects and pathogens are reviewed as a component for understanding production stability in short- and long-term perspectives.

AB Gaps in knowledge of current and past forest ecosystem research in the temperate zone of Europe are discussed and research priorities are defined. Since the last Ice Age the forest ecosystems of this region have undergone fundamental changes mainly caused by climatic and anthropogenic influences. Hence, today's temperate forests hardly represent the natural ecosystem development state. However, the implementation of the sustainability concept as the dominant principle of modern forestry in the early 19th century allowed to predict and maintain forest productivity in the longer run.
   Despite timber production forest management has to cover public demands such as recreation, groundwater protection, and biodiversity. But it is still unclear whether all these requirements can be fulfilled economically and in agreement with the concept of ecological sustainability. Even though the understanding of forest ecosystems has increased enormously in recent decades, this improved understanding has resulted, somewhat paradoxically, in a demand for further knowledge, both more precise in nature and broader in scope. The ongoing discussion on forest stability is based on the experience that predictions of an enhanced dieback of forests did not come true. On the contrary, the growth of many European forests has been accelerated since several decades, illustrating a fundamental lack in the understanding of the productivity of forest ecosystems.
   In conclusion, specific gaps of knowledge are identified with regard to (i) the impacts of elevated CO2 and nitrogen on the stability and resilience of forest ecosystems, (ii) the functioning of old-growth (semi-)natural forests and the development of scientifically based concepts for forest transformation, (iii) the multiple interactions between forest and adjacent management systems, (iv) the afforestation of set-aside and abandoned areas, and (v) the intensification, methodological complementation and diversification of the monitoring of forest sites belonging to the EU 'level-two-programme'.

ID MARKERS
AB Mediterranean forests art, characterised by a remarkable set of features that make them naturally and aesthetically attractive, on the one hand, but also quite fragile, on the other, therefore calling for careful strategies for their conservation and management. An exceptionally large variation of environmental conditions characterises the Mediterranean countries, where the environment can limit forest growth and succession but can also give rise, more often than it is supposed, to lush, mesic forest ecosystems, similar to those of central Europe. Moreover, Mediterranean forests contain an ample, plant and animal biological diversity, exemplified by the large number of tree species as compared to Nordic forests, and by their relatively high genetic variability due to the survival of many conifer and broadleaf species in southern European refuges, during the glacial periods. Another peculiar aspect of this region is the long-lasting manipulation of trees, forests and landscapes, since ancient times, with the diffusion all over the Mediterranean basin of such species as Pinus pinea, Cupressus sempervirens, Castanea sativa, and Quercus suber. The harsh and unpredictable climate, the difficult socio-economic conditions and the history of over-exploitation of the Mediterranean forests require that a scientifically sound conservation strategy and a locally-tailored sustainable management should be implemented. In particular, the need for identifying those silvicultural and management strategies appropriate for southern European forests should be stressed. Obviously, this consideration will have important effects on the definition of criteria for sustainability and eco-certification, Also, social issues should be considered key factors for effective forest conservation in the Mediterranean region, otherwise it will be impossible to control forest fires and landscape degradation.
   Based on these considerations a number of research priorities are discussed, with special consideration to possible impacts that global change may have on Mediterranean forest ecosystems. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB European Forest Ecosystem Research Network (EFERN), was set up in 1996 as one result of the Ministerial Conferences on the Protection of European Forests in Strasbourg 1990 and Helsinki 1993 with the aim of promoting ecological research for sustainable forest management. Three plenary meetings were held, each with a specific theme. The results of these meetings have been documented in 10 chapters in a volume with the title 'Pathways to the wise: use of forests in Europe'. The intention was also to give priorities for future forest ecosystem research. In accepting the idea that sustainability includes a multifunctional view of forests, there is a need to find ways of integrating classical forest ecosystem research with biodiversity, water quality and socio-economics. The balancing of the different interests in the forests can he done through planning. From this results also a choice of adequate management methods of the forest resources. The classical stand level in forestry requires now an additional scale - the landscape level, The aim with this paper is to present a concept which attempts to integrate the disciplines involved - ecosystem and landscape ecology and its components. Areas where research efforts are central are also mentioned. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Emerging economies are low-income, rapid-growth countries using economic liberalization as their primary engine of growth. They fall into two groups: developing countries in Asia, Latin America, Africa, and the Middle East and transition economies in the former Soviet Union and China. Private and public enterprises have had to develop unique strategies to cope with the broad scope and rapidity of economic and political change in emerging economies, This Special Research Forum on Emerging Economies examines strategy formulation and implementation by private and public enterprises in several different regional settings and from three primary theoretical. perspectives: institutional theory, transaction cost economics, and the resource-based view of the firm. In this introduction, we show how different theoretical perspectives can provide useful insights into enterprise strategies in emerging economies. We discuss the special methodological as well as empirical challenges associated with doing research in emerging economies. Finally, we briefly summarize the individual contributions of the works included in our special research forum.

   priorities for agrometeorologists
AB Current concerns with the sustainability of agroecosystems in different parts of the world have hightened the awareness for careful use of the natural resource base on which agriculture depends. For proper and efficient use of soils and plant/animal genetic material, knowledge of the role of climate is an essential precondition. Several elements of the chapters in Agenda 21, a global plan of action agreed at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED), require the attention of the agrometeorologists and these have been reviewed. Three International Conventions which have a bearing on sustainable agriculture including the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCC), the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) and the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) were negotiated and ratified since 1992. The World Food Summit Plan of Action (WFSPA), which was developed in 1996, includes several commitments to make agricultural production sustainable. Agrometeorological aspects of these three Conventions and the WFSPA were reviewed. Some of the priorities for agrometeorologists to address sustainable agriculture in the 21st Century were discussed. These include improvement and strengthening of agrometeorological networks, development of new sources of data for operational agrometeorology, improved understanding of natural climate variability, promotion and use of seasonal to inter-annual climate forecasts, establishment and/or strengthening of early warning and monitoring systems and promotion of geographical information systems and remote sensing applications and agroecological zoning for sustainable management of farming systems, forestry and livestock. Other priorities include use of improved methods, procedures and techniques for the dissemination of agrometeorological information, development of agrometeorological adaptation strategies to climate variability and climate change, mitigation of the effects of climate change, more active applications of models for phenology, yield forecasting etc.,active promotion of tactical applications such as response farming at the field level and promoting a better understanding of the interactions between climate and biological diversity. These present important challenges and great opportunities for agrometeorologists to play a proactive role in promoting sustainable development in the 21st Century. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

   benefits of information
AB This paper deals with the clients that may use agrometeorological information. The sections treat the possible identities of the clients, the nature of the information products that they may request, the products that an agrometeorological unit can provide, the manner of delivery of the product, and the evaluation of the value of the product to the client. A fair amount of agrometeorological knowledge is, or can relatively easily be made available, but far from all is used. If agrometeorological information is communicated to the right client and applied, agrometeorology can help find 'windows of opportunity' to practise sustainable, high quality agriculture more profitably, with less risks, less cost, and less environmental pollution and damage. Such an application requires a concerted and interdisciplinary approach, whether by the public service or by a commercial firm, to offer the agrometeorological product to the client. The reward may be great, because clients may persist for a very long time and useful products may have an incalculably fruitful outcome. Such is proven by the agrometeorological information for the control of potato blight (Phytophthora infestans), now supplied to potato farmers all over the world: a single agrometeorological information product, steadily perfected, and persistently used for more than a lifetime of man, having positively affected untold millions of lives.

ID RAINFALL
AB The arid zones of the world are all characterized by a large deficit of rainfall in relation to the potential evapotranspiration. Their distribution around the world is governed by the interaction of global atmospheric circulation patterns, the distribution of land and sea, and local topography. Countries that have substantial areas with arid conditions belong to very different groups in terms of resource availability, agricultural productivity, population density and wealth. Most are poorly endowed with good agricultural land. Water resources vary tremendously, both in terms of reserves and consumption. Agriculture is in most cases the main consumer of water. Most arid zone countries have high population growth, and rural population densities are generally much higher than overall population densities. They have a wide disparity in wealth. The arid zones have a surprising diversity of agroecological niches, with edaphic conditions that can deviate substantially from those of surrounding areas. These niches often have a higher biomass or agricultural productivity. At the same time they are vulnerable to natural processes such as primary salinization, wind and water erosion. Increasing pressure of human and livestock population make that these natural environmental stresses lead to accelerated degradation and depletion of soil and water resources. As they exploit the various agroecological niches, the production systems of the arid zones are equally diverse, and cover the full spectrum of land use intensification from pastoral or transhumant livestock systems to rainfed or irrigated cropping systems. These production systems show rapid change under the pressures of environmental degradation, increasing land and water shortage, and the needs of expanding populations. With the exception of irrigation management, the agrometeorological needs of the arid zones have been insufficiently addressed in the past. Perceptions of homogeneity, low agricultural potential, low population density and the logistical problems of providing maintenance and collecting data from remote stations are largely to blame for this situation. Agrometeorological research can have a positive impact on the productivity, resource-efficiency and environmental sustainability of the arid zones by supporting a better characterization of the agricultural environments. Research targeted towards data spatialization and integration of meteorological and remote sensing information will help to alleviate the handicap of sparse meteorological data networks. At the same time these networks will need to be improved through installation of automatic stations and by establishing new partnerships with land users. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

DE crop evapotranspiration methods; water use efficiency
ID EVAPOTRANSPIRATION
AB Sustainable food production will depend on the judicious use of water resources as fresh water for human consumption and agriculture is becoming increasingly scarce. To meet future food demands and growing competition for clean water, a more effective use of water in both irrigated and rainfed agriculture will be essential. Options to increase water use efficiency include the conservation of rainfall, the reduction of irrigation water losses and the adoption of cultural practices that will increase production per unit of water.
   Water use for crop production is depending on the interaction of climatic parameters that determine crop evapotranspiration and water supply from rain. The compilation, processing and analysis of meteorological information for crop water use and crop production will therefore constitute a key element in developing strategies to optimize the use of water for crop production and to introduce effective water management practices.
   In the 1970s, FAO developed practical procedures to estimate crop water requirements and yield response to water stress which have become widely accepted standards in the planning and management of irrigated and rainfed agriculture. As a follow-up to recommendations of a panel of high-level experts convened in 1990, further studies have been carried out which have led to the development of revised procedures for reference evapotranspiration and crop evapotranspiration. The new procedures and guidelines have been recently published in the FAO Irrigation and Drainage series and include the adoption of the Penman-Monteith approach as the new standard for determining reference crop evapotranspiration (ET,) calculations. Procedures have been developed to use the method also in conditions when no or limited data on humidity, radiation and wind speed are available.
   Procedures for estimating crop evapotranspiration are revised with an update of the crop coefficients that allow more accurate estimates for a wide range of crops and for various crop, soil and water management practices. Daily ET, calculations are included by separating soil evaporation and crop transpiration estimates through the dual crop coefficient.
   The use of climatic data for the development of practical criteria in planning and management of irrigated and rainfed crop production is demonstrated at the hand of some examples using the FAO computer programmes and climatic database.
   Agrometeorology needs to play a key role in the looming global water crisis. Appropriate strategies and policies need to be defined, including strengthening of national capacities in the use of climatic data for planning and management of sustainable agriculture and drought mitigation. Cooperation between FAO and WMO in this field may serve as an example of such efforts. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB An eco-compatible and sustainable development requires integrated management of all available information and the extraction of analytical evaluation on the impact of human activities. Agrometeorology can be used to contribute to further understanding of the relative importance of each environmental component, organising the field activities and optimising the use of natural resources. This is especially true today, due to the availability of new tools, as geographic information systems (GIS). which allow the management of an incredible quantity of data, as traditional digital maps, database, models etc. The advantages are manifold and highly important, especially for the fast cross-sector interactions and the production of synthetic and lucid information for decision-makers. Remote sensing provides the most important informative contribution to GIS, which furnishes basic informative layers in optimal time and space resolutions.
   This paper describes various recent applications of GLS and remote sensing in Agrometeorology, both in developed and developing countries. It illustrates the possible evolution of these systems and the expected future developments, which can be decisive for a re-launch of the role of this science in the environmental and land resource management.

AB Climate determines the general adaptation of ecosystems and land use activities at any location. Year to year recurrences of extreme climate events such as drought, flooding, hot/cold spells, etc. often have far reaching consequences in agriculture. Advance warning of such events through climate prediction can minimize various socio-economic problems which are often associated with such events. The severity of the socio-economic impacts of climate related stress varies significantly from one region to another. The impacts are generally more severe in many developing countries where technological adaptations are often very low, and where most of the agricultural systems are rain dependent.
   Socio-economic challenges of the next century will include population pressure, industrialization, environmental degradation, and anthropogenic climate change issues, among others. Thus some climate stress in this century may be able to induce far more serious socio-economic disasters in the next century. Advance warning of impending extreme climate events, especially within time scales of months to years, would provide vital information which could be used for sustainable agricultural production. Such early warning information can also form crucial components of national/regional disaster preparedness system which will help to minimise loss of life and property including damage to agricultural investments.
   This review has addressed the basic linkages between climate and agricultural systems, the current state of climate prediction science and technology, together with their potential advancements in the next century. The last part of the review highlights the challenges of optimum applications of climate information and prediction products in agricultural planning and operations in the next century. Vital to such an effort are the availability of good databases, skilled multidisciplinary human resources, co-operation between scientists and product users to improve the use of climate prediction products, and to investigate technological and natural adaptations aimed at mitigating the effects of extreme weather.

AB This paper starts with summarizing the indications for climate change as they are reviewed in the most recent WMO global climate system reviews. There are indications in the paper for increasing climate variability in certain areas. Some of the principal causes of increasing climate variability and climate change (ICV & CC) are a mixture of external and internal factors to the climate system. Of changes over the past century, increases in greenhouse gases have probably been the most important cause of climate change. Continued warming of global climate is expected to occur if atmospheric greenhouse gases keep increasing, with global climate models projecting an increase in mean temperature by 1-3 degrees C by 2100 A.D. Upon these general background trends interannual climate variability has operated. Volcanic eruptions that inject significant amounts of sulphate aerosols into the stratosphere cause a cooling of global climate in the order of 0.5 degrees C for a period of 12-24 months. The ENSO (El Nino/Southern Osciallation) is the major cause of climate variability on seasonal to interannual time scales. Since 1976 El Nino episodes of the Southern Oscillation have increased in frequency, and become more extreme.
   There has yet been little analysis of short-term extreme events, such as high intensity rainfall, tropical storms, tornadoes, high winds, extreme temperatures and droughts to show if the frequency and intensity of these have changed. However, for some of these events in some areas an increase is occurring while in other areas no changes have currently occurred. Changes in extremes cause significant impacts on agriculture. Strategies to fight slower variations have already been widely proposed and require application. Agrometeorologists can assist the agricultural community in developing strategies to adapt to ICV & CC that should be validated on-farm for improved extension advisories, together with fanners.
   To enhance adaptation and promote sustainable development, strategic planning studies for assessment of natural resources, technological change and innovation are required to increase productivity, with sustainable economic growth that preserves finite natural resources. The ten most essential agricultural umbrella projects with agrometeorological priority components in the literature that either modify the consequences of ICV & CC and/or mitigate their causes have been selected. The Commission for Agricultural Meteorology has pledged to guide the implementation of projects that assist adaptation strategies to ICV & CC within the WMO Agrometeorological Programme.

AB The present status of education and training in agricultural meteorology is reviewed in relation to the agreed objectives of this interdisciplinary science. The major educational contribution of the agronomy faculties to the educational and research effort is acknowledged. The significant part played by the World Meteorological Organization Regional Meteorological Training Centres in the training of technical and scientific personnel is reviewed. The heterogeneous training facilities and programmes of the Regional Meteorological Training Centres are described. The absence of a scientifically based evaluation system of the training effort in agricultural meteorology is noted.
   In the 21st century the socio-economic gap between the richest developing and the poorest developed countries is likely to widen. Thus, the requirements for education, research and services in agricultural meteorology are likely to diverge especially in the field of applications. The major aim of the developing countries remains the increase in quantity and nutritional quality of food and fibre production. The aim of the developed countries will most likely centre on sustainable agricultural systems environmentally compatible with the requirements of an urban society. Educational facilities in agricultural meteorology will have to adapt to such a gradually changing situation nationally, regionally and internationally. Advantages from remote learning techniques and commercial systems are also likely to follow. Research priorities will be reviewed in view of changing national objectives. Agricultural meteorology will have to be integrated into the major research efforts of national priority. Growing competition in the field of meteorological services will also affect agricultural meteorology. The services of proven use to the agricultural community are likely to succeed in the 21st century as the free market economy gains ground. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Current corn and soybean productivity data is needed in Illinois for land-use planning, sustainable farm management, and accurate land appraisal. The out-of-date source of soil productivity data is Circular 1156 Soil Productivity in Illinois (Fehrenbacher et al., 1978, Soil productivity in Illinois. UIUC. College of Agriculture. COOP. EXT. SERV. Circular 1156). A new major analysis based on current Illinois farmer crop-yield data is needed to assure the availability of reliable 10-year average corn and soybean yield estimates by soils. The overall objective of this study was to update the corn and soybean yields which serve as a productivity index for Illinois soils since these two crops are grown on approximately 90% of the cropland. An approach based on multiple regression was used to evaluate the relationship between 16 selected soil properties of 34 major soils and established 1970s (1967-1976) corn and soybean yields as published in Circular 1156. Statistical models developed from major soils were tested internally by calculating the 10-year average corn and soybean yields for each of the 34 major soils. The coefficients generated from multiple regression were further tested using the soil property values for the additional 165 soils identified in nine counties representing the crop reporting districts and weather districts in Illinois. The 10-year average crop yield trends were determined for 66 counties in the northern region and for 36 counties in the southern region for the 20-year time period between 1976 and 1995. These 20-year yield trend increases were added to the established (Circular 1156) and model predicted 1970s crop yields to estimate 1990s (1986-1995) corn and soybean yields for the average management level for all 199 Illinois soil types in nine selected counties. The 1990s crop yield estimates for the selected counties were weighted by extent of each soil type in the county and compared against 10-year county averages for the 1990s farmer reported Illinois Agricultural Statistics (IAS) corn and soybean yields. Predicted 1990s county crop yields were statistically similar to 1990s fanner reported (IAS) county crop yields, The proposed approach to updating corn and soybean yields worked well and should be useful in surrounding states or countries.

AB This paper presents the design and development of an Environmental Sustainability Index (ESI) and describes a case study used to evaluate the performance of the index. The objective of the index was to provide a modelling-based, quantitative measure of sustainability from an environmental perspective, comprising both on- and off-site environmental effects associated with agricultural systems. A performance approach was utilized for the ESI, having inputs that were derived from long-term simulations of crop management systems with the EPIC model (Erosion Productivity Impact Calculator). 15 sub-indices for representing sustainability were chosen employing a dual framework for characterizing environmental sustainability, embodying the agricultural system's: (i) inherent soil productivity and groundwater availability; and (ii) potential to degrade the surrounding environment. A case study was developed based on prevalent corn and wheat agricultural production systems in Baca County, located in southeastern Colorado. Principal components analysis was employed to assess the information content of the 15 sustainability sub-indices. Sensitivity analysis was performed to evaluate the effects of model input uncertainty on the index. The effect of the time frame over which the index is computed was also examined for time frames ranging from 50 to 300 years. Results show that the ESI is capable of demonstrating clear differences among crop management systems with respect to sustainability. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Nitrogen balances for households in the mid-hills of Nepal

AB Sustainable production requires balanced resource use and it is the management decisions at a household level that determine nutrient fluxes and the economic viability of enterprises. Traditionally, the agricultural systems of the mid-hills of Nepal have relied on the close integration of forestry, livestock husbandry and crop production but increasing population and other social changes are straining these systems. This paper uses diverse sources to determine a N balance for a hypothetical household and to assess the sustainability of current farming systems with respect to N. For a hypothetical household holding 1 ha of land with two-thirds of it rainfed hillside (bari-land) and one-third irrigated lowland (khet-land), the system is currently in balance with inputs across the boundary of about 26 kg Na-1 (mainly in fertilizer) and losses, excluding gases, of about 60 kg Na-1 (mainly in crop removal). Tree fodder and grasses are a major source of N (80 kg Na-1) to the household. A major pathway for the flow of N within the system is via the forage fed to livestock, and the subsequent application of manure to crops. Typically, manure and compost supply 100 kg N to crops (four times that supplied by fertilizer) and produce crops with a N content in grains of 36 kg N. The N losses via soil erosion are shown to be small but the losses via leaching and gases are largely unquantified. It is concluded that the use of tree fodder and forage from forest areas and grasses from terrace risers as animal feed ensures a net movement of N from non-agricultural land to agricultural land. The magnitude of this movement is not known, because the quantities of Vegetation gathered from inside and outside the household boundaries are not known. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Objective: Chronic depression starts at an early age for many individuals and could affect their accumulation of "human capital" (i.e., education, higher amounts of which can broaden occupational choice and increase earnings potential). The authors examined the impact, by gender, of early- (before age 22) versus late-onset major depressive disorder on educational attainment. They also determined whether the efficacy and sustainability of antidepressant treatments and psychosocial outcomes vary by age at onset and quantified the impact of early-versus late-onset, as well as never-occurring. major depressive disorder on expected lifetime earnings.
   Method: The authors used logistic and multivariate regression methods to analyze data from a three-phase, multicenter, double-blind, randomized trial that compared sertraline and imipramine treatment of 531 patients with chronic depression aged 30 years and older. These data were integrated with U.S. Census Bureau data on 1995 earnings by age, educational attainment, and gender.
   Results: Early-onset major depressive disorder adversely affected the educational attainment of women but not of men. No significant difference in treatment responsiveness by age at onset was observed after 12 weeks of acute treatment or, for subjects rated as having responded, after 76 weeks of maintenance treatment. A randomly selected 21-year-old woman with early-onset major depressive disorder in 1995 could expect future annual earnings that were 12%-18% lower than those of a randomly selected 21-year-old woman whose onset of major depressive disorder occurred after age 21 or not at all.
   Conclusions: Early-onset major depressive disorder causes substantial human capital loss, particularly for women. Detection and effective treatment of early-onset major depressive disorder may have substantial economic benefits.

AB Climate variability is a feature of many arid and semi-arid lands, though only the most protracted periods without rain can correctly be described as droughts. Protracted droughts lead to pressure being put on vegetation and soils through over-stocking, and on governments to provide food or financial assistance. This paper discusses the evolution of drought policy in Australia and southern Africa, highlighting how people in these areas can become more self-reliant through being proactive rather than reactive in coping with drought. The importance of protecting the natural resource base is also emphasized, so that it can be productive in future years. However, an essential prerequisite to achieving increased self-reliance and to reduce the impact of drought is to put a national drought policy in place, and provide the necessary research and education infrastructure so that farmers, agri-business and rural communities can better anticipate and cope with droughts.

AB How land development in the form of land improvements and locational amenities interact in time, at any point in space characterized as a tourist area, is the topic of this rather brief investigation. The strong, non linear, interactive dynamics between the two entities is viewed in a general ecological predator-pray formulation, under a series of scenarios. Mildly cyclical and eventually unstable dynamics are portrayed under numerical simulation to be perhaps the most likely of the various scenarios explored. Windows of opportunity for governmental intervention are shown to exist, in the case where complex scale effects and significant externalities take place between the two. This paper presents an effective framework to fruitfully examine issues of sustainable development.

AB Eighteen growing male Murrah buffalo (Bubalus bubalis) calves were divided into three groups consisting of six animals each and fed three urea ammoniated wheat straw (UAS) -based rations supplemented with concentrate mixtures (roughage: concentrate ratio 58:42) containing deoiled ground nut cake, GNC (8%), formaldehyde treated GNC (8%) or fish meal (8%) to undertake comparative evaluation of these rations in terms of their CH4 production and growth (285 d duration) potential. A digestibility trial (10 dr duration) was followed by a comparative calorimetric study in respiration chamber. Dry matter (DM) intake (84.3 to 89.3 g/kg W(0.75)d(-1)) did not differ between treatments. The digestibility coefficient of DM, organic matter (OM), crude protein (CP), neutral and acid detergent fiber did not differ significantly in different diets. Urinary energy loss as a percent of gross energy (IGE) was not affected by diets. Average values of CH4 production were 84.3, 77.6 and 99.1 g/d and CH4 energy losses as percent of gross energy were 5.7, 5.2 and 6.1 percent on GNC, formaldehyde treated GNC and fishmeal, respectively, and did not differ significantly. When expressed per unit of digestible OM intake, CH4 production (g) was lower (p<0.05) on formaldehyde treated GNC (30.6) than on untreated GNC (30.6) and fish meal (31.9). Total ME intake and heat production were similar and hence the energy balances on different diets were similar. Nutritive value of rations in terms of digestible CP and ME were similar. Average daily gain calculated on the basis of regression of fortnights on cumulative liveweight gain in calves fed on concentrate containing unprotected GNC, protected GNC and fish meal were 437.1, 483.9 and 481.6 g, respectively. This indicated that the intake of energy was sufficient to meet the requirement of calves growing at 400 g per d. However, CP intake was around 150% of the stipulated standard (Kearl, 1982). Feed conversion ratios on unprotected GNC, protected GNC and fish meal were 11.60, 11.10 and 10.4 respectively. It was concluded that because significantly (p<0.05) low CH4 is produced on protected GNC (8%), it is very good and sustainable protein source in comparison to poor quality fish meal and untreated GNC to be used in concentrate mixture for supplementing UAS-based diets.

AB A participation scheme involving smallholder dairy farmers in improving dairy productivity through the use of local feeds, on-farm established feeds and crop residues was carried out in the Nor Northeast, Thailand. At six milk collection centers, 63 farmers with 340 lactating cows participated in this research and demonstration of feed supplements, Farmers and cows were allotted to receive respective feed supplements: high-quality feed block (HQFB), high-quality feed pellet (HQFP), dried cassava leaf/cassava hay, dried leucaena leaf and cottonseed meal: 5% urea treated rice straw was fed as a source of roughage throughout the feeding period of the dry season. Trainings and workshops were organized by the researchers at the University, research station, demonstration sites and on-farms. Regular visits to the farms by researchers and extension officers were made while discussions and demonstrations were performed in addition. Participating farmers also visited other farmers during the demonstration which offered a real practical perspective and farmers-to-farmers interaction. As a result of this participation and demonstration scheme, the farmers could learn more effectively and accepted the technology more readily, especially the practicality of the feed preparation, feed establishment, feeding method and feed reserve. Strategic supplementation of these feed supplements resulted in improving milk yield, milk quality, overall condition of the cows and higher income return through increased productivity and lower level use of concentrate to milk yield from 1:2 to 1:3 or lower. Based on this research and demonstration /participation scheme, all Feed supplements enhanced productivity, however the establishment of cassava hay on farms deserved more attention and warrants a wider developmental expansion among dairy farmers since it contained high rumen by-pass protein (tannin-protein complex) and could be easily produced and be sustainable on farms.

TI Economic electricity generation at a higher safety level - The European
   pressurized water reactor (EPR) waiting for the start of construction
SO ATW-INTERNATIONALE ZEITSCHRIFT FUR KERNENERGIE
LA German
DT Article
AB The EPR is a modem nuclear power plant whose design characteristics were developed in an evolutionary process from the successful N4 plants operated in France and convoy plants run in Germany. It constitutes another step in the safety concept in which measures are taken to manage even severe accidents, core meltdown included. The consequences of such accidents remain restricted to the interior of the plant, thus obviating the need for emergency protection measures for the vicinity of a nuclear power plant.
   In addition to these features, special attention was devoted to competitive electricity generation. Optimization of all plant parameters, from higher efficiency and increased availability to improved fuel utilization, results in clear competitiveness with all other techniques of electricity generation. With the completion of the optimization phase after the basic design phase, the EPR has now reached a level of maturity which allows its construction to be started. Industry has done its job of developing a prolnising reactor and preserving know-how in nuclear technology. It is now up to politics to pave the way for the implementation of this reactor concept within the framework of a sustainable long-term energy policy so that know-how may continue to be preserved and the nuclear option may remain open also to future generations.

AB This paper explores the potential of a new method of reconstructing historical vegetation change in the Australian rangelands. Historical monitoring of rangeland vegetation has been so deficient that it is not possible to determine whether a long-term trend toward degradation has occurred (as is often assumed) or, indeed, if it is continuing to occur. Because long-term records are unavailable any attempt to monitor vegetation retrospectively must be based on proxy measures rather than direct observation. Where historical data are lacking an integration of palaeoecological, archaeological and ecological methods is required to reconstruct the past. Our research is based on a detailed analysis of sheep faeces deposited near a shearing shed in the semiarid rangelands of south-west Queensland between the late 1930s and the mid-1990s. The faeces in these deposits represent the diet of sheep in the days leading up to the property's annual shearing and as such are a potentially useful index to changes in vegetation. Results indicate significant changes in the diet of sheer since the late 1940s. The potential of this method, and its limitations, are discussed. Long-term records are critical in understanding issues of sustainability in land management and it is intended that this paper will stimulate further research into historical vegetation change in rangelands.

TI The Agrarian Reform in Mexico 1917-1992 and it's impact on the
   socioeconomic development of the country
SO BERICHTE UBER LANDWIRTSCHAFT
LA German
DT Article
AB The formulation of a country's land tenure system has a fundamental influence on it's socioeconomic development. Therefore agrarian reforms, which are aimed at a recombination of the rural production factors labour, land, capital and know-how, are important instruments of development cooperation. The agrarian reform in Mexico was the first one carried out in a developing country. For a certain time, it's typical units of communal property and production were considered as exemplary. But extreme poverty in rural areas, food shortage and resource degradation after 75 years of reform process let doubt about the success. This article analyses the historical background, the realization, results and framing conditions of the mexican agrarian reform and reviews, if the general conceptional guidelines laid down at the beginning have been followed. It is concluded that neither a sufficient land distribution nor an adequate access to crucial resources could have been reached. As main problem for the failing implementation the concentration of political power is identified. The governing elite used the agrarian reform not as an instrument for development but for controlling and manipulating the rural people. Thus, at the cost of the agrarian sector a rapid but socially detrimental industrialization could have been initiated. After some positive results in the beginning, the established economical structure showed a serious instability, so neither social nor economical development could have been reached. The experience in Mexico can be taken as a link for other countries, that an agrarian reform only can provide sustainable development if the whole society participates in this process.

DE common chameleon (Chamaeleo chamaeleon); habitat selection; natural vs.
   human environments; land uses; road barriers; safe nesting sites
AB We studied the features of the habitat selection of the common chameleon [Chanaeleo chamaeleon (L.)] in a population located in an area under development in south-eastern Spain. Chameleons were recorded in zones characterised by the presence of roads, lack of natural vegetation and presence of cultivation at the macrohabitat level, and tree-dominated vegetation and bare soils at the microhabitat level. This particular habitat selection increases the propensity for casualties due to illegal collection, accidental road deaths or nest losses because of ploughing. However, chameleons were not present in nearby natural environments in which these sources of mortality are much less intense or absent. We suggest that the sustainability of chameleon populations requires a combination of maintaining traditional human rand uses and the adoption of preventive measures, such as road barriers in some selected sites or the protection of safe sites for nesting, since both the more aggressive human pressures (settlements for tourism) and the promotion of natural landscapes (reforestation) could be negative for the species.

AB This study investigated the effects of different tillage practices on the nematode community structure. The different tillage systems were: untilled control, conventional deep plough, two-layer plough and cultivator. Sampling was carried out in a field experiment at Worrstadt-Rommersheim (Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany) in order to study the effects of these tillage systems in a sustainable farming system. Soil samples were taken every 3 months from June 1994 to March 1995 and divided into two depths of 0-10 and 10-20 cm in order to study the vertical distribution of nematode density and community structure. Nematode density was significantly reduced after the first tillage. The second tillage had no effect on the nematode density, whereas the nematode community structure was strongly influenced on both structural (taxonomic) and functional (trophic group, life strategy) level. After tillage, the density of plant parasitic nematodes decreased and the density and dominance of bacterivorous nematodes increased. In the tilled plots, and especially in the cultivator and the two-layer plough plot, the nematode community was dominated by bacterial feeders, whereas, in the untilled control, plant feeders were more dominant. Our results showed that the nematode Maturity Index and Plant Parasite Index are suitable for indicating immediate tillage effects on the nematode community.

AB Land productivity, along with improvement or maintenance of soil health, must be evaluated together to achieve sustainable agricultural practices. Winter wheat-fallow (W-F) has been the prevalent cropping system in the central Great Plains for 60 years where moisture is a limitation to crop production. Alternative cropping systems show that producers can crop more frequently if residue management and minimum tillage are used. The impact of different crops, crop rotations and tillage management practices on soil quality was assessed by measuring aggregate stability and glomalin production by arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi in soil from cropping trials established in 1990. Crops were wheat (W), corn (C), prose millet (M), and sunflower (S). Rotations sampled were W-F, W-C-M, W-C-M-F, W-C-F, and W-S-F. In the same area as the cropping trials, soils were taken from a perennial grass (crested wheatgrass) and from a buffer area that had been planted to Triticale for the past 2 years but prior to that had been extensively plowed for weed control. We found that aggregate stability and glomalin were linearly correlated (r=0.73, n=54, P<0.001) across all treatments sampled. Highest and lowest aggregate stability and glomalin values were seen in perennial grass and Triticale soils, respectively. Aggregate stability in W-S-F was significantly lower than in the other crop rotations (P less than or equal to 0.03), while W-C-M had significantly higher glomalin than the other rotations (P<0.05). Differences between crop rotations and the perennial grass indicate that selected comparisons should be studied in greater detail to determine ways to manage AM fungi to increase glomalin and aggregate stability in these soils.

AB 'Sustainable use' and 'community-based conservation' are two contemporary concepts in wildlife conservation policy. Their rise represents a shift away from traditional conservation techniques, and a merging of narratives about conservation and development. While policy statements by major conservation organisations emphasise the necessity of the shift, evidence to date suggests that, in practice, implementation of these concepts has been limited.
   This paper considers the extent to which sustainable use and community-based conservation have been accepted (or not) by a specific group of conservation experts, and what this level of acceptance implies for conservation in practice. Based on in-depth interviews with experts in marine turtle biology and/or conservation policy the paper considers the willingness and ability of such experts to incorporate human development needs and issues into conservation activities. The suitability of conservation organisations as promoters of rural development, and implications of their further involvement as such, are discussed.

DE world population; demographics; food production
AB The world's human population of 6 billion is currently projected by the United Nations to reach about 8 billion by the year 2025 and continue growing until stabilising at about 10.8 billion in 2150. Most of this increase is destined to occur in underdeveloped countries. It is not only the magnitude of this population growth, but also its speed that will cause unprecedented strain on world food production. It will also affect living standards in most countries and likely widen the disparities that exist between the industrialised and underdeveloped nations. While world food production currently exceeds requirements, economic and political constraints on its distribution leave about 800 million people malnourished. Food production, processing and distribution in the industrialised countries rely heavily on energy provided by petroleum products. As global oil production is expected to begin declining within 5 yr, alternative energy strategies will be required. Human activities are also being linked to changes in global weather, and to the destruction of the soil and water resources necessary for sustainable food production. The scale and rapidity of these changes in turn will affect the productivity and stability of agriculture systems in the world's major food producing areas. As societies react to these pressures on food production, choices between economic and humanistic goals will become more prominent political issues.

   statistics; fish culture technology
AB Aquaculture has a long history, with carp culture in Asia starting before 2000 BC and oyster culture in the Roman Empire before the time of Julius Caesar. However, it is clearly the past 40 yr that have seen the most dramatic expansion of aquaculture. The world's population now exceeds 6 billion people and is still growing at an alarming rate. The world's wild fish harvest has clearly peaked at or above me maximum sustainable yield of about 90 million t. Many fish stocks are suffering from over-fishing and there is little hope of any increase in the capture fisheries production. Though modern agricultural practices have been very efficient at increasing the per acre yields, the world is experiencing an alarmingly steady decrease in the amount of agricultural land devoted to food production. In the past 20-30 yr production of fish, molluscs, crustaceans and aquatic plants (aquaculture) has become an increasingly important means of producing food, and in some countries aquaculture production accounts for more than half of the total fishery harvest and is even as high as 90% in a few countries. I have reviewed the historical growth of aquaculture, compared the product value in various countries and reviewed aquaculture practices for a number of plant, molluscan, crustacean and fish species around the world. These culture technologies were compared and contrasted with agricultural practices. Finally, some predictions for the future of aquaculture development in Canada and the world have been made.

AB Modern agricultural practices have led to a decline in our farm animal genetic resources. Changes in the environment or society demands for more ecologically sustainable production systems may require breeds other than those in common use today. Although definitions of levels of concern differ, Canada has a number of endangered breeds which are of cultural and historical interest and which may be useful in future niche markets. Canada has formally ratified the international convention on biological diversity, but funding cuts have jeopardised national programs. The Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations has the mandate to establish an international program for conserving domestic animal diversity and its sustainable use. A major initiative has been the establishment of a data base and training information available through the World Wide Web. New technologies such as microsatellite markers and mathematical modelling offer promise for integration with more traditional live animal conservation methods and are now being incorporated into conservation schemes in a number of countries. Canadian groups involved in livestock and poultry genetic resource conservation must continue to interact to ensure a coordinated approach.

DE highway; sustainable; national park; environment
AB This paper describes how strategic highway engineering improvements have been developed or adopted to mitigate the unique environmental impact highways and roads have within Canadian Rocky Mountain national parks, which are also World Heritage Sites. Three levels of strategic highway development are presented. The first is the re-capitalization of existing park roads. Examples are presented from several national parks where parkways and low-volume roads were reconstructed or repaired in ways to reduce terrain impacts. The second is the development of the passing lane system on the Trans-Canada Highway in the Rocky Mountain national parks to defer twinning. The third example is the twinning of 18.6 km of the Trans-Canada Highway. Twinning represents a logical next step following the passing lane phase. This paper describes how highway engineering improvements were developed to address and mitigate numerous potential twinning impacts identified during environmental assessment. Included within the environmental mitigation measures are fencing and animal crossing structures, addressing wildlife movement, biodiversity, and mortality as well as stream, terrain, and vegetation disturbance minimization techniques. Research has found that the mitigation measures have been effective in reducing wildlife and vehicle collisions by 97%.

AB After the discovery of the Witwatersrand gold reef in 1886, the city of Johannesburg became, within a very short period of time, the financial and commercial hub of sub-Saharan Africa. It maintained this position throughout the earlier half of the twentieth century in the face of increasing opposition to the apartheid political system. By the late 1980s, however, this had changed. The restructuring of the global economy and increasing political pressure had resulted in a city whose economic base was declining and in which the social and economic exclusion upon which it had been built,vas no longer sustainable. This resulted in successive attempts by the urban authorities to reinvent a city which could claim a position in the mainstream global economy and become a city all its citizens could feel part of. This paper sketches these attempts, locates them in certain traditions of urban regeneration and exposes their theoretical and practical inadequacies. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB The political and ideological concerns aside, the fundamental economic argument in favor of postsocialist transition to a market system has been a supposition that it will improve allocative efficiency and thus the competitiveness of the industries and standard of living of households. It is believed that the shift of property rights from the state to private sector must quickly facilitate such an improvement. Yet in the majority of cases, even after the first decade of transition, the economies have not returned to the path of sustainable growth. The countries tackling the issues of recovery and growth relatively better are these which were able to focus not only on de-nationalization of the state assets, but mainly on the development of venture entrepreneurship. The grass-rooted development of especially small and medium enterprises has contributed significantly to overcoming the transitional depression and then to recovery and fast growth. Yet to accomplish such a sequence specific systemic and policy conditions must be met. To facilitate such a path of development proper institutional arrangements must be executed by the governments, legal framework must be established and the government policies ought to support the rise and competitive performance of the small and medium enterprises (SME). Liberalization is a prerequisite of growth of this sector in transition economies, but is not a sufficient condition. The crucial factors involve the institutional arrangements.

AB The development and applications in organic synthesis of new mesoporous solid catalysts is proving to be one of the most interesting-and important subjects in green and sustainable chemistry. With high levels of organic functionality on the surface, these materials which can be considered as inorganic-organic hybrids, are compatible even with very low polarity organic media and can be used in various types of organic reactions. Some of the most interesting are solid acids such as solid sulfonic acid and solid peracids which are safe and environmentally less-damaging alternatives to conventional reagents.

AB A view of green/sustainable chemistry (GSC) and catalysts for GSC is first discussed. It is pointed out that easily applicable methods for the evaluation of greenness (or green index) are necessary for the sound development of GSC movement. Then, green/sustainable aspects of heteropolyacid (HPA) catalysts are described referring to examples of the achievements of basic studies and successful practical applications: (i) water-tolerant acid catalysis, (ii) catalysis in pseudoliquid phase, (iii) solid-phase catalysis, (iv) bi-functional catalysis in combination with noble metals, and (v) green processes in bi-phase systems.

AB NED is a collective term for a set of software intended to help resource managers develop goals, assess current and potential conditions, and produce sustainable management plans for forest properties. The software tools are being developed by the USDA Forest Service, Northeastern and Southern Research Stations, in cooperation with many other collaborators. NED-1 is a Windows-based program that helps analyze forest inventory data from the perspective of various resources on management areas as large as several thousand hectares. Resources addressed include visual quality, ecology, forest health, timber, water, and wildlife. NED-1 evaluates the degree to which an individual stand or an entire management unit may provide the conditions required to accomplish specific goals. NED-1 users select From a variety of reports, including tabular data summaries, general narratives, and goal-specific analyses. An extensive hypertext system provides information about the resource goals, the desired conditions that support achieving these goals, and related data used to analyze the actual condition of the forest, as well as detailed information about the program itself and the rules and formulas used to produce the analyses. The software is constructed in C++ using an application framework; the inferencing component that handles the rule bases uses Prolog. (C) 2000 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Managing forest resources for sustainability requires the successful integration of economic and ecological goals. To attain such integration, land managers need decision support tools that incorporate science, land-use strategies, and policy options to assess resources sustainability at large scales. Landscape Evaluation of Effects of Management Activities on Timber and Habitat (LEEMATH) is a tool for evaluating alternative management strategies from both economic and ecological perspectives. The current version of LEEMATH emphasizes timber production and wildlife habitat in industrial forest landscapes. LEEMATH provides a framework upon which various models can be integrated. It is generic because it is designed to model stand growth, habitat attribute, and habitat suitability as they exist generally throughout the American Southeast. It is dynamic because it examines effects of management strategies on timber production and habitat quality over time, especially the balance between habitat loss and regrowth at the landscape scale. It is spatially explicit because it evaluates landscape configuration for its effects on habitat in terms of adjacency requirements and dispersal potential. It is heuristic because it simulates the dynamics of forest stands under different management scenarios and allows land managers to ask 'WHAT-IF' questions to explore management alternatives and their possible effects over time. In this paper, we discuss how to integrate different models into a decision-support system, and how to evaluate habitat suitability at the landscape level. We also discuss the gaps in our knowledge of landscape habitat assessment and the limitations of LEEMATH. finally, we apply LEEMATH to a forested landscape on the coastal plain of South Carolina, USA, to demonstrate its usefulness in management planning with multiple interests. We show the effects of two management regimes on timber production, habitat attribute dynamics, and habitat quality of three target wildlife species at both the stand and the landscape scales.

AB An innovative, knowledge-based partnership between research scientists and resource managers in the U.S. Forest Service provided the foundation upon which the Forest Plan was developed that will guide management on the Tongass National Forest for the next 10-15 years. Criteria developed by the scientists to evaluate if management decisions were consistent with the available information base were applied to major components of the emerging final management strategy for the Forest. While the scientists remained value neutral on the contents of the Forest Plan and the management directions provided in it, their evaluation indicated that the decisions it contained for riparian and fish sustainability, wildlife viability, karst and cave protection, slope stability, timber resources, social/economic effects, and monitoring achieved a high degree of consistency with the available scientific information. The Forest Plan, revised to conform with existing scientific knowledge, represents a management strategy designed to sustain the diversity and productivity of the ecosystem while producing goods and services commensurate with the agency's multiple-use mandate. Execution of this research/management partnership highlighted the role of scientific knowledge in forestry decision-making and provided a new mechanism to input such information into the decision making process. The partnership continues as the scientists are addressing high priority information needs generated by the planning effort in order to have additional information available for plan implementation and revision through adaptive management over the next 3-5 years.

AB Previous studies of the sustainability of wildlife hunting in the Neotropics have not considered the potential dispersal of animals into hunted areas. A literature review of studies of subsistence hunting in the Neotropics suggests that hunting is often conducted in areas adjacent to relatively undisturbed habitat that may act as sources of animals for the hunted sites. We compared studies of tapir (Tapirus terrestris) hunting at different sites to illustrate the potential bias of sustainability evaluations based on local productivity. The limited information available suggests that dispersal could have a key role in rebuilding animal populations depleted by hunting. Thus, factors that strongly affect dispersal-such as spatial distribution and size of areas with and without hunting, population size in source areas, and social behavior-should be considered when the sustainability of hunting is evaluated in areas with heterogeneous hunting pressure. We suggest the application of two models that use spatial controls (recognizing the potential source-sink nature of some hunted systems and protecting unhunted refugia) to avoid wildlife overexploitation when biological data and enforcement capabilities to regulate harvests are limited. This approach may produce more reliable evaluations of sustainability, provide information on the dynamics of hunting systems, and help local communities and policymakers conserve key areas (including protected areas) that may act as game sources.

AB The largest existing hunt for marine mammals is Canada's commercial hunt for Northwest Atlantic harp seals (Pagophilus groenlandicus). From 1995 to 1998, the total allowable catch was set at a level that the Canadian Department of Fisheries and Oceans calculated would not cause the population to decline, consistent both with its stated management objectives of maintaining stable seal populations while allowing a sustainable harvest and with its stated policy of taking a precautionary approach to management. During those years, Canada's total allowable catch was progressively increased from 186,000 harp seals per year (1995) to 250,000 (1996) to 275,000 (1997 & 1998). We examined whether the government's management objectives were achieved using the conventional approach of comparing landed catches with the replacement yield estimated from a biological population model. We then conducted a second assessment, using a more modern and precautionary approach recently implemented for marine mammal management in the United States which incorporates uncertainty into management models to estimate sustainable "potential biological removal levels." From 1996 to 1998, landed catches from Canada and Greenland exceeded Canada's estimated replacement yield. Over the same period, estimated total human-caused mortality exceeded potential biological removal levels by 1.5 to 5.9 times. Given such levels of reported catches and estimated total human-caused mortality. Canada's management of its harp seal hunt did not achieve its objectives. It is likely, therefore, that the population is now declining and, if recent levels of killing continue, the population will stabilize only at levels below (and possibly far below) its maximum net productivity level. Viewed from this perspective. Canada's approach to harp seal management between 1996 and 1998 cannot be deemed precautionary or risk-averse.

TI Protected area planning in the tropics: Uganda's national system of
   forest nature reserves
SO CONSERVATION BIOLOGY

DT Article
ID BIODIVERSITY; SELECTION; NETWORKS; AFRICA
AB Uganda is one of the most biologically diverse countries in Africa, with much of its biodiversity represented in a system of 10 national parks, 10 wildlife reserves, and 710 forest reserves, covering 33,000 km(2) (14%) of the country's area. We focus on the role of the forest reserves in biodiversity conservation and describe a procedure we developed to design a national system of forest nature reserves. In the late 1980s a policy was instituted to dedicate half the area of forest reserves to sustainable timer production and the other half to environmental protection (with 20% as nature reserves). to select suitable sites, a 5-year, US$1-million program of biodiversity and resource assessment was undertaken, focusing on five biological indicator species groups and covering all the major forest reserves. Based on data generated by the field studies, we ranked each forest in terms of various criteria-(species richness, rarity, value for nonconsumptive uses, timber production, and importance to local communities)-and used an iterative site selection procedure to choose the most suitable combination of forests for nature reserve establishment. Our procedure maximized complementarity in representing species and habitats in reserves across the whole protected-area system. We initially selected sites using purely biological criteria but later modified our procedure to ensure that opportunity costs and potential land-use conflicts were minimized. Our preferred network of sites included 14 forests that, in combination with the existing national parks, would account for 96% of species represented in the country's protected areas. These 14 forests were classified as "prime" and "core" sites and were selected for the establishment of large nature reserves (averaging 100 km(2)). The addition of 25 smaller "secondary" forest nature reserves (averaging 32 km(2)) would protect more than 99% pf the indicator species.

AB GM foods have the potential to provide significant benefits for developing countries. Over 800 million people are chronically undernourished, and 180 million children are severely underweight for their age. By 2020, there will be an extra billion mouths to feed. Ecological approaches that underpin sustainable agriculture (e.g., integrated pest management) and participatory approaches that strengthen farmers' own experimentation and decision making are key. Biotechnology will be an essential partner, if yield ceilings are to be raised, if crops are to be grown without excessive reliance on pesticides, and if farmers on less favored lands are to be provided with crops that are resistant to drought and salinity, and that can use nitrogen and other nutrients more efficiently.
   Over the past 10 years, in addition supporting ecological approaches, the Rockefeller Foundation has funded the training of some 400 developing-country scientists in the techniques of biotechnology. Most of the new crop varieties are the result of tissue culture and marker-aided selection. The Foundation also supports the production of genetically engineered rices, including a new rice engineered for beta carotene (the precursor of Vitamin A) in the grain.
   Some specific steps can be taken by Monsanto that would improve acceptance of plant biotechnology in both the developing and the industrialized worlds: label; disavow gene protection (terminator) systems; phase out the use of antibiotic resistance markers; agree (with big seed companies) to use the plant variety protection rather than patents, in developing countries; establish an independently administered fellowship program to train developing-country scientists in crop biotechnology, biosafety, and intellectual property; donate useful technologies to developing countries; agree to share financial rewards from intellectual property rights on varieties such as basmati or jasmine rice with the countries of origin; and finally, develop a global public dialogue that treats developing-country participants as equal partners.

   public policy analysis; uncertainty
AB The most critical task facing humanity today is the creation of a shared vision of sustainable and desirable society, one that can provide permanent prosperity within the biophysical constraints of the real world in a way that is fair and equitable all of humanity, to other species, and to future generations. Recent work with businesses and communities indicates that creating a shared vision is the most effective engine for change in the desired direction, yet most effort in "futures modeling" has focused on extrapolating past trends rather than envisioning alternative futures. Science and economics as applied to policy are in conflict often over alternative visions of the world than purely "scientific" disagreements. Likewise, governance has gotten bogged down in mediating short term conflicts between special interests rather than its more basic role of creating broadly visions that can guide dispute resolution.
   This paper addresses the question of what policies are most appropriate for society now, given alternative visions of the future and the enormous uncertainty about the reality of the assumptions underlying these visions. Four specific visions are laid out as being representative of the major alternatives. Far each vision the benefits of achieving the vision, the assumptions that would have to be true in order for it to be achieved, and the implications of it being attempted but not achieved are explored. It is argued that dealing with uncertainty about the nature of the world, its carrying capacity for humans, the impacts of climate change, and other aspects of its future can best be done at this level of future visions and assumptions, not at more detailed levels (like the parameter uncertainty in models). Application of this vision/uncertainty analysis can help us both to design the future society we want and to maximize the chances of our getting there safely.

AB Bycatch in fisheries is receiving attention because of its impact on ecological diversity and resource sustainability. Male and juvenile female diamondback terrapins, Malaclemys terrapin? frequently drown as bycatch in crab pots, removing individuals with high reproductive value from the population and possibly skewing sex ratios. We tested a wire bycatch reduction device (BRD) to determine its ability to reduce terrapin entrapment and to examine any effects the BRD has on the size and number of blue crabs, Callinectes sapidus, caught in crab pots. We tested three sizes of BRDs, a 4 X 10 cm BRD in 1996, and 4.5 x 12 cm and 5 X 10 cm BRDs in 1997. We equipped both standard crab pots and modified (tall) crab pots with BRDs, the latter were used to prevent terrapin mortality in areas of high terrapin density. Traps were checked and baited daily. In 1996, we caught no terrapins in 14 crab pots equipped with the 4 X 10 cm BRDs and 21 terrapins in II crab pots without BRDs. In 1997, the 4.5 X 12 cm BRD reduced terrapin bycatch by 82%, whereas the 5 x 10 cm BRD reduced terrapin bycatch by 47%. The 4 X 10 cm BRDs, however, reduced the size and number of large "Number One" and mature female crabs. Catch rate for standard crab pots with 4 X 10 cm BRDs was 2 crabs.pot(-1).day(-1) lower than standard crab pots fished without BRDs in 1996. Neither the 5 X 10 cm BRD nor the 4.5 x 12 cm BRD affected crab size or the number of crabs caught in crab pots. Standard crab pots with a 4.5 X 12 cm BRDs had the highest catch per unit effort (2.69 crabs.pot(-1).day(-1)), followed by standard crab pots without BRDs (2.55 crabs.pot(-1).day(-1)) and standard crab pots with 5 x 10 cm BRDs (7.39 crabs.pot(-1).day(-1)). The largest crab caught in 1997 was in st crab pot with a 4.5 x 12 cm BRD. We stress the importance of using the 4.5 X 12 cm BRD on crab pots fished commercially and recreationally to reduce terrapin mortality and the need to integrate the use of BRDs on crab pots with ether conservation practices such as protection of critical terrapin habitat, particularly nesting beaches.

AB To be an appropriate indicator of sustainability, a net income measure projected into the future should consider risk. Several authors have demonstrated how risk can be formally incorporated into welfare measures like Green Net National Product (NNP), however, the resulting measure can be considerably more complex than its deterministic counterpart. A practical alternative to formally incorporating risk is to use simulations of the type outlined in this paper to provide information about the expected impact of risk. This information can be used to apply a stochastic Version of a sustainability rule that requires that the expected value of net income be non declining. This paper discusses the importance of risk and uncertainty to welfare measurement and more specifically the measurement of net income from forest services in a region of northern Alberta. Two different approaches to valuing resource extraction are compared. The depreciation approach and the wealth-based approach provide very different projections of net income. We demonstrate that when a renewable resource is subject to risk, the wealth-based approach provides a more appropriate measure of the influence of resource use on future consumption possibilities and the sustainability of net income.

AB The paper investigates the relevance of participatory approaches to environmental policy-making when sustainable development is taken as the encompassing normative basis for environmental governance. In the first section, we illustrate the frequent references to participatory approaches in environmental decision-making. We then look at environmental issue attributes as determinants of the problem-solving requirements for environmental decision-making. We conclude the section by investigating whether and how participatory approaches could answer some of these requirements. In the second section, an illustration is proposed with the presentation of a participatory process that took place in 1997, during the last phase of the international negotiations that led to the Kyoto Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, and in 1998 in the preparation of the post-Kyoto phase. The process, organised by the European Commission, consisted of a series of workshops whose objective was to furnish timely inputs responding to the European Commission's information needs for climate policy formation in the pre- and post-Kyoto periods. This was to be achieved through the establishment of interfaces between: (i) the research community; (ii) the EC Climate negotiation team and through it the EU Member Slates representatives; (iii) other Commission interests (the 'inside stakeholders'); (iv) a range of'outside' stakeholders including industry, finance and commerce, employment, environment, consumer and citizen interests. We reflect on the participatory nature of the process and show how the process met some of the decision-making requirements identified in the first section. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB This paper describes the comparative growth performance of and monetary returns for Eucalyptus tereticornis and Dalbergia sissoo plantations in northern India. The growth is analysed in terms of annual and relative growth rates of bole, crown and marketable heights aic gains are considered for five components, i.e. timber, fuel-wood, fodder, oil and ash. The old plantations of D. sivolumes, and diameter at breast height. The measurements were taken at 6-8 and 19-21 years of age. The economry gains estimated are Rs. 13.4 million per hectare in the case of D. sissoo, but only Rs. 7.4 million per hectare for E. tereticornis, even after including the value of all rotational crops possissoo are found to be more sustainable in terms of growth performance and net monetary return. The total monetand ble within the 21-year life span. This integrated analysis challenges the long claimed forest policy that fast growing trees perform better than indigenous trees.

AB Local water supply and sewage systems utilizing soil infiltration systems and septic tanks are common in the Swedish countryside. The effects that infiltration of grey water has on groundwater quality have been investigated in a Swedish holiday village consisting of 269 houses and covering an area of some 160 ha. Boron and linear alkylbenzene sulphonates (LAS) were not found to occur in sufficient quantities to indicate sewage impact on the groundwater. A slight elevation ill the content of nitrate in the groundwater was found compared with data from 1972, with the highest concentration being 4 mg NO3-N/1. The input of nitrogen (N) from sewage is small in comparison with the background levels, while the input of phosphorus (P) constitutes 40% of the total input of this element. The release from grey-water infiltration as a fraction of total leaching was 6% for N and 30%, for P. However, in the groundwater, the level of phosphate was found to be unchanged from background levels. In a bacteriological test two wells out of 118 were found to contain water unsuitable for drinking purposes. About 15% of the available groundwater recharge was used for water supply. The current water and sewage practices appear to be a sustainable. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper discusses some conceptual fundamentals for the derivation of environmental indicator sets. On the one hand, it defines requirements from environmental politics, environmental management and legislation, reaching from political target hierarchies and sustainable management strategies to holistic protection concepts such as process protection, resource preservation, ecosystem health and ecological integrity. On the other hand, demands from ecosystem theory are described which include the consideration of features such as self-organization, emergence, thermodynamics, gradients and ecological orientors in environmental indicator sets. From that concept, collective and emergent properties are selected and eight holistic ecosystem features are presented that indicate the ecosystemic state as an ensemble. These general indicators of ecosystem integrity are supplemented by variables on structural changes and substance dynamics. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Sustainable development planning must be based on environmental and biophysical baseline indices that effectively define comparative development potential and environmental constraints. As such, indices must define the comparative advantage of the natural resource base and measure the fundamental capacity to sustain production rates of natural resource goods and services used to create societal well being. Complex biophysical and socioeconomic characteristics affect the identification and selection of sustainable development strategies. When derived from effective baseline indicators, indices may be used to define the spatial and temporal distribution of economically viable production opportunities and may be expressed in derived indices that realistically describe basic production opportunities and guide the selection of feasible, long-term development strategies. Specifically, representative indices are critical in the identification of development goals and realistic objectives and can be used to evaluate, select and implement sustainable development strategies and plans. It is stressed that the relevancy and effectiveness of public policies depend on the identification of representative evaluation models and baseline indices to define development strategies that are both environmentally sustainable and economically viable. In this context, the role of baseline indicators that define natural resource production capacities is discussed. This includes potential resource uses, derived benefits and their economic and environmental impacts. Key thematic indicators are suggested that may be especially useful in identifying development alternatives and impacts. This suggested that clearly defined environmental pollution limits or impact standards be used to define public risk tolerance limits and carrying capacity constraints. It is argued that these measures may be more effective in directing policy choices than economic valuation of non market goods and services that represent environmental externalities associated with resource exploitation options and economic development strategies. To this end, examples of thematic indicators and derived indices are introduced that may prove effective in resource assessment, economic evaluation and strategic development planning.

AB This paper discusses data analysis, the most technical part of performance measurements. The aim is to address issues that are problematic in undertaking research on indicators and are related to a fundamental yet often neglected area of sustainable development (SD) projects. These projects, even if implemented by an expert team, are not yet in the phase to be verified by statistical and econometric methods. SD indices (descriptors of a new paradigm) deserve to be constructed by adopting more rigorous data analysis with a good statistical base. The paper will examine the relevant lessons of four empirical projects conducted by the International Institute for Sustainable Development (IISD). The challenge is how to adopt more quantitative analysis in measuring SD. This may lead to a more comprehensive method of SD performance measures and more adequate indicators that are measurable with available data and verifiable by analysis. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Understanding and managing environmental risk is one of the major challenges of our time. The variability of ecological systems, wherein disturbances occur with uncertain frequency and magnitude over time and space, is essential for maintaining ecosystem integrity and resilience. This paper uses sustainable development indicators to improve multiple-objective environmental decision making under conditions of unknown variability. Specifically, the robustness to uncertainty of competing policy alternatives is assessed using multi-attribute value theory and the recently developed information gap methodology. The management of spruce-budworm outbreaks in the forests of New Brunswick, Canada, is used as an illustrative example. Numerical and theoretical results show how the minimum required return and the available prior information determine which alternative can best cope with environmental uncertainty.

AB The authors present a framework that illustrates how a resource quality index can be used to examine policy relevant questions regarding environmental condition, the management of a resource as a production output, and sustainability. The framework demonstrates that heterogeneous endowments of a resource can change over time in different ways. By evaluating these changes using substitution, reversibility and uncertainty criteria, we can suggest four general guidelines for managing an environmental resource in a single production process. This framework was applied in a case study to three soil types (stable, neutral and susceptible) used in agricultural production in the Midwestern United States. By evaluating the economic and environmental impacts of managing soil quality under different sustainability and profit objectives, we uncovered policy relevant information including: which soils need to be preserved; when public intervention is needed to attain sustainability; and what perceptions of sustainability may be worth pursuing at all. The accuracy of these insights is highly dependent upon the reliability of the assessment of resource quality. An index was useful in this resource assessment because it could adapt to many of the complexities of environmental condition. We offer three lessons in refining resource indicators so that they may be used in the framework to better achieve optimal resource management and a greater understanding of what sustainability really means.

DE AMOEBA approach; sustainable development; sustainability indicator;

AB Sustainable development, a concept of concern today in the political decision-making arena, captures and combines the need for economic development and the urgency of ecosystem protection. Sustainability indicators not only describe the environmental situation and the current burden on it; they also show what environmental burden the ecosystem is able to withstand in the long-run. Sustainability indicators tell us if, and to what degree, we are making progress toward the goal of sustainable development. This paper examines the purposes and requirements of sustainability indicators, using the AMOEBA approach as its main focus. AMOEBA, in the Dutch language, stands for 'general method of ecosystem description and assessment'. In the AMOEBA approach, quantitative and verifiable objectives are developed that allow for a quantitative description and assessment of ecosystems. The AMOEBA approach is a tool in aiding political decision makers to better understand the ecological status of an area of concern. AMOEBA is described both in general terms and with respect to its application at Jumping Run Creek shellfish restoration project in North Carolina. The project seeks to mitigate impacts to watershed hydrology due to land use changes that contribute to excessive bacterial loading and bed closure. Parameters being studied are indicators of bacterial stores, hydrologic modification and building density. An altered AMOEBA was developed which graphically presents the selected indicators and allows for an assessment of ecosystem impairments. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The credibility hypothesis, which was used to support the use of a pegged exchange rare arrangement as a nominal anchor mechanism, is based on restrictive analytical foundations that circumscribe its real world applicability. While all pegged exchange rate arrangements are subject to circumstances that can undermine the sustainability of the peg, exchange rate nominal anchor pegs are especially fragile because such arrangements introduce problems that are endogenous to that particular type of regime. The East Asian crisis is used to demonstrate the fragility of exchange rate nominal anchor pegs, while the case of Australia demonstrates how a floating currency escaped the contagion of the East Asian crisis.

AB Three factors are likely to cause a major paradigm shift in the field of ecotoxicology:
   1. heightened interest in sustainable use of the planet,
   2. increased recognition of the value of ecosystem services and natural capital,
   3. the consilience of ecology and industry via the rapidly developing field of industrial ecology.
   This manuscript provides a preliminary exploration of likely components of the paradigm shift.

   chasing your tail in the pursuit of sustainability
SO ENERGY POLICY
LA English
DT Article
AB In most countries people are urged to change their pattern of consumption and lifestyle in a less-energy consuming and more environmental-friendly direction. But gains in ecoefficiency are likely to be annihilated by a larger consumption - the so-called rebound effect - resulting in an increased throughput in the economy. Here is an obvious contradiction. Another contradiction entails from the fact that most governments strive to promote economic growth which includes increased consumption. The paper takes a look at various means to handle these contradictions in order to avoid or balance the rebound effect. Environmental policies (including such measures as green taxes) may redirect consumption from one kind to another but this demands that the alternative spending is less harmful than the one dissuaded from. Two other tested means are to alter the sector mix of the economy and to shorten the working hours - work sharing - to match the increasing efficiency. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB In areas where livestock production predominates, a 'fence-out rule' as opposed to a 'fence-in rule' has been advocated due to perceived economic advantages associated with open-range livestock production; people desiring to have no livestock on their properties need to construct fences. Yet a region's total economy may be enhanced by moving away from established fence-out and cost-sharing rules. With changes in public perceptions of property rights, advances in technology, and the acquisition of new scientific information, fence rules should be expected to evolve. This paper articulates political, economic and scientific considerations in the USA that may be contemplated by citizens and elected officials for altering directives controlling livestock. To promote economic efficiency and social well-being, the paper advocates the scrutiny of existing fence-out and cost-sharing rules in a region to determine whether alternative rules should be preferred. The demise of fence-out rules in some areas in the USA and other countries could help achieve a more sustainable use of range resources.

AB Nowadays cities are seen as motors for the sustainable development of European regions and are thus of crucial importance for the future of Europe as a whole. Management of complex systems such as cities requires the use of innovative, sophisticated planning tools that can assist in monitoring current conditions and projecting future developments. In this paper an integrated approach is proposed towards the development and implementation of a generic city planning framework that in principle can be applied to any city. The proposed city planning framework is a combination of an information system and a dynamic model, which enables the instrument to be used in both strategic and operational manners.

DE sustainability; mathematical modeling
AB The pursuit of urban sustainability poses problems of how to evaluate proposals for new development. Without an agreed basis for comparing alternatives, it may be difficult to justify one set of proposals over another. Mathematical modeling, by quantifying aspects of the urban environment, is often promoted as the most credible way of assessing sustainability. But the use of models in practice raises many issues that need to be considered if models are to gain widespread acceptance. Four United Kingdom universities are researching an energy and environmental prediction (EEP) model to predict energy consumed and emissions produced by the built environment and traffic. As well as further technical development of the model, the research aims to study how the model can be used by different organizations to promote sustainable decision making. In this short paper we examine the role that models in general can have in supporting decision making about urban sustainability. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

AB This paper is aimed at presenting a model, in the form of a template and a set of operating instructions, produced by the European Commission for the appraisal of sustainability of projects requesting financial support under the Urban Pilot Projects scheme. The template, along with the instructions for interpretation and usage, was handed over to a panel of external evaluators for them to reach consistent decisions across the European Union (EU). The proposed appraisal scheme is meant to jointly take into consideration the three main components of the sustainability concept, namely economic, social, and environmental, subjectively weighted to produce a single index. Strengths and weaknesses of the scheme are analyzed with the help of one of the appraised projects that happened to obtain EU financial support. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

DE urban sustainable development; urban and provincial levels
AB This paper provides an overview of the initiatives for sustainable development taking place in Italy at the urban and provincial levels, stressing some limits they met: unsatisfactory knowledge of environmental conditions, use of too general indicators, modest public participation. The case of the plan for the Province of Trento, currently in progress, is examined. This experience applies an eco-systemic approach to analyze the interactions among the different resource use cycles. Moreover, it tends to overcome the drawbacks of the top-down approach typical of plans, by means of a structured public involvement. In the Province of Trento, aspecific attention has to be devoted to the Alpine environment, which is endangered by the urban sprawl and the intensive use of resources. The plan will provide a deeper knowledge of environmental processes and will produce a set of appropriate indicators to assess the level of sustainability of the province, thus giving guidelines for improving policies and actions.

AB The increasing demand for sustainable development will have a profound impact on all types of urban infrastructures. However, there is a lack of knowledge of how sustainable development should be attained and how sustainability of various technical systems should be assessed. This paper describes the framework of a systems analysis project dealing with the above issues, which focuses on urban water and wastewater systems. The project is part of large national research program in Sweden entitled "Sustainable Urban Water Management." A set of sustainability criteria-covering health and hygiene, social and cultural aspects, environmental aspects, economy and technical considerations-are defined. To promote the practical use of a set of sustainability criteria it must be concise and related to quantifiable indicators that are easily measured. This paper suggests suitable indicators for the proposed criteria. It also contains a brief analysis of the contribution to various environmental effects and resource utilization of the Swedish urban water system in relation to the impact of Swedish society in total, to allow for a correct prioritization of the criteria.

DE sustainable management; urban water systems
AB In natural and artificial Urban Water Systems (UWS), there are strong interactions between urbanization processes, discharges of individual, industrial and collective wastewaters, transfer of pollutants in storm water runoff, and their impacts on natural surface and ground waters. The sustainable management of UWS is becoming very important, and needs new research and action methodologies to get a more integrated knowledge and understanding from scientific, technical, ecological, and socio-economic points of view. In this paper, methodological problems associated with modeling, decision-making tools, definition of objectives, metrology, and multidisciplinarity are identified. An improved and reliable knowledge about the short- and long-term behavior of UWS appears absolutely necessary to evaluate indicators and criteria used in various methodologies aiming at assessing sustainability. A multidisciplinary research project, named OTHU (Experimental Observatory for Urban Hydrology), which aims at providing results, knowledge, and methodologies to assess the sustainability of UWS, is then briefly presented.

DE design and management; sustainable urban water systems
AB The implications of sustainability on a construction level are quite well known, for example, with respect to the use of resources and emissions. On a higher level, sustainable development is not univocal. There are various sustainable solutions to a problem. Sustainable development is a complex problem, and in urban infrastructure a specific solution usually is the result of a planning process in which people from various backgrounds are involved. Different people have different perceptions of urban infrastructure and its management. A system of four basic approaches is presented, distinguishing so-called eco, ratio, socio, and carrying capacity approaches. This system, based on an extensive literature review, can facilitate the process leading to a workable consensus on sustainable development. The approach and planning process has to meet a certain set of requirements. Requirements are given, partly based on experience with planning for urban water infrastructure dealing with "natural" water flows in three cities. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

DE small wastewater systems; context-oriented planning approach
AB The authors present a planning tool for comparing and assessing the sustainability of different wastewater systems. The core of the planning tool is an assessment method based on both technical and social elements. The point of departure is that no technique is inherently sustainable or ecological in itself, but that the sustainability of the total system of technologies for a particular settlement in a given location must be assessed in a holistic and transparent manner. A pilot case is used to demonstrate the structure and the results of the assessment method. The assessment method is still under development, and this paper discusses crucial points in the development of the method. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

DE universal indicators; sustainability; urban green structure
AB Universal indicators on the sustainability of the urban green structure independent of the specific culture of the country, the region, and even the town, seem to be difficult either to establish or maintain because the opinions differ so much as to their applicability. This notwithstanding, this paper addresses the possibility of establishing a set of relevant indicators. Some of the proposals contained herein are given based on the ideas emanating from the 1987 World Commission on Environment and Development. The importance of the local context as well as the need for more knowledge of the green structure values is also stressed in the paper. "The green poster"-which has been developed in Norway during the last 10 years-is introduced as a potential to evaluate the sustainability of the urban green structure. As an analytical tool, it has the advantage of providing both a numerical as well as a visualized picture of the situation. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

DE EcoBalance model; sustainability in residential areas; Finland
AB The EcoBalance Model was developed at VTT, the Technical Research Center of Finland, in the early 1990s, and it has been used in several case studies in Finland. The model estimates the total consumption of energy and other natural resources, the production of emissions and wastes, and the costs caused directly and indirectly by residential areas and urban structures on a life-cycle basis. The results of the case studies give information about the ecological impacts of different solutions in urban development. The case study introduced in this article indicates that eco-villages are not necessarily very sound from an ecological point of view. On average, eco-villages require more energy and raw materials, they produce more emissions, and they cost more than urban small-house areas. The EcoBalance model can be used when planning new areas or developing new urban structures, constructing buildings and infrastructure, as well as developing sustainable life styles.

DE article 21; community sustainability indicators
AB Sustainability as defined by the Brundtland Commission, is a composite and thus ambitious policy target. It comprises environmental, economic, social, and institutional criteria with equal importance. Because of this complexity the first step of a (Local) Agenda 21 process should be to develop a Vision of a sustainable society-a "leitbild"-useful as a compass, not a road map (or, even worse, a blueprint), attached by indicators that help to measure progress, distance to target, and failures of plans or their implementations. In the following article a model is proposed how local sustainability indicators can be developed and how they can help to reduce the complexity of sustainability and to concretize a program for the Local Agenda 21. To get a practical impression of the theoretical presentation an example is given in the last part of the article. It shows the experiences made while developing sustainability indicators in the City of Iserlohn. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

DE urban infrastructure systems; rethinking of design
AB The premise of this paper is that there is a need for rethinking the design of technical infrastructures because of environmental problems, and to understand the dynamics of and the potential for change, urban infrastructure large technological systems must be seen as socio-technical artefacts. This paper offers a methodology for analyzing current infrastructure systems, and a case study, demonstrating that social relations play a significant role as barriers against implementing new management practices. It is argued that there is a need to involve more people in the rethinking of urban infrastructure, and this paper raises some strategic questions concerning planning for the transformation of technical infrastructures into more sustainable systems.

DE storm runoff; criteria; sustainability; weighting
AB This paper evaluates the relevance of different methods and criteria for choosing the best technical system to solve a combined sewer overflow problem in a catchment in Oslo. Two systems are evaluated; namely conventional, or nature based. A discussion of different criteria and rough numerical calculation of these are done. It is shown that the nature-based alternative has the best sustainability with a good degree of robustness. The LCA method was found to be too comprehensive and complicated in the present situation, compared to the benefits one will get. A simple EIA analysis with a pragmatic choice of criteria was found most suitable. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

DE environmental indicators; indicators for sustainable development;

   the environment
AB Environmental indicator systems aim to improve both the information and communication on the state of the environment and the environmental policy making. They have to fulfill scientific, functional and pragmatic requirements, e.g., consideration of ecological context, transparency and reproducibility, comprehensibility, policy relevance, international comparability, and justifiable expenditure. This paper analyzes the experiences made with the development of the German environmental indicator system and draws general conclusions toward further improvements. For Germany, an indicator system has been developed that uses the pressure-state-response approach proposed by the OECD, together with a classification in 14 environmental themes. According to the general requirements, the main criteria used for selecting the indicators are the ecological significance of the indicator, its quantifiability and data availability, and its comprehensibility and policy relevance. Altogether, about 140 indicators are selected. This high number stresses the need for further high-level aggregation, e.g., using methods developed for the valuation process in LCA. Further improvement is also needed, especially for the development of response indicators and in the area of data systematization.

AB The Caete Estuary lies within the world's second largest mangrove region, 200 km south-east of the Amazon delta. It has an extension of about 220 km(2) and is subjected to a considerable human impact through intensive harvest of mangrove crabs (Ucides cordatus) and logging of mangroves. In order to integrate available information on biomass, catches, food spectrum and dynamics of the main species populations of the system, a trophic steady state model of 19 compartments was constructed using the ECOPATH II software (Christensen & Pauly, 1992). Ninety-nine percent of total system biomass is made up by mangroves (Rhizophora mangle, Avicennia germinans and Laguncularia racemosa), which are assumed to cover about 45% of the total area and contribute about 60% to the system's primary production. The remaining biomass (132 g m(-2)) is distributed between the pelagic and benthic domains in proportions of 10% and 90% respectively. Through litter fall, mangroves inject the main primary food source into the system, which is either consumed directly by herbivores (principally land crabs, Ucides cordatus) or, when already metabolized by bacteria, by detritivors (principally fiddler crabs, Uca spp.). These two groups art: prominent in terms of biomass (80 g and 14.5 g m(-2)), and food intake (1120 g m(-2) yr(-1) and 1378 gm(-2) yr(-1) respectively). According to the model estimates, energy flow yr yr through the fish and shrimp compartments is of relatively low importance for the energy cycling within the system, a finding which is contrary to the situation in other mangrove estuaries reported in the literature. The dominance of mangrove epibenthos is attributed to the fact that a large part of the system's production remains within the mangrove forest as material export to the estuary is restricted to spring tides, when the forest is completely indundated. This is also the reason for the low abundance of suspension feeders, which are restricted to a small belt along the Caete: River and the small creeks which are watered daily. Phytoplankton, temporarily refloating benthic diatoms, neritic zooplankton and small pelagic fish dominate the (low) pelagic biomass. Total system throughput (10 559 g m(-2) yr(-1)) and mean transfer efficiency between trophic levels (98%) calculated by the model fit well into the range reported for other tropical coastal ecosystems. The very high gross efficiency of the fishery (catch/net primary production) of 8.6% and its low trophic level (2.1) is explained by a high harvesting rate of mangroves and the fact that the main animal resource in the system are the mangrove crabs (Ucides cordatus), which feed at the first trophic level. The model was balanced asuming a turnover rate for the land crabs of P/B = 0.25 (P/B: production per unit of biomass) which is possibly too high. If this value was replaced by a (possibly more realistic) lower value, the model would not balance, suggesting a situation in which more biomass is being harvested than produced, which hints to an overexploitation of this resource A ranking of the various system components in terms of their contribution to the system function (ascendency sensu Ulanowicz, 1997) revealed that detritus and associated bacteria contribute 34%, mangroves 19%, fiddler crabs 13%, phytoplankton and microphytobenthos 10%, mangrove crabs 10%, and the remaining 14 groups 14% to the total ascendency. Summary statistics of the model are given and compared with those of other coastal ecosystems. (C) 2000 Academic Press.

TI A cation exchange index for assessing degradation of acid soil by
   further acidification under permanent agriculture in the tropics
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
AB Soil acidification and related land degradation are becoming more important worldwide and are challenging the concept of sustainability of current land management systems. We have studied the impact on soil properties of two management systems, one in a tropical savanna, the other in a humid subtropical environment, particularly in relation to their cation chemistry. In Northeast Thailand the properties of an Acrisol cleared of dipterocarp forest some 37 years previously and used for continuous crop production are compared with adjacent undisturbed forest. In southern Queensland, Australia, the properties of a Luvisol used for intensive pasture production for 36 years are compared with those prior to introduction of the management system. Under both regimes, the soil pH fell by about 1 unit, with an increase in aluminium saturation of the cation exchange complex. Organic carbon in the Acrisol greatly decreased, but in the Luvisol it increased significantly. Consequently, the effects on surface charge characteristics were strikingly different, in that the Acrisol had been almost irreversibly degraded, whereas acidification and base diminution in the Luvisol can be easily reversed through conventional management. The amount of degradation caused by each management system has been quantified in terms of a Saturation Index, S-u:
   S-u = 100 x (C-u5.5 - Sigma)/C-u5.5,
   where C-u5.5 refers to the cation exchange capacity on the undisturbed (forested) site and Sigma is the sum of the base cations at field pH. This index encompasses an assessment of the degree of degradation taking into account the previous land use, in this case forest, and that due to anthropogenic disturbance. For the Queensland Luvisol S-u does not change, because the pasture management has not appreciably altered the CEC at pH 5.5. However, for the Thailand site S-u increased from 0 to 86%. Consequently in its present state, the surface horizon of this cultivated soil can retain only about 15% of the basic cations it could ideally hold under undisturbed conditions.

TI The economics of soil nutrient stocks and cattle ranching in the

ID ABANDONED PASTURES; EASTERN AMAZONIA; TRADE-OFFS; CONSERVATION
AB We present a model that can be used to analyse economically optimal nutrient (nitrogen) stocks in agricultural lands. The model is applied to study cattle ranching in humid Costa Rica. The numerical results indicate that, for current meat prices and discount rate, it is privately optimal to 'mine' soil nitrogen. In the long run, efficiency is consistent with degraded and abandoned pastures, as observed in the study region. Sustainable pasture management is economically efficient only for a discount rate close to zero or for meat prices at about twice the highest recorded value in 1985-1997. The results highlight the potential conflict between sustainability and economic efficiency. Caveats and externalities that are not included in our model are discussed.

AB Analysis of 23 year (1969-1991) catch-effort statistics of the artisanal fisheries of south-eastern Nigeria, using both the linear and the exponential surplus production models showed that the pelagic, demersal and crayfish resources available to the artisanal fisheries have been overfished; the stocks were most seriously depleted between 1984 and 1987. There was a slight improvement between 1988 and 1991, but currently the stocks are still in a depressed state. The problems of sustainability of the artisanal fisheries resources are discussed.

AB As a new millennium approaches, consumer expectations, demands, aspirations and concerns are more likely to expand than to recede. The job of food scientists, technologists and engineers is to provide solutions which not only make safe, high quality food available to all at affordable prices but to do so in a way that is not detrimental to the environment, that is sympathetic with the welfare of farmed animals and that provides sustainability of increasingly precious renewable resources.

AB The establishment of commercial tree regeneration is currently a focus for concern regarding the sustainability of logging in the tropical forests of Bolivia. This study compared the density, species composition, and growth of sawtimber species seedling and sapling regeneration 14 months following selection logging. Areas sampled included logging gaps, logging roads, skid trails, and log landings. Areas not disturbed by logging were also sampled as controls. The abundance and composition of competing vegetation in tree regeneration plots was also measured. The highest density and greatest initial height growth rates of tree regeneration were observed on areas with the greatest amount of soil disturbance, including log landings and logging roads. This trend was largely due to the higher densities of two common, light-seeded, shade-intolerant species, Anadenanthera colubrina and Astronium urundeuva. Despite having higher light availability than other sites, tree regeneration of all species was poor in logging gaps. Logging gaps were quickly colonized by competing vegetation, particularly lianas, where they had a percent cover 2.5 times that in undisturbed sites. Regeneration of some commercial species in these forests appears to respond more favorably to disturbances that exceed those provided by single tree selection logging. Despite the better initial establishment and growth of a few species on areas with soil disturbance caused by logging, the lack of regeneration of other commercial tree species and the increasing colonization of all sites by competing plants indicate the need for post-harvest competition control treatments to ensure vigorous commercial species regeneration that will contribute to the sustainable management of this forest.

AB In this study we used the diversity of soil and litter arthropods as a metric for evaluating the ecological effects of silvicultural practices of various intensities in a loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) forest ecosystem. The treatments included low and high intensity harvesting, soil bedding, chemical herbicide application, and nitrogen and phosphorus fertilization. Soil and litter cores were used to sample arthropods after harvesting. In the first year following removal of trees, species diversity was higher in hand-fell, hole-only harvested plots than in mechanical, whole-tree harvested plots and higher in non-bedded plots than in bedded plots. However, these differences did not persist into the second year following harvesting. The recovery of undergrowth vegetation in the second year and the development of a rudimentary litter layer may have increased diversity in the more intensively treated plots. Arthropod species richness increased following nitrogen and phosphorus fertilization, but Shannon diversity did not. This indicates that the arthropod community had responded to fertilization with a shift in community composition. The rapid recovery of arthropod diversity in the second year following tree removal suggests that the silvicultural treatments used at this site did not put long-term productivity at risk. Comparisons with other similar studies suggest that when aiming for sustainable forest management, the particular silvicultural practices that allow for ecosystem recovery may depend on local and regional conditions.

DE sustainable forest management; criteria and indicators; multi-criteria
   decision making; participatory decision making
AB This paper describes the use of multiple criteria decision making techniques as decision tools for assessing criteria and indicators designed to evaluate sustainable forest management. Three techniques called ranking, rating, and pairwise comparisons are described and used within the framework of a generic set of criteria and indicators applied in a case study involving a forest concession in Kalimantan, Indonesia. For the case study, an assessment team consisting of national and international experts representing Various disciplines was chosen to conduct an assessment of the forest concession. The criteria and indicators (C&I) developed by the Center for International Forestry Research was used as a reference. From this generic set of C&I, the assessment team made revisions to make the set more relevant to the prevailing conditions in the forest concession. This modified set was used in the assessment of the concession.
   Results from the study indicate that these techniques are effective tools both for selecting sets of criteria and indicators and eventually for prioritizing them. The methods are highly transparent, easy to understand, and offer a convenient environment for participatory decision making. These are desirable features of any evaluation process but most especially for a complex assessment problem such as forest sustainability. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Without fertilizer application intensively managed tree plantations generally have a negative nutrient balance: within one rotation more nutrients are lost from the system than gained. Constant nutrient exports result in a distinctive depletion of soil nutrient storage, To maintain a balanced nutrient budget and, thus, sustain site productivity it is necessary to compensate nutrient losses. We calculated the quantities of mineral fertilizer required to compensate management-dependent nutrient losses for a plantation site in East-Kalimantan, Indonesia. Calculations are based on estimated nutrient losses for three management scenarios: high-, medium- and low-impact management. Fertilizer compensation for nutrient losses incurred due to tree harvest will increase standard plantation establishment cost by 18-33% and total investment costs by 9-15%. Considering additional nutrient losses due to leaching and erosion as assumed for a low-impact management scenario, standard plantation establishment costs were increased by 20-35% and total investment costs increased by 9-16%, respectively. Fertilizer compensation for a high-impact management scenario, including large nutrient losses resulting from burning of residual phytomass, leaching and erosion, increased standard plantation establishment costs by 29-62%, while total investment costs increased by 13-29%. As a consequence, the internal rate of return (IRR) of the plantation investment dropped from 14% to 9-12%. We calculated major differences in the fertilizer expenses between species. Fertilization costs for Eucalyptus deglupta were generally higher than for Acacia mangium.
   Considering the high costs for fertilization, we conclude that strategies are to be developed to reduce management dependent nutrient losses. A low-impact management including alternatives to slash burning and soil-conserving harvesting techniques as well as appropriate site selection are recommended. It is advised to consider nutrient costs in investment calculations of industrial plantations. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

ID NITROGEN AVAILABILITY; QUALITY
AB We present a means to recover information about soil quality trends from data sets, such as those from long-term crop experiments, in which time series of direct measures of soil properties may be unavailable. The first objective of the paper is to develop a method to recover information about the evolution of soil quality attributes from a limited range of data. The second objective is empirical: focusing on the productivity component of soil quality, to apply a dynamic statistical estimation method to infer a measure of soil productivity and its evolution from a time series of data on yields, nutrient inputs and management techniques. The results of the empirical analysis confirm well-known input-productivity relationships, but also reveal new information about their dynamics. For example, more intensive cropping reduces soil productivity, but the dynamic effects of crop choice on productivity in a given period decline over time. N fertilizer can substitute for soil productivity in the short term, but in the long term, soil productivity decline due to intensive cultivation cannot be alleviated by higher N application rates. Simulations of soil productivity evolution across differing land management regimes reveal that continuous cropping of corn rapidly reduces soil productivity even at high N application rates, while rotational choices, especially the use of legumes, can lead to quite rapid soil productivity regeneration. Both our conceptualization of the soil productivity measure and our approach to its measurement have the advantage of making use of only limited longitudinal data. Our empirical findings convey some important implications for future research related to the sustainability of agricultural production worldwide. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Dairy cattle grazing has become popular to dairy farmers in the Northeast looking for management schemes to cut production costs. Carabidae (ground beetles) and Staphylinidae (rove beetles) are indicators of habitat disturbances, such as drainage of wetlands, or grassland for grazing animals, and their monitoring could provide one measure of ecosystem sustainability if intensive grazing management systems expand or intensify in the future. Our objective was to assess the abundance and species richness of these two beetle families under intensive grazing throughout Pennsylvania, southern New York and Vermont. We collected 4365 ground beetles (83 species) and 4,027 rove beetles (79 species) by pitfall traps in three years in Pennsylvania. Nine ground beetle species, Amara aenea, Poecilus chalcites, Pterostichus melanarius, Bembidion quadrimaculatum oppositum, Amara familiaris, Poecilus lucublandus, Agonum muelleri, Bembidion obtusum and Bembidion mimus represented 80% of the Carabidae collected.
   Five other species were new to Pennsylvania. Four rove beetle species, Philonthus cognatus, Meronera. venustula, Amischa analis, and Philonthus various = (carbonarius), comprised 74% of the total Staphylinidae collected. Yearly distributions of the dominant species did not change significantly in the three years with A. aenea and P cognatus being most abundant every year. A parasitic rove beetle, Aleochara tristis, was recovered for the first time in Pennsylvania and Vermont since its release in the 1960's to control face fly, Musca autumnalis.
   Similar results were found in New York and Vermont. We collected 1,984 ground beetles (68 species). Pterostichus melanarius was most abundant. Pterostichus vernalis was detected for the first time in the United States (Vermont). It was previously reported from Montreal, Canada. We collected 843 rove beetles (45 species). Philonthus cognatus was the most abundant rove beetle. In addition, Tachinus corticinus, previously known only from Canada, was discovered for the first time in the United States in Vermont.
   Pastures in Pennsylvania were diverse, containing 14 species of forage plants and 17 weed species. Botanical composition was similar in New York and Vermont. Sixteen species of grasses and legumes made up 90% of the plant composition and 36 species of weeds made up the remainder. This diverse plant ecosystem may explain the richness of ground and rove beetles in northeastern U.S. pastures because the heterogeneity in the plant population provided additional resources which can support a rich assemblage of beetles. Monitoring richness and abundance of Carabidae and Staphylinidae over three years in Pennsylvania suggests intensive grazing systems are ecologically sustainable.

ID FLOWSHEETING SIMULATOR; EXERGY ANALYSIS; MINIMIZATION
AB This paper attempts to quantify the sustainability of technological processes. It is based on thermodynamics with energy carriers and materials (products, waste, etc.) expressed in the same calculable quantity-exergy (Joule). The results have three considerations. One factor reflects to that extent renewable resources are used. In addition, the technological efficiency has to be accounted for as it affects sustainability. Finally, the results take into account the generation of waste products and the exergy required for converting the waste into products which are harmless or assimilable in the ecosphere. The proposed measure of sustainability has been illustrated for two types of products. In the first illustration, ethanol production was studied. Two routes were investigated, one starting from fossil oil and the other from agricultural products. Additionally, a route based on the synthesis from carbon dioxide and hydrogen was examined, in which hydrogen was generated by splitting water with electricity from photovoltaic solar energy conversion. The second product studied was electricity, generated from the combustion of natural gas or from photovoltaic solar energy conversion. The merit of the obtained results are that they treat technological sustainability not only in qualitative but also in quantitative terms. The insights obtained can help to account for sustainability in the development of new concepts of chemical technology.

TI Centralised spatial planning practice and land development realities in

DE rural development; village land-use plans; planning practice; Tanzania
AB After Independence in 1961, Tanzania realised the importance of land in rural development. Village land-use plans produced by experts in the Ministry of Lands and Settlements Development have, however, largely failed to provide the needed guidance to local authorities, village councils and small holders in their long term as well as day-to-day decisions and actions in land development. Instead land development takes place outside the scope of the existing spatial planning system. A notable outcome from that practice is a growing number of land disputes, an increased rate of environmental degradation in rural areas and emanation of land-use practices that are neither economically efficient nor environmentally sustainable.
   This paper reviews the ongoing discussion on reforming the centralised spatial planning practice so that a new system that can achieve social, economic and environmental objectives is developed. The central argument in this article is, that by equipping planners and decision makers with actual practical experience from centralised planning, contradictions between planning and reality are likely to be much more clear, and therefore may facilitate more grounded suggestions for change. Through such analysis, decision makers and planners may be in a better position to understand why centralised spatial planning practice, which has been so much supported by the government, failed to make a justifiable contribution in land development in rural settlements. This paper hopes to answer the following questions:
   What is it that spatial planners do to influence land development in villages?
   What can the villagers do in the absence of guidelines from spatial planners?
   What are the possible lessons from the planner's actions?
   To answer these questions the paper draws mainly from a research conducted by the author in the Town Planning Office in Kilimanjaro region (Lerise, 1996).(1) The paper begins with a brief historical background on the development of spatial planning in rural areas in Tanzania, in order to set the context for this analysis. The brief background is then followed by an examination of planners' activities in the regional office. After evaluating spatial planners' activities, lessons for reforming the planning system and thereby improving its practice are suggested. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Community action research is an effective mechanism to improve the relationship between research and public health practice. The Alcohol and Public Health Research Unit (APHRU) and its Maori research partner Whariki have developed practice in building partnerships with communities characterized by mutual respect of the different resources the partners bring to public health. A current APHRU/Whariki project focused on youth and drugs is a partnership with six communities in rural and urban areas throughout New Zealand, many predominantly Maori. This project illustrates a model that aims to bridge the gap between research and practice, and to improve health and well-being through working with communities to increase their capacity to deal with alcohol and drug issues, and to introduce sustainable initiatives.

TI The Nepal National Vitamin A Program: prototype to emulate or donor

SO HEALTH POLICY AND PLANNING
LA English
DT Article
ID HEALTH
AB More than 250 million of the world's children suffer from vitamin A deficiency. Nepal is one of 60 countries in which this deficiency constitutes a significant public health problem. Each year in Nepal, vitamin A deficiency is responsible for the deaths of 9000 children and for 2500 children becoming permanently blind. The Nepal National Vitamin A Program (NVAP) was begun in 1993 in eight of the country's 75 districts. By the end of 1997, the programme covered 32 districts, and by 2003 its coverage will be nationwide.
   The Nepal NVAP is considered by many to be a highly successful, model programme. It consists primarily of distributing high-dose vitamin A capsules to all children 6 to 60 months of age during twice-yearly campaigns. The capsule distribution is carried out by a previously existing network of Female Community Health Volunteers (FCHVs) that has been reinvigorated by the highly visible and universally acclaimed success of the NVAP. An important strategy of the programme has been the empowerment of the FCHVs, which has been accomplished by organizing, training and motivating community workers and other representatives from education, agriculture and other sectors, as well as political representatives, to support the FCHVs.
   The annual cost of the NVAP is US$1.7 million. It costs $1.25 to deliver two vitamin A capsules to each participant. The cost per averted death is $327. The NVAP reduces the incidence and severity of diarrhoeal disease and measles, which in turn reduces the need for Ministry of Health services, thereby annually saving the Government of Nepal $1.5 million. Factoring in these cost savings, the net annual cost of the current NVAP is $167 000, and the net annual cost of the permanent, nationwide programme is estimated at $1.1 million. The NVAP is a highly cost-effective programme. The article concludes with a discussion of the sustainability and replicability of the programme.

SO HUMAN ECOLOGY

ID VALUES
AB The Huerta de Murcia is a traditionally irrigated land located ill the middle lowland area of the Segura River around the city of Murcia, Southeast Spain. During the twentieth century several factors, such as the creation of new irrigated lands and the urbanization of traditionally irrigated lands, have changed the use of natural resources, giving rise to a growing imbalance between water resources and irrigation demands and a loss of fertile soil and other environmental and cultural values of this traditionally agricultural area. Such factors constitute environmental problems that will need to be controlled if more sustainable conditions for agriculture are to be achieved. The objectives of the present work are to develop a dynamic system model containing the main social, economic, and environmental and to use this model to explore the long-term effects of several policies designed to promote the sustainability of this agrolandscape. Some preliminary conclusions suggest that regulation and agricultural policy are not enough to stop the loss of traditionally irrigated lands and that additional water management and environmental policies are necessary.

ID AGRICULTURE
AB Initiatives intended to create alternatives to the conventional, industrialized, global food system are now emerging. Conceptual framings of alternative food systems have been based principally on the reflections of academics and policy specialists rather than on the views of the producers and eaters who constitute the bulk of the food localization movement. At a conference hosted by the Michael Fields Agricultural Institute, we explored the attributes of food system sustainability with 125 persons representing a broad cross section of the alternative farm/food community. Dividing into five discussion groups, participants were asked what the characteristics of a sustainable food system would be. From their statements we abstracted a set of attributes. Participants envisioned a sustainable food system as relational, proximate, diverse, ecologically sustainable, economically sustaining, just/ethical, sacred, knowledgeable/communicative, seasonal/temporal, healthful, participatory, culturally nourishing, and sustainably regulated. We explain these attributes and note their complementarities and tensions.

AB Community-supported agriculture (CSA) seeks to create a direct relationship between farmers and those who eat their rood-farm members or shareholders. Data from a five-year study of eight CSA farms are used to examine the perceptions and behavior of farm members in three different ways: their motivations for membership, the role of women in initiating and maintaining farm membership, and how the extent of membership participation relates to member perceptions about and commitment to their farms. We interpret the significance of our results using Gidden's concept of modernity and Etzioni's concept of communitarianism. Finally we raise questions about the long-term sustainability of CSA, given the lifestyle and needs of the farmers in tension with the constraints and competing values of shareholders.

AB The 1999 National Organic Food Production Act was enacted to establish the criteria and certification regulations that would give uniformity and credibility to organic processes and products-to define the organic label across the U.S. The promulgation of these standards has been a contentious issue, with purists pitted against pragmatists and attention focused almost exclusively on the development of a materials list for growers and manufacturers. The "organic rule" proposed in December 1997 generated widespread public protest that was also largely materials- and technology-focused. Conspicuously absent from the debate has been a critical concern over the long-term structural impacts of national standards themselves, especial ly at the regional or local level. This paper questions whether national standards designed to increase national and international commerce and thus "grow the industry" can produce anything other than a slightly "greener" version of the existing industrial agrofood system. Under these conditions, will the codification of organic undermine its capacity to support a socially and environmentally sustainable agriculture and food system? Will national standards get in the way of diverse, locally bused solutions and, in the process, will the organic mindset be represented by conforming commodities rather than by more intimate and varied connections to place?

AB For nearly 20 years, most Czech reservoirs supplying drinking water have been under statutory protection which permitted reservoir managers to manipulate fish stocks in order to maintain a sustainable water quality. The most common biomanipulative measure adopted was stocking with piscivorous fish (mostly 5 cm fry) using an annual stocking level of approx. 25 000 fish per reservoir. Nine reservoirs were studied for signs of top-down food web effects, as predicted by the trophic cascade hypothesis based on levels of total phosphorus (TP), chlorophyll a (Chl a), zooplankton biomass (ZB) and zooplankton community structure. In all nine reservoirs, only small Daphnia species were recorded, such as D. galeata and D. cucullata. The proportion of large-bodied daphnids retained on a 0.71 mm sieve was less than 10% of the total crustacean biomass in all reservoirs. The relationship of Chl a level - TP, and of ZB - Chl a, was positive under enhanced piscivory and did not differ statistically from the relationships in other reservoirs with natural fish stocks. This implies that bottom-up forces remained stronger than top-down ones in the studied reservoirs, despite the stocking of piscivorous fish. The failure of this attempt at biomanipulation may be due to an insufficient stocking rate of predatory fish and/or inadequate data on the resident planktivorous fish levels.

SO HYDROLOGICAL SCIENCES JOURNAL-JOURNAL DES SCIENCES HYDROLOGIQUES

ID LAKE VICTORIA; ADRIATIC SEA; TRENDS
AB The effects induced on the climate by human activity have become a major issue for the new millennium. In order to arrive at sustainable conclusions it is necessary, first of all, to assess and quantify natural climatic changes. In general this is done by analysing available time series. In the case of historical hydrometeorological data sets, a comparative analysis with solar cycles is not usually conducted. This work, however, demonstrates that the effect of solar cycles observed at the Equator is also visible at middle and high latitudes with multiple periodicity of the basic solar frequency (roughly 11 years). This could well be due to the interaction between solar forcing and circulation mechanisms within the atmosphere, i.e. water-air-soil interactions coupled with anthropogenic forcing. This theory has been tested by comparing different types of historical data series with the River Po discharges and cyclic appearance of slime bloom in the Adriatic Sea.

AB The effects of the early growth of plantation forestry on the biogeochemical cycling of potassium, calcium and magnesium have been investigated in a stand of 12 year old Sitka spruce and adjacent moorland growing on acid peaty podzol soils in mid Wales. Element budgets have been calculated for both systems using measurements of soil and vegetation base cation pools and fluxes. In the moorland, the magnesium budget is approximately at steady-state with no net change to the soil store whilst the soil is accumulating potassium. The calcium budget is approximately balanced but contains significant uncertainties due to between plot variability in calcium leaching losses. Afforestation has greatly increased the above-ground living biomass which holds 7 to 15 times more nutrients compared to the living aerial biomass in the moorland. With the exception of magnesium, the base cation stores within the forest soil are being depleted as the increase in atmospheric deposition due to the forest canopy provides only a small offset to the much larger accumulation of base cations within the trees. The current net rate of change in the soil store of calcium is sustainable for only 65 years. However, as the trees mature, their demand for calcium will be reduced and they should be able to 'tap' deeper sources of calcium in the soil profile as well as in the drift and regolith material.

AB The impact of fishing on chondrichthyan stocks around the world is currently the focus of considerable international concern. Most chondrichthyan populations are of low productivity relative to teleost fishes, a consequence of their different life-history strategies. This is reflected in the poor record of sustainability of target shark fisheries. Most sharks and some batoids are predators at, or near, the top of marine food webs. The effects of fishing are examined at the single-species level and through trophic interactions. We summarize the status of chondrichthyan fisheries from around the world. Some 50% of the estimated global catch of chondrichthyans is taken as by-catch, does not appear in official fishery statistics, and is almost totally unmanaged. When taken as by-catch, they are often subjected to high fishing mortality directed at teleost target species. Consequently, some skates, sawfish, and deep-water dogfish have been virtually extirpated From large regions. Some chondrichthyans are more resilient to fishing and we examine predictions on the vulnerability of different species based on their life-history and population parameters. At the species level, fishing may alter size structure and population parameters in response to changes in species abundance. We review the evidence for such density-dependent change. Fishing can affect trophic interactions and we examine cases of apparent species replacement and shifts in community composition. Sharks and rays learn to associate trawlers with food and feeding on discards may increase their populations. Using ECOSIM, we make some predictions about the long-term response of ecosystems to fishing on sharks. Three different environments are analysed: a tropical shelf ecosystem in Venezuela, a Hawaiian coral reef ecosystem, and a North Pacific oceanic ecosystem.

AB Large changes are taking place in yield-determining traits of commercially exploited fish, including traits such as size-at-age and age-at-maturation. The cause of these phenotypic changes is often not understood, and genetic change arising from the selective effects of fishing may be a contributory factor. Selection generated by fishing gear is strong in heavily exploited fish stocks, and the spatial location of fishing can also cause strong selection. The success of selective breeding in aquaculture indicates that significant amounts of genetic variation for production-related traits exist in fish populations. Fisheries managers should be alert to the evolutionary change caused by fishing, because such changes are likely to be hard to reverse and, if properly controlled, could bring about an evolutionary gain in yield.

AB A mass-balanced model of the Southern Benguela upwelling ecosystem was constructed using Ecopath. The effects of altered fishing on three abundant small pelagic fish, and on hake, are explored using Ecosim for three scenarios of top-down and bottom-up control: (1) bottom-up control of zooplanktivorous fish by zooplankton dampens effects of altered fishing; (2) wasp-waist control (top-down control of zooplankton by their predators and bottom-up control of predators by small pelagic fish) causes vigorous effects to propagate through the ecosystem; and (3) effects of mixed control (neither top-down nor bottom-up control) are intermediate between the former two scenarios. Heavier fishing may be sustainable under one scenario of control, whereas fisheries may crash if another type of control is assumed. The key to predicting ecosystem effects of fishing is understanding the way in which components of the ecosystem interact. (C) 2000 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.

AB An aggregative model of fisheries is developed in the context of the ecosystem. Rules for optimal harvesting are derived and their content is examined. An important result with obvious practical implications is that it may be optimal to pursue unprofitable fisheries in order to enhance the overall economic contribution from the ecosystem. Another interesting result is that modifications of single-species harvesting rules may be required even when there are no biological interactions between the species. The possibility of multiple equilibria and complicated dynamics and their implications for sustainability are briefly discussed. Equations for the valuation of ecosystem services are derived. Only two classes of economic instruments capable of optimal management of ecosystem fisheries have been identified so far, namely ia) corrective taxes and subsidies (Pigovian taxes) and (b) appropriately defined property rights. Of these, Pigovian taxes are informationally demanding perhaps to the point of not being feasible. In contrast, property-rights-based regimes are informationally much more efficient and therefore appear to constitute a mure promising overall approach to the management of ecosystem fisheries. The employment of the latter for the management of ecosystem fisheries is discussed and some of the implications are explored. (C) 2000 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.

ID DESIGN; PERFORMANCE
AB Space-based multicast switches use copy networks to generate the copies requested by the input packets, In this paper our interest is in the multicast switch proposed by Lee [12], The order in which the copy requests of the input ports are served is determined by the copy scheduling policy and this plays a major part in defining the performance characteristics of a multicast switch. In any slot, the sum of the number of copies requested by the active inputs of the copy network may exceed the number of output ports and some of the copy requests may need to be dropped or buffered, We First propose an exact model to calculate the overflow probabilities in an unbuffered Lee's copy network. Our exact results improve upon the Chernoff bounds on the overflow probability given by Lee by a factor of more than 10, Next, we consider buffered inputs and propose queueing models for the copy network for three scheduling policies: cyclic service of the input ports with and without fanout splitting of copy requests and acyclic service without fanout splitting. These queueing models obtain the average delay experienced by the copy requests. We also obtain the sustainable throughput of a copy network, the maximum load that can be applied to all the input ports without causing an unstable queue at any of the inputs, for the scheduling policies mentioned above.

AB A field experiment was conducted during 1993-94 to 1995-96 to study the effect of different agronomic inputs for taking good sustainable yield of mustard [Brassica juncea (L.) Czernj. & Cosson] under late-sown conditions. Maximum seed yield of mustard was recorded in all the years where all the four major agro-inputs, viz. thinning, fertilizer, irrigation and plant protection, were used as per recommendations. Considering the single factor, irrigation proved to be the most critical input in this semi-arid region, when there was no winter rains and rainfall during the season was low or normal. The reduction in the yield under no irrigation was up to 39% followed by fertilizer which contributed up to 28 % yield. During the year when rainfall was more than normal, that too up to October and was accompanied with winter rain, fertilizer contributed to the yield up to 38% and preyed the most critical. In its absence reduction in the mustard yield was up to 38 %. This was followed by plant-protection measures, as during the years of sufficient rainfall in rainy season with winter rains the infestation of diseases and pests was much more, causing great reduction in yield. Thus during the years of scanty rainfall for taking good yield of mustard, irrigation and fertilizer are the most critical inputs in this semi-add tract; whereas during the years of sufficient rainfall, fertilizer and plant-protection measures are the most critical inputs for taking good sustainable production of mustard.

AB Field studies demonstrate that there are substantial numbers of dissatisfied people in many buildings, among them those suffering from sick building syndrome (SBS) symptoms, even though existing standards and guidelines are met. The reason is that the requirements specified in these standards are rather low, allowing a substantial group of people to become dissatisfied and to be adversely affected. A paradigm shift from rather mediocre to excellent indoor environments is foreseen in the 21st century. Based on existing information and on new research results, five principles are suggested as elements behind a new philosophy of excellence: 1) better indoor air quality increases productivity and decreases SBS symptoms; 2) unnecessary indoor pollution sources should be avoided; 3) the air should be served cool and dry to the occupants; 4) "personalized air", i.e. a small amount of clean air, should be served gently, close to the breathing zone of each individual; and 5) individual control of the thermal environment should be provided. These principles of excellence are compatible with energy efficiency and sustainability.

AB Liberalisation of the Indian telecommunications services started in mid nineties with no change in the existing public monopoly structure, viz., Department of Telecommunications (DoT). In order to evaluate any proposed industry structure, it is essential to analyse the production technology of DoT so as to determine the rationale of liberalisation and sustainability of competition. Accordingly, this paper estimates a frontier multi-product translog cost function for DoT, where the cost function has been duly modified to account for the production technology of a public monopoly. The study finds that although DoT displays high allocational inefficiency, it is still a natural monopoly with very high degree of subadditivity of cost of production. This implies that the choice of any reform policy should consider the trade-off between the loss of scale and scope economies and cost saving from the reduction in inefficiency of the incumbent monopoly in the event of competition.

TI Measuring family manning service quality through client satisfaction
   exit interviews
SO INTERNATIONAL FAMILY PLANNING PERSPECTIVES
LA English
DT Article
AB Context: Because of the widely recognized importance of quality of care in the provision of family planning and sexual and reproductive health services, there is a great need to develop simple means of evaluating quality of care. Of particular interest are approaches that fake into account clients' satisfaction with their care.
   Methods: A model client exit interview developed by the international Planned Parenthood Federation, Western Hemisphere Region, was used to measure levels of client dissatisfaction with various components of quality: From 1993 through 1996 89 surveys of more than 15 000 clients were conducted in eight Latin American and Caribbean countries.
   Results: The areas of quality that most often received more than 5% negative response from clients (termed negative response cases) were waiting time (mentioned in 70% of surveys, with a mean dissatisfaction level of 20%), ease of reaching the clinic tin 54%, with an average dissatisfaction level of 12%) and price of services (47% and 10%, respectively). Using the survey results, participating family planning associations made changes to improve quality in these areas, ranging from improving appointment systems to relocating to implementing sliding fee scales. Results from 16 subsequent follow-up surveys showed a decline in each country in the number of negative response cases, as well as in the mean level of dissatisfaction. For example, in Brazil, the mean number of negative response cases per survey declined from 2. 7 to 2.2 and the mean level of dissatisfaction among them fell from 19% to 11%.
   Conclusions: Well-known problems of measuring client satisfaction may be addressed by focusing on a low threshold of dissatisfaction as a way to uncover shortcomings in service quality Although declines in dissatisfaction cannot be attributed entirely to the changes made as a result of the use of the questionnaires, client surveys can provide a quick and inexpensive way of determining areas of service where quality could be improved. These kinds of improvements will be necessary if service providers hope to become more sustainable and if they are to help clients meet their reproductive health needs.

DE criteria; indicators; sustainability; rangeland; grassland
ID ECOLOGY
AB The linking of rangeland sustainability at a national scale to the Montreal Process is a logical extension of the protocol fostering sustainable management for countries with temperate forests. The 12 signatory nations to the Santiago Declaration also possess about three-Fourths of the world's rangelands. Nearly 75% of all threatened ecosystems in the USA are either grasslands or shrublands. Globally, rangelands are at risk from numerous pressures, thus, the Montreal Process nations would have broad interest in the sustainable management of grazing lands. The first five criteria of the Montreal Process deal with biological and abiotic indicators, while the last two criteria address social, I:economic and political indicators. The following papers appraise the biological and abiotic indicators. In general, the criteria and indicators do apply to rangelands. The means for appraising specific indicators may differ from those employed for forests; however, the procedures seem to be equally successful in assessing sustainability at a national scale.

AB Rangelands provide habitat for a wide array of plants and animals and forage for both domestic and wild herbivores. Estimating the cumulative area of rangeland in a country (Indicator 10) is complicated by how rangeland is defined and the scale at which range sites occur and are classified. Determining biomass production available for grazing (Indicator 11) including plantations and seedings of native and exotic plants including cultivars (Indicator 12), and the amount of sustainable annual biomass removal (Indicator 13), and the removal of non-rangeland (similar or equal to non-livestock) products (Indicator 14) is also difficult. Nevertheless, these indicators are just as applicable for monitoring sustainable management of rangelands as they are for forests. Productivity also varies with seral stage. Inclusion of multiple seral stages across the landscape generally increases the diversity of plant and animal species that occupy the landscape. Sometimes degraded landscapes require restorative practices; plant materials are available for rehabilitation plantings.

AB Criterion 4 of the Montreal Process addresses the conservation of soil and water resources as a way to assess the sustainability of a nation's forests. For the most part, the indicators under this criterion are relevant to rangelands. The area and percent of rangeland with significant soil erosion apply equally well to both biomes. Percent of streams with flow rates and timing outside its range of historical variation is also equally important, although a measure of proper functioning and condition may provide a better measure of the indicator. The area and percent of rangeland with diminished soil productive capability because of a loss of reduced organic matter or changed physical characteristics can be useful indicators locally and regionally.

AB The daily farm is a 'Food Manufacturing Facility'. Everyday it produces raw milk, dairy beef and liquid and solid nutrients. Since food safety begins on the farm, this mini-ecosystem must be managed on a daily basis for animal health and well-being, public health, environmental health and the financial well-being of the operation. An approach, termed Dairy Breakthrough Management, has been developed as a way to bring HACCP (Hazard Analysis Critical Control Points) principles to the farm and create a personnel infrastructure that can identify problems before they occur, then implement sustainable programmes to address the issues. This is accomplished through team building, proactive listening, problem solving and process management. This presentation will discuss the genesis of this programme and how it is being successfully implemented on dairy farms.

The model predicts overall participation levels and the individual and collective flows and compositions of the materials diverted into the compost bin. The take up of home composting by new composters and the drop-out of existing composters are modelled through invoking staged or random discrete events which perturb the model attitudes, and other attributes held by individual householders. An attitude-behaviour model then determines whether these attitude changes result in behavioural change. Post-event evaluations of the compost produced are simulated by integrating an empirical, technical model of the composting process into the behavioural model. This was accomplished by matching the input/output requirements of the two models via a common vector of material flow, and by feeding back the technical process quality monitoring data into the social model, as instances of discrete events. The simulation results are compared with survey data, and simulation results are presented to predict the longer-term sustainability of home composting within the community.

AB Dry rangelands in the Syrian steppe have been degraded by overgrazing and incursions of barley cultivation. Replanting with Atriplex spp. (salt-bush) is recommended for rehabilitation; but, for land already ploughed, growing barley between atriplex hedges may be the best compromise, providing complementary feed sources and soil protection against wind erosion. The trial described here measured the biomass output of barley and atriplex browse material in a range of treatments, in which hedge dimensions and crop-strip widths were varied in partial factorial combination. Results over 6 years showed little interaction between hedges and barley crop, but growing the two together tended to buffer total feed output against annual fluctuations due to rainfall variability. An apparent decline in atriplex vigour towards the end of the study period drew attention to the need to optimize browsing pressure on the shrubs. Altogether, the indications are that barley-atriplex systems have potential to provide sustainable production in currently degraded steppe areas, but essential conditions for success will be full control of land access and skilled management of atriplex shrubs.

DT Article
ID SOUTHERN LEVANT
AB Long-term human impact on the environment is a subject of debate among archaeologists in the Near East. Two issues are of central importance to anthropology in this debate. First, what factors have led people to degrade their environment? Second, how have people responded to degradation? The present paper uses a Geographic Information System (GIS) and spatial statistical analyses to address these issues in the Wadi al Hasa, west-central Jordan. Tests of spatial segregation suggest that Fast populations made settlement decisions based on immediate concerns such as agricultural productivity and prevailing political climate. Conversely, long-term trends indicate that settlement success was predicated on terrain factors affecting sustainability at the expense of proximity to permanent water sources.

AB In this paper, we investigate three central issues in public finance. First, was the path of public debt sustainable during 1947-1992? Second, how has the government balanced the budget after shocks to either revenues or expenditures were observed? Third, are expenditures exogenous? The results show that (i) debt is sustainable in econometric tests, with the budget being balanced almost entirely through changes in taxes, regardless of the cause of the initial imbalance. Expenditures are weakly exogenous; (ii) the behavior of a "rational" Brazilian consumer may be consistent with Ricardian Equivalence; (iii) seigniorage revenues are critical in restoring intertemporal budget equilibrium.

AB We study the debt dynamics and sustainable debt for an open economy which borrows from abroad in order to finance consumption. To service the debt the country may exploit a renewable resource. We show that there is for every resource stock R a critical level B*(R) of debt above which debt tends to infinity but below which it may be steered to zero. We demonstrate how to compute B*(R) using an ODE of steepest descent. If the economy maximizes a discounted integral of utility depending on consumption and the resource stock, the critical debt B*(R) may be reached in finite time, In such a situation slight perturbations of the optimal consumption lead to insolvency. The maximum principle ceases to be valid in this case. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved. JEL classification. C61; F32; F34; O16.

TI A stepwise life cycle engineering methodology for the clean design of
   large made to order products
SO JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper describes the stepwise life cycle engineering methodology for the clean design of large made to order (LMTO) products under development at the Engineering Design Centre, University of Newcastle upon Tyne, UK. LMTO products, such as offshore platforms, ships and power stations, have particular environmental implications due to their size, cost, long life spans, high public visibility and their potential for ecological/civil disaster. The methodology uses a stepwise approach to apply life cycle costing,life cycle assessment (environmental impact estimation) and risk assessment to an inventory model of the product. Both the inventory model and the analyses increase in complexity as the design progresses. The methodology extends the LMTO product life cycle model to include a long-term 'legacy' phase to address the intergenerational equity principle of sustainable development.

AB Ethnobotanical information relevant to the management of savanna vegetation was obtained through interviews with 57 elderly villagers living near Delta du Saloum National Park, Senegal. Local people had observed a change in the local environment from forest to savanna during their lifetime and considered it primarily a result of frequent intensive fires and declining rainfall. Most people preferred the woody vegetation to be dense. In particular, nine woody species were useful for construction, 10 for protection in agricultural fields, 19 for medicine and 10 for livestock fodder. Some of the locally highly preferred species were also considered to be declining in the local environment, they included Cordyla pinnata, Pterocarpus erinaceus, Daniellia oliveri, Parkia biglobosa, Khaya senegalensis and Pericopsis laxiflora. Highly preferred and declining species were characteristically large trees, non-thorny, with edible fruits and of Sudano-Guinean to Guinean affinity. The study furthermore identified a close coincidence between the interest in conserving tree species diversity in protected areas and the priorities of local people which included preservation of plenty of large frees (including many fruit trees), maintenance of a variety of species, improvement of woody regeneration, and reduction of fire intensity and frequency. Focusing management strategies on increasing populations of such declining and highly preferred species, by active fire protection for instance, would enhance the natural resource value considerably and thereby the quality of life for the local people.

AB Containment of overpressured fluids in areas of strong fluid release depends critically on the stress state and the brittle infrastructure within capping layers. Maximum overpressure is controlled by hydraulic extension fracturing only under low differential stress in the absence of throughgoing faults that are well-oriented for frictional reactivation. Elsewhere, overpressure is buffered by fault-valve action accompanying shear failure along existing or new-forming faults and is substantially lower than that required for hydrofracturing, decreasing with increasing differential stress. For equivalent brittle failure modes at the same depth and differential stress, maximum overpressure is always higher in compressional than in extensional regimes. Transitions in the tectonic stress state (e.g. positive or negative inversion), by changing mean stress (governed by critically stressed faults) and maximum sustainable overpressure, may thus induce regional episodes of fluid redistribution. Effects are likely to be most pronounced when the stress transition takes place rapidly. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The online database industry has annual sales of US$6.5 billion for a product that can be easily appropriated, duplicated, reused, and redistributed. This paper examines how the industry developed dynamic pricing and delivery strategies as a response to technological and market changes, and shows how each strategy specifically compensated for the public good properties of information. Readers will see that specific pricing strategies reduce the incentive to improperly reuse downloaded information. Thus, these strategies can lead to the sustainability and growth of the online database industry. These findings are then extended to the broader context of information delivery via the Internet.

SO JOURNAL OF PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT

DT Article
AB The mean-variance approach permits the evaluation of portfolio strategies without otherwise first specifying preferences about risk. It is not well suited, however, to investors who must make periodic withdrawals from their investments. This includes endowment funds, foundations, and individuals after they retire. Expected utility models have been applied to such situations, but they have been difficult for practitioners to implement since preferences must be specified beforehand. By assuming such investors want to make sustainable withdrawals, the author develops a simple model for evaluating investment choices over time without making any further assumptions about preferences. Various factors that affect the size and sustainability of the withdrawals are explored.

AB Restoration of the oyster Crassostrea virginica resource to the Chesapeake Bay is a widely supported goal. This manuscript explores the questions of why, how, and in what time frame this should be attempted. Restoration goals based simply on support of a commercial fishery fail to address the role of the oyster as a cornerstone species within the Chesapeake Bay and should only be considered in the context of a long-term sustainable fishery exploitation. The argument is proffered that a restored resource sustaining a fishery at the historical harvest level is unrealistic, because: (1) harvest probably exceeded biological production for much of the recorded history of exploitation; and (2) maximum production, a desired end for fishery support, occurs at approximately half the maximum (virgin, unexploited) biomass, and, thus, can only be achieved with disruption of the virgin complex community structure. Thus, the direct harvest economic value of a fishery based on a restored resource will not reach historical levels if there is an accompanying goal of long-term community development that is self-sustaining in the absence of restoration effort. The role of the oyster as a cornerstone organism and the pivotal link in benthic-pelagic coupling is examined in the context of current and projected watershed management problems, including agricultural and urban development with associated nutrient and sediment erosion issues, in the entire Chesapeake Bay watershed. Restoration efforts to date have focused on rebuilding three-dimensional reef structures, often with subsequent oyster broodstock enhancement, in predominantly small estuaries with retentive circulation to provide demonstration of increased resultant recruitment. Such examples are used to increase public awareness of the success of restoration processes and increase long-term participation in such programs by schools, nonprofit and civic organizations, and commercial and recreational fishing groups.

AB Oyster reef restoration, protection, and construction are important to meeting harvest, water quality, and fish habitat goals. However, the strategies needed to achieve harvest and conservation goals have often been considered to be at odds. We argue that these goals are. in fact, compatible and that the same strategies will promote a sustainable harvest of the resource, increased filtration of estuarine waters, and increased provision of structured habitat for finfish, crabs, and other organisms that utilize oyster reefs or receive benefit indirectly from them. Creation or designations of unharvested sites (refuge sites) are key components of these strategies. Unharvested reefs have the potential to provide vertical relief, which is typically destroyed by harvest practices, to act as a source of larvae, which potentially increases the supply of harvestable oysters, and to protect those individuals most likely to have some resistance to disease. Furthermore. proper monitoring and design of refuge and restoration efforts are critical to providing information needed to improve the success of future restoration efforts, and will simultaneously enhance the basic information needed to understand the ecology of oysters and their role in estuarine and coastal systems.

AB Shellfish management and restoration efforts in Rhode Island date back to the late 19th century. From the late 1890s to the Second World War the Rhode Island Fisheries Commission operated a lobster hatchery in Wickford Harbor in response to a perceived decline in lobster catches in Narragansett Bay. Berried lobsters were collected, eggs hatched, larvae reared, and postlarval fifth stage juveniles were released to the bay. The project was discontinued primarily because of costs and a failure to demonstrate the efficacy of juvenile seeding in improving lobster catches. From the 1930s to the 1980s, there have been several similar efforts to establish hatcheries to produce juvenile bivalve mollusks for public and private reseeding efforts, but none of these efforts were economically sustainable. The longest running efforts to improve shellfisheries have been stare programs to relay northern quahogs, Mercenaria mercenaria, from dense population assemblages in waters closed to shellfishing. Large-scale relays began in the 1950s in response to heavy fishing pressure but ended in the 1960s when commercial power dredging for shellfish was banned in Narragansett Bay. A small-scale state program existing since the late 1970s pays a modest fee to supervised shellfishers for hand digging quahogs in closed waters and planting them in management areas for depuration and eventual harvest. The amounts of shellfish relayed annually has varied widely since 1977, ranging between 7 and 322 metric tonnes, with an average of 98 metric tonnes per year. A new relay program has been underway since 1997. It involves assessing the shellfish stocks in the closed Providence River and hiring dredge boats to relay shellfish into down bay management areas. Based on maximum sustainable yield (MSY) considerations, annual relays should not exceed 10.3% of the standing crop (or 2721 metric tonnes) in the Providence River. An effort to restore lobsters onto monitored artificial reefs is underway using settlement funds from a 1989 oil spill in Narragansett Bay. Finally, the Rhode Island Public Benefit Aquaculture Project. a joint educational effort with commercial fisheries involvement, is involving secondary level students in the nursery culture of shellfish (though marina-based upwellers) for seeding of public shellfish beds.

AB Intense population growth, associated nonpoint source pollution, competing uses of the estuaries (e.g., pristine views, recreation) and increased regulatory scrutiny associated with the Endangered Species Act and the Sustainable Fisheries Act are jeopardizing the survival of West Coast shellfish farmers. The Pacific Coast Shellfish Growers Association (PCSGA) has recognized that to maintain a niche for shellfish amongst all these competing interests, growers need to be proactive on several fronts. PCSGA members are encouraged to get involved with local watershed planning committees, growth management planning, Soil Conservation Districts, environmental groups, and other watershed stakeholder groups, and to educate others on the value of shellfish as part of a healthy ecosystem. Shellfish farmers are also being encouraged to "walk the talk." It is no longer adequate to go to hearings, profess shellfish as the "canaries in the mineshaft," and ask everyone upstream to fix the problems. Shellfish growers are being asked to review and improve their overall environmental performance. PCSGA is embarking on an effort to develop a coastwide Environmental Code of Practice (Best Management Practices) for shellfish farming. PCSGA is also exploring the development of the Environmental Code of Practice into a programmatic Habitat Conservation Plan to provide regulatory stability under the Endangered Species Act and impending salmonid listings. The Pacific Shellfish Institute (PSI), the research arm of PCSGA, is pursuing funding for shellfish ecosystem research as a high priority. Being proactive and establishing the industry as the most responsible user group in the ecosystem will assure that shellfish farming survives into the new millennium.

AB The heritage and culture of rural communities along Florida's Big Bend coastline in the Gulf of Mexico have been linked intrinsically a with commercial fisheries for generations. Over the past decade, closures of oyster harvesting grounds and a state-imposed ban on gill nets triggered economic decline and depression in this area. A transition to shellfish aquaculture as an alternative employment opportunity has been facilitated through the recent federally funded, job-retraining programs. Since 1993 when the first program graduates were placed with leases, the industry has grown and now supports over 300 hard clam. Mercenaria mercenaria (Linnnaeus, 1758), growout operations on 950 acres of state-owned submerged lands with sales (farm gate value) estimated at $10 million in 1997. The promise of prosperity has created a new excitement and common bond among the individuals of these communities. With a renewed sense of purpose and cohesion, people are working together to promote their livelihoods, and above all, to protect the coastal waters so critical to the success of these ventures. This revitalization has also spurred a reaction and responsiveness to the emergent industry by local governments and by state and federal agencies. Citizens of Cedar Key have formed advisory groups to work closely with elected officials and agency representatives in the planning and implementation of a wide range of water quality activities. These include storm water and wastewater treatment, environmental education, and water quality monitoring programs. Sustainable hard-clam aquaculture operations have proven to be an excellent opportunity to both protect and preserve the region's environmental qualities as well as support economic activity.

AB Better Assessment Science Integrating Point and Nonpoint Sources (BASINS) is a geographic-based watershed assessment tool developed by EPA's Office of Water to help states more efficiently target and evaluate water-bodies that are not meeting water quality standards. BASINS (EPA, 1996a, 1998) brings together data on water quality and quantity, land uses, point source loadings, and other related spatial data with supporting nonpoint and water quality models at a quicker and more effective pace. EPA developed BASINS, to better integrate point and nonpoint source water quality assessments for the Nation's 2100+ watersheds. In its zeal to achieve this endpoint, EPA has initiated a simplistic approach that was expected to grow through scientific enhancements as TMDL developers become more familiar with modeling requirements. BASINS builds upon federal databases of water quality conditions and point source loadings for numerous parameters where quality assurance is suspect in some cases. Its design allows comprehensive assessments and modeling in typical Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) computations. While the TMDL utility is the primary reason BASINS was developed, other longer-range water quality assessments will become possible as the Agency expands the suite of assessment models and databases in future releases. The simplistic approach to modeling and user-friendly tools gives rise, however, to technical and philosophical concerns related to default data usage. Seamless generation of model input files and the failure of some utilities to work properly suggest to NCASI that serious problems may still exist and prompts the need for a more rigorous peer-review. Furthermore, sustainable training becomes paramount, as some older modelers will be unfamiliar with Geographic Information System (GIS) technology and associated computer skills. Overall, however, BASINS was judged to be an excellent beginning tool to meet the complex environmental modeling needs in the 21st Century.

TI Demography of rural foxes (Vulpes vulpes) in relation to cull intensity
   in three contrasting regions of Britain

AB The impact of deliberate culling of fox populations has been much debated. Although a local (< 10 km(2)) impact has been accepted, previous authors have denied that culling has any impact on a larger scale because local losses are compensated through immigration. Rather, it has been claimed that at this scale fox density is determined by resources, mediated through social behaviour and breeding suppression. We determined the impact of culling on a regional scale (>1000 km(2)), using data on culling (Heydon & Reynolds, 2000), fox density (Heydon, Reynolds & Short, 2000) and productivity. The three U.K. study regions (size 1238-2322 km(2)) were in mid-Wales (A), the east Midlands (B) and East Anglia (C). High productivity in regions A and C was associated with low density, high culling mortality and high overall mortality (all relative to region B), indicating that density was suppressed by culling. In region B (moderate) breeding suppression was associated with a higher density and lower cull than in regions A and C, implying that fox density was closer to the maximum sustainable by resources. We conclude that the impact of culling in different regions of Britain is variable, dependent on the regional prevalence, methods, and history of culling. However, it is clear that in a range of circumstances culling can substantially depress fox numbers, and that current fox densities reflect a history of culling. This conclusion is fundamental in considering the management of fox predation in farming and conservation contexts.

ID GOVERNANCE; GOVERNMENT
AB Local authorities in the UK have come under renewed pressure from central government both to adopt Local Agenda 21 and to advance participative democracy. In late 1996/early 1997, the (then) new unitary authority of Bath and North-East Somerset Council set rip a Local Agenda 21 Issue Commission to review its 'sustainability' performance and policy development practice with the direct involvement of the community. The way in which the commission was conceived and conducted resulted in difficulties in identifying and carrying out its task. Nonetheless, it kick-started significant steps towards LA 21 within the council, and provided valuable insights into LA 21 implementation, and the nature of meaningful consultation.

TI Philippine coral reefs under threat: Lessons learned after 25 years of
   community-based reef conservation
SO MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
LA English
DT Article
ID MANAGEMENT
AB The Philippine archipelago consists of more than 7000 islands. Most of these islands have extensive coral reefs or coral communities. For centuries, reefs and their associated resources have provided the livelihood for a large portion of the coastal population. However, reefs as sources of income are threatened by over-exploitation and by the use of destructive fishing methods. The scientific community, natural resource managers and many of the small-scale fishermen are aware that catches are falling rapidly while the fast growing population requires increasing amounts of fish. Since the early 1970s, various programs have tried to counter the decline of Philippine coastal resources, This article reports about successful examples of reef conservation in the provinces of Negros Oriental, Batangas and the Tubbataha Reef National Marine Park, Palawan, In all three localities, significant areas of reefs are legally protected and sustainable management regimes are working effectively. In Negros and Batangas this success is partly a result of intensive education programs that contributed to the active involvement of the traditional fishermen and the larger coastal community, Community participation and co-operation of all institutions involved in resource management are regarded as the key elements of sustainable reef management in these areas. This paper presents the objectives, programs and achievements as well as the fruitful networking of the participating organizations. Particular emphasis is placed on the experiences and lessons emanating from 25 years of reef conservation while showing the overall objective of sustainable use is still far on the horizon, It is suggested that more integrated forms of management, involving various stakeholders, and that address the numerous intertwined issues, will save Philippine reefs.

AB Chronic heart failure (CHF) is a highly prevalent condition associated with serious morbidity, intense levels of health services use, and shortened survival. It is also a condition for which ameliorative therapies exist. The evidence indicates that there is substantial need to change clinical practice and health care delivery for people with CHF and thereby improve their outcomes. The goal of the Veterans Affairs (VA) Quality Enhancement Research Initiative in CHF (CHF QUERI) is to create measurable, rapid, and sustainable improvements in quality of care and health outcomes of veterans with heart failure. This article describes the current state of knowledge and practice in fare for people with CHF. Using the framework of the 5 steps of the QUERI process, we point out the gaps in research and practice that must be filled if the CHF QUERI is to achieve its goal. We relate our recommendations for how the VA can put its research and administrative infrastructure to work to fill the gaps. Lessons learned about CHF in the course of the CHF QUERI will be applicable to all people with heart failure and to all health care systems-VA as well as non-VA-that care for them.

TI Middle Rio Grande regional water resource planning: The pitfalls and the
   promises
SO NATURAL RESOURCES JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
AB This article relates the efforts of a diverse group of resource stakeholders, known as the Middle Rio Grande Water Assembly, who voluntarily tackled the daunting task of formulating and implementing a sustainable water management plan for this arid region of the country. Following a policy of openness and inclusion, the group must navigate the resource planning process through many problem areas born of the landscape and climate and the subsequent effect on the three distinct cultures that inhabit the region. The article lays out the natural and institutional limitations circumscribing available solutions. Tension between conservationists and developers, municipal use and agricultural use, historic allocation and modern needs, or any of the many competing interests create pitfalls that could derail the deliberative, problem-solving process. The great hope for the process, however, lies in the Assembly's efforts to provide a non-threatening environment in which to develop lines of communication for competing stakeholders to engender cooperation.

AB Cover cropping, hedgerow intercropping, additional food-crop cropping and combinations of these with monocropping were studied as whole systems in S.E. Asia. The benefits of each system in terms of nutrient retention or supply, the sustainability of levels of organic matter and fertility were assessed, along with the financial rewards or penalties and the constraints to adoption of each cropping system in terms of extra labour, conflicts with off-farm labour and farmers' attitudes.
   Leguminous pre- and post-crops such as groundnut increased the yield of a food crop and provided enough marketable produce itself to increase a farmer's income significantly. The residues also helped maintain levels of soil organic carbon and nitrogen in soil. Analysis suggested a good price for the secondary crop to be key, however, as is sufficient water to grow it and availability of or tenure on the land for a farmer to be willing to invest. Hedgerow intercropping boosted soil fertility but did not increase incomes sufficiently, monocropping was profitable but yields and soil fertility declined rapidly. Monocropping remains popular with farmers with little land or without tenure, however. N-2-fixation was sufficient to match offtake in a moderately yielding food-crop in these systems; more intensive production requires additional input. Overall leguminous secondary cropping has the least against it of the improved cropping systems investigated and probably stands the best chance of bring adopted by farmers in the region.

SO NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
DE New Zealand; high country; fertiliser; sustainability; carrying capacity
AB Annual sheep-grazing-days over 14 years is reported for two grazed, mixed-species pasture trials on a Pukaki/Tekapo high-country soil. One compared 30 combinations of 5 superphosphate rates (0-500 kg ha(-1) yr(-1)) x 3 stocking rates x 2 stocking methods; the other compared 27 combinations of P and S fertiliser (0-100 kg element ha(-1) yr(-1)). Carrying capacity increased with both S and P fertiliser from 2.3 grazing-days/365 ha(-1) yr(-1) with zero fertiliser, to 20.9 under high fertiliser and irrigation. Carrying capacity was 11-27% less under sustained or set-stocking than under mob stocking, the difference increasing with mean carrying capacity. There were several time trends in carrying capacity: a year to year fluctuation related to positive effects of Sep-Dec rainfall and negative effect with March temperature; the difference between treatments increasing in good years; an increase or decrease to asymptote carrying capacity dependent on P fertiliser rate; and an increasing positive effect of S fertiliser.

ID EMPLOYMENT; BANKING; BRITAIN; CENTERS; WORK
AB The growth of white-collar jobs in call centres has been a significant feature of the last decade. Local and regional economic development agencies have sought to attract call centres because they are a source of new jobs, and help to ameliorate the decline in employment, especially in the manufacturing sector. This paper examines the work provided in call centres, based on a case study of North East England. Call centres are characterized by a narrow range of occupations and skills, and the work regime in them is intense. The majority of the jobs are taken by women. An assessment of the long term sustainability of call centre work also highlights threats to employment from technical developments in the industry. Nevertheless, there is some evidence of limited improvements taking place in training and work practices in call centres.

SO REGIONAL STUDIES

ID LEARNING REGION
AB In recent years, there has been considerable debate over the consequences of globalization for local economic development. For some, globalization is seen as strengthening the position of transnational corporations (TNCs) and core regions over branch plant regions. For others globalization offers opportunities for the latter to create local advantages, particularly if they can construct more effective 'learning' relationships with the branch plants of transnational corporations. This paper contributes to this debate through a case study of the Aberdeen oil complex in the North East of Scotland. It suggests that while there are opportunities for branch plant regions to upgrade their activities in the short term, they still face huge structural problems in creating more sustainable forms of competitive advantage.

AB Detailed forest ecosystem classifications have been developed for large regions of northern Ontario, Canada. These ecosystem classifications provide tools for ecosystem management that constitute part of a larger goal of integrated management of forest ecosystems for long-term sustainability. These classification systems provide detailed stand-level characterization of forest ecosystems at a local level. However, for ecological approaches to forest management to become widely accepted by forest managers, and for these tools to be widely used, methods must be developed to characterize and map or model ecosystem classes at landscape scales for large regions. In this study, the site-specific Northwestern Ontario Forest Ecosystem Classification (NWO FEC) was adapted to provide a landscape-scale (1:20 000) forest ecosystem classification for the Rinker Lake Study Area located in the boreal forest north of Thunder Bay, Ontario. High spatial resolution remote sensing data were collected using the Compact Airborne Spectrographic Imager (CASI) and analyzed using geostatistical techniques to obtain an understanding of the nature of the spatial dependence of spectral reflectance for selected forest ecosystems at high spatial resolutions. Based on these analyses it was determined that an optimal size of support for characterizing forest ecosystems (i.e., optimal spatial resolution), as estimated by the mean ranges of a series of experimental variograms, differs based on (i) wavelength, (ii) forest ecosystem class, and (iii) mean maximum canopy diameter (MMCD). In addition, maximum semivariance as estimated from the sills of the experimental variograms increased with density of understory. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 2000.

AB The ascidian Ecteinascidia turbinata synthesizes some of the most promising substances against solid-type tumors, but the only available source are the natural populations of this tunicate, which is reared or collected in different parts of the world. A total of 33 locations were sampled in the Gulf of Mexico and the Yucatan Peninsula. The tunicate was not found in Veracruz, Tabasco and Campeche but it was well established on mangrove roots in the Yucatan peninsula where we estimated densities more or less equal to one colony and an average production of 115 g of biomass per lineal meter of mangrove coastline in one location (Rio Lagartos). Sustainable management appears to be possible.

TI Dry season bovine fasciolosis in Northwestern part of Ethiopia
SO REVUE DE MEDECINE VETERINAIRE
LA English
DT Article

ID GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION-SYSTEM; OVINE FASCIOLIASIS; HIGHLANDS
AB Features of dry season bovine fasciolosis were studied in North Gondar area, Northwest Ethiopia. Out of the total 2226 cattle examined, 774 (33.42 %) were found positive on qualitative coproscopy. The overall herd egg output (EP2G) was 81.16 +/- 0.11. The herd infection prevalence, as estimated from the egg-shedding index, was 41.22 +/- 4.38. In all the above measurements, the monthly values significantly decreased (p < 0.05) along with the progression of the dry season (November through April) and with an increase of age. The abattoir-based study on older stocks revealed an overall fasciolosis prevalence rate of 90.65 %, without any statistically discernible variation (p > 0.05) between study months. Infections due to Fasciola hepatica, F. gigantica and by both fluke species occur in the order of 67.14 %, 14.1 % and 18.77 %, respectively. Moderately affected livers present the highest mean fluke count (112.73 +/- 2.3) followed by severely (61 +/- 2.2) and lightly (32.09 +/- 2.72) affected ones signifying the presence of acquired resistance and local tissue reaction as chronicity of infection supervenes.
   The present study suggests that high fasciolosis pathogenesity is present in the study area, justifying at least one obligatory strategic treatment during the dry season. In addition, as compared with classical coproscopic methods, egg-shedding index was found to be a relatively robust parameter in estimating herd infection prevalence, hence recommended for use in future field investigations and monitoring programmes in the tropics where resource limitations often curtail uses of improved diagnostic techniques. Further detailed study could provide valuable information that foster local planning and implementation of a more sustainable fasciolosis control strategy for Northwest Ethiopia.

TI Coming back across the fence: Masculinity and the transition to
   sustainable agriculture
SO RURAL SOCIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB In this paper we explore the social construction of agricultural masculinity and its role in the transition to sustainable agriculture. We draw our evidence from a participatory qualitative study comparing members of the sustainable agriculture group Practical Farmers of Iowa (PFI) with their non-PFI neighbors. On the non-PFI farms, men more often represented what we call monologic masculinity, a conventional masculinity with rigid and polarized gender expectations and strictly negotiated performances that make a clear distinction between men's and women's activities. The male farmers belonging to PFI, on the other hand, more often represented what we call dialogic masculinity, characterized by different measures for work and success than in monologic masculinity, less need for control over nature, and greater social openness. Although both are present to some extent in all male participants, we argue that acceptance of a more dialogic masculinity helps promote the transition to sustainable agriculture.

TI Producing more with less? Community forestry in Durango, Mexico in an
   era of trade liberalization
SO RURAL SOCIOLOGY

DT Article
ID COMMON PROPERTY RESOURCES; COLLECTIVE ACTION; MANAGEMENT
AB Through a qualitative case study of peasant-organized forestry in Durango, Mexico, this paper examines how neoliberal policy reform is reshaping the community forestry sector. Post-1992 agrarian and forestry laws facilitate the emergence of new forms of association in ejidos (collective property communities created by agrarian reform) and agrarian communities, and reorganize the delivery of forestry technical services. These developments indirectly undermine peasants' capacity to deal with the sector's long-standing internal problems, putting at risk their ability to provide themselves with the services they need for sustainable community livelihoods and forest exploitation. Nevertheless, this study of a forest peasant federation shows that institutional change is a process peopled by groups of social agents who respond creatively to external structure from local organizational and community contexts. Ethnographic methods can be used fruitfully to study complex interactions between multiple levels of political-economic structure and local action, which both constrain and provide opportunities for the organization of common-pool resource management regimes.

AB Planning of infrastructures typically involves many organizations with conflicting interests and diverging control over crucial issues, such as technological and social safety, economic potential, and environmental concerns. Traditional planning assumes that all conflicts must, and can, be resolved and that the resulting master plan represents a compromise solution being carried by all parties. In this paper we apply a new methodological approach which departs from this unrealistic assumption. Instead of aiming at resolving all conflicts, we try to manage all planning conflicts by searching for an optimal exchange of control which minimizes the remaining differences among the planning organizations. The focus is on analyzing dependencies among different actors involved in the planning process. We discuss the application of this approach to the urban center melioration project for Alphen on the Rhine, in The Netherlands. Fourteen actors, representing seven planning agencies, governmental departments, and business associations, participated in a workshop for the urban center amelioration project for Alphen on the Rhine (NL). The applied methodology allowed the participants to gain insights in their mutual dependencies. Moreover, post-workshop analysis allowed us to conclude that the current configuration of actors and issues provides little potential to reduce the tension caused by conflicting planning objectives. The most important recommendation to the urban center amelioration project for Alphen on the Rhine (NL) is to broaden their approach to include additional actors and planning issues.

AB We propose a participatory approach for conceptualizing and implementing research-based interventions that has as its primary aim the development of acceptable and sustainable change efforts. The Participatory Intervention Model (PIM), rooted in participatory action research, provides a mechanism for integrating theory, research, and practice and for promoting involvement of stakeholders in intervention efforts. We present evidence of PIM's capacity for promoting intervention acceptability, drawing on our research experiences in international sexual-risk prevention work. We conclude with a discussion of PIM's potential for bridging the gap between research and practice, addressing cultural diversity, fostering partnerships, promoting disciplined reflective practice, and integrating the multiple roles of the school psychologist.

AB The 1992 collapse of the northern cod undermined a centuries-old way of life in Newfoundland. This ecological change has had broad social consequences, especially the loss of livelihoods for people and places that possess few alternative resources. Using a biology-based model, we explore possible paths to fishery recovery under a range of policy scenarios. Recovery could take decades, even under an absolute fishing ban. Recovery with substantial growth in jobs can be achieved under "precautionary" low-fishing policies. High-fishing policies initially create more jobs, bur eventually crash the resource. Interactions between social and biological systems create a policy trap. Developments since the 1992 moratorium show the force of this trap and offer an explanation for why no recovery has yet been seen. Model results highlight the importance of level and rime, as specifics that give content to the widely discussed goal of sustainability.

AB The concept of sustainable development suggests that soil quality should be measured on the basis of the most environmentally sensitive properties of native soils under climax vegetation. The most relevant properties are biochemical. We describe the general biochemical parameters of the O and Ah horizons of 40 native Umbrisols under climax Atlantic oakwood in Galicia (NW Spain). The properties studied were: microbial biomass C (O horizons 1935 +/- 450 mg C kg(-1), Ah horizons 781 +/- 753 mg C kg(-1)), N flush (68 +/- 20 and 26 +/- 13 mg kg(-1)), soil respiration (12.9 +/- 4.5 and 2.6 +/- 0.8 mu g CO2-C g(-1) h(-1)), ATP (8.91 +/- 3.20 and 2.77 +/- 1.38 mu g g(-1)), dehydrogenase activity (555 +/- 205 and 207 +/- 58 nmol INTF g(-1) h(-1)), catalase activity (3.9 +/- 1.1 and 2.0 +/- 0.9 mmol H2O2 consumed g(-1) h(-1)), N mineralization capacity (113 +/- 66 and 30 +/- 13 mg N kg(-1) 10 d(-1)), and arginine ammonification rate (11.1 +/- 5.9 and 4.9 +/- 2.2 mu g N-NH4+ g(-1) h(-1)). The values reported are generally within the ranges found in the literature. The correlations between biochemical parameters and chemical variables show in these soils microbial population size and activity directly related to both organic matter and available nutrient contents.

AB Parent material and pumiceous alluvial soils, located in a tropical region of Mexico, were studied to supply information on soil suitability for agricultural production in the context of sustainable agriculture. In recent alluvial soils. an understanding of how soil characteristics vary with patent material and topography provides a basis for determining land utilization type, land suitability as well as land quality. The main objective of this study was to establish the relationship of soil properties to parent material in west Nayarit, Mexico, Field studies were initiated in 1993 by a request for technical assistance from the Comision Federal de Electricidad. The studied soils were derived from pumice that has been reworked and mixed with detrital material from other sources. We found that such soils have unique physical, chemical and mineralogical characteristics that are rarely found in soils derived from other parent materials. Data for two selected alluvial soil profiles are presented. These soils were developed on Holocene volcanogenic pumiceous alluvial river ter-races and river floodplains, under current udicisohyperthermic soil-climate conditions. The agronomic properties, tillage influences and fertilizer requirements of these soils have been studied extensively. To maximize their productivity and minimize deterioration, proper management must be based on an understanding of the unique physical, chemical and mineralogical properties. Results indicate that such soils have physical properties that provide a good environment for deep rooting and can supply the water necessary for vigorous plant growth. In both soils, water retention at 33 and 1500 kPa, particle surface area, calculated clay, cation exchange capacity, Al exchangeable percentage and P retention, and the occurrence of isotropic coatings on rock fragments and peds tend to increase in the presence of the large amounts of hydrolyzed pumice that are found in the 0.02-2.0 mm fraction. Scanning electron microscope-energy dispersive X-ray analyses demonstrate that the coatings dominantly consist of noncrystalline material, probably allophanic-like material as suggested by the Si/Al molar ratio of 1.0. Selective dissolution analysis reveals that these abundant noncrystalline materials consist of ferrihydrite and allophane with an atomic ratio (Al-o-Al-p)/Si-o of approximately 1.4. Both ferrihydrite and allophane have very large specific surface area and absorptive capacity that make a significant contribution to the overall properties of these soils. X-ray diffraction analysis and transmission electron microscope observation show that the major group of crystalline clay minerals in the upper section of studied soils are tubular and spheroidal halloysite. These soils were classified as Vitrandic Udifluvents according to Soil Taxonomy. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Technological advances in sugar-cane harvesting and processing is bringing about rapid changes in production systems which could impact on soil physical conditions. An increasing incidence of soil structural decline and depletion of soil carbon levels has increased the risk of soil erosion and crop yield reductions. Soil carbon (C) and aggregate stability were studied on a sugar-cane (Saccharum officinarum L.) green trash blanket trial that had been established on a Chromic Luvisol soil at Mackay, Qld, Australia in 1992. The experiment consisted of blocks with two blocks being harvested early and the remaining two blocks harvested late in the crushing season. Within each block, treatment combinations of trash burnt or green trash blanket, which are either cultivated between rows or not cultivated after harvest, were included. Cropping and cultivation of the soil reduced the different C fractions in the surface 0-100 mm layer by 66-67% when compared to an adjacent uncropped reference soil. The labile C (C-L) concentration was 11% lower in the burnt treatment compared to the trash returned treatment but the opposite was found for total C (CT) After four years, the no cultivation treatment had higher concentrations of all C fractions measured, compared to the cultivated treatment. When compared to the uncropped reference soil, cropping resulted in marked reductions in aggregate mean weight diameter (MWD) and aggregates >250 mu m and an increase in aggregates <125 mu m determined by both immersion and tension wetting. The return of the green trash resulted in a 30% greater MWD and a 28% increase in aggregates >250 mu m and an 18% reduction in aggregates <125 mu m compared to the burnt treatment when immersion wetting was used. Four years of cultivation reduced the MWD, as determined by immersion wetting, by 26% compared to the no cultivation treatment. No significant correlations were found between any measured C fraction and aggregate stability. This study indicates that sustainable sugar-cane cropping systems will likely be those where cultivation is kept to a minimum and trash is retained in the system. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB The large input of research effort on aspects of nitrate leaching over the last two decades has produced many innovative scientific and practical results. The MAFF Nitrate Programme has enabled considerable progress to be made in unravelling much of the complexity of the grassland nitrogen (N) cycle, and identifying gaps as essential first stages in providing improved managements for N in grassland systems. From a practical standpoint, there have been key outputs which have allowed the identification of options for policy, and which should allow grassland farmers to increase the efficiency of N use throughout their farming system and thereby improve the sustainability of their enterprises. As well as quantifying N transformations, transfers and losses, other important outcomes have been the development of user-friendly models of N cycling (NCYCLE and variants) and an easy to use field kit to determine mineral N in pasture soils. The use of modelling to produce fertilizer recommendations with a Decision Support System and of new approaches developed within the Programme, in particular system synthesis desk studies, and 'farmlet' investigations to determine the consequences of modifying N flows and losses, have allowed us to produce solutions to satisfy the dual aims of meeting environmental and economic production targets.

TI The Carletonville-Mothusimpilo Project: limiting transmission of HIV
   through community-based interventions

   PREVENTION; HIV/AIDS; AIDS
AB For all of the last century, the economy of South Africa, and so also of its neighbouring countries, has depended on migrant labour from rural areas. This is particularly so for the mining industry, especially hard-rock mining, and this has led to a system of 'oscillating' migration whereby men from rural areas come to live and work on the mines, without their wives or families, but return home regularly. This pattern of oscillating migration is an important determinant of health and, especially at the start of the epidemic, contributed to the spread of HIV in the region. In this paper we describe an extensive, community-led, intervention designed to develop ways to manage and limit the spread of HIV in Carletonville, the largest gold-mining complex in the world. We first consider the political and economic context within which earlier attempts to develop HIV intervention programmes were made and then show how the Carletonville project was designed to go beyond these early attempts and avoid some of the pitfalls encountered then. The Carletonville project was based on a set of assumptions. First, that HIV should not be treated as another biomedical problem to be dealt with by changing individual behaviour but rather that it must be understood within the social, cultural and normative conditions that pertain in particular communities. Secondly, that in the short to medium term the most effective interventions would involve the treatment of sexually transmitted diseases and the use of community-based peer educators to promote safer sexual practices and the use of condoms. Thirdly, that for the intervention to be sustainable in the long term, it would require the full commitment of all the local stakeholders including the state, the private sector, the trade unions and local community-based organizations. Fourthly, that in order to understand the nature and pattern of the epidemic, to focus our intervention efforts so that they have the maximum effect, to make sensible predictions as to the likely future course of the epidemic, and finally, to evaluate the impact of the interventions, it is essential to carry out detailed monitoring and evaluation of the epidemic using both biomedical and behavioural markers of infection and behaviour. The background and current status of the project are described in detail. The surveys have shown that the situation is even worse than envisaged at the start of the project and have highlighted the importance of protecting young women from infection. Valuable lessons have been learnt concerning the reasons for the continued spread of the epidemic and some success has been achieved especially in the empowerment of women at high risk and the mobilization of people from all sectors of the community to join the fight against HIV/AIDS. It is still too early to show significant changes in STI or HIV rates but it is hoped that this will become apparent over the course of the next one or two years.

AB Existing models for the shear strength degradation of reinforced concrete members present varied conceptual approaches to interpreting test data. The relative superiority of one approach over the others is difficult to determine, particularly given the sparseness of ideal test data. Nevertheless, existing models are compared using a suite of test data that were used for the development of one such model, and significant differences emerge. Rather than relying purely on column test data, the body of knowledge concerning degradation of concrete as a material is considered. Confined concrete relations are examined to infer details of the degradation process, and to establish a framework for developing phenomenologically-based models for shear strength degradation in reinforced concrete members. The possibility of linking column shear strength degradation with material degradation phenomena is explored with a simple model. The model is applied to the results of 7 column tests, and it is found that such a link is sustainable. It is expected that models founded on material degradation phenomena will be more reliable and more broadly applicable than the current generation of empirical shear strength degradation models.

DE globalisation of tobacco marketing
ID PUBLIC-HEALTH; GLOBALIZATION
AB The globalisation of tobacco marketing, trade, research, and industry influence represents a major threat to public health worldwide. Drawing upon tobacco industry strategy documents prepared over several decades, this paper will demonstrate how the tobacco industry operates as a global force, regarding the world as its operating market by planning, developing, and marketing its products an a global scale. The industry has used a wide range of methods to buy influence and power, and penetrate markets across the world. It has an annual turnover of almost US$400 billion. In contrast, until recently tobacco control lacked global leadership and strategic direction and had been severely underfunded. As part of moving towards a more sustainable form of globalisation, a global enabling environment linked to local actions should focus on the following strategies: global information management; development of nationally and locally grounded action; global regulation, legal instruments, and foreign policy; and establishment of strong partnerships with purpose. As the vector of the tobacco epidemic, the tobacco industry's actions fall far outside of the boundaries of global corporate responsibility. Therefore, global and local actions should not provide the tobacco industry with the two things that it needs to ensure its long term profitability: respectability and predictability.

AB In the past 35 years, professionals in the field of early childhood special education have demonstrated great advances in social skills interventions for young children with disabilities. We no longer question if social behavior is important or if we can teach children social behaviors. Despite what we have learned, much work remains. In this article I identify three areas in which work is still needed: (a) working with families to define social outcomes in a meaningful and culturally relevant manner; (b) expanding our definition of social behaviors and moving toward a framework based on social relationships rather than social skills; and (c) developing interventions that are socially valid, ecologically valid, and sustainable across settings.

TI A broad context model of destination development scenarios
SO TOURISM MANAGEMENT

ID LIFE-CYCLE; TOURISM
AB Intensity and regulation are employed as variables to formulate a broad context model of tourism destination development. This model consists of four inclusive tourism development states (i.e., circumstantial alternative tourism or CAT, deliberate alternative tourism or DAT, unsustainable mass tourism or UMT, and sustainable mass tourism or SMT), and eight possible scenarios of transition from one state to another. It is argued that the Butler sequence is just one possible scenario within this framework, and that most places are CAT destinations that are unlikely to progress beyond this status quo. The model is applied to the Gold Coast of Australia to suggest that an integrated DAT/SMT product should be the outcome of destination management strategy, to replace the current unintegrated CAT/UMT structure.

CY SEP 21-25, 1997

AB Continuing growth in travel has led to concerns about the environment and sustainability, and hence the need to attempt to reduce travel, particularly by car. This paper considers the types of travel reduction strategy available, in terms of the implicit mechanisms of switching or substitution by which travel would be modified or reduced, and;evaluates their potential impacts by means of four case studies in European cities. It is found that the various travel reduction strategies have had qualified success. The strategies to some extent achieve reduction in car travel, mainly through switching to other modes, although also through reduced travel distance. However, the scale of the reduction is relatively small and may be offset by new traffic generation. In addition, in some cases the objectives of the measures, although potentially having a travel reduction contribution, are not always aimed directly at travel reduction as such, and therefore may not be able to deliver the intended travel reduction. The paper concludes that the way forward would appear to lie in setting clear policy objectives and in assembling travel reduction measures into strategy packages, ensuring that when combined the measures are complementary towards the policy objectives of travel reduction.

AB Everyone lives downstream - except the water lawyers; they commute from Mars. Repeated statistics forecast imminent global water scarcity with disastrous consequences. International experts promote solutions based on sound economics, science, and enlightened and enhanced political commitment. Absent from the integrated water resources strategy are considerations of fundamental principles of water law - a serious shortcoming. The development and implementation of a comprehensive, forward-looking integrated water resources management scheme must include water law as an integral component. This is especially important in upstream / downstream situations where conflicts of water use are increasingly inevitable.

AB Proper management of scarce water resources has in recent years become necessary to maintain sustainable societies. This article discusses the management of water resources in Botswana. It highlights the amount of water resources available, relating it to the demand and observes that the current trend of exploiting these resources will not be sustainable in the long run unless the major strategies suggested herein are adopted. It also looks at the administration of water and water resources in Botswana, focusing on the shared water resources. Government policies and strategies towards sustainable management of scarce water resources are also discussed The author draws particular attention to the water tariff structure, noting that the prevailing water tariff system promotes sustainable management of water resources.

AB Environmental education is seldom a priority in the curricula of primary and secondary schools. Wildlife and environmental clubs meet a critical need for conservation organizations to address conservation attitudes, knowledge, and behaviors of youth worldwide. Our study presents the first comprehensive evaluation of the elements leading to success of the wildlife club movement in Africa. We conducted a written survey of wildlife club organizations administering more than 4,700 clubs in 15 African countries to assess the instructional strategies, success factors, constraints, impacts, and recommendations for improvement. We compared these findings with an in-depth case study using interviews, participant observation, and document review of the Wildlife Clubs of Kenya, an organization that has involved more than one million Kenyan youth in the past 30 years. Increased awareness and knowledge among students was the most significant impact of wildlife clubs, whereas lack of funds and resources remained a critical constraint to educational programming. Factors leading to success of the wildlife club movement included the supper? and commitment of key stakeholders, staff visits to clubs, and training for teachers and students. Capacity building in financial and organizational sustainability, increased communication and networking, and systematic monitoring and evaluation emerged as important themes for future improvement of wildlife clubs throughout Africa and environmental education in general.

LA English

ID BIODIVERSITY
AB This paper assesses the potential and limitations of a range of "innovative" incentive mechanisms (IIMs) to make forest management and conservation more profitable for forest users. It classifies IIMs into three approaches: the fiscal or transfer payments approach; market-based solutions involving public good values; and the property rights approach. An essential complement to any IIM is regulation or control; at the international level, regulation creates the necessary demand for IIMs which attempt to capture global externalities, while at the national level, effective regulation is a vital concomitant of fiscal market-based instruments. Efforts to encourage sustainable forestry should also be complemented by policies which make forest-degrading activities less attractive, particularly by tackling extra-sectoral causes of forest degradation and investing in social capital and labor-intensive agriculture.
