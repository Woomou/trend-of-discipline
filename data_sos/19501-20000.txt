TI The ecological footprint from a systems perspective of sustainability

AB The Ecological Footprint (EF) is a method for estimating the biologically productive area necessary to support current consumption patterns, given prevailing technical and economic processes. By comparing human impact with the planet's limited bioproductive area, this method tests a basic ecological condition for sustainability. The ecological footprint has gained popularity for its pedagogical strength as it expresses the results of its analysis in spatial units that can easily be communicated. Many EF estimates have been performed on a global, national and sub-national level. In this paper, we review the method and critically assess it from a sustainability perspective based on first order principles. We examine:
   Which aspects of sustainability are already covered by existing EF assessments;
   Which further aspects of sustainability could be made accountable through the EF (such as areas needed to assimilate waste streams that are not yet accounted for in present assessments); and
   Those aspects of sustainability that cannot be accountable through the EF, thereby needing complimentary auditing tools.
   Since the EF is a measure of renewable biocapacity, we argue that some dimensions of ecological sustainability should not be included in the EF. These include human activities that should be phased out to obtain sustainability, such as emissions of persistent compounds foreign to nature and qualitative aspects that represent secondary uses of ecological areas and do not, therefore, occupy a clearly identifiable additional ecological space. We also conclude that the EF is useful for documenting the overall human use or abuse of the potentially renewable functions and services of nature. Particularly, by aggregating in a consistent way a variety of human impacts, it can effectively identify the scale of the human economy by comparison with the size of the biosphere.

DE regional sustainability; scenarios; Baltic Sea; policy; values
AB This paper presents integrated scenarios of the Baltic Sea region to the year 2030. It summarises research conducted for Baltic 21, a region wide process to identify strategies for sustainable development. The aim is to illuminate the requirements for a transition to sustainability. This includes a view of where the region is now, where it seems to be heading if conventional development patterns persist, and where alternatively it could aim - a sustainability vision. In the sustainability vision, a high degree of economic equity and full employment are attained, greenhouse gas emissions are sharply reduced, the acidification of soils and waters are kept within safe tolerance levels and the Baltic Sea is restored to ecological health. Preconditions for realising this future include the diffusion of clean and efficient technologies, reorientation of consumer demand towards less resource-intensive products, public support for strong sustainability policies, and a cooperative climate between nations.

TI Geographic shifts in the highland cooking banana (Musa spp., group
   AAA-EA) production in Uganda
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND WORLD ECOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
DE banana marketing; banana nematodes; banana weevil; banana yield decline;
   highland banana; Uganda
AB Between 1970 and 1990 Uganda witnessed the decline of the highland cooking banana from traditional growing areas in the central region, coupled with crop expansion in the country's southwest. Apprehension that the factors leading to loss of sustainability in the central region may be replayed in extant production areas has raised concern about the future of the cooking banana in Uganda. Consequently, a multi-disciplinary study was conducted at nine central and six southwestern sites to document shifts in cooking banana production and to elucidate the causes behind these shifts.
   Cooking banana production in central Uganda sites fell from 18% of total food crop and 7% of total cash crop production in the 1970s to 4% and 2%, respectively, in the 1990s. Farmers identified reduced labour availability and management, increasing pest pressure and declining soil nutrient status as the major causes of decline. On-farm verification confirmed farmers' observations: weevil levels were the highest yet found in Uganda, while foliar samples indicated deficiencies in magnesium, nitrogen, and potassium. Soil nutrient deficiencies, however, appear to be a direct outcome of reduced management rather than 'soil exhaustion' as postulated by farmers.
   In southwestern Uganda, the importance of the cooking banana as a cash crop has quadrupled since 1970. Banana first penetrated the region because of its ease of production and stability of yield. High yields attracted traders and urban market demand drove further crop expansion. With current market incentives, banana management standards have been high. Under current levels of management, it is unlikely that farmers in southwestern Uganda will experience a similar process of decline as that which occurred in the central region. However, concern remains about lack of replenishment of nutrients leaving the farm in the form of fruits sold for market, a nutrient loss which may eventually lead to non-sustainability of the cropping system.

AB Mexican Natural Protected Areas main goals are to protect biodiversity in the core areas and to achieve sustainable development of natural resources in their influence zone. According to Mexican legislation, all newly established biosphere reserves must have a Management Plan (MP). This MP must regulate all activities in the area, and guarantee that the short- and long-term objectives of the reserve will be achieved satisfactorily. In this paper, we outline the required information and topics to be included in all MPs. We describe the main recommendations offered in the MP for a new Natural Protected Area in Mexico: the La Sierra de la Laguna Biosphere Reserve. The document provides the Federal authorities with all the basic information, scientifically supported, for sustainable management of the natural resources of the reserve. The main goal of this MP was to promote the sustainable socioeconomic development of the region, its resources, and its inhabitants. The information provided should be useful to compare with other countries the differences and similarities ill official guidelines of MPs, to enhance sustainable use of resources in Natural Protected Areas.

DE contemporary society; global environmental change; particularistic
   anemic individualism; sociological analysis; sustainable development
AB Aiming at a progressive accumulation of knowledge complementary to recent and important works by environmental sociologists (Dunlap and Michelson, 1997; Redclift and Benton, 1994) and public agencies (CEQ, 1980; Olson, 1996), the general objective of this article is to pursue a renewed sociological understanding of contemporary society confronted by a particular process called global environmental change (GEC). Conceived within a specific integrated theoretical, empirical and applied approach, there is no place here for 'inventories' (Sunderlin, 1995), nor 'assessment analysis' (Buttel and Taylor, 1994) of current literature. In line with the author's own expertise (Prades, 1969, 1987, 1992, 1994), the specific objective of this article is to examine how a heuristic reading (Prades, 1990) of Weber and Durkheim provides basic theoretical insights for the study of GEC as a crucial contemporary societal-ennvironmental problem. According to its own limits, the present text may only suggest avenues for further reflection and research.
   Using macro-sociological, theoretical and methodological material directly oriented towards a concrete, problem-solving approach, this article contains three parts. As an introduction, the first section suggests a preliminary definition of contemporary sociogenic (societally generated) GEC. Searching for theoretical understanding and historical meaning, the second section concentrates on the pathological nature of contemporary sociogenic GEC and subsequently identifies 'particularistic anemic individualism' as a key strategical explanatory cause of such a pathological process, Finally and decisively, the third section studies how this state of affairs can be practically overcome in a functional 'societal solidarity' perspective based on the impulse of 'sustainable development'.

AB Prospective studies generally evaluate the contribution of solar energy to the world energy mix in the range of hundreds of Mtoe. Considering the actual mature solar technologies, this figure leads to a potential of hundreds of solar power plants at the horizon 2020. Development of such a programme requires RD&D to reduce costs and elaborate new systems. It requires also incentives to favour the initial market penetration in a context of low prices of energy. Along with some other technologies, solar power has the potential to mitigate the CO2 problem and therefore appears as a competitor in the international environment protection system. Several economic tools are available or under discussion to help financing the "incremental cost" of development projects in developing countries which are less emitting than current practices. The concept of activities implemented jointly" can foster the partnerships for both climate and development, and finally give support to solar energy. As a non polluting and long lasting technology, solar thermal power appears as a potential contributor to sustainable development. Nevertheless, in the context of hard competition for financing priorities, it has to prove that it is really good for economic development and that developing countries can afford it.

AB A strategy for conducting solar chemistry research is presented. It focuses on the development of technology and knowledge that offers society energy options from its current dependence on fossil fuels. The strategy shifts the traditional requirement from expecting a solar process to be economically competitive with current fossil fuel processes to being economically competitive with the best currently available sustainable energy options. This shift in thinking enables solar energy research programs to concentrate on producing the technology that a country would need if for any reason it lost access to conventional energy resources. The approach is illustrated with a current solar energy research program for producing Zn from ZnO.

AB The Indian renewable energy programme is one of the earliest and advanced renewable energy programmes which started as early as 1975. Over the years the programme has evolved into one which looks increasingly sustainable. Today the Indian renewable energy programme is characterised by it's market orientation, commercialisation, institutional and financing efforts and the presence of an advanced renewable energy industry which is predominantly private. However the same is not true in the solar thermal concentrating technologies. The purpose of the paper is to provide an update on the present status of solar thermal concentrating technologies in India and is aimed at technology suppliers, manufacturers scientists with an interest in the technology and the sub-continent. The paper is an update of the information collected by IT Power India in connection with the 'International Workshop on Solar Thermodynamic Electricity for Developing Countries', New Delhi, Feb. 1997 sponsored by DfID, UK. The paper gives an overview of the meteorology, the institutional, policy and financing framework and gives updates on the ongoing projects in solar thermal concentrators for power generation. Based on the experiences so far, the paper attempts to identify the factors influencing the future of solar thermal concentrating technologies in India.

AB The three chemical reactions of a new Mn-oxide based thermochemical cycle for sustainable H-2 production have been investigated. The reactivity of MnO with NaOH has been studied under a inert gas flow and under dynamic vacuum. H-2 and alpha-NaMnO2 were obtained above 750 K as the only products with yields > 92% under both conditions. The equilibrium pressure of the reaction was determined to be 95+/-2 mbar H-2. Recovery of the Mn-oxide and the NaOH was investigated by hydrolyzing alpha-NaMnO2 in clean H2O and in NaOH-H2O solutions (5 greater than or equal to c(NaOH) greater than or equal to 0.01 M). The solid product of the hydrolyses has a chemical composition with a molar ratio Na/Mn approximate to 0.1 which is due to the presence of a birnessite-like ternary Na-Mn-oxide and a binary Mn-oxide (Mn3O4). Solar thermal reductions of Mn-oxides were effected in a direct absorbing gas/particle reactor open to air. Under mean flux densities of 2000 kW m(-2) the preparation of MnO besides Mn3O4 was achieved in air for the first time with such a reactor.

AB A series of reflective troughs have been designed at the Centre for Sustainable Energy Systems at the ANU that use a hot-sagged glass-laminated-to-glass technique. The troughs are designed with a 2.0 m length acid a 1.2 m aperture width, and have a 45 degrees edge angle, and have a 0.72 m focal length. Videographic focal region characterisation of one of the troughs has been undertaken, and preliminary assessments indicate that the concentrator has an effective focal line width of 54 mm over a 1.8 m length, containing 91% of the intercepted radiation. Average concentration ratio over the 54 mm width has been measured at 22 suns. The focal region flux distribution shows some significant 'bands' of concentration, and indicates the more varied nature of focal light distributions that can occur with the more 'distributed' focal line fluxes, as compared with the more uniformly Gaussian distributions that are often apparent in point focus concentrators. Preliminary surface characterisation studies of the trough using close-range photogrammetry have also been undertaken, with computer based ray tracing applied to the measured surface to produced predicted flux distributions that closely approximate the videographically measured distributions. The photogrammetrically measured surface displacements across the trough indicate that a large proportion of the non-uniformities arise from deviations occurring at the lateral edges of the trough. This highlights a need to improve the fabrication methodology for the troughs in this area.

AB Southern Mediterranean countries, with almost 40% of land with direct insolation above 2350 kWh/m(2) year, present a greater potential for solar thermal power plants than European coutries. For sites with very good solar availability a 300 MWe hybrid plant of the SEGS(Solar Electric Generating System) type can be competitive, ISCCS ( Integrated Solar Combined Cycles Systems) plants can also be a good option. One of the main limiting factor is that this potential area is far from European high energy demand centres. In this paper a preliminary study on bulk electrical trasmission ( up to 2GW) of solar thermal power from Nothern African countries to Europe is carried out. The goal is to define a magnitude order for the cost of energy expoted.

AB Sustainable industrial development seeks to meet current needs of society without compromising the ability of future generations to satisfy their own needs. In order to be able to sustain further the growth and development, we have to become more environmentally conscious in the development, manufacturing, use, and post-life treatment of products. Based on the concept of design for environment and multi-lifecycle engineering, this paper introduces a multi-lifecycle product recovery model, optimal retirement planning, and design selection methods. Two electronic products are used to illustrate the proposed concepts and methods. The results are useful in helping designers take into account the environmental impact into their product and process design activities.

AB The information age has ushered in an awareness of and concern for global environmental problems such as climatic change, ozone depletion, deforestation, desertification, and nonpoint source (NPS) pollution Nonpoint source pollution is the single greatest threat to surface and subsurface drinking water resources. Nonpoint source pollutants also pose a threat to sustainable agriculture, which is viewed as the most viable means of meeting the food demands of a world population that is expected to reach 9.4 billion by the middle of the next century, The ability to accurately assess present and future NPS pollution impacts on ecosystems ranging from local to global scales would provide a powerful tool for environmental stewardship and guiding future human activities. Assessing NPS pollutant is a multidisciplinary problem. To address the problem, advanced information technologies and methodologies are needed that draw from all areas of science and are applied in a spatial context. It was from this setting that the 1997 Joint AGU Chapman/SSSA Outreach Conference Application of GIS, Remote Sensing, Geostatistics, and Solute Transport Modeling for Assessing Nonpoint Source Pollutants in the Vadose Zone (19-24 Oct. 1997, Riverside, CA) materialized. The objective of the conference was to examine current multidisciplinary technologies and methodologies for assessing NPS pollutants in the vadose zone, and to explore new conceptual approaches. It was the conference's goal to provide a forum to stimulate multidisciplinary interaction to enhance the development of techniques for the realtime measurement and modeling of NPS pollution in the vadose zone and subsurface waters.

AB The ability to assess through prognostication the impart of nonpoint source (NPS) pollutant loads to groundwater, such as salt loading, is a key element in agriculture's sustainability by mitigating deleterious environmental impacts before they occur. The modeling of NPS pollutants in the vadose zone is well suited to the integration of a geographic information system (GIS) because of the spatial nature of NPS pollutants, The GIS-linked, functional model TETrans was evaluated for its ability to predict salt loading to groundwater in a 2396 ha study area of the Broadview Water District located on the westside of central California's San Joaquin Valley, Model input data were obtained from spatially-referenced measurements as opposed to previous NPS pollution modeling effort's reliance upon generalized information from existing spatial databases (e.g., soil surveys) and transfer functions. The simulated temporal and spatial changes in the loading of salts to drainage waters for the study period 1991-1996 were compared to measured data, A comparison of the predicted and measured cumulative salt loads in drainage waters for individual drainage sumps showed acceptable agreement for management applications. An evaluation of the results indicated the practicality and utility of applying a one-dimensional, GIS-linked model of solute transport in the vadose zone to predict and visually display salt loading over thousands of hectares. The display maps provide a visual toot for assessing the potential impact of salinity upon groundwater, thereby providing information to make management decisions for the purpose of minimizing environmental impacts without compromising future agricultural productivity.

ID INDUSTRY; FOREST
AB American matsutake (Tricholoma magnivelare), which are harvested from Forest Service lands in the southern Oregon Cascade Range, provide commercial, recreational, subsistence, and cultural opportunities to forest users. The Winema and Deschutes National Forests have used collection permits and educational programs to address concerns about harvesters' activities and resource sustainability. Research on matsutake productivity shows that silvicultural options may reduce fire danger and provide revenue, jobs, and wood while improving forest health and increasing the availability of the mushrooms. Thus forest managers can expand their planning and management activities to enhance the commercial value of forests.

AB This paper reports from a survey of geographers in the UK that canvassed their Experiences of using audio-visual resources to support teaching and learning. The survey results suggest that geographical learning has embraced audio-visual resources and that these are, on the whole, being employed effectively. Yet, very little Expansion of audio-visual-based learning is anticipated. It is concluded that integration of audiovisual resources into the mainstream curriculum and active learning on the part of students are essential to Ensure effective and sustainable deployment of audio-visual technology.

TI Community decision-making about critical access hospitals: Lessons
   learned from Montana's Medical Assistance Facility program
SO JOURNAL OF RURAL HEALTH
LA English
DT Article
AB Limited-service hospitals have been used as a means of maintaining health care services in rural communities with full-service hospitals at risk of closure. The Medical Assistance Facility (MAF) limited-service hospital model has been implemented in 12 communities in Montana and has been evaluated by the Health Care Financing Administration as a viable alternative to a full-service hospital in frontier communities. The 1997 federal Critical Access Hospital (CAH) legislation is the most recent nationwide alternative for maintaining health care in rural communities, and it incorporates many of the features of the MAF model. The purpose of this study was to examine rural community decision making regarding MAF conversion from the perspectives of key informants who were involved in the decision-making process. A descriptive multiple case study design was used. Data were obtained through interviews with community members during site visits. The research focused on identification of local issues that were influential in the decision to convert to or reopen as an MAF, features of the MAF model that made it a locally acceptable were those that made the provision of basic services more stable and sustainable. The study suggests that programs to maintain health care services in isolated communities should allow for and encourage an expandable role for nonphysician providers. The lessons learned from the communities included in this study are instructive to rural communities nationwide that are considering a CAH as well as to policymakers, researchers, and regional and national health care decision makers.

TI Development of decision support system for sustainable community design
SO JOURNAL OF URBAN PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT-ASCE
LA English
DT Article
AB A number of shortcomings are associated with conventional subdivision design. These include environmental, social, and economic issues that affect not only the residents of the development, but everyone within the surrounding urban area. An alternative form of development, known as sustainable community design, has been proposed by many professionals to circumvent the deficiencies of conventional designs. Through an extensive literature review, a number of design rules for sustainable communities were determined and a design methodology was constructed. A prototype decision support system was developed, based upon this methodology, to design sustainable "green-field" communities. This prototype computer tool was written in C++ and is used in conjunction with a second program called SCAPE, to create three-dimensional community plans. The flexibility of the system rests in the hands of the user in the form of input variables that can be used to quickly change the entire layout of the development. It is hoped that the use of the developed prototype system will lead to consideration of a wider range of alternatives for urban fringe development, and ultimately to the construction of increasingly sustainable community developments.

AB This paper focuses on the province of Sissili in southern Burkina Faso, an area that saw widespread immigration caused by the Sahelian droughts since the 1970s. This immigration caused concern over the economic and environmental sustainability of the province. However, over a period of two years of close contact with farming communities, adaptive and innovative actions were noted as people developed new resource-use patterns to safeguard both environment and livelihood. The study examines various aspects of the production and livelihood system of indigenous and immigrant ethnic groups and shows that: the purpose of the emerging new resource use arrangements is to guarantee subsistence for all; negotiation between ethnic groups and communities is the mechanism that guarantees subsistence; landscapes (lifescapes) are not static and are created through assimilation of information and different farming systems; the objective of local production systems is to maximize livelihood subsistence and to minimise negative environmental impacts which threaten long term sustainability.

AB The effects of herbivorous zooplankton on the sedimentation of particles out of the euphotic zone are examined with mathematical models, a large-scale field experiment, and descriptive data from a eutrophic lake. The theory is rooted in the population dynamics of phytoplankton and zooplankton and so explicitly accounts for the potential effect of zooptankton grazing on primary production and the connection between the rate at which phytoplankton cells sink and sustainable zooplankton biomass. The models predict positive, negative, or unimodal zooplankton effects, depending on the values of four parameters: rate of direct phytoplankton sinking, fraction of zooplankton fecal material exiting the euphotic zone, zooplankton assimilation efficiency, and system productivity. Models were parameterized with data from a eutrophic lake to make a priori predictions about the shape and direction of zooplankton effects. Predictions were tested against the results of an independent experiment in which a gradient of Daphnia biomass was established in large enclosures. Daphnia negatively affected sedimentation rates of carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus in the enclosure experiment, which confirmed model predictions. Daphnia had a strong negative effect on phytoplankton biomass, and phytoplankton biomass was positively correlated with sedimentation in the enclosures. Experimental results were congruent with relationships between Daphnia biomass and sedimentation rate in the lake. Successful application of the theory suggests that these models may be of utility for assessing the direction of zooplankton effects on vertical flux in other systems. More generally, the models help to identify parameters that should be measured in studies of zooplankton effects on downward particle flux.

ID TOURISM; COUNTRIES
AB This article examines the implications of a decommodifying thesis for the global-local politics of host communities and ecotourism, and the future of this form of tourism in Australia and elsewhere. Decommodified social policy is usually accessible to all and places social objectives and human rights such as the right to work or to a decent standard of living over that of economic value and ends. The commodified/decommodified distinction can also be applied to the development of ecotourism. Commodifying processes occur where the final outcome is defined as the economic use-value of the product. Current directions in ecotourism are towards the commodification of nature in the search for global profits and the tourist dollar in capitalist economies. We argue that the negative impacts of such a trajectory on host communities require decommodifying actions towards ecological sustainable tourism. In place of the almost exclusive pursuit of industry profits, ecotourism needs to place social value on local environments and economics. These include: the touristic approaches of indigenous or host communities; the quality of interaction of tourism with such communities and with nature; the ethics of care for nature; and, a greater appreciation of the consequences of human action on nature in local economies. Several examples of variation, innovation and resistance to commodifying and globalising processes amongst such host communities are discussed. Criteria are developed for a realizable fit between the concerns of globalisation of tourism and the preservation of tradition and cultural identity in ecotourist industries. The key difficulty for sustainable local ecotourist industries is seen to lie in the commodifying potential of global processes. Finally, policy strategies towards more decommodified practice are suggested such as increasing government regulation and for self-regulation of the industry using measures like stronger industry compliance to codes of ethics and specified limits on tourist carry capacity in host locations.

CT 14th World Congress of Sociology
CY JUL 26-AUG 01, 1998
CL MONTREAL, CANADA
AB In this article I present the course of events in a small country town, Thorn, in the Netherlands, where the local community gradually lost it's grip on the large-scale processes taking place, such as gravel extraction and agricultural reconstruction. The planned construction of a bungalow resort and a marina offered local government the opportunity to increase revenue from tourism and to reverse the loss of control. The authorities decided that the tourism project had to be situated at a distance from the town, without any relationship to local society. This strategy seemed to be a successful way of setting bounds on the one hand to negative tourism impacts and exploiting tourism in a positive sense on the other hand. But Thorn has also missed opportunities. The planning process lacked the qualities of creativity and innovation, and there was no question of any consideration of possible development alternatives. Recent history shows the inability of local politics to recognise or define opportunities and thus strengthen the town's position in I relation to the external economic and political networks.

TI Approach to steady state high performance in DD and DT plasmas with
   optimized shear in JET
SO NUCLEAR FUSION
LA English
DT Article
ID REVERSED MAGNETIC SHEAR; CONFINEMENT
AB Steady state high performance with improved core confinement and sustainable plasma edge conditions has been approached on JET in a double barrier (DB) mode. The DB mode combines an internal transport barrier of the optimized shear regime with an edge transport barrier of an ELMy H mode regime. Improved confinement with an H factor HITER-89 approximate to 2 has been maintained for four energy confinement times. Ion and electron temperature profiles remain peaked in the DB mode, while the density profile is broad and similar in shape to the conventional ELMy H mode profile. The energy confinement improves across the whole plasma cross-section, and the ion heat conductivity falls to the neoclassical level in the core, Particle transport studies show that impurity accumulation can be avoided in the DB mode. In DT discharges the DB mode has attained a fusion gain of Q approximate to 0.4, producing 6.8 MW of fusion power, compared with Q approximate to 0.2 in the conventional sawtoothing ELMy H mode. The ELMs are more benign, with an amplitude an order of magnitude smaller in the DB mode. The DB mode has a high potential to improve performance in reactor relevant conditions.

AB Three approaches to nitrogen budgeting were developed and their ability to quantitatively describe nitrogen cycling in a fertilizer based and a grass-clover based beef system tested. Budgets ranged in complexity from the Economic Input:Output (EIO) budget, which accounted simply for purchases and sales of nitrogen over the farmgate, through the Biological Input:Output (BIO) budget, which included estimates of biological nitrogen fixation and attempted to partition losses into leaching and gaseous forms, to the Transfer:Recycle:Input:Output (TRIO) budget, which also accounted for key soil processes. Nitrogen unaccounted for in the fertilized system decreased with increasing budget complexity (285, 212 and 188 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) unaccounted for by the EIO, BIO and TRIO budgets, respectively). In the legume based grass-clover system, the EIO budget did not accurately describe total nitrogen inputs as it did not include 146 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) from symbiotic nitrogen fixation. In the grass-clover system, nitrogen unaccounted for was again greater using the BIO than the TRIO budget (103 and 79 kg ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively). In conclusion, the most complex budgeting approach (TRIO) was able to account for the fate of a greater proportion of nitrogen inputs than the simpler approaches. However, the perceived success of the different approaches was strongly dependent on the precise objective.

ID AGROBIOLOGICAL MANAGEMENT
AB Although ranking among the major food oils in the world, cotton oil is basically a byproduct of cotton fiber production. Change in cotton oil production depends mainly upon change in seedcotton production, even if better oil processing from seedcotton would have positive impact as well. However, area devoted to seedcotton production in the world, including in developing countries to some extent, has been stagnating for decades while yield has also come to stagnate since mid-1980s. Increase in cotton oil production would derive mainly from seedcotton yield improvement which might, in some cases, induce positive change in cotton area.
   The issue of modifying the current seedcotton yield trends demands to clarify reasons of yield stagnation being observed. Reasons differ among countries. In economically developed countries, yield is stagnating at a somewhat high level, existing high performing technical packages are fully applied and the challenge being set is to carry out new packages to enhance the yield potential. In developing countries where smallholder production dominates, reasons of yield stagnation at a low level are different so that new research outputs adapted to developed countries would not automatically be relevant in less favored countries.
   It is now fully recognized that many technical practices being recommended to smallholders in developing countries are not relevant as regard these farmers' liquidity constraint and risk adversion while they are submitted to climatic hazards in addition to impediments in input and credit provision. Research work must then begin with taking into account these contraints in order to carry out new technical packages less demanding in cash expenses, more cost effective, providing better protection against climatic hazards and cotton pests. As in many developing countries, cotton is grown under rainfed conditions, tolerance to occasional drought is of major importance. CIRAD has contributed to accertain that the above research objectives are not unrealistic. CIRAD has implemented the approach called "direct sowing over vegetative cover" during the last decade, either in commercial farming or smallholding farming. This paper states the principles of the approach, exposes the results obtained in Brazil and Madagascar and suggests the assumed phenomena that reverse a negative trend of soil degradation leading to yield unstability and profitability decrease into a positive process of soil improvement and higher input efficiency to ensure better profitability. Finally, relevance of experimenting the approach in Mozambique is discussed.

AB The increase which is forecast for the world population in the next 50 years will require a high rise in productivity where food consumption is bound to step up most. This appears hardly compatible with the present production techniques. Technological breakthroughs will therefore prove necessary to ensure the sustainability of the new farming systems. No solution should be neglected from the start, and biotechnology in all its dimensions, including genetic engineering, should be considered as belonging to the toolbox of available solutions. Needless to say, this objective does not imply that all necessary safety precautions should not be taken as to the conditions of their use. The countries in the South will inevitably be affected by the generalisation of these techniques in the North. Either willingly and justifiably, or unconsciously, they have already entered the biotech era. Therefore, the question no longer is whether such an evolution is desirable or not, but how best to ensure that they will draw the greatest benefit out of it for their own development. The knowledge and exploitation of genome appears extremely promising, but it may also contribute to extending further the gap between countries or social groups. Accordingly every country needs to develop the minimum capacity required to define and implement its own choices as rationally as possible Cooperating with the private sector is a prerequisite, exactly as it is for public research institutions. They all need to use their comparative advantages, from genetic resources to filing for patents as tradeoffs for proprietary techniques and genes, to gain access to the best negociating position they can reach.

AB In this paper, an attempt is made to illustrate how sustainable agricultural development can be achieved through the application of a holistic eco-restructuring method (ERM). Before describing the concept of eco-restructuring, its importance and its methodological framework, the derivation and some antecedents of sustainable development, the concept of sustainable development (SD) as an interface between environment and development, and the need for sustainable agricultural development (SAD) are discussed briefly.

TI Flowers from Africa: a growing trade
SO OUTLOOK ON AGRICULTURE
LA English
DT Article
AB The production of cut flowers, nearly all for export, is expanding in numerous African countries. Most of the flowers being grown in Africa are of temperate origin and are exported to Europe during the Northern hemisphere's autumn, winter and spring. The development of production in the tropics has required the adoption of specialized protected structures suitable for the tropics, and this review considers Kenya in detail. The future prospects for cut flower exports are considered, including the exacting production and marketing requirements of the international market, the ethical approach to labour employment, safe use of pesticides, and the sustainable management of the environment. The continued expansion of Africa's cut flower growing requires the industry to remain competitive, which in turn needs political stability, and investment in research and training.

TI Infrastructure shortfall in the United Kingdom: the private finance
   initiative and government policy
SO POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY
LA English
DT Article
DE private finance initiative; government infrastructure investment
AB Investment infrastructure is essential for long term economic growth, sustainable regional economic development, and the quality of urban life. Yet the available evidence suggests a significant shortfall in current UK government investment on infrastructure, and a long term pattern of low investment compared to other European countries. Given the pre-occupation of the Labour government with managing expenditures within the parameters set by the previous government, and the vulnerability of any government to financial markets' valuation of current spending plans in relation to interest rates and currency exchange rates, there is little likelihood of major new public spending on infrastructure in the near future. In this context, the Private Finance Initiative (PFI) is very important for the government's plans to make up the shortfall. Although inherited from the previous Conservative government, the PFI has powerful advocates within the Labour government. The PFI is the formal mechanism by which government departments, agencies and instrumentalities, like the National Heath Service, utilise private sector investment capital and, in particular, pension fund assets, to revitalise public services. This paper sets out the institutional history of the PM, beginning with the Thatcher government's Ryrie Rules, the efforts of the Major Conservative government to make it a viable operational practice, and the reasons why the new government supports PFI and has made significant moves to improve its effectiveness. Still we are sceptical about the future of the PFI. We show that the PFI has foundered upon fundamentally flawed design and the politicians' obsession with control of public sector spending. Notwithstanding recent 'reforms', PFI may only succeed if the PFI process is decentralised and linked explicitly with regional development programmes. In any event, given the difficulties posed by the PFI process for private investors, perhaps different institutional responses to infrastructure shortfall should be contemplated, including the introduction of traded infrastructure bonds.

AB As the twentieth century ends, we may identify both constructive and destructive trends that will influence the future of humanity. Which set of trends will dominate the future is uncertain. Attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors all interact to direct the flow of change over time. However, the options and constraints of human life are ultimately fixed by those cosmic elements of the environment over which humans have no control. The modern assumption of a world without end or limits risks collision with that obdurate reality. Facing threats to its long-term survival, humanity is challenged to learn how to build a sustainable future. A successful effort will require a concerted and cooperative effort among all fields of knowledge. This article identifies some of the trends that threaten humanity's future and suggests four lines of action that should be pursued in order to reduce the likelihood that humanity will destroy itself.

TI A political ecology perspective on environmental change in Malawi with
   the Blantyre Fuelwood Project Area as a case study
SO POLITICS AND THE LIFE SCIENCES
LA English
DT Article
ID DEFORESTATION; AGRICULTURE; RESOURCES
AB This article examines deforestation-induced environmental change in the Southern Region of Malawi.. The political ecology approach is used to critique this change, assessing how colonial and postcolonial forestry policies affected the landscape. It is argued that nonparticipatory, "top-down" government programs disempowered Malawi's peoples and allowed the environment to degrade. The Blantyre Fuelwood Project shows how the politics of land use predicate environmental change. It is argued that government implemented, "top-down" approaches failed because they did not integrate local communities. The result has been local opposition to government programs, passive resistance, and deteriorating environmental conditions. The article critiques Malawi's forestry policies since colonial times, analyzes the political ecology of the Blantyre Fuelwood Project and concludes with the hope that newly implemented "bottom-up" programs that incorporate local communities will make Malawi's environment more sustainable.

TI The post-petroleum paradigm - and population
SO POPULATION AND ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB The use of oil has changed world economies, social and political structures, and lifestyles beyond the effect of any other substance in such a short time. But oil supplies are limited. The peak of world oil production and the beginning of the irreversible decline of oil availability is clearly in sight. This paper examines the role of oil in two contexts: Its importance in countries almost entirely dependent on oil income, and the role of oil in world agricultural productivity. Possible alternatives to oil and its close associate, natural gas, are also examined. Countries almost solely dependent on oil income are chiefly those of the Persian Gulf region. The prosperity which oil has brought to these nations has resulted in a rapidly growing population which is not sustainable without oil revenues. World agriculture is now highly dependent on oil and natural gas for fertilizers and pesticides. Without these, agricultural productivity would markedly decline. As a base for the production of these materials, oil and natural gas are irreplaceable. Lifestyles and affluence in the post-petroleum paradigm will be quite different from today. World population will have to be reduced if it is to exist at any reasonable standard of living. At that time concern will be much more centered on obtaining basic resources, especially agricultural, by which to survive.

   time-series tests
SO PUBLIC FINANCE REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
ID DEFICITS; BUBBLES; BUDGET
AB Sustainability of public debt has become a major issue in the debate over the success of the European Monetary Union. The authors pursue the question of whether Germany's fiscal policy is sustainable. With sustainability of a given fiscal policy, the authors refer to a policy that satisfies the intertemporal budget constaint of the government, known as the no-Ponzi game condition. Although this question has been econometrically studied for the United Stares in many studies, it has not yet been pursued with German time-series data. Using annual data from 1955 to 1994, the results seem to indicate that the intertemporal budget constraint for Germany is not met. In particular; the deficits in the period after 1989 appear to have contributed to that trend. Although the question of whether the latter increase in debt will have a lasting effect is still an important issue, the methodology proposed here may be useful for studying other countries. The authors also briefly discuss the macroeconomic effects of adjustment policies.

DT Article
DE energy flow analysis; sustainable development; resource management;
   self-sufficiency; island
AB In order to develop a sustainable society, tools are needed to analyze the relationships between human activities and ecosystems and to estimate the carrying capacity of the natural resource base. In this paper, energy analysis is applied in a study of the small island society Namdo in the Stockholm archipelago, Sweden. Namdo has a permanent population of 41 persons and ca. 1000 summer residents. We estimated the energy and material flows on the island, including the primary and secondary production in natural and cultivated ecosystems, human production and consumption of food, and production of waste. Our results show that the island society's consumption exceeds the natural carrying capacity of the island. A great deal of food and energy is imported while only a minor amount of local resources are utilized. The island society is, at present, not constrained by the local resource base, but instead depends heavily on functioning transport communications with the mainland. Based on our findings we make recommendations for greater self-sufficiency, including use of locally available renewable resources and increased recycling. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

However, the analyses depend on a Cobb-Douglas production function with a constant elasticity of substitution out to infinity. This paper shows that a Cobb-Douglas function eventually violates entropy and that the elasticity of substitution between any two inputs must at some point become zero. Different types of substitution are examined to show how physics and the law of entropy cause the elasticity of substitution to decline. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In a previous interpretation of multiple discrepancies theory (MDT), the authors operationalized mutiple discrepancies as gaps between respondents' values and their performance. Using a sample of back-to-the-landers from the larger sustainability movement, the first-stage of the data analysis (Jacob and Brinkerhoff, 1997) confirmed that multiple discrepancies between values and do have a significant impact on subjective well-being (SWB), but this initial analysis also demonstrated that there are intervening variables that can act as compensating factors to attenuate the influence of multiple discrepancies on SWB. In this, the second-stage of data analysis, the authors identify and further explore the interaction of phenomena that might serve as compensation variables in respondents' calculus of their SWB. The present study identifies two salient compensating factors: mindfulness (a calm, yet focused, engagement with the present, similar to a meditative experience), and a sense of an absence of time constraints. Operationalized as Mindfulness and Time for Self scales, these two interrelated variables explain, in multiple regression equations, the major share of variation in multiple measures of SWB. Nevertheless, the multiple discrepancies between values and performance are still significant, if secondary, factors in explaining variance in SWB for the sample of back-to-the-landers.

AB This article examines implications of the information revolution for the global inequalities between North and South. A multidimensional empirical taxonomy of information technology is provided to chart its diffusion throughout the world. Two major conclusions ensue from this analysis: (a) The information revolution is still very much in its beginning stages, and (b) it is limited primarily to the developed nations of the North. Based on past practice, the technical operating features of the Internet, and a content analysis of one Internet discussion group, three possible development scenarios are offered. Although no firm conclusions are possible, analysis of the Internet does reveal that technologically and empirically greater opportunity exists now for the previously excluded (i.e., the South) to participate. However, the question remains as to whether this is sufficient to redress the gross imbalance between North and South.

AB This report reviews novel initiatives for improving the content of information on sustainable development and novel initiatives for increasing access to this information with an emphasis on outreach to rural areas. Improving information content and improving the outreach of the network are the two key elements of any successful communications project. The combination of communications services and other development activities create an opportunity for co-capacity building in that the implementation of one builds capacity for more successful implementation of the other. The co-capacity building of energy and communications services is considered. Integrating connectivity, content, and capacity-building initiatives in a decentralized network for exchange of information on sustainable development can result in greater progress than can improvement of each of the parts.

   of a 10-year community intervention
SO SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE

DT Article
DE heart disease; community action; coal miners; Australia
ID NEW-SOUTH-WALES; HUNTER REGION; PREVENTION
AB Coronary heart disease is a leading cause of death in Australia with the Coalfields district of New South Wales having one of the country's highest rates. Identification of the Coalfields epidemic in the 1970's led to the formation of a community awareness program in the late 1980's (the healthy heart support group) followed by a more intense community action program in 1990, the Coalfields Healthy Heartbeat (CHHB). CHHB is a coalition of community members, local government officers, health workers and University researchers. We evaluate the CHHB program, examining both the nature and sustainability of heart health activities undertaken, as well as trends in risk factor levels and rates of coronary events in the Coalfields in comparison with nearby local government areas. Process data reveal difficulties mobilising the community as a whole; activities had to be selected for interested subgroups such as families of heart disease patients, school children, retired people and women concerned with family nutrition and body maintenance. Outcome data show a significantly larger reduction in case fatality for Coalfields men (although nonfatal heart attacks did not decline) while changes in risk factors levels were comparable with surrounding areas. We explain positive responses to the CHHB by schools, heart attack survivors and women interested in body maintenance in terms of the meaning these subgroups find in health promotion discourses based on their embodied experiences. When faced with a threat to one's identity, health discourse suddenly becomes meaningful along with the regimens for health improvement. General public disinterest in heart health promotion is examined in the context of historical patterns of outsiders criticising the lifestyle of miners, an orientation toward communal lather than individual responsibility for health (i.e, community 'owned' emergency services and hospitals) and anger about risks from environmental hazards imposed by industrialists.

AB Local soil knowledge is an important source of information when designing sustainable land management strategies. Local people's insights, perceptions, and management strategies are often attuned to local soil conditions and can offer guidance for realistic land management. This article reviews the existing literature on local soil knowledge and suggests ways it can be used more effectively in sustainable land management. I discuss three genres of local soil knowledge writing: the ethnographical literature, nomenclature descriptions, and more utilitarian writing. I then offer suggestions for future local soil knowledge studies, broadening local soil knowledge to include the knowledge of physical processes, linking soil knowledge with socioeconomic context, and integrating local with scientific knowledge through the use of participatory methodologies for future research. These suggestions will highlight how local soil knowledge can be an effective tool in sustainable land management.

AB As a part of efforts to effectively utilize the wetlands of the West Africa sub-region for the production of rice and other crops, in order to alleviate the persistent food shortage while also protecting and conserving the environment for sustainability, the general fertility status of hood plain soils were assessed. The whole sub-region was found to be deficient in available phosphorus. Available P (Bray No. 2) was deficient for both the humid Equatorial forest (EF) and sub-humid Guinea savanna (GS), as well as the drier northern sector of Sudan savanna (SuS) and Sahel savanna (SaS) zones. Mean available P levels in the topsoil (0-15 cm) were 9.84, 8.01, 7.25, and 7.31 mg kg(-1) for the EF, GS, SuS, and SaS zones respectively. Effective cation exchange capacity (eCEC) and levels of exchangeable K, Ca, and Mg were higher for the SaS and SuS than for the GS and EF zones. The level of exchangeable K was, however, very low within the EF zone. The soils were slightly acidic to neutral but with isolated areas of high salinity. Mean topsoil (0-15 cm) pH for West Africa was 5.4. Mean soil pH varied from 5.7 in the drier SaS, through 5.4 for the SuS and GS zones to 5.2 in the EF zone. Mean topsoil levels of total carbon for the EF (humid) and GS (sub-humid) zones were 14.4 and 16.3 g kg(-1) while the dry SuS and SaS zones showed topsoil means of 8.3 and 6.2 g kg(-1) respectively. Total nitrogen levels, however, were low throughout the sub-region particularly within the SaS and SuS zones which showed respective topsoil means of 0.71 and 0.88 g kg(-1). Mean topsoil level of total nitrogen for West Africa hood plains was 0.98 g kg(-1). C/N ratios ranged from 8-13 except for the EF which showed quite higher, 18-20, ratios.

TI Expanding contraceptive choice: Findings from Brazil
SO STUDIES IN FAMILY PLANNING
LA English
DT Article
ID ISSUES
AB This article presents findings from a participatory action research project in a municipality in southern Brazil that models a new and holistic approach to broadening women's contraceptive choices. The project encourages a collaborative process between researchers, community members, and public health managers to diagnose service-delivery problems, to design and implement interventions, and to evaluate their effectiveness. Findings from the baseline evaluation revealed major constraints in availability of and access to family planning and reproductive health services for women, as well as severe deficiencies in quality of care. Interventions designed to address these weaknesses, bound by the limited resources of the public sector, focused on training, restructuring of providers' roles and service-delivery patterns, the management process, the creation of a referral center, and the introduction of injectables, vasectomy services, and a program for adolescents. Evaluation results show the project's considerable impact in broadening reproductive options, although not all issues, especially those related to sustainability, have been resolved.

ID STRATEGY
AB The Strategic or Active Incrementalism style and the Meta-Cognitive paradigm of strategic decision making are proposed as self-organizing cognitive filters for facilitating technology transfer, which is viewed as a knowledge transfer process of technological (technical and administrative) cognition and learning as well as unlearning. Furthermore, the case is made for an architecture of hyperlearning conceived as a four-level (operational, tactical, strategic, and meta-strategic level) and four-mode (individual, intra-organizational, inter-organizational, and supra-organizational mode), feedback-driven system of technological learning and unlearning. Such an architecture for a self-organizing system of technological learning, could serve as a major source of sustainable competitive advantage from a resource-based, firm-specific perspective within hypercompetitive and technology-driven environments. To validate our proposed typology of multiple level and mode technological learning that underlies the Strategic Incrementalism style and the Meta-Cognitive paradigm of strategic decision making, we attempted to empirically identify the presence of multiple-level technological learning through in-depth-interview-driven, two to three year long, ethnographic case studies of nineteen companies headquartered in the USA, Canada, Germany, and France, that operate in high risk and/or uncertainty, very dynamic (due to intensity of competition and/or technological complexity), and technologically intensive (where technology has strategic import, and in many cases one has to "bet the company" when deciding for or against a certain project or technology) business environments. Specifically, the industries the companies operate in are: multimedia, pharmaceuticals/biotechnology, transportation, industrial chemicals/materials, and power generation.

TI Harry Stobbs Memorial Lecture, 1997 - Rethinking high input systems of
   livestock production: a case study of nitrogen emissions in Dutch dairy
   farming
SO TROPICAL GRASSLANDS
LA English
DT Article
ID NUTRIENT
AB Livestock are essential in many farming systems where they provide income, food and power, or where they enhance soil fertility or the socioeconomic situation of farmers. However, livestock can also cause environmental degradation, pollution and social inequality. The contradiction between these views lies in differences between production systems, here called modes of agriculture. This paper starts, therefore, by giving a classification of livestock systems as a framework to rethink the role of livestock in high-input agriculture. The classification explains what is meant by high-input systems by placing them in a sequence of modes in agriculture that each face sustainability problems in different ways. Secondly, the paper discusses negative effects of livestock in high-input systems by zooming in on nitrogen surpluses in dairy farming of the Netherlands. It then elaborates ways to cope with these problems by distinguishing between linear and dynamic aspects. Linear aspects refer to reductionist approaches like other methods of feeding, housing and/or manure application. Dynamic aspects refer to holistic approaches which acknowledge that an intervention in one part of the system affects the functioning of the system elsewhere. Examples of practical and administrative measures regarding the rethinking of high-input systems are elaborated.

AB Australia has a highly variable climate, giving it the reputation as a land of droughts and flooding rains. A National Drought Policy was agreed to by Commonwealth (Federal), State, and Territory Ministers in 1992, reaffirmed in 1994, and revised in 1997. It aims to encourage primary producers and other sections of rural Australia to adopt self-reliant approaches to managing for climatic variability, to maintain and protect Australia's agricultural and environmental resource base during periods of extreme climate stress, and to ensure early recovery of agricultural and rural industries, consistent with long-term sustainable levels. These aims can be met by providing research, extension, and education services to assist producers to plan for and cope with a variable climate and by ensuring that there are no financial incentives for inappropriate management practices. The extent to which these aims are being met is still a matter of debate. Given that a sequence of El Nino-based events that started in Queensland in 1991 culminated in much of Australia experiencing abnormally low rainfall throughout 1994 and into 1995, the commonwealth government needed measures to determine which areas had been exposed to exceptional drought so that financial assistance could be directed as effectively as possible. For an area to be declared as experiencing "drought exceptional circumstances, " (DEC) the extent and severity of drought had to be assessed as being beyond the bounds of normal risk management. In this paper we discuss our recent experiences in estimating the extent and severity of drought in the arid, temperate, and subtropical regions of Australia, and progress in developing methods and regionally sensitive, indicators to aid assessments of "drought exceptional circumstances.".

AB The current emphasis on reducing pesticide use has led to increased interest in alternative weed control methods. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the potential of hilling, in combination with subsequent interseeding of cover crops, to control weeds in potato and to determine the impact of these actions on potato yield and insects. Each cover crop, either hairy or lana vetch, oats, barley, red clover, or a combination of oats and hairy vetch, was interseeded, following hilling, 3, 4, or 5 wk after planting (WAP). Hilling and interseeding treatments were compared to a no-cover treatment and a chemical standard, metolachlor (1.7 kg ai ha(-1)) plus linuron (1.7 kg ai ha(-1)). Cultivation associated with the interseeding operation and cover crops reduced weed density 20 to 27% by 3 wk after interseeding. To prevent excessive competition, cereals interseeded 3 or 4 WAP and vetches interseeded 3 WAP were controlled at a height of 25 to 35 cm using fluazifop (0.22 kg ai ha(-1)) plus metribuzin (0.28 kg ai ha(-1)). Because of slow growth, it was necessary to control red clover (interseeded 3 WAP), only in 1996, at a height of 15 cm. Control of cereals resulted in a dead mulch chat provided 0 to 95% weed control, whereas legumes regrew after herbicide application and provided 45 to 70% weed control. However, an adequate minimum of 70% weed control was achieved only with the chemical standard, cereals (1995 and 1996), and legumes (1996) interseeded 3 WAP when controlled with herbicides. In a dry season (1995), potato yields were highest with the chemical standard, whereas in a season with adequate precipitation (1996), potato yields equivalent to those of the chemical standard were obtained with early interseeding (3 WAP) of cereals. The observed changes in the densities of potato leafhopper and of its natural enemies were unlikely to have any effect on potato yield because of low overall insect populations. Thus, the results suggest that in good growing conditions, early (3 WAP) interseeding of cover crops supplemented with postemergence herbicides may both suppress weeds with 70% less herbicide (ai ha(-1)) and provide yields comparable to those associated with conventional potato production.

AB Sustainability has today become a word of fashion. What does it really mean ? Can it solve our ecological problems, as many believe ? First of all, its definition is not very clear and therefore it will be necessary to define what is meant by it General systems theory tries to clarify whether sustainability can stabilize our ecosystem and in what way it will influence economics. It is found, that a more precise concept is stationarity (steady state), which eventually will guarantee stability. Sustainability is not identical with stationarity and therefore the effects of both must be evaluated separately for every case. We know cases of a over-sustainabilty with high growth, while in other cases a true sustainability will not be possible, as with exhaustible resources.
   In particular, the question arises whether sustainability will be compatible at all with growth, the sacred cow of our economic system.

AB Normally, a broad spectrum of weeds has to be controlled in arable crops. When applying ecologically sound cropping techniques, such as cropping systems with living mulch (e. g., in maize), or control strategies with specific timing of phytosanitary interventions to favour natural antagonists (e. g., with late weed control to favour predators of aphids in sugar beets), most of the weed species can be controlled effectively. However, some weeds, such as the bindweeds Convolvulus ni arvensis L. and Calystegia sepium (L.) R. Br. or late emerging Amaranthus species, need supplementary control measures. In these cases, biological weed control, which generally aims at the control of a single weed species, may be suitable to complement. such ecologically sound cropping techniques. In pastures, especially of alpine regions, generally only single weed species need to be controlled. This must be done without reducing the species richness of the flora and, thus, high selectivity is required. Socio-economic projections suggest that livestock may be withdrawn from the less productive, bur high conservation value, marginal grassland, which in turn would exacerbate weed problems. The use of herbicides, even when possible, disagrees with public opinion. Biological control can be the appropriate means of control both to support sustainable pasture management and to conserve biodiversity of these habitats.

ID GREAT; ALBICOLLIS; HYPOLEUCA; RULE
AB A revision of situation in the zone of overlapping (OZ) of Parus major and P. minor; populations in the middle Amur River basin was performed based on the field studies (1991-1996) and available literature. Dimensions and shape of OZ were determined for the first time; Its total range is about 250 km. Human settlements are typical habitats of P. major, secondary broad-leaved forests in the vicinity of these localities are populated by P. minor. The most sustainable state of interaction between the populations major and minor is their co-existence in human settlements, where local and limited hybridization takes place in a narrow belt of populations' contact. This is true for the central part of OZ. In eastern OZ, where both populations inhabit settlements, mixed populations exist; there is a tendency of displacing minor forms out of human settlements (Birobidzan city). The populations are shown to come in contact 100 years ago as a result of their dispersal due to transformation of the environment because of human activities.

AB Fishes inhabiting screams and rivers in the interior of North America experience a continental climate. Water temperatures reach 0 degrees C in winter and are high in summer. There is a marked seasonal cycle in discharge. These circumstances make groundwater a crucial component of Fiver habitats, Groundwater can influence the distribution, reproductive success, biomass and productivity, behaviour and movements of fishes, and is especially important in winter and summer. Winter flows are minimal and are affected by ice. In winter, the importance of groundwater increases northwards. Groundwater provides overwintering habitat free of subsurface ice and fish may migrate long distances to take advantage of it. The melt season can account for up to half the annual discharge. In summer, groundwater is important for maintaining discharge and moderating stream temperatures. During critically hot weather, groundwater refugia protect species exposed to temperatures approaching their thermal limits. Since groundwater exerts such an important influence on river habitats, its quality, quantity and sustainability should be considered before development proposals are approved which could alter it. Examples of the role of groundwater in the ecology of some species show how localised and critical habitats influenced by groundwater can be, and, in consequence, how necessary it is to protect them. Protection is complicated because groundwater distribution pathways are often unknown and recharge areas may be remote from discharges. Scale becomes important in identifying potential risks to critical stream habitats from all types of landscape modification and water abstraction. Groundwater temperatures reflect mean annual air temperatures and are likely to change as global climates respond to increases in the greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. This could profoundly change critical fish habitats, particularly those at the margins of species distributions or those that are already overcrowded. Such considerations emphasise the importance of developing proper strategies for the conservation of groundwater. Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

   repercussions for the sustainability of tree-growing systems
SO AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
LA English

DE soil salinity; trees; water table
ID SLUG TEST
AB Tree planting is often considered an environmentally 'friendly' option for water table control in irrigation areas where water tables are shallow. This paper presents and discusses tree/water table interactions at two sites in Kyabram, Northern Victoria, Australia: one non-irrigated and planted to a range of Eucalyptus spp. and the other irrigated and planted to E. grandis at variable spacings. The non-irrigated (except for the first 7 years after planting) plantation was established in 1976. A network of observation bores and piezometers was installed in 1982. During the monitoring period 1982-1993, water tables underneath the plantation were lowered by between 2 and 4 m, compared with the adjacent paddocks. However, the impact of the trees on the piezometric levels, measured in the aquifer underneath the plantation, was less pronounced. The trees reversed the hydraulic gradient underneath the plantation, essentially converting the plantation site into a 'sub-surface discharge area.' This resulted in a build-up of soil salinity under the trees over 1984-1994. Salinity also increased in the groundwater under the plantation. A similar hydraulic gradient reversal effect was found under the irrigated variable spacing tree site. About 4 years after planting, the higher tree density (3 m spacing interval) started to lower the water table and 2 years later a similar result was found in the 7.3 m spaced trees. The deeper (10 m) piezometric pressure was not affected at any of the tree densities. This lack of impact on deeper piezometric pressures, combined with the lowering of the water table, caused a reversal of the hydraulic gradient under the high density trees (3 m spacing) 5 years after planting, which was conducive to salt movement to the base of the root zone. In spite of irrigation water being applied, the trees progressively lowered the water table, with high-density trees showing the greatest effect. It is concluded that the low transmission characteristics of the soils restrict the depth of wetting from both irrigation and rainfall, leaving uptake from the capillary fringe above the water table to supply additional transpiration in coping with demand. The long-term sustainability of deep-rooted tree plantings growing on shallow water tables is questioned; engineering mechanisms such as groundwater pumps or tile drains may be needed to sustain long-term tree growth under these conditions.

AB Tree growth, water use, climate, soil salinity and groundwater conditions were monitored over a 3-year period in an unirrigated 5-8-year-old plantation in northern Victoria, within an area where groundwater pumping is in use for control of shallow watertables and salinisation of irrigated farmland. Diameter and sapwood area of Casuarina cunninghamiana increased twice as rapidly as Eucalyptus camaldulensis, in plots with initially equal mean diameter. C. cunninghamiana had greater sapwood area but lower sap flux density, so that the daily and annual water use did not differ significantly between species. Average single tree water use determined by the heat pulse method varied from less than 101 day(-1) in winter to over 301 day(-1) in summer. Stand water use averaged 0.9-1.0 mm day(-1) over 2 years, and was evidently limited by soil water availability. The leaf area index (LAI) of the E. camaldulensis stand was estimated as 2.07 and the mean ratio of leaf area to sapwood area as 3815 m(2) m(-2). This ratio increased with sapwood area in small trees. Hydraulic properties of the soil profile were inferred from measurements of moisture content and matric potential at 30 cm depth intervals to 390 cm, indicating the presence of a medium clay layer with heavy clay above and below. Salinity and chloride distribution were also determined, indicating slight-to-moderate salinity below 30 cm depth reaching a maximum (saturation extract electrical conductivity 8 dS m(-1)) at around 200 cm. Saturated hydraulic conductivity of the heavy clay was estimated as 3 mm day(-1). Daily watertable depth observations were used to parameterise a water balance model to predict the uptake of water from unsaturated soil and shallow groundwater based on measured daily water use and rainfall, and accounting for the influence of groundwater pumping. Modelled results indicated that more than half the tree water uptake (170-220 mm year(-1)) was drawn from the groundwater. Both recharge and discharge of the groundwater occurred annually, but discharge was predominant. Intensive monitoring of soil salinity at 100-400 cm depth using buried sensors demonstrated substantial seasonal variation, apparently related to watertable movements. The average soil solution salinity rose by over 5 dS m(-1) in 32 months of monitoring, estimated to correspond to chloride accumulation of more than 4 kg m(-2). These values cannot be reconciled with the observed water use and salinity below the maximum watertable depth, and may indicate lateral inflow of more saline perched groundwater within the medium clay layer. The results are expected to contribute toward the development and validation of models for predicting the sustainability and environmental benefit of tree plantations in areas with shallow saline groundwater.

AB This paper describes the ecosystem management planning approach that has been successfully implemented for landscape-scale sustained yield plans (SYPs) and is currently being used for multispecies habitat conservation plans (HCPs). A key aspect of this approach is its emphasis on preventative management, which involves matching land use activities to the capabilities of the landscape such that forest management can occur in an ecologically sustainable manner. The planning process targets a desired future condition using a geographic information system (GIS) to store and analyze site-specific resource data. Monitoring and adaptive management will be needed to evaluate the effectiveness of the selected plan, and to continue to improve the land management plan through time. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB The question of single vs, multiple species management of threatened and endangered fishes is discussed using examples from Arizona, where efforts to conserve native fishes have largely taken a single species, 'real' approach. Such a strategy has been dictated by multiple factors including: (1) the interaction between climate and topography - interaction that legislates regional hydrology, (2) marked alteration of historic hydrology by dams, diversion, and groundwater mining, and (3) introduction of non-native species of fishes. However, opportunities for multiple and perhaps 'ideal' species management must be continually embraced, despite the increased complexity of the task. In either case, conservation of native fish communities is inseparable from conservation of habitats and will require sustaining the few remaining un-dammed, free-flowing rivers in the State and managing rivers or drainage basins to incorporate (1) sustainable riparian-stream habitats and security of habitats, (2) an ecosystem, watershed or river basin approach, and (3) a cooperative (i.e. interagency), long-term, and vigilant approach.

AB This paper presents preliminary quality and utilization data from a hospitalist system that is being implemented at Kaiser Permanente, a large health maintenance organization with 16 hospitals in northern California. Hospitalist programs, which are staffed by clinicians highly skilled in caring for inpatients, are being launched with the aim of delivering high-quality, efficient medical care in an increasingly competitive health care delivery environment. This paper also describes, in some detail, the process of implementation at one hospital. Challenges to implementation included 1) overcoming the reluctance of clinic physicians to relinquish inpatient care responsibilities, 2) developing sustainable work schedules, 3) creating effective channels of communication between staff in inpatient and outpatient settings, and 4) designing appropriate compensation scales for hospitalists. Mean length of stay, patient-day rates, admission rates, consultation request rates, costs, and readmission rates were examined for patients discharged from adult medicine services at all 16 hospitals between 1 January 1994 and 30 June 1997. These preliminary resource utilization data seem promising, but further analysis is needed to assess how hospitalist programs may affect clinical quality of care, costs, and patient and provider satisfaction.

AB While Asia's share in 1996 global aquaculture production of fish and shelfish (26.38 million mt as estimated by FAG) was maximal (91%), those of Europe (4.7%) and North America (1.8%) were low. Intriguingly, the relative increases (%) in production over the decade in both the developed continents have decreased. Among the top ten producer countries, China accounted for 67% of total world production, followed by India (7%), Japan (3%), Indonesia (2.5%), Thailand (1.9%), USA and Bangladesh (1.5%), Korea (RoK) (1.4%), philippines (1.3%) and Norway (1.2%). While India has increased its farmed freshwater fish production and shrimps very impressively, utilization of marine aquatic resources (except for shrimps), spread over an expansive EEZ of two million km, is poor. India has little production of farmed marine fishes, molluscs and seaweeds, in which even smaller Asian countries excel. An index of Biodiversty Utilization for Aquaculture (BUA), calculated for India is quite low (0.13), when compared to the highest (0.51) for Taiwan and RoK, India can gain much by diversification of aquaculture, recruiting more species from her rich aquatic fauna and flora and also by developing eco-friendly and sustainable aquaculture systems by sharing of experience and technology with our Asian neighbours through cooperative efforts.

ID GROWTH
AB Soil samples from 57 Norway spruce stands on sandy and nutrient poor soils in western Denmark were analysed for their content of exchangeable calcium, potassium and magnesium. The content of the three elements showed a strong spatial variation and the content of Mg and Ca correlated significantly with stand yield class. Estimations on nutrient export by harvest of stem and bark and a comparison with soil content, suggest that severe nutrient deficiencies may occur on many sites in the future. A soil weathering assay applied to selected sites, indicated that the long-term Ca supply is particularly critical, whereas the long-term supply of K and Mg from weathering of soil minerals, is more stable.

AB Bangalore has in the recent decades seen an explosive growth of not only the software industry but of a diversified high technology research and industrial base. More recently, infrastructural problems, among other developments, have prompted the reopening of the long-standing debate on the sustainability of this growth, which is examined in this paper from the perspective of high technology organisations that have been driving formal job creation in the recent past. Presented here are four short case studies of companies active in the field of information technology and services: one a large-scale public sector enterprise: three indigenous firms that originated as small-scale enterprises and two companies started by multinational corporations. The studies demonstrate the new challenges facing these companies and the consequences of the ongoing shift from an older paradigm of state intervention toward the new paradigm of entitled liberalisation.

DE Ethiopia; rural households; policy changes; land use practices
AB Since 1975, agricultural land tenure arrangements in Ethiopia have changed from a feudal system, to a socialist model with semi-collectivist villages and, from 1991, to a small-holder system based on private (freehold) ownership. By surveying a random sample of 94 households in the Ethiopian highlands, the paper examines (a) how de-collectivisation has affected important parts of the agrarian structure such as land tenure and common property and (b) the subsequent responses of farmers in terms of their land-use practices. The results provide some grounds for optimism that the freeing-up of the land market will bring with it more sustainable land-use practices. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The aim of this study was to detect, using time-series analysis methods, whether measurable socioeconomic adjustments for the time period 1986-96, as presented by caries index values, could be related to a new trend in caries status development for specific age groups leaving the free state-organized dental care system. In the study, Goteborg was divided into four districts. The study showed a favorable development in dental health for the 15-19 age group. However, the caries incidence index DSa (decayed approximal surfaces) values showed no or only negligible signs of lower mean values. During the study period, the study showed an unfavorable trend concerning die socioeconomic variables related to health care. However, the incongruity far the different districts between the trend results of the caries index Values and the contemporaneous socioeconomic variable development indicated few signs of relationship. In relation to general discussions of environmental questions, the idea of sustainable development was discussed when applied to the field of dental care. The results of this study indicate that dental health, in times of major economic adjustments and lack of resources for health care for the 15-19 age group in Goteborg-as interpreted by the caries indices used-is an example of sustainable dental health development.

Due to the combination of high rainfall, highly permeable soils and high N turnover rates, N losses are high and current natural pastures are calculated to mine soil N reserves with 40-60 kg ha(-1) year(-1) With current financial returns, there is no economic incentive for farmers to convert soil mining natural pastures to sustainable alternatives, viz. grass-legume mixtures or fertilized improved grasslands. When degradation of natural pastures over time due to soil N mining is considered in the model, it becomes economically attractive to replace these pastures with grass-legume mixtures. Sustainable beef cattle ranching is best realized by integrated intensification that raises total economic returns, i.e. use of grass-legumes or fertilized pastures, high levels of feed supplements and improved herd management techniques.

AB Beneficials as bioindicators of ecological plant protection effects in field studies - methods and the problems of data interpretation
   Both, investigations and evaluation of plant protection effects on beneficial arthropods in fields succeed only by using bioindicators which respond to different environmental variable or changes (stressors) with measurable state reactions. In field crops a range of indicators is suitable, single species as well as whole taxonomic groups and so-called guilds (predatory mites, specialized aphid predators, epigeous arthropods, predatory flies, aphid parasitoids and parasites of rape pests). Population responses in quantity (density, motoric activity) and quality (species composition, dominance structure, diversity, phenotypical variability, biological capacity) have to be considered. Unfortunately, the methods available for all interesting indications have their limitations and are different suitable in several field crops. Field studies should be realized as direct comparisons of plant protection types at the same site considering short-term and sustainable effects. A description of status of beneficial communities at different sites does not be a sufficient base for the incidences of an ecological impact of plant protection. For investigation of sustainable effects the data samplings have to carry out over a year as minimum. Because clear outlines of ecological values for agro-ecosystems do not exist the interpretation of findings including different groups of beneficial arthropods is difficult. Considering our view on tritrophic systems with interspecific and intraspecific interactions a combined approach for evaluation should be established. An important aim is to standardize methodical conceptions of field studies and to develop interpretation helps.

AB The effect of the form of N nutrition on soil stability is an important consideration for the management of sustainable agricultural systems. We grew soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] plants in pot cultures in unsterilized soil, and treated them by (1) inoculating them with Bradyrhizobium japonicum, fertilizing with (2) nitrate or (3) ammonia, or (4) by providing only minimum N amendment for the controls. The soils were sampled at 3-week intervals to determine changes in water-stable soil aggregates (WSA), soil pH, the development of roots, arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) soil and root colonization, and selected functional groups of soil bacteria. The soil fauna was assayed at the end of the experiment (9 weeks). WSA was correlated positively with root and AM soil mycelium development, but negatively with total bacterial counts. Soil arthropod (Collembola) numbers were negatively correlated with AM hyphal length. Soils of nodulated and ammonia-fertilized plants had the highest levels of WSA and the lowest pH at week 9. Sparse root development in the soils of the N-deficient, control plants indicated that WSA formation was primarily influenced by AM hyphae. The ratio of bacterial counts in the water-stable versus water-unstable soil fractions increased for the first 6 weeks and then declined, while counts of anaerobic bacteria increased with increasing WSA. The numbers of soil invertebrates (nematodes) and protozoans did not correlate with bacterial counts or AM soil-hyphal lengths. Soil pH did not affect mycorrhiza development, but actinomycete counts declined with decreasing soil pH. AM fungi and roots interacted as the factors that affect soil aggregation, regardless of N nutrition.

ID BRITISH-COLUMBIA; CERVICAL-CANCER; INDIAN WOMEN; RATES
AB PROBLEM ADDRESSED First Nations women in British Columbia, especially elders, are underscreened for cancer of the cervix compared with the general population and are much more likely to die of the disease than other women.
   OBJECTIVE OF PROGRAM To develop a pilot program, in consultation with community representatives, to address the Pap screening needs of First Nations women 40 years and older on a rural reserve.
   MAIN COMPONENTS OF PROGRAM Identification of key links to the population; consultation with the community to design an outreach process; identification of underscreened women; implementation of community Pap screening clinics; evaluation of the pilot program.
   CONCLUSIONS We developed a Pap screening outreach program that marked a departure from the usual screening approach in the community. First Nations community health representatives were key links for the process that involved family physicians and office staff at a local clinic on a rural reserve. Participation rate for the pilot program was 48%, resulting in an increase of 15% over the previously recorded screening rate for this population. More screening clinics of this type and evaluation for sustainability are proposed.

AB Manure management and composting methods may greatly affect compost characteristics. An experiment was conducted to characterize 23 on-farm and 6 industrial composts in Quebec (Canada). Cluster analysis identified two major groups characterized by their chemical composition, source materials, management intensity and degree of decomposition. Electrical conductivity, total N and K, water-soluble NH4+, PO4, K, Al and organic C, and a cress test were the best chemical and biological parameters for grouping composts. These groups were strongly associated with bedding rate, turning frequency, composting duration, profile windrow appearance, material aggregation and odor. When restricted to dairy manure composts, no clear relationship could be established by cluster analysis between material grouping and their farm management. Statistical analysis on single chemical parameters of dairy manure composts, however, identified five farm management factors: type and amount of bedding, system of manure handling and storage, compost windrow turning, composting length and milk production intensity. These factors affected one or several major parameters: pH, dry matter, electrical conductivity, total and water-soluble C, N, P and K, and humic components characteristics. This study demonstrated the importance of leaching losses in the on-farm composting operations in humid cold regions and the need for more environmentally sustainable composting methods.

ID EI CALCULATION
AB Erosion modeling techniques provide a framework for the evaluation of agricultural impacts on soil and water resources. Agricultural policies or economic incentives generally induce land use changes or even agricultural crop rotation changes. This results in a different erosional behavior of cultivated soil. Besides economic benefits, the sustainability of the agricultural practices with regard to soil and water resources has to be evaluated for specific local or regional conditions. This paper analyzes the spatial and temporal variability in soil erosion risks in a changing Mediterranean agro-ecological situation. At first the spatio-temporal variability of rainfall erosivity is analyzed. The depth and erosivity of design storms are determined for different return periods. Then, the temporal variability of soil loss ratios (SLR) due to different agricultural crop rotations are evaluated on watershed scale using the revised universal soil loss equation (RUSLE). The 211 km(2) Guadalteba river basin and study area is located in the region of Andalusia, southern Spain, presenting a typical south European agricultural wheat and oil producing area with marked occurrence of soil erosion problems. The spatial soil erosion risk evaluation approach is based on commonly available data and a minimum of additional field observations. The spatial distribution of input and output data is handled with the Integrated Land and Water Information System (ILWIS). (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Imagine making more goods from fewer resources and throwing virtually nothing away. That's not just some utopian dream-it's part of the 10-year plan at a leading chemical company, and it's probably the future of the industry at large.
   The process helping to make it possible is called "eco-efficiency," and it's a set of approaches that support the movement toward sustainable development.
   Innovation's also needed for sustainable growth, which demands quantum leaps, rather than incremental gains, in environmental and economic performance.

The case is made for working children's participation in the process of combatting child labour. Their participation will help ensure that interventions designed to eliminate exploitative and hazardous child labour are context appropriate, locally sustainable and child centred. This study is a contribution to the process. A specially designed Children's Perspectives Protocol guided group activities with over 300 children in Bangladesh, Ethiopia, the Philippines and Central America. This article summarizes selected issues addressed by the study, including children's occupational preferences and their views on work and school.

AB Key propositions in the theory of regional economic regeneration include concepts centered on "modernising" lagging economies. In recent decades these propositions have been amplified by the concept of "post-modern" economic structures. In such structures knowledge-creating enterprises, including universities and professional firms, are seen as critical to developing competitive advantage for localities (see Kotler et al., (1995) Managing Places, Butterworth Heinemann, London). Sustainable prosperity and new-job generation require, in this perspective, continuous creation of smaller knowledge-intensive enterprises, particularly those with technology-based products and aspirations for rapid growth. This paper first considers some of the theoretical issues arising in this approach. It then examines an in-progress field application in southern England, in which this hypothesis is being presented to and tested with regional stakeholders and investors. Using an application of the theory in the form of "the enterprise televillage programme," respondents in industry, government, and academic life are being asked to reflect on how well the proposed approach could work in advancing regional business growth. The research is embedded in a multi-agency programme of development aimed at creating a chain of such centres. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Maturing programs on child immunization and diarrheal diseases, a community-based research project, and a rational drug-use program facilitated the launching in 1989 of a nationwide Philippine Control of Acute Respiratory Infections program (Phil-CARI). From 1990 to 1991 the Phil-CARI expanded rapidly, training >80% of its middle managers and frontline health care providers on the case-management protocols of the World Health Organization for acute respiratory infection. Multiple donors and good collaboration with various societies and medical schools assisted the program. However, by 1992, there were difficulties in maintaining training quality, follow-up, and supervision. Donor assistance dwindled and the health care delivery system decentralized. Government procurement systems were unable to meet the logistics demands of the program. The monitoring and evaluation system was inadequate to measure impact. The Phil-CARI provides lessons in searching for more sustainable approaches and systems to meet the various demands of a nationwide ARI control program and to create the desired impact.

AB Relationships between large-scale patterns of biodiversity and ecoclimatic variability were examined using distributions of 789 Andean birds; recorded in 15' x 15' grid cells, and interannual differences in Normalized Difference Vegetation Index and Brightness Surface Temperature, calculated month by month and resampled to 15' cells. Following the east Andean treeline from 1 degrees N to 18 degrees S; there is no evidence of a latitudinal gradient in species richness, but a considerable local variation reflecting the habitat complexity in individual cells. The mean endemism (inverse range-size for all species present in a given cell) shows well marked peaks. Pairwise comparisons of 'peaks' and adjacent 'lows' of endemism provide strong evidence for linking peaks of endemism with local ecoclimatic stability. The most important single factor responsible for this correlation could be orographic moderation of the impacts a south polar winds. Presently manifested as occasional winter freezes in the southern part of the tropical zone, these winds may have been a major determinant of vegetational changes during Pleistocene glacial periods. The correlations suggest that most endemics are relict populations which survived periods of global climatic change in places where these impacts were moderated. It is suggested that, by retaining relict populations, these places play a significant role in the recruitment to the regional species pool. The stable places were also centres of Andean cultures and have dense human populations. The current conservation strategy of reserving areas with few people therefore needs to be supplemented with actions to secure sustainable landuse in certain densely populated areas.

AB Although the need for implementing ecosystem management across boundaries has been widely recognized, little is known regarding the extent to which loss of species richness resulting from timber harvesting in a focal forest could be offset by the surrounding areas. Using an individual-based, spatially explicit landscape simulation model (FORMOSAIC), which considers not only the dynamics of a focal forest, but also the interactions between the focal forest and the neighboring areas, we found that tree species richness of a tropical forest was related to the interactions between harvest impacts and immigration from adjacent areas. Simulation results indicated that adjacent species-rich forests increased species richness in a focal forest, but neighboring single-species plantations had opposite effects, and these effects were enhanced by the duration of immigration. Heavier harvest impacts on residual trees resulted in lower species richness, although the negative effects were partially offset by immigration from species-rich forests. Immigration after heavy harvest impact led to higher species richness than did immigration before harvesting, when the surroundings were species-rich forests. Harvesting on the edges of a focal forest resulted in higher species richness than harvesting at the center when seed dispersal distances were short, but spatial patterns of harvesting caused no differences in species richness if seeds could disperse into the focal forest from more distant sources. Under the option of no harvest, immigration was more important at small spatial scales than at large spatial scales. From the simulations, we also noticed some unexpected results. For example, heavy harvest impacts reduced a higher percentage of timber species than nontimber species. Simulation results from this study could provide insights into identification of alternative methods for sustainable timber production and conservation of tree species richness beyond natural, management, and ownership boundaries. One potential method would be to establish a species-rich seed zone around a focal forest to partially compensate for negative harvest impacts. Another option would be to harvest timber trees at optimal locations and during optimal periods of time to accommodate dispersal ability and availability of seeds from the surroundings.

AB Ecological economics is built on a value-commitment to study environmental issues and to contribute constructively to a more sustainable development path. However, many ecological economists still hesitate, it appears, to depart too much from other scholars by openly addressing issues of values and ideology. In this essay, the role of the scholar's orientation with respect to values and ideology is addressed. It is observed that not only scholars but also actors in society are guided by their 'ideological orientation'. This leads to the idea that some of the weaknesses of Economic Man and 'profit maximising firm' assumptions can be mitigated by introducing a Political Economic Person and a Political Economic Organisation.

AB This paper provides an overview of the concept of sustainability, presents our definition of sustainability, and contends that students need to have exposure to both business and scientific perspectives as undergraduates. We argue that the typical university class may be ineffective in conveying the scope of changes now taking place in the business world, and offer our pedagogic innovations as an alternative to the status quo. The result is a capstone course in sustainability team taught by one professor from the School of Business and one from the College of Arts and Science. The intended audience for the course is undergraduate students majoring in business or science. The content draws heavily on the many parallels between ecology and economics, including systems and resilience, ethics and valuation issues, and information and dialogue as central to the process of sustainability.

ID POLLUTION-CONTROL; ECONOMICS
AB In this paper, targets, institutions and policy measures for describing and implementing sustainable development are evaluated in terms of their conformity with the economic framework of a market system. From the viewpoint of neo-liberal economic thinking as conceived by the German Freiburg school of economists, a general set of criteria is developed. It includes issues of operationalization and legitimation of goals as well as institutional and instrumental issues. On this basis, general rules for designing an ecological framework guaranteeing the greatest possible degree of conformity with a market system are derived. The concrete application of these rules leads to recommendations for a policy of sustainability with respect to the setting of goals, the establishment of institutions as well as the use of appropriate instruments.

TI Has Australia surpassed its optimal macroeconomic scale? Finding out
   with the aid of 'benefit' and 'cost' accounts and a sustainable net
   benefit index
SO ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
LA English
DT Article
DE optimal macroeconomic scale; sustainable economic welfare; national
   accounts; Australia
AB The sustainable economic welfare of a nation depends largely on the sustainable net benefits the macroeconomy confers to its citizens. For this reason, an optimal macroeconomic scale can be considered one where the physical scale of the macroeconomy and the qualitative nature of the stock of wealth it comprises maximises a nation's sustainable net benefits. The corollary of this definition is thus: the physical scale of the macroeconomy should grow only if, in the process, the sustainable net benefits of a nation increase. It should cease to grow once sustainable net benefits are maximised. Whilst it is one thing to promote an optimal macroeconomic scale, it is another entirely to gain an appreciation of the sustainable net benefits yielded by the macroeconomy. Gaining such an appreciation constitutes the central aim of this paper. With the assistance of two separate 'benefit' and 'cost' accounts to replace gross domestic product (GDP), a sustainable net benefit index is constructed for Australia for the period 1966-1967 to 1994-1995. The index, particularly at the per capita level, indicates that economic welfare in Australia is declining (i.e. the average Australian is getting 'poorer') despite per capita real GDP increasing. The index therefore suggests that the scale of the Australian macroeconomy has probably well exceeded the optimum. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

TI An index of sustainable economic welfare (ISEW) for Chile
SO ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
LA English
DT Article
DE economic welfare; economic growth; accounting; Chile
AB Chile has experienced a period of strong economic growth. The Gross Domestic Product (GDP) has doubled in the past 12 years, however, income inequality remains relatively the same as in the 1960s. The economic growth is primarily attributed to the exports of natural resources, which accounts for 80% of total exports. However, the GDP fails to account for the loss of natural capital and non-marketed services. The objective of this paper is to more clearly indicate the status of the Chilean economy in terms of welfare using the Index of Sustainable Economic Welfare (ISEW) designed by Daly and Cobb (1989). The ISEW provides corrections to the GDP that includes income inequalities, household labor and damage to natural capital. This index has been applied in several case studies for developed countries. In general, the results show that ISEW runs parallel with GDP until the 1970s when a decline in welfare occurs due to a loss in natural capital. This study is the first attempt to utilize the ISEW for the purpose of analyzing whether or not similar trends exist for Chile, a developing country. The ISEW for Chile grew at a much slower annual rate over the past 30 years, compared with GDP (-0.16% vs. 2.9%). The Chilean ISEW parallels the GDP until the 1980s; a decline in the ISEW then occurs, showing that Chile is not on a sustainable path and that there is a strong link between economic growth and the depletion of natural resources.

AB Community-based organizations are struggling to find alternative strategies to successfully leverage assistance and resources to improve their neighborhoods. This article offers a three-pronged formula for sustainable community development based on an entrepreneurial approach to undertake neighborhood initiatives. Economic, social, and political capital are necessary ingredients to generate independent community-based strategies that residents and investors can manage over the long term to achieve financial and social successes. Two community organization cases are compared to determine whether different approaches to local government for community development programs and funding represent different strategies and, ultimately, different levels of success.

ID URBAN
AB In the early 1990s China experienced phenomenal, massive, speculative land development that had long range impacts on China's sustainable development. The authors attempt to examine the administrative framework of the current land-apportionment system from the perspectives both of formal or legal and of informal or quasi-legal processes. In particular, they focus on the detrimental consequences of the informal process of land apportionment, which has virtually overridden the formal process in recent years. They also cautiously scrutinize the underlying reasons for land misapportionment. They argue that the informal process is difficult to control and it will continue to impede the normal and healthy development of China's land market in the foreseeable future.

AB Environmental degradation in many hill forest regions of Asia, inhabited by indigenous/tribal communities is growing at an unprecedented rate. The case of Orissa State in eastern India is no exception. The government is of the view that the local population is responsible for forest degradation as they practice swidden cultivation and forest gathering indiscriminately to sustain their livelihoods. Based on economic merit alone, the government has undertaken some policy initiatives. Such initiatives that are meant to stop swidden cultivation have not been successful. This study recommends an integrated framework for developing a sustainable natural resource management practice for tribal communities. The framework has taken into consideration both economic and noneconomic factors in evaluating various alternatives. Furthermore, it has been applied to two tribal communities in Orissa (Juang and Saora). Based on an economic analysis comparing returns from swidden as well as wetland cultivation, it is observed that where forest degradation is not serious, wetland cultivation does not have a significant economic merit vis-g-vis swidden cultivation. However, in view of the long-term sustainability issue within ecological limits, swidden cultivation may be phased out in favor of wetland cultivation with an appropriate transition period. During this transition, government must adopt suitable policy initiatives to provide tribals tenurial rights to land, help financially in creating settled lands through terracing, introduce certain improved agroforestry techniques and train tribal people in other income-generating activities. Furthermore, all such interventions made by the government should have a strong sociocultural component in order to attract the tribal people to give up swidden cultivation.

AB For sustainable management of mangrove ecosystems, there is a pressing need to increase our knowledge of fish and invertebrates associated with this system. This study sampled microhabitats (89-258 m(2)) inside the mangrove forest at Pagbilao, the Philippines, on two consecutive spring tides using stake nets. Distribution patterns of shrimps and fish were compared among four microhabitats that differed in dominant mangrove species (Avicennia marina, A. officinalis or Rhizophora apiculata), structural complexity of the root system, and proximity to open water habitat. A 5 to 6-year-old replanted Rhizophora microhabitat was also sampled to study faunal recolonization following replantation. The mean (+/- SE) density of the shrimp community was 1.5 +/- 0.2 shrimps m(-2), dominated by Palaemonidae, followed by Acetes sp., Penaeus merguiensis and Metapenaeus ensis. The highest shrimp density was observed in the replanted Rhizophora habitat, which also had the highest structural complexity. The mean (+/- SE) density and biomass of the fish community was 5.1 +/- 2.0 fish m(-2) and 10.4 +/- 3.3 g m(-2), respectively, dominated by Ambassis kopsi, A. urotaenia and Atherinomorus balabacensis. The fish community preferred the pneumatophore (Avicennia) microhabitats to the prop root (Rhizophora) habitats. Highest fish abundance and biomass were observed in the most inland habitat, which also lacked larger (total length >100 mm) carnivorous fish. The results demonstrate the extensive use of intertidal mangrove forests by vagile fauna, as well as the successful recolonization by shrimps and fish of replanted Rhizophora habitat. The role of mangroves as predation refuges, based on the distribution pattern of shrimps and fish, is discussed. Sampling strategies in mangrove intertidal habitat are also outlined.

AB This paper develops a bioeconomic approach to yield-mortality models. The usefulness of the conceptual background of these models, and the application of the resulting reference points (RPs), are analysed in a precautionary management framework. Quantification of uncertainty by bootstrapping provided a more realistic comparison of the relative performance of RPs for management advice. Sensitivity analysis, performed under wide initial variations in the natural mortality coefficient M, displayed two important features of this bioeconomic model: (1) the yield at maximum economic yield (Y-MEY) and the associated mortality levels Z(MEY) and F-MEY were always the most conservative RPs, This takes utmost importance at low M values, where maximum sustainable yield (MSY) and the yield at maximum biological production (Y-MBP) tended to coincide, whereas MEY and mortality-related RPs were substantially lower, thus constituting useful target RPs for precautionary management, (2) The RPs derived from the biological production curve were always lower than those derived from the sustainable yield curve. The former could be used as target RPs, whereas both MSY and F-MSY Should be considered as upper exploitation limits. Sensitivity analysis conducted with the economic input of the system, the unit cost of effort (c), revealed consistency of the bioeconomic performance of the model with accepted theory, i.e., Y-MEY approaches MSY with decreasing c values. A simple approach to the formulation of risk-averse management strategies was explored using decision theory. For this purpose, the maximax, maximin and minimax regret criterion were used to evaluate alternative management decisions under uncertainty, without the need for explicit statements of probabilities on alternative hypotheses. Results confirmed the need to consider economic and MBP related RPs for precautionary management. Guidelines for future work are suggested. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Forest resource use has traditionally been multifaceted. In order to ensure that these resources continue to be available for use by current and future generations, sustainable management practices are essential for striking a balance between the varied and often competing demands associated with forest use. This has meant that analysis incorporate specific objectives and considerations aimed at minimizing the impacts of forest activities. One such management planning approach has been the inclusion of spatial restrictions in harvest scheduling analysis. This article reviews two basic harvest scheduling models which may be used for imposing spatial restrictions. Distinctions between the alternative methods are highlighted and operational considerations are discussed. This article establishes and outlines priority areas for future harvest scheduling research.

AB Globalisation, high tech development and environmental issues have made policy makers aware again of the possibilities of future studies for policy making, However, the lack of systematic knowledge about their impact is a major obstruction to a proper use of future studies. Especially since future studies no longer claim to predict the future, but are seen as a strategic tool for improving strategic interaction between key actors and for anticipatory policy making, insight in the dynamics of future studies is indispensable. In this article we review four future studies in the Netherlands with an eye on their methods and related impact on research in sustainable technology, Although in content the four studies were quite similar, they were complementary in linking research strategies and policy objectives, (C) 1999 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB This paper examines the role of the environment in Central and Eastern European states by pursuing the incompatibility between the economic development needed to maintain the democratic institutions already in place, and the crisis levels of environmental degradation in so many areas of Eastern and Central Europe. It is believed that costs of reversing environmental damages in these areas, and the implementation of sustainable development policies and technologies, are so great that the Eastern European states will be unable to meet them, which may lead to a further decline in the environmental quality in both CEE and the EU. This ability to impact the EU's environment could be the major factor in a decision by the EU to implement environmental taxes against these states. As a result, the possibility is raised that Russia may provide an alternative to the EU in the formation of a economically based bloc, with implications for trade, environment and security issues.

AB The need for management, in natural systems, and possibly in all systems, reflects an inability of the systems to operate in self-sustaining ways, due to interference, or damage to an extent that is beyond the capacities of the system for self-repair. Management need is thus a symptom of failure of the system. The more management needed, the greater the failure and management is always costly. Most freshwater systems have been seriously altered by human activities. We may wish to restore them to self-sustaining systems which provide conservation or amenity values, or products such as potable water or fish, with minimal management, or preferably none at all. This may not be possible in many cases; it is completely impossible without profound understanding of their functioning. The ecological 'challenges' in lake management are thus to remove blocks which impede this understanding. There are at least three groups of blocks: fundamental; those of approach and method; and political. The latter is no less ecological than the others; human beings and their behaviour are ecological phenomena like those of any other animal. Fundamental blocks include the complexity and stochasticity of natural systems, which may change faster than they can be dissected and understood. They include also the scarcity of complete systems for investigation. Lakes are parts of greater systems in the landscape and if these systems are no longer intact, through insensitive land use, such as drainage, it is not possible to understand interactions and influences which were not confined to the lake basin. Examples are given concerning fish and bird movements. Methodological blocks concern the scale of investigations. The need for statistical rigour confines many investigations to small scale, easily replicable phenomena. Lake systems, however, are influenced by larger scale, lakewide or more extensive effects. An example is given concerning the effects of piscivorous birds. Unless whole lakes and their catchments are subject to experimentation, these influences will remain obscure, though they may be at least as important as within-lake effects. Replication is difficult and areas with large numbers of broadly similar lakes are needed. Such areas exist, but the costs of such large scale and long-term experimentation are rarely met. Political blocks are the ultimate blocks. A society which chooses to continue exploiting natural resources in an unsustainable way is not particularly interested in the fundamental understanding which underlies sustainability. There are many symptoms that we are choosing to follow the imperatives of our selfish genes, rather than make the ethical choices of which we are alternatively capable. They include the greatly reduced support for fundamental research in the U.K., the failure to use, in the spirit in which it was intended, existing European legislation for environmental protection, and the decreased strength of imperatives for conservation in the Environment Act 1995, compared with the Water Act 1989 and the Water Resources Act of 1991.

ID WATER-QUALITY
AB Restoring lakes from a degraded state is a costly and risky enterprise. It is costly partly because 'rewinding' the cycles of degradation involves great scientific uncertainties. Therefore, the only way forward is by careful, expensive monitoring, and much adaptation of treatment as the evidence unfolds. This process requires much patience and political commitment. Therefore, the economic challenge is to find a relationship between the ecological exploration of restoration techniques and the economic justification of the outcome. Unfortunately, the basis of that justification is an economy that creates environmental degradation. So there is a cruel circularity in the economic appraisal: the process of benefit calculation is predicted on an economy that is, at present, non sustainable. This suggests that there should be another approach to economic valuation, based more on participatory processes of involving interests with a stake in the outcome and in the gains and losses that will inevitably be incurred in reaching the outcome of lake restoration. In that process, ecological science plays a vital role of explaining possible future pathways for restoration, and the dilemma of uncertainty is handled by creating various scenarios rather than models. The real challenge, therefore, is to devise a fair and full process of bargaining over lake futures, within which both ecology and economics play important, but subsidiary roles.

AB Evidence suggests a net decline in the quality and quantity of still waters over most of the developed world. A strategy predicated on merely 'sustaining' them as isolated resources is ultimately unsustainable. True sustainable development takes account of the ecological, social and economic values of still waters within the context of living catchments. Catchment management has begun to move thinking about water management 'upstream', towards causes and integrated solutions, rather than local amelioration of 'downstream' effects. Application of systems thinking, which focuses on holistic dynamic systems and the factors that influence them, offers a powerful means to extend this 'upstream' thinking. This includes, as an important component, a movement towards cyclical resource utilisation and away from linear flows based on a mine-use-dispose ethos. 'The Natural Step' presents a generic yet science-based framework to support decision-makers across the diversity of sectors of society that influence the water cycle, and which ultimately affect still waters. It is rooted in systems thinking, taking the biospheric system of matter and energy cycling as its frame of reference, yet presents these as simple and readily-comprehensible "rules" that are powerful through their very simplicity and generic applicability. Application of 'The Natural Step' systems thinking to complex and diverse problems affecting still waters offers high-level insight, comprehensible to decision-makers in all sectors of society, which may potentially lead to cost-effective and sustainable solutions.

AB Sustainable lake management for nutrient-enriched lakes must be underpinned by an understanding of both the functioning of the lake, and the origins of changes in nutrient loading from the catchment. To date, limnologists have tended to focus on studying the impact of nutrient enrichment on the lake biota, and the dynamics of nutrient cycling between the water column, biota and sediments within the lake. Relatively less attention has been paid to understanding the specific origins of nutrient loading from the catchment and nutrient transport pathways linking the lake to its catchment. As such, when devising catchment management strategies to reduce nutrient loading on enriched lakes, assumptions have been made regarding the relative significance of non-point versus point sources in the catchment. These are not always supported by research conducted on catchment nutrient dynamics in other fields of freshwater science. Studies on nutrient enrichment in lakes need to take account of the history of catchment use and management specific to each lake in order to devise targeted and sustainable management strategies to reduce nutrient loading to enriched lakes. Here a modelling approach which allows quantification of the relative contribution of nutrients from each specific point and non-point catchment source over the course of catchment history is presented. The approach has been applied to three contrasting catchments in the U.K. for the period 1931 to present. These are the catchment of Slapton Ley in south Devon, the River Esk in Cumbria and the Deben Estuary in Suffolk. Each catchment showed marked variations in the nature and intensity of land use and management. The model output quantifies the relative importance of point source versus non-point livestock and land use sources in each of the catchments, and demonstrates the necessity for an understanding of site-specific catchment history in devising suitable management strategies for the reduction of nutrient loading on enriched lakes.

AB Eastern England, the driest part of England, has the fastest population growth and water demand in the UK. Existing supplies taken from groundwater have to be supported by surface water, in pumped storage reservoirs supplied from highly eutrophic rivers. These reservoirs are managed primarily by technical means to produce high quality drinking water but there is recognition that intensive recreational use has to be a compatible part of their management. In the future progress towards a more sustainable, ecologically-based management is possible.

ID BARLEY-STRAW; ANTIALGAL ACTIVITY
AB When barley straw and deciduous leaf litter decompose aerobically in water, inhibitors are released that suppress the growth of nuisance algae. Barley straw has been widely used for algal control in small, shallow lakes and we review the advantages and disadvantages of the method. It is particularly effective at promoting the switch from algal to macrophyte domination. Despite its cheapness and apparent safety in the short term, however, the use of barley straw requires considerable management effort and the long-term ecological safety of such un-natural litter inputs is unkown. We therefore recommend it to lake managers primarily as a short-term measure. Deciduous leaf litter from a range of woody species can suppress the growth of Chlorella and Microcystis very effectively in laboratory bioassays and, in field trials with medium-sized ponds, the addition of leaf litter produced significant inhibition of the filamentous alga Cladophora glomerata. We followed the development of algal inhibitory activity over 2.5 years with freshly fallen oak leaves placed in a large tank of aerated water and using Chlorella as the test species. Two periods of inhibitor release were identified: 4-90 days (early phase) when soluble, relatively stable inhibitors were present in tank liquor, probably generated from oxidized tannins; and 120-900+ days (late phase) when inhibitors were relatively unstable in solution and were associated primarily with fine particulate organic matter (FPOM). Late phase inhibitors may, as suggested for barley straw, be generated during the oxidative breakdown of lignin. The prolonged and powerful anti-algal properties of these natual litter inputs offer possibilities for low-effort, sustainable management of lakes and catchments so as to reduce the problem excessive algal growth.

AB In regions with high inter-annual climatic variability, lake management strategies should be based on scientific data covering the maximum range of lake dynamics. Lake Sanabria is a monomictic lake located in a gneiss-dominated glacial valley at 1000 m a. m. s. l. in NW Spain. A three-year study was carried out during 1987-89 to obtain the basic ecological knowledge required for a sustainable lake management. Water and phytoplankton samples were collected from several depths of the water column at the deepest zone of the lake. Temperature and Secchi disk visibility, and total and dissolved inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus, chlorophyll a, and phytoplankton species composition and abundance (in laboratory) were determined monthly following standard limnological methods. Stratification began in March-April, with the thermocline stabilized at between 6-10 m, and lasted until November-December. The euphotic depth was higher than the mixing depth throughout the stratification period, except in the month previous to the water column mixing. The water residence time, estimated from the volume of the lake and the inflows and outflows, was between 0.48-0.67 years. However, during the months of highest rainfall (September-February) it was up to three times greater than during the same months of low rainy years. Nutrient concentrations in the water were very low throughout the year (52 mu g l(-1) dissolved inorganic nitrogen, 6.1 mu g l(-1) soluble reactive phosphorus, and 1.45 mg l(-1) soluble reactive silica) and dominated by the dissolved organic fractions, which was related to the inputs of organic materials from the densely forested catchment. The colour of the lake, 21-41 mg Pt l(-1), is also indicative of the relatively high amount of organic substances dissolved in the waters of the lake. A bloom of cyanobacteria ( Microcystis flos-aquae, Aphanothece clathrata, Merismopedia tenuisssima, Synechococcus sp.) persisted in most of the water column during August 1988-March 1989, associated with the high residence time of the water. In contrast, the cyanobacteria bloom was limited to the mesolimnion for 3-5 months during 1987 and 1989. A model is proposed for the seasonal variation of the phytoplankton, which differentiates the seasonal trend during years of high water turnover from that of years with long residence time. Lake Sanabria is oligotrophic, based on a range of criteria (Secchi disk visibility, chlorophyll a concentration, total phosphorus concentration). However, during years of long water residence time (e.g. 1988), the annual input of total phosphorus is critical to maintain the characteristics of the lake. Short-term strategies for the management of lakes should take into account the inter-annual variability rather than averages as indicators to prevent the impact of increased nutrient inputs derived from changes in land and water use in the catchment area. Long-term strategies should also consider the potential changes in the lake's dynamics, derived from the changes in the rainfall pattern caused by climatic changes.

ID EUTROPHICATION
AB This paper discusses how the use of nature conservation targets can influence the practice of the management and rehabilitation of shallow lakes. It suggests that managers need to identify realistic targets, based on a sound understanding of the nature and ecological processes operating in the lakes in question. The constraints on effective management towards ecological targets are identified in the context of the rehabilitation of shallow lakes from eutrophication. It is recognised that most commonly, nature conservation is one of several objectives in lake management. Using the Norfolk Broads case study, it identifies a range of ecological and human use influences that need to be assessed in order to form the basis of an integrated, sustainable approach to rehabilitation from the effects of eutrophication. The way in which nature conservation is taken account of through each stage in the planning of broads restoration projects is discussed, and the need for further specific advice for lake managers is indicated. This paper stresses the benefits of large scale experimental management, backed up by research and monitoring as a way of taking forward this applied science. The need for good communication with partner agencies and the local community when undertaking this management work, is also emphasised.

AB The large western Irish lakes are natural salmonid lakes and a unique ecological resource. Lough Mask (82 km(2)) and Lough Conn (50 km(2)), Co. Mayo, are among the finest, natural, wild brown trout fisheries in Europe. Recently, however, threats have arisen to water quality in Lough Conn as a result of agricultural intensification. A doubling of phosphorus (P) inputs to Lough Conn for the period 1980 to 1990 caused a number of ecological changes such as an apparent increase in littoral algal production; while arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus L.) have also disappeared from the lake over the same period of time. The changes in Lough Conn appear to represent an early phase in the eutrophication process. The western Irish lakes represent a super-sensitive ecological category requiring particularly strict catchment controls in order to protect the diversity of native flora and fauna including unusual glacial relict species and the unique genetic strains of fish which are present. Catchment management committees were established in order to study and reverse the perceived early-stage eutrophication problem in Lough Conn and in order to prevent the occurrence of similar problems in the case of Lough Mask. These committees have a sectoral basis covering: agriculture, local authority functions (sewage, rural septic tanks, planning and environmental control), forestry, peat harvesting and drainage works, as well as having representation from the fisheries boards and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Management of these relatively pristine lakes is perhaps a more difficult problem than that of cleaning up an obviously degraded resource. This is especially so since they are located in regions which are economically underdeveloped and where a real need exists to improve economic returns from farming, tourism and industry in the catchments. The importance of developing a sustainable, ecologically-based management strategy which will maintain existing high quality lakes into the next century with their irreplaceable genetic and ecological resources intact cannot be over-emphasised. The challenge is to devise refined management strategies which will eliminate nutrient wastage to waters and yet allow an appropriate level of sustainable development in the area. The management of Lough Conn and Lough Mask is described in some detail concentrating in particular on the efforts to reduce phosphorus loss from agriculture in the catchment but also emphasising the importance of a multi-sectoral approach to phosphorus load reduction.

AB This review summarizes advances in soil organic matter (SOM) research obtained by applications of analytical pyrolysis. Conventional pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS) was used to investigate a wide range of plans materials and humic substances. Much fewer investigations of whole soils were reported. On the basis of pyrolysis-field ionization mass spectrometry (Py-FIMS) and complementary chemical, physical and biological analyses, progress was achieved in the discovery of relationships between: (1) organic precursors and SOM composition, (2) geographic origin and SOM, and (3) specific SOM constituents and soil functions, e.g. unknown soil N, dissolved organic matter (DOM), particle-size, density and aggregate fractions. Hence it can be concluded that analytical pyrolysis has been developed as a key method for SOM and DOM research and will expand into urgent problems of environmental chemistry with topics such as soil and groundwater contamination, soil amelioration, sustainable agriculture, etc., and, last but not least, the fundamental objectives of soil structure, processes and quality.

AB Perceived contemporary issues are 1) food safety and food healthfulness, 2) environment, 3) sustainability, 4) biotechnology, 5) animal well-being, 6) animals as food, and 7) research funding. Food safety is the paramount contemporary issue, and environment and sustainability issues can be considered as a single issue. Biotechnology, animal wellbeing, and animals as food are addressed in this paper as separate issues, but they can be considered as components of food safety and healthfulness. The pharmaceutical industry addresses these issues by providing safe and effective products to the livestock industry. These products are used to treat and prevent disease and to increase livestock production efficiency. These products contribute to a safe food supply, enhance protection of the environment, and increase the sustainability of animal agriculture through increased efficiency of livestock production. The pharmaceutical industry wants the following from animal science departments: 1) students skilled in deductive and inductive thinking and communicating to peers and the public; 2) regional research on food safety, such as irradiation, steaming of carcasses, E. coli contamination, antibiotic resistance, production facilities, and carcass contamination; 3) improved research to identify the food values of animal products and effective communication of that research to the public; 4) research on topics having the greatest potential to increase efficiency of animal production consistent with a positive impact on the environment and sustainability of animal production; 5) leadership in developing and using technologies such as biotechnology, not only as descriptors of biological processes, but as technologies to test hypotheses leading to new understandings of biology; 6) research on animal wellbeing and production facilities that foster animal wellbeing; 7) research and education on ethical and moral aspects of animals as food through encouragement of one or more staff members to become effective animal science department spokespersons; and 8) active participation in activities such as FAIR 95, Federation of Animal Science Societies, and multidepartmental and(or) interdisciplinary programs.

DE pigs; nutrient improvement; manures; management
AB The goal of pork producers is to operate in a sustainable manner that includes among other requirements, environmental soundness, social acceptability, and profitability. Gains in efficiency have reduced nutrient by-products per pig, but competitive forces have led to specialization, larger farms, and concentrated areas of production that have resulted in new opportunities related to nutrient management. Available technology uses on-farm processing or storage facilities, and manure is applied to the land as an organic fertilizer. Knowledge of nutrient content of soils and crop uptake of nutrients is incorporated into manure application and crop removal plans to prevent either runoff or nutrient buildup on the land. This is to ensure water quality protection. Existing systems are adequate but lack flexibility, require effective management, may not have been incorporated into older farms, and do not offer obvious solutions to odor concerns. Cost-effective alternatives should address those needs. Advancement in nutrient management procedures will likely accelerate the ongoing changes in the structure of the swine industry.

   2. Long-term data on numbers of cockies and weights of their shells were used to estimate their annual production on Balgzand, a 50-km(2) tidal flat area in the westernmost part of the Wadden Sea. During the 1969-97 period, it amounted to an average of 125 g m(-2), including 107 g m(-2) of shells large enough to be exploitable for shell-lime fishery.
   3. The very irregular annual recruitment of cockies was the main cause of the wide 95% confidence limits (74 and 140 g m(-2) year(-1)) of this 28-year estimate. Moreover, high mortality rates in severe winters substantially reduced production per recruit in some year classes.
   4. About one-third of the estimated production does not reach exploitable stocks, because it is fragmented by birds (particularly elder ducks), permanently buried in the sediment, or removed by the fishery for live cockies.
   5. During the last few decades, the estimated mean amount added annually to the exploitable stocks was 88 million kg or 132 000 m(3) of large cockle shells. This amount compares favourably with the current annual level of removal of 134 000 m(3) of shells, three-quarters of which are cockies.
   6. Even at temporarily lower production rates, the exploitation of shell stocks at its present rate is not expected to lead to a rapid exhaustion of the existing stocks in the tidal inlets of the Dutch Wadden Sea, as these stocks will be in the order of a few million m(3).

ID CONSERVATION
AB Due to implementation of Structural Adjustment Programs, prices of agricultural products have increased in many developing countries. From an environmental point of view, it is an open question whether these price increases stimulate sustainable agriculture. In the context of a simple model that includes (labour intensive) investments in soil conservation, it is demonstrated that rising prices for agricultural outputs unambiguously increase soil conservation in the steady state. With imperfect labour markets, the reverse effect may occur, giving rise to a conflict between agricultural reform programs and soil conservation. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V, All rights reserved.

SO JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT STUDIES

DT Article
AB China is revamping its enterprise-based old-age security system and introducing a pension programme financed by the employer employee, and the government through a combination of pooled funds and individual accounts. The new system is expanding coverage to the urban workforce outside the state sector and protecting benefits against inflation, The decentralised nature of the pension pools, however limits increases in efficiency and portability of pension benefits. Sustainability of the revised system will require attention to fund management regulations and preparation for rapid population ageing by expanding coverage to rural wage earners and reducing benefits.

AB Hypotheses about possible mechanisms for spillover processes between pro-environmental behaviours are developed and tested by means of structural equation modelling. Data were collected by means of telephone interviews with a representative sample of Danish adults. Personal norms concerning recycling and packaging waste prevention are found to be rooted in the same more general, internalised values. Further, a predicted positive spillover effect from recycling to packaging waste prevention is confirmed. However, whereas a positive spillover effect from recycling to personal norms concerning packaging waste prevention is predicted, the reverse is found. Neither is it confirmed that performing an environmentally friendly behaviour makes attitudinal and more distal antecedents of related behaviours more predictive of the next step in the assumed causal chain.

AB We conducted this study to determine whether two of the physiological changes associated with non-sustainable exercise, elevated blood lactate levels and decreased arterial pH, contribute to the behavioral hypothermia exhibited by exhausted lizards. Dipsosaurus dorsalis were placed in a thermal gradient and their body temperatures were recorded from 08:00 to 14:00h. At 14:00h, animals were subjected to different experimental regimens. In the exercise (E) regimen, animals at 40 degrees C were forced to exercise maximally for 5 min on a treadmill. In the lactate (L) regimen, animals were infused with 11.5 ml kg(-1) of 250-500 mmol l(-1) sodium lactate. In the osmolarity control (O) regimen, animals mere injected with 11.5 ml kg(-1) of 500 mmol l(-1) NaCl, and in the injection control (I) regimen, animals were injected with 11.5 ml kg(-1) of 150 mmol l(-1) NaCl, In the hypercapnia (H) regimen, the thermal gradient was flushed n ith a gas mixture containing 10 % CO2, 21 % O-2 and 69 % N-2, a treatment that lowers the arterial pH of D. dorsalis to a value comparable with that imposed by exhaustive exercise. A group of control (C) animals was left undisturbed in the thermal gradient for 24 h, Animals in all experimental groups were returned to the thermal gradient, and their cloacal temperatures were monitored until 08:00 h the following morning. The mean cloacal temperature of E animals underwent a significant decrease of 4-7 degrees C, relative to control animals, which persisted for 7 h, The mean cloacal temperatures of animals subjected to 2 h of regimen H also decreased by 3.5-9 degrees C and remained depressed for 12 h following the beginning of the treatment. L, O and I animals did not undergo a significant change in body temperature following treatment, and their mean body temperatures did not differ from those of C animals at any time during the experiment, The results of this study suggest that the metabolic acidosis, but not the elevated blood lactate level, that follows exhausting exercise might play a role in the behavioral hypothermia that follows exhausting exercise in D, dorsalis.

AB Two state forests and one county forest have completed pilot programs testing verification of sustainable forest management by outside organizations. Among other goals, each agency wanted to assure citizens that their forests were well managed and to create models for nonindustrial private forestlands. All three agencies' performance was certified, and areas marked for improvement had already by targeted by staff. The certifed then evaluated the certifiers and found them generally professional and technically competent, if occasionally unrealistic. Reaction from environmental organizations, which are cautious about promoting certification for public lands, has been mixed.

ID EQUITY PREMIUM PUZZLE; RISK-FREE RATE; ASSET RETURNS; UNITED-STATES;

   PRICES
AB Historically, average real returns on U.S. government debt have been far below the rate of economic growth, allowing the U.S, government to roll over its debt at a remarkably low cost. At the same time, the rate of return on capital has generally been above the growth tate, suggesting that the U.S, economy is dynamically efficient. The paper shows that the welfare implications of budget deficits in this scenario depend critically on why interest rates have been so low. If the government can offer low returns on its debt because of some unique ability to create default-free claims, persistent primary budget deficits may be unproblematic. But if low interest rates are due to high risk aversion, policies that exploit the low cost of government debt to run frequent budget deficits will impose significant risks on future taxpayers. In essence, safe government debt is safe for the debt holders, but it is very risky for the taxpayers who are implicitly taking a short position in the safe security.

AB Performance improvement integration in health care organizations is a challenge for health care leaders. Required for accreditation by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (Joint Commission), performance improvement (PI) can be designed as a sustainable model for performance to survive in a turbulent period. Central Baptist Hospital developed a model for PI that focused on strategy established by the leadership team, delineated responsibility through the organizational structure of shared governance, and accountability for outcomes evidenced through the organization's profitability. Such an approach integrated into the culture of the organization can produce positive financial margins, positive customer satisfaction, and commendations from the Joint Commission.

AB A study dealing with ecological sustainability of plantation based land use initiated in 1991 and in a 19 yr old coconut plantation consists of growing certain leguminous crops like Atylosia, Pueraria, Centrosema and Calopogonium as soil cover in separate plots with lemon grass as live bounds. These cover crops are grown during the rainy season and incorporated into the soil towards the end of the monsoon every year. The effect of such cover crops on soil microbial counts (total counts, fungi, actinomycetes and bacteria), biomass C, organic C, total N and on the activity of enzymes like urease, amidase, L-glutaminase, aryl sulphatase and dehydrogenase was determined in soils (Ap horizon) collected from these plots after 5 years.
   Soils with cover crops registered significantly higher microbial biomass, biomass C, organic C and total N compared to control. Consequently, all the enzymes were activated to different degrees in soils with cove crops. Significant and positive relationships of enzyme activities with organic C, mineral N and total N suggested that growing cover crops, increased C turnover and N availability and therefore, provided a conducive environment for microbial proliferation, enzyme synthesis and accumulation in the soil matrix.

TI The plant tissue culture scene in India: [II] financial considerations
   for technology sustainability
SO JOURNAL OF SCIENTIFIC & INDUSTRIAL RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
AB As a part of our ongoing study on the various interactions of the plant tissue culture (PTC) industry and as a part of a project (under CSIR Emeritus Scientist Scheme), on "Study and Development of Models for Transfer of Tissue Culture Technologies", the influence of financial policies on the PTC industry has been investigated. We have interacted with several financial managers as well as industry personnel, in order to identify the barriers as well as possible solutions in order to overcome the limiting factors. This communication is a brief compilation of the views expressed by these two groups. The PERT (Project Evaluation and Review Techniques) network analysis for a test case of establishment of a micro propagation project further illustrates the influence of the financial aspects of the PTC industry. The implications of these analyses may provide guidelines in formulating effective mechanisms for the sustenance of the industry.

TI Recharge of the Snake River Plain aquifer: Transitioning from incidental
   to managed
SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION
LA English
DT Article
DE water management; water policy; water development; aquifer recharge;
   artificial recharge; managed recharge; groundwater hydrology
AB Declining ground-water levels and spring discharges have heightened water user concerns about the sustainability of the Snake River Plain aquifer in southern Idaho. Diminished recharge from surface water irrigation and increased irrigation pumping have been depleting the aquifer at a rate of about 350,000 acre-feet/year. Previously, aquifer conditions were treated as an uncontrollable consequence of weather and development activities. With increasing competition for available water, the State appears to be progressing through a three-stage process of recharge management. The first stage is that which has occurred historically where recharge is largely an incidental effect of surface water irrigation. The second stage is the implementation of intentional recharge with little regard to identifying or maximizing benefits. Idaho has been at this stage for the past few years. The State is entering a third stage in which recharge sites will be located and designed to meet specific water user and environmental objectives. Preliminary estimates using numerical and analytical models demonstrate that managed recharge within a few miles of the river will result in short-term increases in spring discharge. More distant recharge sites are needed to provide longer-term benefits. The primary challenge facing implementation of the managed recharge program will be the balancing of economic and environmental costs and benefits and to whom they accrue.

AB The Environment Agency is midway through a programme of 'local environment agency plans' for all of England and Wales by the Millennium. To complement them, the Agency has published two overarching plans one of which is regional and the other sub-regional in scale. 'Thames Environment 21' and 'The North Wessex Plan' deal with the potential impact of development pressures and their consequent implications for the environment. Both give practical expression to the Agency's environmental strategy for the Millennium, which concentrates on issues of direct concern to local planning authorities, e.g. addressing climate change, improving air quality, managing water resources, managing waste and enhancing biodiversity.

AB The marketing audit is widely regarded as a valuable diagnostic device in marketing planning. In theory it should be the starting-point for any considered course of managerial action in marketing. In practice there is often confusion about how to translate the principles of marketing auditing into tangible outcomes. The article clarifies the role of marketing auditing as an intervention that facilitates learning and transformation towards a culture of sustainable continuous improvement. In doing so it draws clear links between the means of marketing auditing, i.e., diagnosis, and its end, i.e., incremental organisational change. The author sets out an approach to process and practice in marketing auditing that places benchmarks and benchmarking at its centre. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Building knowledge management into strategy: Making sense of a new
   perspective
SO LONG RANGE PLANNING
LA English
DT Article
AB Knowledge management is rapidly becoming one of the next big trends. All the signs are apparent in the number of recent conferences, articles and books devoted to the topic. Even the comic strip Dilbert has taken notice and poked fun at it. Our experience of earlier management trends, including BPR, organizational learning and TQM, might cause sceptics to question: so what's new here? The experiences of knowledge management pioneers in North America and Europe show that real and significant results are possible. However, as with older methodologies, good planning and implementation are essential; and success is not guaranteed.
   This paper explores how managers might build knowledge management into the strategy process in their firms. Much has already been written about the philosophy and concepts of knowledge and intellectual capital. Less attention has been focused on how to combine a knowledge perspective with established strategy tools, or how to develop unique knowledge-based sources of sustainable competitive advantage. Gary Hamel and C.K. Prahalad have observed that managers typically spend too little time thinking seriously about strategy and the future. We need to ensure that in this limited time, the important dimension of knowledge doesn't get overlooked. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB An understanding of the level, structure and origin of genetic variation within and among populations of tropical trees is essential for devising optimum management strategies for their sustainable utilization and conservation. Here, amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) analysis was used to partition genetic variation within and among nine populations of the predominantly riverine tree, Calycophyllum spruceanum, sampled across a wide geographical range along river tributaries of the Peruvian Amazon Basin. Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) employed 65 AFLP markers and revealed most variation among individuals within populations (91%), although variation among populations was highly significant (P < 0.001). Calculation of genetic distances and nested AMOVA indicated a degree of structuring among populations based on geographical proximity, although clustering did not depend on geographical distance alone. No firm evidence was obtained for unidirectional seed dispersal by water playing an important role in determining genetic structure over the geographical range sampled. Implications of data for optimising genetic management of the species are discussed and areas for further study identified.

TI Sustainability of commercial vegetable production under fallow systems
   in the uplands of Mindanao, the Philippines
SO MOUNTAIN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
ID LEUCAENA; SOIL
AB The quality of fallow lands in northern Mindanao, the Philippines, was assessed with a farm survey and soil sampling in order to understand land-use dynamics under upland commercial vegetable production systems. Twenty-one percent of commercial vegetable growers practiced fallow systems, with an average re-cultivation period of four years. The soils of the fallow lands were highly acidic, nutrient poor, and higher in exchangeable aluminum compared to lands currently under cultivation. Land fallowing was more prominent on large farms and those with higher farm labor requirements. Two distinct groups of land fallowers were identified. The first represented fallowers with a positive net return from vegetable crops while the second, and larger, group represented land fallowers with negative net return from vegetable crops. Re-cultivation of fallow lands was more common in the second group. To rejuvenate fallow lands, timber tree planting was the most preferred option of the first group while fruit trees were preferred by the second group. In light of the apparently slow rate of soil fertility regeneration, the lack of capital among most land fallowers, and the increasing demand for arable land to raise farm income, planting of trees on cultivated lands before their being set aside as fallow for natural fertility regeneration is suggested as a potential measure to increase farm income and the sustainability of upland commercial vegetable production under fallow systems.

ID ADOPTION
AB Soil fertility enhancing technologies (SFETs) have been promoted in the West African Semi-Arid Tropics (WASAT) for many years with limited success. Using a qualitative approach of focus group discussions, long, open-ended interviews and observations from held visits, this paper explores with farmers their beliefs and rationales behind the adoption or non-adoption of SFETs. Farmers are knowledgeable about, and practise SFETs of rock phosphate application, crop residue and farm yard manure, chemical fertilizer and crop rotation to combat soil fertility decline. Their attitudes to and rationales behind adoption decisions are influenced by the availability and use policies of land and labour resources, food security concerns, perceived profitability, contribution to sustainability and access to information. Some of the factors are beyond farmers' control and require a broad and integrated effort from research, extension and government to promote the use of the SFETs in the region.

AB This paper presents a methodology to analyze the responsiveness of fiscal sustainability to the "endogenous fiscal discipline" that will be strengthened by the EMU. This discipline arises in response to the harmonization of tax systems, the loss of control of current and prospective money financing, and the deepening of financial market-based discipline. The model developed in this paper is a generalization of Blanchard's 1984 model, in which the interest rate is determined endogenously. This provides the framework to analyze more features of the linkage between sustainability and endogenous fiscal discipline. This paper also presents a new intratemporal fiscal sustainability index.

AB With renewed economic interest in the Southeast Asian region following the 'peace dividend' of the early 1990s, numerous hydrodevelopment plans have been initiated in the Mekong basin. The river-as-resource, in a glibly bioregional metaphor, has been transformed from a Cold War 'front line' into a 'corridor of commerce', drawing six riparian states together in the pursuit of sustainable development through economic and infrastructural integration and cooperation, promoted by multi- and bilateral donors and lending institutions. Through a brief examination of the discursive framing of Mekong hydrodevelopment, this paper uncovers some of the implications of an emerging regional geopolitical imagination centred on the naturalising metaphor of the watershed. Through a discussion of the increasing involvement of private capital, and the politicisation of resource use, the implications of hydrodevelopment for Laos, an upstream state currently undergoing major hydrodevelopment, and Cambodia, a downstream state, are explored.

AB Specifically, budgetary content analyses and secondary data are combined to develop a multiple regression model. The model uses the 1991 per capita defensive expenditures of 832 municipal governments as the response variable. These data are aggregated into 49 regions to ensure administrative commensurability. Model selection began with a nide array of predictor variables thought to exert an influence on the defensive expenditures. The final model includes four predictor variables: provincial transfer payments for defensive expenditures per capita, property taxes per capita, median household income, and total pollution output per region. These four variables are significantly and positively associated with 73.5% of the variation in defensive expenditures (adjusted R(2) = .735, p < .0001). An interpretation of the results suggests a need for a more place-sensitive approach to environmental accounting to ensure differences in environmental quality do not confound the analysis.

TI Globalization: implications for development learning
SO PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION AND DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB Globalization represents growing integration of the economic, financial, political, social and cultural lives of countries. Rapid globalization has been induced by a scientific-technological revolution, by the need to reap the economies of scale of international markets and the unprecedented openness of countries. It has simultaneously opened up a world of immense opportunities and of challenges and risks for developing countries. Integration also makes the process of learning much more demanding, requiring continuous change and nurturing of the process. In the coming years, developments in five areas-globalization, urbanization, decentralization, governance, and the environment-will have profound implications for international co-operation, for the activities of national and subnational governments, for the development approach adopted by national and international organizations? and for the cultural integrity of communities. As global needs for knowledge increase, the challenge for development learning institutions is to understand the dynamics of the learning process and to disseminate knowledge and information that embody some of the best practices and technology from around the world. At the same time it is important that they remain closely attuned to the client, so that services reflect needs, and programmes make the most of available resources and help clients to address poverty and sustainable development.

TI Poverty perspectives of the DFID White Paper and the Australian Aid
   Review: implications for international training
SO PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION AND DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB This article compares the approaches to poverty elimination adopted by the UK government White Paper on international development and the Australian government's review of its overseas aid programme (Ausaid Review). Both documents adopt sustainable poverty reduction/elimination as the key policy leitmotiv of overseas aid policy. However, a difference of approach is in evidence. The UK White Paper ventriloquizes the DAC and World Summit social policy targets and ambitiously elevates its own departmental policy and values to that of government policy overall-though without specifying the instruments by which this consistency can be assured. The silence on the resource implications of the overriding objective of poverty elimination, in terms of budgetary provision, could create a credibility gap between intentions and programme implementation. The Ausaid Review, on the other hand, hones its cutting edge on the complex, often self-serving array of development programmes that are often lacking in focus and harboured from external scrutiny by an overprotective bureaucracy. The Review suggests the adoption of a single value statement of 'poverty reduction through sustainable development' by which all programmes should be judged. The predominantly Australian-based tertiary education scholarship programme is criticized for pandering to domestic educational constituencies and reflecting a weak linkage to poverty reduction. However, in the final analysis the narrow geographical focus of the programme, the privileged status of PNG and the level of tied aid remain substantially intact-despite serious question marks over their poverty content.

TI Training implications of changing donor approaches
SO PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION AND DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB In recent months, donors have signalled a desire to move away from the orthodoxy of project aid. Project aid is criticized as being donor led and creating non-sustainable systems. Furthermore, it works outside the main structures of government ministries. In its place the new paradigm calls for sector investment and development programmes which are seen as being more integrated into ministry structures. By making greater demands on those structures, they will create an impetus for lasting change. Training in this contest is a facilitating process to ensure that these higher level demands can be met.

AB The effects of long-term agricultural management on active soil organic matter (SOM) and short-term microbial C and N dynamics were investigated. Short-term changes in chemical and biological variables after incorporating fresh rye shoots were measured in intact soil cylinders from three contrasting agricultural systems. Two of the soils were from organic or conventional 4-yr rotations which had been in place for 6 yr as part of the University of California at Davis Sustainable Agriculture Farming Systems (SAFS) project and the third was from a double-cropped, intensive vegetable production system in the Salinas Valley of California, Microbial biomass (MB) and respiration, numbers of organisms in several trophic groups, soil inorganic N, dissolved organic C and recoverable rye were measured before and during the 6 weeks following rye incorporation. Active soil organic matter, expressed as the ratios of microbial biomass C or N to total soil C or N, respectively, appeared to be related to longterm management. These ratios increased in proportion to increased organic inputs and reduced tillage or periods of fallow. In all soils, MBC increased and decreased rapidly following rye incorporation, but MBN was fairly constant. Significant differences among the soils in MBC and MBN were maintained over the 6 week experiment. Following rye incorporation, fluorescein diacetate (FDA) active counts of bacteria and bacterial-feeding nematodes increased rapidly, whereas changes in FDA active fungal hyphal lengths and fungal-feeding nematodes were less pronounced. The rates of rye decomposition, respiration and net N mineralization were highest the first week after incorporation, coincident with increases in MBC and numbers of active bacteria in all three soils. There were significant differences among soils in numbers of organisms in the trophic groups on some sample dates, but changes in soil respiration and inorganic N and the rate of rye decomposition remained similar in all three soils. The SAFS organic soil had a somewhat lower ratio of bacterial to fungal biomass and lower ratio of respiration to MBC throughout the experiment than the SAFS conventional soil. Despite long-term differences in agricultural management and differences in active SOM contents among the three soils, the rates of rye decomposition and C and N mineralization were similar. Rye incorporation produced a short-term burst of microbial growth and activity of similar magnitude in all three soils although the initial MB contents in the three soils were different. Variations among the soils in FDA active counts of fungi and numbers of bacterial- and fungal-feeding nematodes indicated that microbial community composition was more responsive to rye incorporation than were changes in soil C and N pools.

AB Flagellaria guineensis occurs in the subtropical indigenous forests in the coastal districts of Transkei, South Africa, where its stems are used for making baskets and other woven products. This use of a non-timber forest product is seen as a potential means of alleviating poverty in that area, but little is known about the utilization patterns of F. guineensis or the sustainability of such an enterprise. Data on the utilization patterns were obtained from official government records to identify the forests from which this plant was harvested and the quantities removed from 1981-1989. Harvesting of F. guineensis was a seasonal activity, most of it happening during the dry season (April-September) and most of the harvesters harvested very occasionally. The amount harvested varied widely from year to year and was not related to variation in rainfall, but may have been related to social events. Approximately 14 metric tons of F. guineensis were harvested during this period and one forest was identified as having supplied 40% of the F. guineensis harvested. The amount of harvesting increased significantly in this forest from 1986, but the harvesting intensity (i.e. weight of F. guineensis harvested per hectare of forest per annum) was relatively low, suggesting more intensive harvesting could be sustained. In general, the potential exists in this district to promote the basket industry by intensifying the harvesting of F. guineensis.

AB Environmental citizenship is a nationally and internationally stated objective and can be modelled as a product of interacting facets of personality, socio-demographic factors and participation opportunities. The 1992 UNCED Declaration called for the widest possible citizen participation, stating that each individual shall have appropriate access to information concerning the environment, thus placing the provision of public information as a cornerstone of sustainable development strategies. However, this paper reveals that environmental information provision can be a haphazard affair and that whilst successful information retrieval is influenced by variables such as educational attainment and social class, it is nevertheless often simply the outcome of chance factors. Furthermore, a series of information barriers are identified, which include personnel, agency isolation, cost, geographical, dissemination and technical language barriers, and we conclude that if the involvement of communities in the sustainable development process is to be achieved, then the Rio slogan 'think globally; act locally' perhaps needs to be modified to 'think globally; cooperate locally'.

SO SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB Sustainability as a concept comprises the combination of economic, environmental and social elements, never more importantly than when looking at the achievement of local sustainability. Local business enterprise is an important factor here - the implementation of the principles of sustainability will benefit enormously from the involvement of local businesses and their owners and employees. However, what is not clear is how this can happen in practice - what ought to be is not yet translatable into what is.
   The following paper discusses work in progress relating to a recycling scheme that is proposed to be set up in an urban area. There are a number of issues to be addressed in the project: the organization undertaking the recycling activity is considering the ways in which it can develop sustainable practices whilst at the same time examining the ways in which recycling can be encouraged as a community action.

ID DURATION DATA
AB A dynamic econometric framework (duration analysis) is used to analyze the determinants of farmers' decisions on whether or not to adopt low-external-input and sustainable agriculture (LEISA) technology. A wide range of potential determinants (both economic and non-economic) are considered. Our results suggest that the probability of a farmer adopting this technology increased if the farmer was more integrated with farmers' organizations, had contacts with nongovernmental organizations, was aware of the negative effect of chemicals on health and the environment, could rely on family labor, and had a farm located in an area with better soil conditions. On the other hand, the probability of adoption was reduced by increases in farm size. In addition, time-varying economic variables outside farmers' control were found to be significant determinants of adoption and the rate of diffusion. Changes in relative prices were particularly influential. Specifically, the diffusion of sustainable technology accelerated when declining output prices squeezed agricultural profit and many farmers faced difficulties in buying external inputs. Similarly, when labor became relatively cheap in periods of economic crisis, low-external-input practices became a more attractive option for family smallholdings. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Inc.

DT Article
AB Massive urbanisation has overwhelmed the national and local authorities of developing countries as they try to plan for it. Urban policy-makers in some countries seem to have resigned themselves to upgrade such settlements rather than obviate their creation and development.
   There is evidence, this paper argues, that upgrading is nor cost-effective; nor does it address the basic problem. In contrast, improved advance planning for the development of settlements would lead to a more sustainable and cost-effective urban development. To ensure an economically productive and environmentally sustainable urban development, public-sector institutions need to be built and strengthened.

TI Rehabilitation, sustainable peace and development: towards
   reconceptualisation
SO THIRD WORLD QUARTERLY
LA English
DT Article
AB Rehabilitation after violent conflict is today relevant to many countries-especially but not only in SSA - and hopefully will become so for more. It is in generally too narrowly specified, too short term and too fragmented with no macro strategic or conceptual frame. Further it is usually based on quite inadequate knowledge of the history, priorities and dynamics of the afflicted country. Rehabilitation has - or should have-interacting economic (especially livelihood rebuilding), social (stress and perceived inequity reducing) and political (reconciliation and legitimacy restoration not least by rehabilitating basic service access including user friendly, personal security oriented civil police and magistrates courts system). In severely war impacted countries these are likely to be among the most economically efficient ways to regaining growth and restructured economic development as well as of rebuilding social and political reconcilliation and religitimisation.

TI Issues of justice and reconciliation in complex political emergencies:
   conceptualising reconciliation, justice and peace
SO THIRD WORLD QUARTERLY
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper focuses on what can be done during emergency and transition periods to promote sustainable peace, in the aftermath of complex political emergencies in Africa, with particular reference to issues of reconciliation and justice. There is no common understanding of the political conditions under which efforts at reconciliation should be minimal in relation to a focus on justice in order to achieve the 'best' peace, or of those where the pursuit of justice should become paramount. There is also not even a common language of what justice and reconciliation mean in the context of post-conflict peace-building. The paper concludes that there is a much greater potential role for outsiders with regard to justice, while reconciliation is considered to be more of an internal affair in which international actors can only be present as supporters of domestic initiatives, and even then with great caution.

ID LESSONS; ORGANIZATIONS; PROGRAMS; CREDIT
AB What is the best way for nongovernment organisations (NGOs) to make a lasting impact on poverty? This paper summarizes the findings of recent research into the impact, sustainability and cost-effectiveness of two NGOs in India and two projects implemented by Save the Children Fund-UK in Bangladesh. The factors determining performance are explored through the interaction of organizational decisions with the external context. Although these interactions are complex and dynamic, some clear conclusions emerge. Making a difference to livelihoods and capacities among poor people depends on NGO successes in fostering autonomous grassroots institutions and linking them with markets and political structures at higher levels, These conclusions question the current predilection among donor agencies to fund large-scale NGO service delivery.

TI NPA variations across Indian commercial banks - Some findings
SO ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL WEEKLY
LA English
DT Article
AB The Indian commercial banking sector is characterised by both a high average non-performing share in total bank advances and a high dispersion between banks. This paper presents the findings of a formal attempt to explain inter-bank variations in NPAs for the year 1996-97. The specification tests for the impact of region of operation on domestically-owned banks, as measured by percentage branches in each of a set of state clusters. One cluster of three eastern and seven north-eastern states carries a robust and statistically significant positive coefficient; another cluster of the southern and some of the northern states carries a significantly negative coefficient. These findings bear out those of Demirguc-Kunt and Huizinga on the significance of the operating environment for bank efficiency. No sustainable improvement in the performing efficiency of domestic banks is possible without prior improvement in the enforcement environment in difficult regions of the country. Another finding of some importance is that it is not foreign ownership in and of itself so much as the banking efficiency and technology correlates of the country of origin of the foreign bank which determine NPA performance in the Indian environment.

AB Development of the rural credit delivery system in the country has metamorphosed from monopoly of cooperatives to the induction of commercial banks and establishment of regional rural banks for improving the outreach and ensuring access to credit in rural areas. With the implementation of financial sector reforms, the accent is on ensuring the financial health of the system. Innovations in rural credit. Accelerating the pace of capital formation in agriculture, infrastructure development with focus on transportation and marketing, ensuring credit discipline will enable the rural sector to absorb more credit from institutional sources. The focus should be on strategies that are required for tackling issues such as sustainability and viability, operation efficiency, recovery performance, small farmer coverage and balanced sectoral development.

AB Human population pressure has forced smallholder farmers in some areas of the central plateau region of the Ethiopian highlands to cultivate plots located on slopes or hillsides having varying amounts of stone cover. The objectives of this pilot study were to determine if slope and(or) stone cover influenced tillage operations an smallholder farms in the Debre Birhan area of the Ethiopian highlands, and to examine the relationship between different soil/tillage-related factors and draft of the indigenous single-tined ard (maresha). This paper also briefly describes the traditional systems of cropping and soil management, and provides data on selected physical and chemical properties of soils found in the study area. A land classification (LC) system was developed to categorize plots according to the slope and stone cover. Surface stone cover of plots was calculated and a method of estimating subsurface stones was tested. Tillage measurements included plowing frequency or number (PN) per area per annum, soil moisture tension, plowing depth, furrow "wedge" of soil moved, area plowed, contour angle, and the speed of travel and pulling force exerted by oxen. Plots were located on slopes ranging from 0% to 23%. Degree of slope was a key factor in determining the acuteness of angle of the contour at which plowing is done prior to seed covering, but had no significant effect on maresha draft. Stone cover of plots ranged up to 27%, with individual stones moved by the ard weighing up to 2.5 kg. Plowing depth ranged from 10.1-15.3 cm for all PN across LC. Oxen travelled at speeds of 0.35-0.58 m s(-1). Mean values for draft of the maresha across LC ranged from 0.83-1.04 kN. Farmers plowed from 0.10-0.15 ha during a 5-6 h work period, irrespective of LC or PN. Soil moisture tension (range 16-33 kPa) was found not to have a significant effect on draft, due to tillage being carried out prior to the major and minor rains. Percent stone cover explained very little of the variation in implement draft (R-2=0.10). Adding stone weight to the model increased R-2 Slightly (0.22), but significance was low (P<0.16). Furrow wedge of soil displaced by the ard head accounted for most of the variation in draft of the maresha across all LC and PN (R-2=0.75, P<0.008). The design and construction of the maresha allows it to be used equally well for tillage operations on plots having minimal or high stone cover which may be located on flat or gentle sloping land, or on steep hillsides.

ID CHANNEL CATFISH; ZINC; PHOSPHATE
AB Approximately two-thirds of phosphorus in various grains is present as phytate, which is not well-utilized by fish and other monogastric species. Besides its low availability of phosphorus, phytate is reported to reduce the availability of other dietary nutrients to animals. Single-gene, non-lethal low phytic acid (Ipa) mutations in corn and barley cause the seed to store most of the phosphorus as inorganic phosphorus instead of as phytate phosphorus. Theoretically, using these mutant grains containing lower levels of phytate in animal feeds should reduce phosphorus excretion by the animals, provided that available phosphorus levels in feeds containing these grains are appropriately adjusted downward. This study was conducted as a first step to determine if the biological availability of phosphorus in the low-phytate mutants of barley, dent corn and flint corn differed significantly from that in ordinary grains for fish. Also of interest was the effect, if any, on the availability of other minerals in formulated feeds containing the low-phytate grains. Feeding trials demonstrated that the apparent availability of phosphorus in low-phytate grains was significantly higher than that in ordinary grains when they were combined with low-ash ingredients. Fecal phosphorus content (on average) decreased 50.2% (in phytate-phosphorus) or 42.9% (in total phosphorus) by replacing ordinary grains with low-phytate grains in the low-ash diets. The apparent availabilities of calcium, iron, zinc and strontium also were significantly higher in the low-ash diet containing low-phytate dent corn than that containing ordinary dent corn. However, no such increase was observed with low-phytate barley or low-phytate flint corn over their counterpart grains in either calcium, iron or zinc. The apparent availabilities of copper, manganese, magnesium, potassium and sodium were not significantly different between ordinary and low-phytate grains. The apparent digestibility of dry matter also was not significantly different between ordinary and low-phytate grains. The results of this study suggest that a substantial reduction of phosphorus discharge from fish, poultry and animal farms could be achieved simply by replacing ordinary grains with low-phytate mutant grains in low-ash feeds.

ID CD4 CELL COUNTS; CUBIC MILLIMETER; TRIAL
AB Background: A marked decline in the number of reported AIDS cases has been observed in the United Kingdom, as in many industrialized countries, in 1996 and 1997. In England and Wales, a large reduction in AIDS cases has been recorded among homosexual and bisexual men.
   Objectives: To investigate, using data from the homosexuals and bisexuals in England and Wales as an example, possible explanations for the above decline such as the effects of new anti-retroviral therapies, or a decrease in the incidence of HIV in recent years.
   Methods: A multistage model of HIV infection, HIV diagnosis, treatment and of AIDS diagnosis has been used to represent the pattern of HIV and AIDS incidence in homosexual and bisexual men in England and Wales up to the end of 1995. Scenarios for the post-1995 period were examined under different assumptions about changes in HIV incidence in recent years and treatment uptake and efficacy.
   Results: The fall in the incidence of AIDS is unlikely to be the result of a reduction in HIV transmission during the 1990s. The most plausible explanation for this fall is the effect of new, more effective, anti-retroviral therapies. As a consequence, the number of individuals on treatment is likely to increase by 50 to 100% compared with the pre-1996 revels by the year 2001. Also, if the effect of the new therapies has a limited duration, or the use of such therapies is not well tolerated, the incidence of AIDS will rise again in the near future.
   Conclusions: These findings indicate that a substantial workload increase is under way for the healthcare system, and reiterate the need for measures to reduce HIV transmission as a means of bringing about a sustainable change in the incidence of AIDS. (C) 1999 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

AB A comprehensive study of the history of cotton production in Thailand shows the causes of its collapse. Crop protection problems are regarded as major driving forces behind the recent changes in cotton production systems. The cotton industry went through the characteristic sequence leading from subsistence farming to a disaster phase, because of increasing reliance on chemical pesticides. Integration of biophysical and socio-economic aspects of cotton production allows for this evolutionary path and the obstacles to the dissemination of IPM principles among key stakeholders to be explained. Suggestions are made to facilitate the process of collective learning toward more sustainable IPM practices. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Sustainable consumption is an important component of sustainable development. Consumption is not just a problem of population growth, but also of resource-intensive consumerist life-styles. For India, the challenge therefore is to achieve progress towards equitable human welfare with lesser utilization of energy, water and other resources than is possible with the western model of development. Countries of South Asia have the highest percentage of the malnourished in the world. Malnutrition has a complex aetiology, of which household food security (which in turn depends on local availability of food purchasing power and knowledge to utilize it properly), is art important aspect. The challenge before agricultural scientists is to make available nutritionally well-endowed foods, at least cost both to the environment and the consumer. This is a no mean challenge, because consumers (even the poor) have their own preferences for foods, which are not always guided by their nutrient content. The word 'consumerism' generally implies excessive consumption, driven by guided or unguided consumer choices and preferences. Normally, higher incomes and urbanization are associated with consumeristic life styles.

AB We present a revised tectonic interpretation of Australia and Antarctica incorporating new magnetic data off of Wilkes Land, Antarctica, for the earliest period of seafloor spreading on the Southeast Indian Ridge, from the Late Cretaceous to Early Tertiary. Reconstructions based on our revised anomaly identifications are characterized by a surprisingly large amount of continental overlap, involving the South Tasman Rise, Tasmania, and the Victoria Land region of Antarctica. The overlap is due to continental extension and/or deformation of oceanic crust in the Australian-Antarctic Basin. The second hypothesis would imply that the magnetic anomalies older than chron 31 in the Australian-Antarctic Basin are not isochrons. We also fmd evidence for a previously unrecognized period of extremely slow spreading on the Southeast Indian Ridge from chron 31 (68.7 Ma) to chron 24 (53.3 Ma) in the Australian-Antarctic Basin. In the western end of the basin we have tentatively identified a hiatus in the generation of crustal accretion associated with a minimum sustainable threshold half spreading rate of 1.5 mm/yr. In addition, we recognize a new fracture zone on the Antarctic plate, the Vincennes fracture zone, as the conjugate to the Perth fracture zone on the Australian plate, in the western Australian-Antarctic Basin. These fracture zones record the initial NW-SE opening direction between Australia and Antarctica.

AB Callus of Trema orientalis derived from both contaminated and uncontaminated sources were tested in vitro for their relative tolerance to chromium and nickel. The calluses derived from contaminated source were metal-tolerant and showed better growth than those obtained from uncontaminated plants. The specificity of metal tolerance shown by the parent material was maintained in the calluses. Compared to the uncontaminated explants, the calli derived from contaminated sources exhibited higher catalase and peroxidase activities but a reduced acid phosphatase activity. Biochemical studies, provided evidence that the contaminated sources were physiologically distinct from the uncontaminated ones. Thus, this study indicated that seeds of Trema orientalis collected from contaminated sites were tolerant to chromium and nickel, and may have the advantage of being used in sustainable revegetation programmes on chromiferous minewastes.

AB This paper explores the meanings of low and high impact consumption practices in a transitional society, Turkey, and the implications of such meanings for fostering environmentally friendly practices. Drawing from a qualitative study, the author discusses if and how low impact practices can be made desirable and attractive. With a strong ethos of consumption and modernization, consumers in transitional societies associate many high impact practices with a single, "Western" way of the "good life." The dilemma is the desirability of low impact consumption in the absence of a prevalent alternative ethos and signification of modern or "Western" ways.

ID ENERGY USE
AB In this paper, the authors draw on concepts from conventional energy planning to examine the social nature of consumption. This understanding is crucial in light of new efforts to arrive at an understanding of sustainable consumption patterns and how to move toward realizing them. The concept of social load, both base and peak, is defined to help us understand how levels of consumption of energy and other materials are established in the household environment. Cases and examples are used to illustrate the meaning of social load. We show how social loads can be identified, and consider some of the ways in which they are assumed and estimated in the structuring of common household systems. Some of the important determinants of load in the home environment are drawn out, including status and display, sociality and conventionality, security and convenience, and embeddedness in systems and structures. We draw attention to the necessity of viewing consumption not solely as an isolated activity taking place at a point of "end use," but rather as a result of the interplay of multiple forces in society, including commercial actors, public policy, webs of organizational as well as regulatory action, advertising and distribution. We conclude with a discussion of the implications of this social perspective on consumption for both research and policy agendas.

TI Criteria for an environmentally compatible agriculture (KUL) - An
   approach to assessing the ecological state of farm enterprises
SO AGRIBIOLOGICAL RESEARCH-ZEITSCHRIFT FUR AGRARBIOLOGIE AGRIKULTURCHEMIE
   OKOLOGIE
LA German
DT Article
AB This paper presents an appraisal system which on the basis of 20 criteria enables to describe the environmental state and sustainablility of different farm enterprises and land farm operations. The procedure identifies the most significant risk potentials and sets ranges of their tolerability. By this way the farmers can recognize principal shortcomings of their management and start countermeasures to cope with them. An environmentally sound and sustainable agriculture is defined as a way of farming which uses the available ressources as efficiently as possible, but at the same time keeps undesirable impacts on soils, water, air and biota within acceptable limits.
   Several years' investigations on more than 100 different farms in 11 German States have shown that there is no clear-cut relationship between the environmental shortcomings found and specific site or structural farming conditions. In particular there is no convincing proof for the assumption that the intensity of farming is generally responsible for the extent of adverse effects. Non-tolerable impacts on the environment are almost exclusively due to the way of farm management and may therefore be avoided by a better knowledge of the local situation and by an aim-oriented advice.

TI Indicators for sustainable agriculture - a theoretical framework for
   classifying and assessing indicators
SO AGRICULTURAL AND FOOD SCIENCE IN FINLAND

AB Indicators can be used for identifying, simplifying and quantifying agri-environmental aspects of sustainability. They offer us a way to proceed from the theoretical definition of sustainability to more practically oriented approaches. This study examines agricultural systems with a view to identifying the points and levels at which the sustainability of these systems can be assessed.
   The agri-environmental indicators are presented within the Pressure-State-Response (PSR) framework. Although suitable for ecological indicators, this framework is not highly relevant for economic and social indicators, which were thus studied from a more general theoretical perspective.
   As the concept of sustainability includes a number of different value-laden definitions, the setting of indicators should be seen as an ongoing re-evaluation rather than a technical process of measuring certain parameters. The need to refine the assessment methods was recognised in several subthemes of agricultural sustainability. A major shortcoming was found to be the lack of tools for evaluating qualitative phenomena such as landscapes and animal welfare. Likewise, in economics and the social sciences, much needs to be done to promote understanding of the interactions between these disciplines and environmental processes. Moreover, the basic framework of the assessments requires further examination, for instance, when interpreting the indicator results, when dealing with uncertainty and when seeking to identify cause-effect chains, even though these questions are no longer purely matters of indicator methodology.

AB In connection with the concept of sustainability emphasising the interaction of the economy and nature the material flow accounting (MFA) approach has in recent years obtained new relevance and is presently under vivid development. In this study, the concept of the total material requirement (TMR) of the MFA methodology has been applied to agriculture in Finland. The present level and development trends in use of natural resources since the beginning of the 1970's are described. The objective is to show the feasibility of the approach, to point out the reduction possibilities within the agriculture and to provide tools to set clear quantitative goals for reduction. There appears to be an urgent need to develope new methods, because several of the TMR-based indexes cannot be applied within the agricultural sector as such. Three indexes -Sigma direct material input (DMI)/energy consumption, Sigma DMI/use of commercial fertilisers, Sigma DMI/use of biocides - are suggested to measure the resource efficiency and the tempo of change towards sustainability. Some of the problems are directly related to the lack of adequate and internationally comparable data. The study is part of the national ecoefficiency-project with the overall aim to analyse the dependence of the natural resource use from the structure and growth of the economy, to localise the strategic targets of dematerialisation of the economy and to create a coherent and internationally comparable database to be used in developing environmental indicators.

AB A rather unusual but realistic two-dimensional dynamical system is formulated, analysed, and interpreted for the interactions of earthworms and plant litter in soils. The model proposes the use of litter quality as an independent variable as well as the elapsed time. The system is searched for thresholds beyond which the system is sustainable with an asymptotically stable steady state. Only one such state is possible. The outcome is that there is a threshold on the average quality value of the litter input which has to be above a certain value for the system to be sustainable. For special descriptions of the litter input and palatability dependence on quality, explicit solutions are possible for the stability analysis. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Crop yield is primarily water-limited in areas of West Asia and North Africa with a Mediterranean climate. Ten years of supplemental irrigation (SI) experiments in northern Syria were conducted to evaluate water-yield relations for bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and durum wheat (Triticum turgidum L.), and optimal irrigation scheduling was proposed for various rainfall conditions. The sensitive growth stages of wheat to water stress were from stem elongation to booting, followed by anthesis, and grain-filling. Water stress to which crop subjected depends on rainfall and its distribution during the growing season; the stress started from early March (stem-elongation stage) or even in seedling stage in a dry year, and from mid-April (anthesis) in an average or wet year. Crop yield linearly increased with increase in evapotranspiration (ET), with an increase of 160 kg for bread wheat and of 116 kg for durum wheat per 10 mm increase of ET above the threshold of 200 mm. Water-use efficiency (WUE) with a yield greater than or equal to 3 t ha(-1) was ca. 60% higher than that with yield <3 t ha(-1); this emphasises the importance of that to achieve effective use of water, optimal water supply and relatively high yields need to be ensured. Quadratic crop production functions with the total applied water were developed and used to estimate the levels of irrigation water for maximizing yield, net profit and levels to which the crops could be under-irrigated without reducing income below that which would be earned for full SI under limited water resources. The analysis suggested that irrigation scenarios for maximizing crop yield and/or the net profit under limited land resource conditions should not be recommended. The SI scenarios for maximizing the profit under limited water resource conditions or for a targeted yield of 4-5 t ha(-1) were recommended for sustainable utilization of water resources and higher WUE. The time of irrigation was also suggested on the basis of crop sensitivity index to water stress taking rainfall probability and available soil water into account. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB In a long-term study (1980 to 1993), the survival, growth performance and biomass production of two grass species viz. Chrysopogon fulvus (Spreng.) Chiov. and Eulaliopsis binata (Retz.) C.E. Hubb. were assessed when intercropped with four tree species viz. Albizia lebbek (L.) Benth., Grewia optiva Drumm., Bauhinia purpurea L. and Leucaena leucocephala (Lamk.) de Wit. on the bouldery riverbed lands of Doon Valley of north-west India. The survival of grass clumps was higher under the canopy of B. purpurea (48.3% in 1993 of the initial planting density of 20,000 clumps ha(-1) in 1980) and G. optiva (47.4%) than of L. leucocephala (31.1%) and A. lebbek (29.4%), and at 75% intensity of tree lopping (40.9%) than at 50% (37.1%). The effect of tree species on different growth parameters of grasses was not uniform, with G. optiva and B. purpurea causing comparatively more synergistic effect on clump height and clump diameter respectively. Although the performance of grasses was good under A. lebbek and L. leucocephala in the early years (1980-1987), these tree species resulted in the lowest grass dry weight in the later years up to 1993. The beneficial effect of higher lopping intensity of 75% was observed on the growth and biomass production of grasses over 50% lopping, presumably due to increased light penetration into the under-storey. The biomass production of grasses reached a maximum at four years of growth in 1983, after which, it decreased gradually to less than half in 1993. Eulaliopsis binata showed higher survival, growth and biomass production than C. fulvus throughout the period of study. The total biomass production was highest in association with B. purpurea followed by G. optiva, which appeared to be the most suitable tree species along with E. binata for sustainable silvopasture development on the marginal lands of Doon Valley of north-west India.

AB The impact of contour hedgerow systems on soil sustainability under acidic conditions has been widely criticized. A study was undertaken to determine the effects of management and hedgerow species on soil properties. Cassia spectabilis (a non-N-fixing tree legume), Gliricidia sepium (an N-fixing tree legume), Pennisetum purpureum (a forage grass), and Stylosanthes guyanensis (a forage legume) contour barriers were compared with an open field (non-hedgerow treatment) over 1 cowpea and 2 rice seasons. Three types of management viz.: prunings applied + N0P0K0, prunings applied + N20P20K20 and prunings removed + N20P20K20 were used as subplot treatments. The soils were strongly acidic (pH 4.5) and classified as clay Orthoxic Palehumult. Cassia performed better than the other species in terms of pruning biomass, N and P contributions over a period of 20 months. There was a combined positive effect of pruning biomass and fertilizers on rice and cowpea yields in Pennisetum and Gliricidia systems, while a tendency towards a positive effect of pruning biomass on rice was found in the Cassia system. The pruning biomass and/or fertilizer application did not significantly influence the top soil organic C, N and available P in the hedgerow systems. Soil bulk density was significantly reduced by the application of Cassia prunings after 12 months. Organic C, N and P dynamics indicated that in situ pruning biomass was not sufficient to maintain their level in the soil. But the cassia systems with prunings applied + N20P20K20 experienced the lowest degradation in soil organic C (2.1 t ha(-1)) followed by the Gliricidia systems (4.1 t ha(-1)). The overall results imply that the application of pruning and inorganic fertilizer is imperative to conserve soil resources, and non-N-fixing tree species can exert a significant advantage in biomass and thereby in soil N-recycling under acidic soil.

AB Natural ecosystems, whose components are the results of natural selection, are sustainable; most are productive, responsive to pests, and retentive of nutrients. Thus, they are appropriate models on which to base the design of new systems of land use. Abiotic and biotic stressors are related non-linearly; the nadir of total stress being mid-way along a gradient of environmental harshness. Superimposing the stress functions on Holdridge's life zone chart yields four broad categories of environments for agriculture: climates where annual rainfall is similar to potential evapotranspiration, plus three other categories that are either too cold, too arid, or too wet. Extremely cold lands have no potential for agriculture. Lands that are arid or infertile can be used successfully, although the cost of compensating for environmental limitations increases exponentially with increasing abiotic stress. Grazing animals (which act as trophic buffers between people and environment) have proven successful in dry and infertile environments. The humid tropical lowlands epitomise environments of low abiotic stress but overwhelming biotic intricacy. Here it pays to imitate natural systems rather than struggle to impose simplicity on ecosystems that are inherently complex. The keys to success are to (i) channel productivity into outputs of nutritional and economic importance, (ii) maintain adequate diversity to compensate for losses in a system simple enough to be horticulturally manageable, (iii) manage plants and herbivores to facilitate associational resistance and not associational susceptibility, and (iv) use perennial plants to maintain soil fertility, guard against erosion, and make full use of resources.

AB This paper addresses the question of how much biodiversity is enough in the context of the concept of agriculture as a mimic of nature. Following an historical review of the likely origins of ecosystems I show that the currently accepted components of biodiversity, viz. genetic, species and ecosystem, and their functional expression, are relevant to agriculture. Examples of adequate biodiversity are given and it is concluded that what constitutes enough biodiversity in an agricultural system is dependent upon the goal in question and will be different depending on whether the aim is, for example, to increase yield stability or deal with salinity, ground water levels, soil erosion, leaching of nutrients or weed control. The point is made that ecosystems and their composition are contingent in nature so the history of events, their frequency and intensity all need to be considered when interpreting the natural biodiversity present and thus determining what is enough in particular circumstances.

AB The science of ecology is undergoing many important shifts in emphasis and perspective which have important implications for its role in designing sustainable farming systems. In particular, a shift has occurred from the equilibrium paradigm to one which recognises the dynamic, non-equilibrium nature of ecosystems. Allied to this is the recognition that ecosystems can occur in any one of a number of alternative stable states, depending on the disturbance and management history. An increased emphasis on spatial patchiness in ecosystems has also emerged as appropriate tools have emerged to analyse spatial mosaics. These features have led to a recognition that considerable uncertainty is associated with the outcome of any particular ecosystem modification; hence predictive capacity is also low. Recent considerations of the interrelation between biodiversity and ecosystem function have also explored the questions of how many species need to be in a system to fulfil certain functions and confer resilience. We identify a set of steps that are required for the development of an agricultural system based on mimicking natural ecosystems. Central to this is identifying (1) the functions which are currently suboptimal in the agricultural system, and (2) the species which have key functional roles in the natural system, and then reaching decisions as to the array of species needed to confer system function and resilience.

AB Several traditional Indian cropping systems are used as examples of agriculture imitating the multispecies character of natural ecosystems. Modelling of their productivity and dynamics suggests they have potential advantages in production, stability of output, resilience to perturbation, and ecological sustainability, although they are harder to manage. Extra diversity in a cropping system can increase the production of a subsistence diet through either biochemical or ecological complementation. Stability of a cropping system may be improved through the incorporation of more crop species. Within a mixed crop, compensatory growth by the stronger component will tend to increase stability of final total yield. Where a two component intercrop has a regular production advantage, the land area required to produce a person s subsistence with a certain low level of risk of failure may be much less than if the crops are grown separately. Where a crop mixture contains contrasting components, the production penalty due to a disaster may be helpfully spread over time so that resilience of the system is increased. The compensatory growth of less-damaged components makes mixtures more resilient. Multi-species systems under intensification stress may be much less resilient than unstressed ones. Unless they are well managed, they can collapse. Where high output is desired, sustainability can only be attained through an understanding of the underlying processes. Intensification can lead to increased production up to a certain level, but such an increase is usually at the expense of subsequent production.

AB The southern Australian landscape is characterised by large climatic variability and an old, weathered surface with generally low hydraulic gradients. Many of these landscapes are prone to salinisation. The original ecosystems have strategies to cope with this environment in ways which minimise runoff and groundwater recharge. Replacement of these ecosystems with conventional agriculture has resulted in large-scale disruption of the natural water cycle with severe environmental, economic and social consequences. Sustainable agricultural systems aimed at mimicking natural hydrology must either minimise groundwater recharge over most of this landscape or intercept groundwater discharge in lower parts of the landscape prior to salinisation to restore the original hydrological balance. Empirical and theoretical analyses suggest that however vegetation is managed in the landscape, effective water balance control will be achieved only at a leaf area index approaching that of the natural state, indicating revegetation of most or all parts of the catchment with either trees or plants with similar ecohydrological characteristics as trees. There are at present few economically- attractive agricultural systems able to achieve hydrologic mimicry likely to be adopted at the necessary scale.

AB Nutrient and hydrologic cycles in harvested native forests in southern Australia are largely balanced. For example, we have little or no evidence of any decline in nutrient capital or availability in harvested forests. Short-term and small-scale reductions in evapotranspiration due to loss of leaf area after harvesting are adequately balanced at the landscape scale by large areas of regenerating or older-age forest. In contrast, agricultural systems on similar soils are a) dependent on large inputs of fertilisers to maintain growth and b) frequently subject to increasing salinity and waterlogging or other forms of degradation. The large-scale replacement of long-lived communities of perennial and often deep- rooting native species with annual crops or other communities of shallow-rooting species might be better managed within the framework of knowledge developed from studies of native plant communities. However, application of such a mimic concept to systems of low natural productivity is limited when agricultural systems require continued high productivity. Nonetheless, the mimic concept may help in developing sustainable management of agriculture on marginal lands, and contribute to the nutritional resilience of agroecosystems. Relevant characteristics for mimic agroecosystems in south western Australia include: high species diversity, diversity of rooting attributes, utilisation of different forms of nutrients (especially of N and P) in space and time, and the promotion of practices which increase soil organic matter content.

AB This article describes the structure and functioning of a natural Banksia woodland at Moora, Western Australia. Species are first grouped in terms of growth form, root morphology, phenology and nutrient acquisition strategy. Above- and belowground standing biomass of a woodland is measured and its net annual primary production per unit rainfall compared with that of adjacent crops and plantings of the tree tagasaste. Information on seasonal water use and nutrient cycling in the dominant tree species Banksia prionotes is used to highlight the pivotal role of deep rooted summer growing trees in the maintenance of sustainability of the system. The article then addresses how one might select species mixtures as functionally effective analogues of the woodland. Assuming the mimic system replaces cleared virgin woodland not previously subject to runoff of water and nutrients from agriculture, a selection procedure would incorporate native flora representing (a) summer-growing deep- rooted and winter-growing shallow-rooted trees and shrubs, (b) herbaceous ground cover species, (c) fire resistant and fire sensitive species, and (d) a range of complementary nutrient uptake strategies. Assuming the mimic is designed to rehabilitate agricultural land experiencing rising water tables and nitrate pollution of ground water, incorporation of fast growing deep rooted exotic trees or herbaceous perennials is recommended alongside conventional annual crops or pastures, with appropriate nutrient stripping through removal of biomass. Difficulties in this context are scale of planting required and current lack of profitable incentives for planting and maintenance of perennials.

AB The fundamental challenge in developing a new farming system is to have it adopted and maintained by farmers. The difficulty of achieving widespread adoption is increased if the new farming system is complex and/or radically different to current farming practice. This paper is a review of these issues with a focus on farming systems based on mimicry of natural ecosystems. It is proposed that there are four conditions which are necessary for an individual farmer to adopt an innovative farming-system: awareness of the innovation, perception that it is feasible to trial the innovation, perception that the innovation is worth trialing, and perception that the innovation promotes the farmer's objectives. Challenges involved in meeting each of these conditions are discussed. It is concluded that the most important challenges in developed countries are: (a) developing a farming system that is in fact more profitable than current practice; (b) assessing whether a system is in fact more profitable than current practice; and (c) overcoming the problem of deep uncertainty about the technology. In developing countries one must add the additional challenges of (d) high interest rates/high discount rates; and (e) insecure or inequitable land tenure.

AB This paper is a reflection on the workshop Agriculture as a Mimic of Natural Systems. It analyses what is essential for protecting agricultural land from degradation, including enabling features of the social context. It looks at how natural systems maintain a stable landscape, and explores ways in which pertinent features of natural systems can be copied in agriculture to help solve particular problems of land degradation, such as: erosion; hydrologic instability and the often associated secondary salinity; and chemical imbalances, such as those leading to excessive acidity. The conservative practices that many farmers have recently adopted are in several respects based on attributes of natural systems, but the mosaic nature of land is one important aspect that has not yet strongly influenced practices, which are often too strongly tied to cadastral boundaries.

AB In the preceding papers, the authors evaluate the usefulness of the proposition that mimicking characteristics of natural ecosystems, particularly patterns of resource capture and distribution, can lead to improved sustainability of agricultural systems. They approach this question from a diverse array of disciplines over a broad range of geographical settings and ecosystems and produce an equally broad range of views and conclusions. The aim of this paper is to draw out the major themes that have emerged concerning the usefulness of the mimic concept in generating radical solutions to the problem of agriculture. First, a brief summary of their scope and conclusions.

AB A doctoral thesis by I. Seling at Freiburg university does suggest that the movement towards conservative forestry in Germany at the end of 19th and beginning of 20th centuries was motivated less by professional arguments than by general philosophies within the sociological group of politcally conservative and nationalistic "educated citizens". It is criticized in the present paper that this hypothesis has not really been scrutinized and proven. Too little is said in the thesis concerning forestry development of the 19th century in Germany. Selective citation of only a few representatives of the "educated citizens" group may illustrate but cannot prove the above hypothesis.

DE agricultural development; environmental degradation; productivity loss
ID SOIL QUALITY
AB The sustainability issues associated with agricultural development are a growing concern worldwide. This study focussed on farmers' attitudes about environmental degradation and long term productivity loss that may result from implementation of modern agricultural technologies. The study was conducted in a selected area of Bangladesh and field level data were collected from the sampled fanners through personal interviewing. Findings revealed that more than two-thirds of the fanners confronted either a medium or high level of environmental problems due to intensive cultivation. Their main concerns were stress on soil fertility, loss of essential aquatic life, and reduction of earthworms and other beneficial organisms in soil. The fanners' recommended solutions were production of high yielding crop varieties with conservation management practices, and the balanced use of chemical fertilizers and organic manures. To apply these techniques, the top expectation of the farmers was to receive subsidies for agricultural inputs, and get easy-term credit from the government or non-government organizations. Interestingly, just half the farmers in the study area possessed a less than favorable attitude towards sustainability issues of agricultural development. In other words, to them these issues were of low or marginal priority. Only 6% of them expressed a highly favorable attitude thigh priority) and 44% expressed a moderate attitude. Based on correlations, the individual farmer's age, education, family size, organizational participation, television exposure, communication behavior and environmental problem confrontation were identified as the main determinants of their attitudes about sustainability issues, Hence, these factors should be considered when formulating programs and policies for agriculture development that aim for long-term sustainability.

ID NETHERLANDS; PROTECTION
AB The focus of this paper is the challenge to technology development in the international pesticide industry. We address these challenges within the context of debates on how to achieve an environmentally- and economically-sustainable,world food production system. Forces acting within and upon both pesticide manufactures and the agrifood system are moving toward globalization and standardization. Main issues on sustainability in agriculture are protecting and improving agricultural resources (e.g., preserving and restoring soil and water quality). This places greater emphasis on diversity, regional self reliance, reduced chemical dependence and greater community involvement. A small but rapidly growing movement in local food systems is evolving in parallel with globalized agribusiness. It offers new opportunities for private sector development of technologies and services. These opportunities could be interesting for companies that are struggling to retain profitability in a stagnant and commodity-oriented pesticide market. Our question is whether the pesticide industry is structurally capable of developing innovations in products and services for these new local/regional markets to ensure a more diversified and sustainable agriculture. Our conclusion is probably not, but if the industry were capable of doing so it would first need to acquire a thorough understanding of how organic farming systems function.

AB Population studies are an essential part of conservation actions. Under exceptional observation conditions we studied a western lowland gorilla population visiting the Maya salt-clearing (north of the Pare national d'Odzala, P.N.O., Congo) over an 8 month period; 36 groups and 18 solitary individuals (a total of 420 individuals) have been identified visiting the clearing, which suggests a high gorilla density in the region. Ninety-six percent of the gorillas entered the clearing in groups. One-male groups had a mean size of 11.2. Ninety percent of solitary individuals were silver-back males. Compared with other populations of both lowland gorillas and mountain gorillas, the Maya population had the highest immature rate and the highest number of infants per female. Ecological correlates that could explain the attractiveness of the Maya clearing are discussed. The present status and the renewal rate of the Maya population indicate the need for further studies and confirm the importance of developing eco-tourism in this region as part of the sustainable park management activities developed by the ECOFAC programme (European Union). The results also provide arguments to support the proposal for extending the P.N.O. to include this region, which is rich in salt-clearings and attracts many other key-species of mammal such as forest elephants.

AB I report a simulation study that tested the ability of a variety of experimental designs to achieve two fundamental goals: (1) to determine the association between loss of biological diversity and responses such as ecosystem functioning and (2) to determine which components of biodiversity, such as number of species, functional diversity, or a keystone species, were most responsible for that association. For the goal of reliably detecting an overall association, all designs I tested! performed well and were unlikely to misidentify predominant patterns. Thus, this study affirms the common conclusion of many published biodiversity experiments that loss of biological diversity is often associated with a reduction in ecosystem functioning. However, for the goal of identifying the components of biodiversity that are most responsible for the effects,, designs differed markedly. Some designs performed well in detecting number-of-species effects but poorly in detecting effects of unique species or functional groups. No design tested was able to discriminate both numeric effects and compositional effects in all situations. Thus, this study demonstrates that interpreting results about: mechanisms from biodiversity experiments will be critically dependent on an experiment's design.

AB Sustainability of the average level of consumption in a resource-rich country is examined in the presence of uncertainties in terms of trade for the country. In an open economy, we assume that prices are taken as given but may be subject to some fluctuations. Planners in the resource-extracting economy have the knowledge of the current resource price at each moment in time, but are not sure about its future courses. We examine the validity of the rule on a constant consumption path, presented by Hartwick, and show that investing the Hotelling rent of current extraction into non-exhaustible capital markets does not guarantee the constancy of consumption even in the expected sense. Thus, we need modifications on the investment rule. To obtain the constancy of consumption, it is shown that gain and/or loss effects from uncertainty should be taken into account in addition to the terms-of-trade effects examined by previous authors.

AB The bulk of recent tourism-environment and sustainable tourism development literature can suggest the application of strong sustainability criteria. This is shown to be problematic since even such developmental practices may. generate various classes of spillover effects that can frustrate genuine attainment of strong sustainability in tourism concentration, dispersal, or small-scale operation. At a broader sectoral level, tourism-centric development policies are also reasoned to he of inherently limited value in achieving strong sustainability objectives. Accordingly, by consideration of these problems it is argued that policy should be directed to facilitating more coordinated strategic planning intervention, rather than reliance an market instruments and processes.

AB The problem of disposing of urban waste has been thrown into prominence by the European Union Urban Wastewater Treatment Directive (91/271/EC) banning member states from dumping sewage sludge at sea from the end of 1998. The paper investigates one of the alternative disposal methods available to UK water companies, namely the recycling of sewage sludge on farmland. An 'actor-network' interpretation is developed, which focuses on the human actors and non-human intermediaries in the recycling of sewage sludge in agriculture. 'Regulation' and 'pricing' are shown to be competing 'modes of ordering' within the actor network, with scientific knowledge in its material forms as one of the principal actants. The actor network is used to consider the limits to the spreading of sewage sludge on farmland as a form of 'sustainable' resource management. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The projected rise in sea level for the next century will have profound impacts on peri-urban agricultural production in the Yangtze delta area. This paper assesses the major impacts of the rise in sea level on coastal processes, flood hazards and saline water incursion in relation to sustainable development of peri-urban agriculture in the deltaic plain around Shanghai, People's Republic of China. It is concluded that the rise in sea level will cause coastal erosion along the southern coast and slow sedimentary accretion in a number of shoals within the Yangtze estuary. This change will severely limit the extent of intertidal fats available for land reclamation. The rise in sea level will also increase hood risk, raise the groundwater table and prolong waterlogging. Consequently, agricultural yields will be seriously reduced. During dry seasons, saline water will dominate the deltaic area for much longer periods and shortages of freshwater for agriculture are expected to be more pronounced. Four counter-measures have been adopted by the Shanghai Municipal Government in an attempt to mitigate the effects of sea-level rise. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Field CO2 production was related to soil carbon pools and fluxes determined by laboratory incubation of soils from agroecosystems designed to test the possibility of substituting biological for chemical inputs. Treatments included: conventional and organic-based row crops, woody and herbaceous perennial crops and historically tilled and never tilled successional fields. The CO2 efflux in corn and soybeans was affected by crop residues from previous years and growing season temperatures but not soil moisture. Overwinter cover crops and perennials such as alfalfa and poplar, resulted in fairly uniform fluxes of approximately 20 kg CO2-C ha(-1) day(-1) throughout the non-frozen period. Highest fluxes occurred in alfalfa, historically tilled successional and never tilled, grassland successional treatments, although, highest aboveground productivity occurred in the corn and poplar. Summed, field CO2 fluxes were similar to residue-C inputs. Measurement of CO2 mineralized in extended incubations in the laboratory made it possible to use soil enzyme activity to determine the size and dynamics of soil C pools. The residue of acid hydrolysis defined the size of the resistant pool C-r. Carbon dating determined its mean residence time (MRT). Curve analyses of CO2 evolution plotted on a per unit time basis gave the active (C-a) and slow (C-s) pool sizes and decomposition rate constants k(a) and k(s). Temperature correction factors provided field MRTs. The active pool of this coarse textured soil represents 2% of the soil C with a MRT of 30-66 days. The slow pool represents 40-45% of the SOC with field MRTs of 9-13 years. The poplar soil has the greatest MRT for both the active and slow pools. The system approach to land use sustainability (SALUS) model, which predicts CO2 evolution from decomposition in the field as part of a plant growth - soil process model, was tested using the decomposition parameters determined by incubation and C-14 dating. The model satisfactorily predicted the intra and inter year differences in field CO2 but over predicted fluxes from residues in the fall. It does not yet adequately consider a lag period during which the residues lose their hydrophobicity, are comminuted and colonized. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB The proximity of many Pacific countries to seafood markets in Asia, the high value of species associated with coral reefs, and the increased demand for marine aquarium species, has prompted many nations in the region to investigate opportunities for coastal aquaculture. There are, however, several constraints to consider throughout much of the Pacific, including, transport problems, fragile ecosystems, lack of suitable sites, limited economies, and the effects of customary marine tenure on access to growout sites. To overcome these problems, coastal aquaculture in the Pacific will need to focus either on species of high value, or those that yield non-perishable products. Valuable industries have been established for pearl oysters, penaeid shrimps, and the microalgae, Spirulina, in tropical Australia, the French territories and Hawaii, whereas enterprises for cultured giant clams, milkfish (Chanos chanos) as tuna bait, the macroalgae, Eucheuma, and sponges are emerging in the small island developing states. Species demanded by the aquarium trade, groupers for live reef fish markets, tropical abalone (Haliotidae), mangrove crabs (Scylla spp.) and a variety of invertebrates as sources of bioactive compounds are promising new species for intensive farming. Aquaculture technology is being applied to the restocking and stock enhancement of valuable, sedentary species low in the food chain, and there are active programmes in several small island developing states to assess the scope for releasing cultured giant clams, trochus, green snail and sea cucumbers to replenish and enhance wild stocks. There is a growing awareness that the potential benefits of increased aquaculture, restocking and stock enhancement need to be balanced by the risks associated with culturing additional species, i.e. introduction of diseases, dilution of gene pools and increased biological interactions with other species, and that sustainable aquaculture, restocking and stock enhancement are most likely to be achieved with responsible application of technology and the use of indigenous species.

AB Present perceptions of trophic status are reviewed and considered wanting against the early Thienemann-Naumann classification based on lake metabolism. This theme is developed through a consideration of the supportive capacities defined by the supplies of each of the main anabolic components and by the processing of fixed carbon through the water column and in the superficial sediments. The import of external organic carbon is acceptable within the oxidative capacity of the aquatic system but an excess challenges its conventional sustainability. A recent application of metabolic modelling to the management of a lake subject to anthropogenic influences is presented.

AB We studied the foraging distribution and the formation of multi-species feeding associations of seabirds and marine mammals off the British east coast. The local top-predator community comprised c. 34 species of seabirds, two pinnipeds and eight cetaceans. It appeared that multi-species feeding associations (MSFA's),with rather low species richness and diversity, were commonly formed around fishing vessels, were attracted by or otherwise associated with cetaceans (MSFA's with a generally low but more variable species richness and moderate diversity) and occurred over natural resources, apparently mainly fish shoals (MSFA's with the highest species richness and diversity). Small, short-lived MSFA's were the commoner type, particularly those over natural prey (sandeels and small clupeoids). Black-legged Kittiwakes Rissa tridactyla acted as catalysts in these flocks, Common Guillemots Uria aalge and Razorbills Alca torda as diving producers, apparently driving up fish towards the surface. The specific role of all other species joining in is described in general terms. Typical associations with marine mammals were those in which the cetaceans (mainly White-beaked Dolphins Lagenorhynchus albirostris and Harbour Porpoises Phocoena phocoena) operated as 'beaters' for Northern Gannets Morus bassanus and Black-legged Kittiwakes.
   The functioning of MSFA's is decribed from two angles. First of all, MSFA's are prominent phenomena on the sea surface, guiding seabirds using visual cues for food finding. Secondly, perhaps more importantly, the differentiation of feeding methods deployed in MSFA's may facilitate seabirds to reach prey that would otherwise be unavailable for them. It is suggested that the frequent associations of Kittiwakes and auks are the most sustainable system, because commensalism is the underlying mechanism rather than competition. The participation of scroungers in these flocks (Herring Gulls Larus argentatus as common nearshore examples) normally ruined the MSFA formation in no time. Usually, a MSFA would usually collapse as soon as the auks gave up their synchronised feeding activities. This underlines the essential role of Alcidae in these formations. The MSFA's are common and prominent in the North Sea and they deserve further study in the context of when interspecific relationships and the structuring of seabird communities.

AB Clearing brush from rangeland and seeding it to buffelgrass (Cenchrus ciliaris L.) is a popular range improvement practice in Mexico, but no data are available on the effects of these practices an soil properties. Twenty-nine study sites were randomly selected across 3 major climatic regions in Mexico: 13 in the northwest, 11 in the northeast, and 5 in the southeast. Soils under buffelgrass stands more than 10 years old and on adjacent virgin rangelands were sampled at 0-10, 10-20, and 20-30 cm depths to quantify sand, silt, clay, organic C, total N, pH, EC, CEC, available P, and exchangeable Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+, and K+. Because soil variables were not significantly (P > 0.05) different among depths, only data from the surface horizon received further analysis. Sails in the northwest had higher (P < 0.05) sand content and were particularly low in total N (0.08%), Ca2+, and K+, while soils of wetter and warmer southeast Mexico were significantly (P < 0.05) higher than the other two regions in measures of soil fertility such as organic C (IO times higher), total N,and CEC (both at least 3 times higher). Long-term buffelgrass establishment had the most effect on soils in the southeast and no significant effect (P > 0.1) on soils of northeast Mexico. Soil organic C and total N both declined (P < 0.025) by about 40% under buffelgrass pastures in the southeast; exchangeable Ca2+ decreased (P = 0.027) by 21% in the same region, and Mg2+ declined (P = 0.03) by 36% under buffelgrass in the northwest. Soil P did not respond to buffelgrass establishment. The findings of this study suggest that high forage yields following conversion of rangelangd to buffelgrass pasture will be less sustainable in subtropical regions with high rainfall (mean of 1070 min in this study) than in the semiarid zone with inherently poorer soils.

AB In a lecture give in Nice, Dr. Hans Blix, former Director General of the Vienna International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), warned against turning back the wheel of energy policy development. Blix sees major deficits in information among a number of politicians bearing responsibility in important European states. This was evident not only from the opt-out plans in Sweden and Germany, but also from the request to delete nuclear power from the catalog of safe and sustainable energy sources, which had been rejected in the European Parliament by a very slim majority. Actually, there were indications of the public acceptance of nuclear power being broader also with a view to problems of climate than was evident from statements by politicians. Blix accused politicians of being opportunists playing to antinuclear voters. A factor influencing this situation could be the fact that the true consequences of opting out of the use of nuclear power, including higher carbon dioxide emissions, always became apparent long after the next election date. Blix asked what the nuclear industry could do to convince the public that nuclear power, compared with other forms of energy, should be classified as a sustainable energy source not only in terms of its price, but also with respect to its environmental impact. In this connection, the former Director General of IAEA mentioned five areas in which the nuclear industry was required to make progress on its own.
   These included the need for still more safety in all areas of nuclear technology worldwide, from exploration in the uranium mines to the storage of nuclear waste, in particular, those responsible should seek to attain public acceptance of the need for nuclear waste management and storage strategies as soon as possible. Ultimately, this required nuclear organizations to seek a direct dialog with the public. Blix concluded with the statement that it was simply unconvincing to venture into a future for billions of people on earth with energy concepts dating from the period before the industrial revolution.

TI Alternatives to methyl bromide: chemical fumigants or integrated pest
   management systems?
SO AUSTRALASIAN PLANT PATHOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB Changes in government and international policy, coupled with consideration of sustainable management strategies, will lead to the demise of methyl bromide as a soil disinfestation treatment for high value cropping industries within the next decade. Methyl bromide has provided excellent disease, pest and weed seed control and finding alternative chemical and non-chemical options which replace all the benefits of methyl bromide is providing a challenge to researchers. The advantages and disadvantages of alternative chemical and non-chemical control strategies are considered in this paper. Alternative chemicals treatments showing promise include lower application doses of methyl bromide, such as methyl bromide/chloropicrin (30:70) and the use of other fumigant mixtures such as, 1,3-Dichloropropene/chloropicron and metham sodium combined with chloropicron. Investigations in Victoria have led to the development of an integrated pest management (IPM) strategy which partially offsets the need for methyl bromide in the flower bulb industry. IPM systems, however, will require more input from farmers, and support services, in such areas as the monitoring of pest and disease populations and the use of disease resistant stock and disease-free nursery material, before IPM systems fully offset the benefits of methyl bromide. Consideration of grower profits, reliability and insurance afforded by soil disinfestation with methyl bromide must be taken into account when assessing the suitability of alternatives.

DT Article
ID PLANT PATHOLOGY; DEGRADATION; SOIL
AB Over the last 30 years, integrated pest management (IPM) has been widely accepted as a desirable pest control strategy. The concept has been embraced by all pest management disciplines and the term 'pest' now encompasses weeds, rodents, nematodes, plant pathogens and arthropods. However, despite attempts to increase adoption of IPM, there are situations where calendar-based application of chemicals remains the rule rather than the exception. Nowhere is this more apparent than for soilborne diseases of annual fruit, vegetable and ornamental crops, where fumigants, nematicides and fungicides are routinely applied. This paper looks at the reasons why this situation has arisen and outlines some of the initiatives that are needed to increase adoption of IPM as it applies to soilborne diseases.

TI Methane emissions from Australian livestock: implications of the Kyoto
   Protocol
SO AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH

DT Article

ID GREENHOUSE-GAS EMISSIONS; CONSUMPTION; TEMPERATE; OUTPUT; CATTLE
AB Human activities have increased the atmospheric concentration of methane by about 140% since preindustrial times. The accumulation of methane and other 'greenhouse' gases is anticipated to cause significant climate changes in the future. Ruminant livestock are the largest producers of methane in Australia and this source constitutes about 12% of the national net emissions. Australia is a signatory to the Kyoto Protocol, which, if it comes into force, requires limiting annual emissions during the period 2008-2012 to 8% over the 1990 value. Australian livestock emissions are projected to increase by 7% by 2010 with total Australian emissions expected to increase by 28-43%. Emissions per unit GDP are higher for the livestock sector than for most other sectors and this may negatively affect the sector if free market emission trading is implemented and no new technologies to reduce emissions cost-effectively are introduced. Using information from the National Greenhouse Gas Inventory, we demonstrate that reductions in emissions per unit product are already occurring in at least one Australian livestock industry and discuss ways to ensure that similar future changes will be recorded. Cautionary notes are made regarding options of grain feeding and more intensive production, which appear to be attractive but may lead to increasing emissions when viewed on a broader basis. The potential for increased animal production with new technologies developed to reduce methane emissions suggests that there may be significant opportunities for the Australian livestock industries arising from the issue of greenhouse gas reductions. Opportunities to establish carbon sinks are also discussed. We suggest that addressing reduction of emissions per hectare rather than per head or per kilo of product results in a strong alignment with the development of more sustainable livestock industries.

AB The use of nitrogen fertilisers to arrest the decline in soil nitrogen fertility in the northern grains belt of New South Wales has been the subject of many years of research, however, little is known about how farmers make decisions about nitrogen fertiliser. A survey of 400 wheat farmers in northern New South Wales in April 1997 revealed that many have recently changed their fertiliser practices. Although most respondents had been growing wheat since the 1960s, regular applications of nitrogen only commenced in the mid 1980s. Initially only low rates of nitrogen were applied, but in the last 2-5 years, the nitrogen rates have substantially increased. These changes are notable because until this decade, most were content to rely mainly on mineralisation of soil organic nitrogen, whereas, now, half the respondents in the survey plan to add as much nitrogen in fertiliser in 1 year as was removed in the previous year's wheat crop.
   Farmers were asked to rate the importance of a number of factors that have been promoted as means of tactically adjusting fertiliser rates. This study found a disparity between the level of measurement and precision suggested by the majority of research, development and extension programs compared with the methods used by farmers. In general, the respondents to the survey have rejected, or are yet to adopt, regular soil testing, the use of climate forecasts and decision support programs. Rather, they rely on simple rules of thumb based on readily accessible data such as past grain protein content and cropping history.

TI A framework to monitor sustainability in the grains industry
SO AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL AGRICULTURE

DT Article
ID SOIL
AB Community awareness of the sustainable use of land, water and vegetation resources is increasing. The sustainable use of these resources is pivotal to sustainable farming systems. However, techniques for monitoring the sustainable management of these resources are poorly understood and untested. We propose a framework to benchmark and monitor resources in the grains industry.
   Eight steps are listed below to achieve these objectives: (i) define industry issues; (ii) identify the issues through growers, stakeholder and community consultation; (iii) identify indicators (measurable attributes, properties or characteristics) of sustainability through consultation with growers, stakeholders, experts and community members, relating to: crop productivity; resource maintenance/enhancement; biodiversity; economic viability; community viability; and institutional structure; (iv) develop and use selection criteria to select indicators that consider: responsiveness to change; ease of capture; community acceptance and involvement; interpretation; measurement error; stability, frequency and cost of measurement; spatial scale issues; and mapping capability in space and through time. The appropriateness of indicators can be evaluated using a decision making system such as a multiobjective decision support system (MO-DSS, a method to assist in decision making from multiple and conflicting objectives); (v) involve stakeholders and the community in the definition of goals and setting benchmarking and monitoring targets for sustainable farming; (vi) take preventive and corrective/remedial action; (vii) evaluate effectiveness of actions taken; and (viii) revise indicators as part of a continual improvement principle designed to achieve best management practice for sustainable farming systems.
   The major recommendations are to: (i) implement the framework for resources (land, water and vegetation, economic, community and institution) benchmarking and monitoring, and integrate this process with current activities so that awareness, implementation and evolution of sustainable resource management practices become normal practice in the grains industry; (ii) empower the grains industry to take the lead by using relevant sustainability indicators to benchmark and monitor resources; (iii) adopt a collaborative approach by involving various industry, community, catchment management and government agency groups to minimise implementation time. Monitoring programs such as Waterwatch, Soilcheck, Grasscheck and Topcrop should be utilised; (iv) encourage the adoption of a decision making system by growers and industry representatives as a participatory decision and evaluation process.
   Widespread use of sustainability indicators would assist in validating and refining these indicators and evaluating sustainable farming systems. The indicators could also assist in evaluating best management practices for the grains industry.

AB Lucerne (Medicago sativa. L) root elongation in acid soils amended by gypsiferous coal combustion by-products was investigated in a glasshouse study. Lime, fluidised bed boiler ash (FBA), and flue gas desulfurisation gypsum (FGDG) were mixed into the surface 50 mm of either an Allophanic (the Patua sand loam) or an Ultic (the Kaawa clay loam) soil column, at rates containing calcium equivalent to 5000 kg/ha of CaCO3. Lucerne was grown on each column after it was leached with 400 mm of water. Whereas the lime treatment had no erect on root elongation in the acidic subsurface of the Patua soil, the FBA and FGDG treatments significantly improved lucerne root penetration into the subsurface soil (P < 0.05). This was due to the `self-liming effect' induced by sulfate adsorption. Regression analysis indicated that the molar ratio of labile monomeric aluminium and calcium in soil solution (Al : Ca) was a good indicator of the degree of root growth into subsurface soil layers (R-2 = 0.94). In contrast, topsoil incorporated amendments did not influence root penetration into the acidic subsurface of the Kaawa soil, which is dominated by permanently charged clay minerals. The `self-liming erect' caused by gypsum application is not a sustainable practice. Lime should be applied to neutralise the topsoil acidity, when gypsum is used as subsurface soil acidity ameliorant. FBA, which contains both lime and gypsum, can meet these requirements.

AB Chemical and physical degradation of Red Ferrosols in eastern Australia is a major issue necessitating the development of more sustainable cropping systems. This paper derives critical concentrations of the active (permanganate-oxidisable) fraction of soil organic matter (C1) which maximise soil water recharge and minimise the likelihood of surface runoff in these soils.
   Ferrosol soils were collected from commercial properties in both north and south Queensland, while additional data were made available from a similar collection of Tasmanian Ferrosols. Sites represented a range of management histories, from grazed and ungrazed grass pastures to continuously cropped soil under various tillage systems. The concentration of both total carbon (C) and C1 varied among regions and farming systems.
   C1 was the primary factor controlling aggregate breakdown, measured by the percentage of aggregates <0.125 mm (P125) in the surface crust after simulated rainfall. The rates of change in P125 per unit change in C1 were not significantly different (P < 0.05) for soils from the different localities. However, soils from the coastal Burnett (south-east Queensland) always produced lower P125 (i.e. less aggregate breakdown) than did soils from the inland Burnett and north Queensland locations given the same concentration of C1. This difference was not associated with a particular land use.
   The 'critical' concentrations of C1 for each region were taken as the C1 concentrations that would allow an infiltration rate greater than or equal to the intensity of a 1 in 1 or 1 in 10 year frequency rainfall event of 30 min duration. This analysis also provided an indication of the risk associated with the concentrations of C1 currently characterising each farming system in each rainfall environment. None of the conventionally tilled Queensland Ferrosols contained sufficient C1 to cope with rainfall events expected to occur with a 1 in 10 frequency, while in many situations the C1 concentration was sufficiently low that runoff events would be expected on an annual basis.
   Our data suggest that management practices designed both to maximise C inputs and to maintain a high proportion of active C should be seen as essential steps towards developing a more sustainable cropping system.

AB Soil acidification and related land degradation issues are assuming increasing importance in Australia and challenging the concept of sustainability of current land management systems. In this study, the impacts of tree plantations of 2 species and permanent pasture on soil chemical properties are compared. Soil samples were collected from the top 50 cm (0-5, 5-10, 10-15, 15-20, 20-30, and 30-50 cm depths) from 3 adjacent sites carrying pasture and monocultures of Pinus radiata (radiata pine) and Quercus suber (cork oak) on a deep-surfaced yellow podzolic soil, and differences in soil pH and other soil chemical properties were examined. In the surface 0-5 cm, pH was similar at all 3 sites. Below that depth, soil pH was significantly lower and exchangeable Al greater under the cork oak stand than at the other 2 sites. Consistent with a decrease in soil pH there was significantly less exchangeable Ca under cork oak. Also, less clay was observed under the cork oak stand and this is taken as evidence of the degradational impact of soil acidification.
   An estimate of Ca in the top 50 cm of the soil implies considerable loss of Ca under oak, probably by leaching and loss of litter down the slope. Evidence is presented to show that there has been more Fe and Al movement under oak than under pasture and pine, this being ascribed in part to the greater Al and Fe mobilising capacity of the water-soluble component extracted from freshly fallen leaf litter of oak. The Fe and Al composition of the oxalate extract from concretionary material at 10-30 cm under oak is consistent with a process similar to podzolisation. Pseudogleying of Fe and Al may have accompanied the leaching of bases from the system and a reduction of pH.

AB A question of economic, social, and land-use importance in the predominantly steep South Island high country tussock grasslands of New Zealand is whether these lands can be sustainably farmed by oversowing introduced grasses and legumes and using fertilisers. To help answer this question, we compared vegetation and soil chemical, biochemical, and biological properties on Brown soils (Dystrudepts) on adjacent land areas which have been differently managed since 1978. One area had never been fertilised or oversown. The other had been oversown with grasses and clovers and received about 1100 kg/ha of sulfur-superphosphate between 1979 and 1997.
   Oversowing and fertilising reduced the amount of bare ground and transformed the vegetation to a species composition dominated by the introduced adventives Anthoxanthum odoratum and Agrostis capillaris. Fertilising raised soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) content, increased A-horizon thickness, and raised exchangeable cation values. All of the phosphorus (P) applied to the fertilised area was accounted for in the top 15 cm of soil, but has accumulated in the relatively unavailable organic form. Oversowing and fertilising significantly (P < 0.05) increased microbial biomass C, N, and P relative to values in unfertilised soils. The microbial biomass C: N and C: P ratios were significantly (P < 0.05) lower in fertilised soils. Fertilised soils had significantly more (P < 0.05) mineralised N than unfertilised soils.
   Populations of 5 groups of soil fauna (Scarabaeidae, nematodes, enchytraeids, rotifers, tardigrades) were higher in fertilised soils. Nematode species parasitic or pathogenic for clovers were present in greater numbers on fertilised soils. A combination of fertility decline (in particular, P immobilisation as organic P) and nematode damage may be the reason for the low clover cover on fertilised sites, and may explain the widely observed clover 'flush' and decline common to oversown high country.
   We conclude that there is no simple measure of 'soil quality' that can be used as a sustainability indicator in moist New Zealand high country. Nor can sustainability be judged purely on biological, biochemical, and chemical critieria. Although many of the erects associated with oversowing and fertilising, such as increased organic matter content of A horizons and increased biological activity, are positive, these erects must be balanced against the economic risk associated with being committed to a high-input farming system, the loss of low-producing but resilient native species, and increase of plant-pathogenic nematodes.

DE poaching; sustainability; soil quality; compaction
AB A study of the physical condition of 3 soils used for intensive dairy farming in the Waikato Region was undertaken. The study was to determine the existing physical condition of the soil, the possible long-term changes from pugging damage, and the most appropriate measurements and depth for monitoring change in soil physical properties under dairying.
   Four dairy farms were selected on each of 3 soils (an Allophanic Soil and 2 Gley Soils). On each farm, 3 sites that corresponded to never trodden, usual ('average' paddock and pasture condition for the farm), and previously pugged (pugged >18 months ago) pasture histories were sampled. Undisturbed soil cores were collected at 50-mm depth increments to 250 mm for determination of bulk density, total porosity, saturated and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity, proportion of pores >30 and 60 mu m, and aggregate size class.
   Results showed pugging was having a long-term effect on soil physical properties of all 3 soils, including the well-drained Allophanic Soil that rarely pugged. All measurements showed a decline in values for soil properties from never trodden to previously pugged. The greatest changes were in hydraulic conductivity, proportion of pores, and aggregate size (>60 and <20 mm).
   The most appropriate depth increment for measuring differences between treatments was found to be 50-100 mm. A comparison of previously pugged to never trodden at this depth showed that hydraulic conductivity had decreased by 80%, pore size by 46% (except for Allophanic Soil), and the proportion of aggregates >60 mm in diameter had increased at least 4-fold.
   Farming practices that minimise pugging damage, such as on/or grazing, need to be encouraged. It is possible that such programs may permit the soil to recover to a physical state similar to never trodden sites.

ID GROWTH
AB Land treatment of wastewater using short rotation forestry (SRF) has potential as a sustainable method for disposal of dairy-farm effluent. We compared 3 SRF species, 2 evergreen species of eucalypts (Eucalyptus nitens, E. saligna) and a deciduous willow (Salix kinuyanagi), in the land treatment of dairy-farm effluent. The trees were grown in lysimeters (1.8 m diameter, 1.0 m depth), and a bare soil treatment was used as a control. The application of dairy-farm oxidation-pond effluent totalled 218 g N/lysimeter (equivalent to 870 kg N/ha) over 2 irrigation seasons (December 1995-June 1996 and September 1996-April 1997). Effluent was applied weekly in summer at a rate of 18.9 mm/week. No effluent was applied during the winter period. The evapotranspiration (ET) rates of the trees, and the volumes and nitrogen contents of the leachates are compared for a winter period (4 weeks) and a summer period (5 weeks). The biomass accumulation and the uptake of nitrogen by the 3 tree species were also investigated.
   The SRF trees improved the renovation levels of dairy-farm effluent and produced biomass suitable for energy conversion. Of the 3 tree species, only the S. kinuyanagi treatments maintained leachate nitrate concentrations below the New Zealand drinking water standard of 11.3 mg NO3--N/L throughout both the winter and summer periods. The E. nitens treatment produced significantly more oven-dry biomass (19.1 kg/tree) than the E. saligna trees (9.7 kg/tree) (P = 0.05). The S. kinuyanagi treatment had intermediate production (13.3 kg/tree) and was not significantly different from the other 2 tree species (P = 0.05). The nutrient accumulation was not significantly different among the species (P = 0.05). S. kinuyanagi was considered the best overall performer for the land treatment of dairy-farm effluent, based on the concentrations of leachate moving beyond the root-zone.

The argumentation refers to four case studies of environmental management in the US, Europe, and China. To diagnose the institutional constraints of environmental management, the studies focus on the mental models with which experts understand environmental problems and justify their efforts to fix the problems. As such, the mental models also reflect the institutional rules that constrain expert actions. Design principles for novel environmental institutions are developed on the basis of institutional theory and case study findings. In conclusion, implications of the proposed institutional arrangements for the public role of experts are discussed.

AB Within the even-aged forestry management regime, the length of the rotation period determines the age class structure of a forest area. In many countries harvesting decisions are made by households that own forest land. This paper discusses how different type of values can be included in a model that aims to explain the household forest owners' harvesting decisions. The model suggests that the in situ or amenity preferences make the forest rotation problem considerably more complex than in the classical rotation models based on maximum sustainable yield or maximization of timber revenues. This extended model is able to explain several empirical findings on harvesting behavior and prices of forest land. The model and its features are compared to certain ecological views on renewable resource management.

AB Data on the breeding success of the pied flycatcher, which reflects the combined effects of various biotic and abiotic factors affecting the quality of the breeding habitat each year, could explain more than three quarters of the variation in the autumn population levels of woodland tetraonids (capercaillie Tetrao urogallus and black grouse T. tetrix) in a subalpine forest area in Lierne, central Norway, during the period 1986-1995. The applicability of a simple regression model is evaluated on the basis of the data from 1996. Much less time is required to collect these breeding parameters on the flycatcher from nest boxes than to obtain reasonably good population estimates for the tetraonid species themselves directly. Data on the production of pied flycatcher, collected well in advance of the shooting season, could be used to set bag limits for woodland tetraonids the following autumn. This might be used as a tool for sustainable harvest to avoid future over-exploitation of these species in years with predicted low production. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The effects on soil condition of increasing periods under intensive cultivation for vegetable production on a Typic Haplohumult were compared with those of pastoral management using soil biological, physical and chemical indices of soil quality. The majority of the soils studied had reasonably high pH, exchangeable cation and extractable P levels reflecting the high fertilizer rates applied to dairy pasture and more particularly vegetable-producing soils. Soil organic C (C(org)) content under long-term pasture (>60 years) was in the range of 55 g C kg(-1) to 65 g C kg(-1). With increasing periods under vegetable production soil organic matter declined until a new equilibrium level was attained at about 15-20 g C kg(-1) after 60-80 years. The loss of soil organic matter resulted in a linear decline in microbial biomass C (C(mic)) and basal respiratory rate. The microbial quotient (C(mic)/C(org)) decreased from 2.3% to 1.1% as soil organic matter content declined from 65 g C kg(-1) to 15 g C kg(-1) but the microbial metabolic quotient (basal respiration/C(mic) ratio) remained unaffected. With decreasing soil organic matter content, the decline in arginine ammonification rate, fluorescein diacetate hydrolytic activity, earthworm numbers, soil aggregate stability and total clod porosity was curvilinear and little affected until soil organic C content fell below about 45 g C kg(-1). Soils with an organic C content above 45 g C kg(-1) had been under pasture for at least 30 years. At the same C(org) content, soil biological activity and soil physical conditions were markedly improved when soils were under grass rather than vegetables. It was concluded that for soils under continuous vegetable production, practices that add organic residues to the soil should be promoted and that extending routine soil testing procedures to include key physical and biological properties will be an important future step in promoting sustainable management practices in the area.

AB Terrestrial above-ground biomass production and utilisation in Sierra Leone was analysed for the years 1984/5 to 1990/1. The total production of biomass energy was estimated at an annual average of 131 PJ (39% from agriculture, 51% from forestry and 10% from livestock). Of the 117 PJ produced from agricultural and forestry operations, 37 PJ was harvested as firewood and burnt (10.9 GJ or 0.72 t wood per capita per year, supplying 80% of the country's energy), 12 PJ was harvested for food, 66 PJ was unutilised crop and forestry residues, 37 PJ was harvested crop residues for use directly as fuel, and 2 PJ was harvested and used for industrial purposes and not for fuel. Livestock produced wastes with an energy content of 13 PJ of which only 0.1 PJ was collected and used for fuel. Thus 54 PJ (41%) of the 131 PJ of biomass energy produced annually was actually utilised while 49 PJ remained as unused agricultural residues and dung, and a further 27 PJ was unused forestry residues. The total amount of biomass (fuelwood, residues and dung) used directly to provide energy, mostly in households, was estimated at 40 PJ (11.8 GJ per capita per year or 0.79 t fuelwood equivalent). Direct biomass energy utilisation in agroindustry (0.4 PJ) was negligible in comparison.
   Two assessments of Sierra Leone's biomass standing stock and MAI (mean annual increment) were examined in order to assess the sustainability of various biomass use scenarios. Large differences were found between the MAI of the two assessments, making it difficult to predict sustainability of biomass production and use. The estimation of total standing stock varied between 227 and 366 Mt and the estimation of MAI varied between 15 and 70 Mt.
   Analysis of the availability and use of the biomass resource is crucial if biomass energy is to be used on a sustainable basis. A software package has been developed and is available to draft biomass flow charts but further work is needed to incorporate social and economic costs. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

ID DIGESTERS
AB The decomposition and gas production pattern of eight unprocessed biomass feedstocks representing annual weeds, leaf litter, agro residues and market wastes were monitored in this laboratory study. Solid phase fermentation was effected with a weekly fed biomass bed sprinkled twice daily with recycled fermenter liquid to initiate and sustain biogas production from the decomposing biomass bed. Fermenters were fed from the top with gradually increasing feed rates to determine maximum feed rates sustainable. Feed rates of 1 g total solids (TS) l(-1)d(-1) was possible which lead to pseudo steady state gas production rates between 0.26-0.98 1 l(-1) d(-1) at specific gas yields of 0.18-0.44 1 g(-1) TS at 35-75% volatile solids (VS) destruction. Feedstocks such as paper mulberry (Broussenetia), Parthenium, Synedrella and urban garbage lost > 50% VS in 30 d while paddy straw, bagasse and sugarcane trash exhibited lower VS loss (greater than or equal to 35%) in this period. During decomposition, bulky biomass feedstocks underwent compaction and obviated the need for a pretreatment step. Bulk densities rose manifold to reach between 150-350 g l(-1) within 20 d. A higher decomposition rate, process optimization and use of pre-compacted feedstocks have the potential to increase the feed rates (0.96-1.93 g TS l(-1)d(-1)), quantity of feedstock held in the reactor as well as gas production rates. The current gas production rates and space economy in these fermenters compare well with Indian cattle dung fermenters (0.3-0.5 l l(-1) d(-1)) and is attractive. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

ID INDUSTRIALIZED DEMOCRACIES; SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT; CORPORATISM;

AB This article examines the relationship between national political and economic institutions and environmental performance since the early 1970s in seventeen OECD countries. After presenting hypotheses about some of the effects of the most important structural and institutional variables on performance, I test these hypotheses using a multiple regression analysis. I find that neo-corporatist societies experience much better environmental outcomes than more pluralist systems. However, neither the degree of 'consensual' political democracy nor traditional political factors can explain much variation in environmental performance. These relationships hold even after controlling for other structural factors such as income and manufacturing intensity. The results are robust despite perennial small-n statistical problems encountered in comparative political economy.

AB The performance of two types of tags (external tags and visual implants) on juvenile tarpon is evaluated in mangrove mud Bats of Boqueron Bay. External tags (mini-spaghetti and dangling tags) yielded high retention and recovery rates (69% and 46%, respectively) over a period of 167 d. While recapture returns with visual implants were lower (26%) than returns with external tags, they provided more reliable estimates of growth. Experiments conducted between July 1992 to February 1995 suggest juvenile tarpon residency in Puerto Rican mud flats is ephemeral: limited to a few months when high water connection exist among mud flats and the adjacent lagoon (from June to February). Tarpon are recruited as late larvae or newly metamorphosed juveniles during this period. Recruitment exhibited a high inter-annual variation; highest from August to September in 1992 and from October to December in 1994, while it completely crashed during 1993. Tarpon juveniles grew at 1.2% their SL d(-1) and reached a maximum sustainable size of approximately 200 mm SL between the months of October to December. Most exit the area before the end of February before the mud flats become completely dry.

AB For immunization to be effective in the long run as a major global disease control intervention it is imports nt to provide good quality Vaccination services. Studies carried out in three countries in Asia (Bangladesh, India, and the Philippines) and two countries in Africa (Ethiopia and Malawi), and reported on in this article, document the fact that parents are willing to invest considerable effort in having their children vaccinated; however, there are a number of serious shortcomings in the quality of the routine Vaccination services and strains are apparent at the interface between the Vaccination providers and the users. These shortcomings are detracting from the sustainability of routine Vaccination programmes and are promoting the growth of pools of nonimmunized and partially immunized children. To safeguard the continued operation and to enhance the coverage of routine vaccination programmes it is crucial that these difficulties be addressed.

AB Crop rotations involving perennial alfalfa (Medicago saliva L.) present the unique problem of terminating the alfalfa stand. Intensive tillage currently used to terminate alfalfa increases the risk of soil erosion and reduces many of the rotational benefits from alfalfa. Inadequate alfalfa termination results in severe competition to the following crop by surviving alfalfa plants. Field experiments were conducted in Manitoba between 1991 and 1993 with the following objectives: I) to investigate no-till vs. tillage management systems for successful alfalfa termination, 2) to compare fall vs. spring alfalfa termination, 3) to compare the performance of barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) and wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) seeded into alfalfa residue, and 4) to determine the relationship between alfalfa escapes and grain yield. Fall termination produced higher grain yields than spring termination, however this advantage was only achieved with the better termination treatments capable of lowering alfalfa regrowth below a critical level. The best herbicide treatment tested here was glyphosate at 1.78 kg a.i. ha(-1) Successful treatments would have to reduce residual alfalfa basal crown area (a measure of alfalfa regrowth potential) after cereal grain harvest to below 2%. Alfalfa escapes reduced yield of following wheat and barley crops similarly (P > 0.05). When alfalfa termination treatment method allowed some regrowth, in-crop herbicide treatments significantly reduced alfalfa basal crown area. Results of this study indicate that it is feasible to terminate alfalfa with herbicides in the absence of tillage, however an overall cropping strategy, including adequate consideration of weeds present in alfalfa fields at time of termination, must be considered.

   Sea; sustainable use of the world ocean
ID ULTRAVIOLET-RADIATION; GROWTH; MARINE
AB The concept of ocean governance encompasses norms, institutional arrangements, and substantive policies. The new ocean regime, for which the Third United Nations Law of the Sea Conference was the midwife, is based on the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, but the 1982 convention by itself was clearly insufficient to rake the world community into the twenty-first century. It has been supplemented by Agenda ZI of the UN Conference an Environment and Development (UNCED) of 1992; the Global Programme of Action for the Protection of the Marine Environment from Land-Based Activities of 1995, and the United Nations Agreement on Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks of 1995. Even with these additions the fabric of the new ocean regime is insufficient to confront the new challenges faced by human use of the marine environment. Present patterns of human utilization of the world ocean are not sustainable over an indefinite future. There is an urgent need to breathe life into the notion of "sustainability" to make it into a fundamental norm of the new world ocean regime. This article explores what such an effort would require in terms of norms, institutional arrangements, and substantive policies.

AB We investigated avian use of the Pantan habitats, a Mediterranean wetland on the Croatian coast of the Adriatic Sea, by comparing censuses from two periods. The Pantan was surveyed for breeding, resident, wintering, and passage birds in the periods from 1968-1972 and 1986-1991. Species richness declined from 67 to 54. Wintering/passage bird species was the most important group of birds but they also declined from 55 in the period 1968-1972 to 42 in the period 1986-1991. The value of the Pantan coastal area to birds was determined by 25 threatened species and 15 "Species of European Special Concern" (SPEC, Tucker & Heath, 1994). The Pantan wetland ecosystem has a floristical, ornithological, and aesthetic value at both the regional and international levels. The wetland ecosystem has been destroyed in part by the construction of artificial fishponds and by the regulation of the water course, and it is threatened by the dumping of garbage and rubble, the sedimentation of lead and nitrogen compounds, and the planned construction of housing and a slaughter-house. There are impacts from fishing and bunting on waterbirds. The degradation of wetlands is reflected in the reduction of the frequency and/or abundance of 87% of the bird species. We discuss the socioeconomic context for conservation management and sustainable development of coastal wetlands in Croatia. Management measures for conservation of the wetland as a whole are suggested.

AB Irrigation is becoming a more commonly used practice on glacially derived soils of the Northern Great Plains. Threshold salinity and sodicity water quality criteria for soil-water compatibility in these sulfatic soils are not well defined. This study was conducted to relate soil salinity and sodicity to clay dispersion and saturated hydraulic conductivity (K-sat) in four representative soils. Soil salinity (EC treatment levels of 0.1 and 0.4 S m(-1)) and sodicity (SAR treatment levels of 3, 9, and 15) levels were established to produce a range of conditions similar to those that might be found under irrigation. The response of each soil to changes in salinity and sodicity was unique. In general, as sodicity increased clay dispersion also increase, but the magnitude of the increase varied among the soils. In two of the soils, clay dispersion across a range of sodicity levels was lower under the 0.4 S m(-1) treatment than under the 0.1 S m(-1) treatment and in the other two soils, clay dispersion across a range of sodicity levels was similar between the two salinity treatments. Changes in K-sat were greatest in the finer textured soil (decreasing an order of magnitude across the range of sodicity levels), but was unchanged in the coarse textured soils. Results suggest that these sulfatic soils are more susceptible to sodicity induced deterioration than chloridic soils. These results and earlier field observations suggest that sustainable irrigation may be limited to sites with a water source having a SAR <5 and an EC not exceeding 0.3 S m(-1) for these sulfatic glacially derived soils.

TI Growth and cadmium accumulation in selected switchgrass cultivars

ID SOIL; NITROGEN; BIOMASS; SLUDGE
AB Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) has potential as a sustainable biofuel crop. Utilizing alternative sources of fertilizer nutrients could enhance production of switchgrass. However, alternative sources of fertilizer such as sewage sludge sometimes contain heavy metals such as cadmium (Cd) and the response of switchgrass to Cd is not known. Four switchgrass cultivars (Alamo, Blackwell, Cave-in-Rock, and Trailblazer) grown in sand culture were watered twice weekly with a nutrient solution containing Cd. Cadmium levels in solution were 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16 mg Cd L-1. Plants were harvested 63 d after planting and separated into leaf blade, stem (culm + leaf sheath), and root components. Tissue Cd concentrations were determined using atomic absorption spectrophotometry. Cultivars differed (P<0.05) by less than 15% for biomass accumulation and allocation among plant parts. Cadmium levels of 16 mg L-1 reduced biomass yields by 31% for roots, 39% for leaf blades, arid 47% for stems as compared to no added Cd. At 16 mg Cd L-1, Cd concentration in leaf blades was 9.9 mg kg(-1). The highest levels of Cd (329 mg kg(-1)) were found in roots of Blackwell and Trailblazer grown at the highest Cd level. Cadmium at 16 mg Cd L-1 is phytotoxic to switchgrass and accumulates in all plant parts. The cultivars tested in this study did not differ in biomass accumulation in response to Cd; however, Cd accumulation in plant parts differed among cultivars. Consideration of Cd uptake should be a part of switchgrass cultivar selection when grown in the presence of Cd.

ID SOCIAL-SECURITY
AB Analysts predict that future demographically driven financial imbalances will undermine the sustainability of pay-as-you-go social insurance arrangements like the Canada Pension Plan (CPP). Proposed reforms for the CPP focus on raising the contribution rate to pre-fund future benefits. In an overlapping generations model, the authors examine how demographic factors alone could explain the observed changes in productivity/wage growth over the last 30 years. The authors also examine how these factors impact on a pay-as-you-go financed CPP. If Canada is a small open economy, then real wages and real interest rates are not affected by domestic demographic conditions. In this setting, increasing payroll taxes transfers the burden of finance away from the lower income baby bust generation to the higher income baby boom generation. In contrast, if Canada can be characterized as a closed economy, then real wages and real interest rates are sensitive to domestic demographic conditions. In this setting, increasing payroll taxes now to keep taxes lower in future is intergenerationally regressive because the CPP burden is reduced for the well off baby bust generation and passed onto the lower income baby boomers.

AB This paper is a progress report on the Adaptable Workplace Laboratory (AWL) within the Headquarters of the General Services Administration (GSA) of the United States of America. GSA owns, operates, leases and rents real estate for major U.S. Government agencies and departments, such as the Environmental Projection Agency, the Department of Energy, and the Department of Commerce. About 1.5 million office workers are housed nationwide in GSA owned, leased or rented buildings. Consequently, GSA is one of the world's largest landlords.
   To demonstrate advanced systems integration concepts, to create a platform for experimentation with innovative information technologies, furniture, heating, ventilating, air-conditioning (HVAC), lighting and building control subsystems, and, most importantly, to create organizational know-how with the goal to better serve its clients, GSA is partnering with Carnegie Mellon University's Center for Building Performance and Diagnostics under the auspices of the National Science Foundation. This partnership is to create the Adaptable Workplace Lab (AWL), a evolutionary workspace on the 7(th) floor of the 3(rd) wing of the GSA Headquarters in Washington, DC. This 10,000 sq. ft. space will feature raised flooring, plug & play non-imbedded mobile technologies, and provide for individual control of environmental systems, workstations and workgroups.

AB Collaborative environments can be understood to be "enabling" environments, which enable individuals and organizations to be creative and productive. Buildings can be seen to operate as enabling environments at different yet inter-related levels: I) as mediator between outdoor and indoor environments; 2) as provider of appropriate indoor physical settings; 3) as host to information technology for an organization. This paper focuses on the first level, and describes a range of architectural alternatives for improved indoor environments in commercial buildings. The paper uses illustrative examples of high-performance buildings in the U.S, and Europe, contrasting their respective approaches to the integration of enclosure, mechanical, and lighting systems.

AB A paradigmatic three stage approach to software development is sketched in terms of a torso-like, but schematic development of informal and formal descriptions (i) of the domain of sustainable development, (ii) of requirements to decision support software for developing models for and monitoring development (claimed to be sustainable), and (iii) of rudiments of a software architecture for such a system.
   In "one bat we tackle three problems": (i) illustrating a fundamental approach to separation of concerns in software development: From domain via requirements to software descriptions; (ii) contributing towards a theory of sustainable development: Bringing some precision to many terms fraught by "political correctness"; and (iii) providing, we believe, a proper way of relating geographic information system+demographic information system systems to decision support software. Perhaps a fourth result of this paper can be claimed: (iv) Showing, as we believe it does, the structural main parts of a proper presentation of software.

SO CROP SCIENCE

DT Article
ID AGRICULTURAL SUSTAINABILITY; FRAMEWORK; SYSTEMS
AB A method for assessing and implementing sustainable crop production is needed to give practical relevance to the frequently used term "sustainable agriculture", The objective of this paper is to present such a theoretical procedure. Therefore the terms "sustainability" and "sustainable crop production" are discussed and defined. On the basis of the definitions, an eight-step procedure for assessing and implementing sustainable crop production is outlined. The steps are (1) identify emissions and other releases linked to different crop production practices. (2) trace each different release from its source (the crop management practice) to its sinks (i.e., agroecosystems and other ecosystems or components of ecosystems directly or indirectly affected by these releases). (3) select indicators that adequately describe the condition of the ecosystem affected directly or indirectly by crop production practices, (4) determine threshold values for the selected ecosystem indicators (i.e., values which should not be exceeded if irreversible changes in the affected ecosystems are to be avoided), (5) transpose the ecosystem threshold values to the farm level by retracing the impact pathways (from Step 2) backward to crop production itself, (6) derive farm-level indicators that point to separate or combined agronomic practices that could cause irreversible changes in affected ecosystems, (7) determine farm-level threshold values for management-induced releases on the basis of ecosystem level threshold values, and (8) identify production schemes that adhere to the framework set by the farm-level thresholds. From these production schemes the farmer can select those most in line with his available resources and objectives.

TI The cost of capital in regulated businesses: Incentives and methodology
SO DESARROLLO ECONOMICO-REVISTA DE CIENCIAS SOCIALES
LA Spanish
DT Article
AB The sustainability of the service is one of the main purposes of every regulatory regime, and this can be seen in the legal regulatory frameworks of every public service. This raises the need to recover the economic costs of the service, to guarantee the maintenance and continuity of the system and its expansion. These economic costs might include a reasonable return on equity: the cost of capital. In this paper we analyze the components of the cost of capital, discussing the incentives that the regulatory decision can generate for the regulated firm. Between others, we discuss geometric and arithmetic returns, mean and marginal cost of debt, book value vis a vis market value. Finally, we present a model of dynamic optimization for a regulated firm.

ID EVOLUTION; DIVERSITY
AB Over recent years a new understanding of complex systems, and their dynamics and evolution has emerged, and these have been shown to provide a nem basis for models of the changing patterns of population and economic activities that shape the landscape. In this paper ne make clear the necessarily partial description that any particular model must provide, and show the importance of a multidisciplinary, holistic understanding, linking any particular model to the co-evolution of its environment. In addition, we show how evolutionary processes link the microscopic level of molecules through successive scales of structure and organization ultimately to the biosphere itself, to issues of climatic change, of biomes at the continental scale and atmospheric and oceanic circulation patterns. Some very recent results will be shown which demonstrate that the world climate has already been modified considerably by human activities, particularly agriculture, underlining the vital need to understand better the on-going interaction between human activities and the biosphere.
   Models will be described which can link the co-evolution of these multiple scales of organization and change, and which can be used to help to explore the consequences of different possible policies? and in this way to provide information concerning the agendas, risks and issues to be addressed in the 21st Century as well as pointing to possible policies that may be appropriate. Already models exist which can explore the dynamics of urban development, the patterns of land-use, and the possible environmental impacts of these in the context of a still fast growing population. Such models provide a framework within which questions such as those concerning energy consumption, transportation, social conditions can be explored and agendas and priorities set. Clearly, advances in information and telecommunications technologies present great opportunities for increasing accessibilities without necessarily increasing mobility or energy consumption, and models which can help in assessing their potential impact on development and in their successful implementation are of great value.
   Complex system models can also be of great use in exploring the long term implications of the present, increasing, reliance on market systems and economic signals in the allocation of resources and patterns of investment. In particular, complex systems models can explore the effects of the precise regulatory framework within which a market operates, and as a result may be able to suggest ways in which long term, sustainable development can be achieved despite the present short term horizons of the players in market dynamics. In addition, of course, they can illuminate and inform actors about the longer term, and perhaps actually lengthen the time horizon considered by market participants. In short, the insights arising from complex systems models could, hopefully, play a role in expanding the understanding, the conceptual framework and the ethical basis of decision making in the 21st Century.

AB Continuous population growth and the concomitant maintenance of a growth sustaining environment are not in conflict only if the rates of both economic and biological processes are slowed down steadily. For this to happen, individual and social impatience-lowering adaptations should be adopted, and the capital of the system, both economic and natural, has to he redistributed among the system interacting components to result in an ever more complex organizational,veb, In addition, these factors have to corroborate with a third element, the incorporation of an arsenal of varied technological innovations that improves the use of existing stocks.

   conservation; environmental education; Una Biological Reserve
AB The Una Biological Reserve (REBIO-Una), located in the southeastern area of the state of Bahia, Brazil, comprises 7022 ha. It is the only area in the region that legally assures protection for fauna and flora, to conserve the species of that area and maintain the genetic viability of the populations. As there is not enough area for this to happen within REBIO-Una, several species, including the golden-headed lion tamarin Leontopithecus chrysomelas, need to be able to interact with the forest fragments on the neighbouring farms in order to enlarge their territories effectively. Therefore, in 1995 the development of an environmental education programme in the community surrounding REBIO-Una was proposed, with the aim of diminishing impacts on the reserve, and on the bordering forests. In the last three years we have worked intensively in 70 rural properties, where the programme's activities aimed to include the rural schools, rural workers, land owners, hunters and forest guards. As a result of this work we have documented decreased hunting in REBIO-Una, increased control of fire in the neighbouring farms, and in particular, increased organisation within the community to discuss and incorporate sustainable economic alternatives, leading to the conservation and better management of these important forest fragments.

DT Article
DE awareness; community; conservation; environmental education; Madagascar;
   theatre; tradition
AB This paper describes the use of theatre as a means of working with local communities in Madagascar to encourage environmental and conservation actions. We chose theatre as a means for reciprocal message transmission for several reasons: 1) it involves mainly oral skills, which in rural areas with high rates of illiteracy aids understanding; 2) people can be both actors and audience; and 3) this popular theatre is simple and cheap to organise. The villages where the events take place are selected because of their proximity to or impact on natural environments and threatened species, and their cultural and socio-economic importance. The theme, on which all activities are focused, is discussed with village leaders; usually it is either the habitat or the animals which make the region unique. Organisation is done by the villagers, who are both actors, and audience, and events are attended by and involve the entire village, local officials, and partners. A case study from Lac Alaotra, home of the critically endangered Alaotran gentle lemur Hapalemur griseus alaotrensis, describes the "joro", a ceremony to ask for blessings, and real theatre pieces based on traditional legend, performed by school students. The oral communication is followed up by written documents and actions. In Alaotra, actions following from the theatre festivals included a fishing "dina" or convention in order to manage lake products sustainably, and replanting of areas of marsh. The theatre theme "The marsh is life" became so widely known that the most important socio-economic event in the region was called the Marsh Fair. Interactive discussion and theatre on locally relevant environmental and conservation topics appears to be an effective way of raising awareness and empowering people to manage their natural resources, while also supporting traditional culture.

DT Article
AB By describing the shift from the so-called "golden age of school" and the "golden age of education" to the "golden age of learning", the author claims that the contemporary changes in education which stress learning, are the outcomes of three factors: globalization, post-modern changes in science, and the policies and programs of international organizations and NGOs. Focusing her interest on globalization defined as a series of inter-related changes leading to establishing the world as a whole, she uses critical analysis to show that educational changes may be explained by an impact of four globalization trends: a) globalization as a process of economic integration, b) globalization as a process of democratic integration, c) globalization as a process of moral integration, and d) globalization as a basis For global processes of differentiation. While describing the influence of each of these trends, she addresses the questions of corporate impact on national systems of education, development of civic and democratic literacy as preconditions for the third generation of human rights protection, development of awareness of interconnections and common responsibility in the context of global ethics and sustainable development, and of the impact the processes of ethnic and national differentiation have on education in developed and post-communist countries.

AB Life cycle assessment (LCA) is a method for analysing and assessing the environmental impact of a material, product or service throughout the entire life cycle. In this study 100 GWh heat is to be demanded by a local heat district. A mixture of coal and wet biofuel is frequently used as fuel for steam generation (Case I). A conversion of the mixed fuel to dried biofuel is proposed. In the district it is also estimated that it is possible for 4000 private houses to convert from oil to wood pellets. It is proposed that a sustainable solution to the actual problem is to combine heat and power production together with an in improvement in the quality of wood residues and manufacture of pellets. It is also proposed that a steam dryer is integrated to the system (Case 2).
   Most of the heat from the drying process is used to the municipal heating networks. In this study the environmental impact of the two cases is examined with LCA. Different valuation methods shows that Case 2 is an improvement over Case 1, but there is diversity in the magnitudes of environmental impact in the comparison of the cases. The differences depend particularly on how the emissions of CO2, NOx and hydrocarbons are estimated. The impact of the organic compounds from the exhaust gas during the drying is estimated as low in all of the three used methods.

ID ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE
AB Sustainable development can be reflected by various economic, social and environmental factors that are closely interconnected with each other, and with the additional dimension of time, which stresses the long-term perspective of several factors. Due to their central role in human activities and development, firms should play an important part in the attainment of sustainability goals. The purpose of this paper is to contribute to the methodology of indicators that allow for the assessment of business participation into sustainable development. A fundamental standpoint adopted is to view economic, social and environmental efficiency as a necessary (but not sufficient) step towards sustainability. To work out indicators, we build on both the concepts of cost-benefit analysis and the principles of productive efficiency. We assume that we have observations on economic, social and environmental factors for a set of decision making units (DMUs), e.g. firms in an industrial (sub-) sector. The efficiency of each DMU is computed from a set of observed data, using mathematical programming techniques, resulting in DMUs that are 'efficient' and define the efficiency frontier among the set of DMUs, and DMUs that are 'inefficient'. To cope with the multidimensionality of sustainable development, it is important not to base decisions on one unique, aggregate sustainability indicator; instead, it is suggested to develop two or three partial indicators that stress different aspects of the problem. The proposed indicators could be used as an aid to detect so-called factors of unsustainability, and hence to provide for recommendations as to the regulations and incentives, or managerial practices, that will contribute to overall sustainability.

AB This paper presents results from a time-series analysis of seven alternative measures of sustainability for Scotland. The measures chosen are green Net National Product, genuine savings, ecological footprint, environmental space, net primary productivity, the Index of Sustainable Economic Welfare and the Genuine Progress Indicator. These are all measures at the national, or macro, level. We note arguments in the literature that no one single measure of 'sustainability' is likely to be sufficient. However, very different messages concerning the sustainability of Scotland over the period in question (1980-1993) emerge from these measures chosen. We also argue that different indicators provide different insights for policy making. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

DE sustainability; international trade; managed economy
AB A simple and minimal criterion for sustainability is that the value of natural capital plus manufactured capital be not decreasing. On the basis of any individual country or region, the above simple comparison may be misleading, as it does not take account of the production of goods for consumption in other countries/regions, via international trade. In other terms, the full 'environmental footprint' of a country may not be properly assessed. A method of calculating a weak sustainability criterion has been established for both a 'closed' economy approach and an 'open economy approach. There are significant differences between the open and closed economies measures for several regions, particularly the Middle East. Overall, global sustainability on this criterion has been positive, and increasing. Using a difference equation approach, a further analysis has been made of the average proportional rate of change of global sustainability between 1980 and 1990, and its various regional and structural components have been determined. These indicate that most of global sustainability growth can be attributed to Western Europe, Other Asia and Japan, particularly through high savings ratios. The USA, on the other hand, has made a very small net contribution to the growth in global sustainability. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Selection and modeling of sustainable development indicators: a case
   study of the Fraser River Basin, British Columbia
SO ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
LA English
DT Article
DE sustainable development; indicators; modeling; British Columbia
AB A large number of groups in British Columbia and Canada as a whole have expended considerable effort to define sustainable development goals and, to a lesser extent, select sustainable development indicators. Many hope that collection and monitoring of such indicators will provide important policy guidance to decision-makers and provide a means for tracking sustainable development. This project was designed with the following goals: (i) to select indicators that could be linked to an operational definition for sustainable development within the Fraser River Basin (British Columbia); (ii) to assess the accessibility, quality and relevance of the best available data for developing such indicators; (iii) to apply modeling techniques for discerning the linkages among indicators; and (iv) to provide recommendations for further indicator selection and modeling research. The major methodological conclusions reached were: (i) it is important to link sustainable development goals to movements of a small slate of individual indicators as single indicators can rarely be linked to any specific sustainable development goal; (ii) the poor quality, inaccessibility and irrelevance of existing data are pervasive constraints to reliable indicator modeling; (iii) modeling is most appropriate at aggregated spatial scales such as provinces or large watersheds, while modeling at smaller ecosystem-based spatial levels is feasible but unreliable; and (iv) linking the use of deterministic and qualitative modeling approaches is a useful means for projecting indicators and discerning important policy linkages, while conventional statistical modeling approaches are frequently inappropriate because of unreliable or non-commensurable data. This has profound implications for indicator selection and modeling. In contrast to much of the current indicator work, which relies on selecting a large number of detailed specific indicators, it would be more fruitful and less costly to focus attention on a small number of indicators within selected indicator classes (such as economic, social, environmental or human health indicators). The precise specification of the indicator within each of these classes is of less consequence. Indicator modeling work should focus on larger scale systems, as opposed to smaller ecosystem units. Such work is most suited to identifying qualitative policy trade-offs and implications, rather than to forecasting specific indicators. Data gathering efforts can be scaled down substantially and should be informed, but not unduly constrained, by available model frameworks. Greater focus is required on modeling frameworks that can use incomplete data sets or qualitative information, and linking existing quantitative model structures to external qualitative models.

AB Orthophosphate removal from wastewater by planted vertical-flow wetlands (VFWs) occurs through three parallel paths, with reaction rates of: sorption to substratum > biofilm assimilation >> macrophyte uptake. Short term tone or two loadings) plant removal of phosphorus (P) is small but irreversible, whereas P removed by substratum sorption, or non-reactive P (NRP) formation, can be returned as reactive phosphorus (RP). The quantity of P removed by the three paths is substratum > macrophyte >> biofilm, in the short term, but macrophyte > substratum >> biofilm, over months. Rhizosphere hydrology restricts P removal, the rate is limited by mass transfer without liquid mixing, but trebled by mixing. Evapotranspirational mixing alone is small and erratic. In small, above-ground, systems environmental temperature changes cause daily mixing, but prevailing soil temperature gradients limit below-ground mixing. A planted wetland, conceptual model, explains: (1) retention times: determined by initial RP removal rates, and operationally dependent on RP concentration and mixing. Aqueous phase cycling reduces retention times several fold; (2) minimum outflow concentrations: controlled by the gravel-PO(4) sorption equilibrium; (3) sustainable annual P removal: the quantity harvested in the macrophytes. Substratum Fe(III) oxide-hydroxide sorption provides additional assimilation for some years. Specific, model derived. VFW design and operation recommendations are made. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Nonlinear models and laboratory experiments suggest that populations can be chaotic, whereas field data show that a fair proportion of observed populations are not too far from being chaotic. Thus, a natural question arises: do ecosystems enjoy special properties at the edge of chaos? By limiting the analysis to three classes of tritrophic food chains and to the role played by the nutrient available to the bottom of the ecosystem, ws show that top-predator mean abundance is maximum at the edge of chaos. The geographical variability of species abundance along nutrient gradients and the dynamic complexity of observed natural populations are consistent with our findings. Effective guidelines for the sustainability of exploited ecosystems are also derived.

AB Several studies have identified impaired zinc status in remote Australian Aboriginal communities, which contributes to poor growth, low immunity and recurrent episodes of diarrhoea in children. Indigenous Foods were identified for inclusion into a community or household garden which would include fruit and vegetables and lead to their availability, affordability, freshness and quality. Suitable indigenous foods which provide zinc include Brachychiton paradoxum (zinc 7.9mg/100g), Sterculia quadrifida (zinc 6.5mg/100g), Portulaca oleracea/intraterranea (zinc 6.5mg/100g), and Acacia coriacea (zinc 5.8 mg/ 100 g). A brief review of the literature on zinc bioavailability is presented and an attempt is made to estimate and improve the bioavailability of zinc from these indigenous foods. This includes food processing techniques which reduce the content of zinc inhibitors, mainly phytate, and the consumption of zinc absorption facilitators with meals. Concomitantly, adequate health and hygiene is suggested in order to minimise the infection-malnutrition cycle that can result from a reduced zinc status and recurrent episodes of infection. An education program, which includes nutrition, gardening and cooking skills, could form the basis of a sustainable approach to combating impaired, zinc status in this population.

AB Vitamin A deficiency (VAD) is one of the public health problems in Tanzania particularly among preschool children. Several approaches have been suggested for the control VAD in developing countries among which, fortification of locally produced staples with vitamin A or provitamin A was noted to be viable and sustainable. This study was conducted in Kigoma district of Tanzania as part of the efforts to fortify the locally produced cassava flour with an underutilized provitamin A rich food-red palm oil. Fortification was incorporated as part of the traditional processing practice for cassava flour. Results of a feeding program with the enriched cassava flour involving 162 preschool children indicated a significant (p < 0.05) decrease in the prevalence of VAD (plasma retinol level > 20 mu g/dL). Prevalence of VAD among preschool children in the pilot villages decreased from 53.0% (range 23.1-72.7%; plasma retinol levels 17.9-21.7 mu g/dL) to 8.5% (range 5.5-9.8%; plasma retinol levels 21.4-21.9 mu g/dL) at the end of the program. The children also gained more weight (range 5.9-6.5 kg) compared to their counterparts in the control group (range 3.8-4.2 kg). The pregnant and lactating women who participated in the program recorded a 12.6% (range 11.9-14.0%) increase in their plasma retinol concentrations compared to an increase of 3.5% (range 3.2-3.7%) in the control group. Average plasma retinol concentrations were significantly (p < 0.05) higher among women in the pilot villages (mean 22.3 mu g/dL; range 19.0-24.5 mu g/dL) compared to their counterparts in the control villages (mean 20.3 mu g/dL; range 19.8-20.8 mu g/dL). Results of sensory and acceptability evaluation of the meals prepared from the fortified cassava flour showed Char the product was highly liked and accepted despite several limitations. Based on this study. fortification of cassava flour with red palm oil has a potential for controlling VAD. In areas of the country where the red palm oil is produced in abundance. enriching cassava flour or other locally produced staples with red palm oil may thus provide a cheap and sustainable method for eliminating VAD. Fortification also improves the flavor hence acceptability of the oil, increases its utilization and improves the energy density of gruels and/or meals prepared from the enriched flour. It is suggested that a detailed study should be undertaken to determine the stability and keeping quality of the red palm oil enriched cassava flour under various conditions to enable a wider distribution of the product in the country.

AB This paper questions the widespread practice of assessing the hypothesis of long-run fiscal policy sustainability by means of conventional unit-root tests that do not allow for the possible impact of regime shifts. Using the Greek economy as a model case, the Zivot-Andrews sequential integratibility testing procedure which allows for the endogenous determination of possible regime changes is deployed to this end. The empirical evidence reached supports strongly the failure of the Greek government to satisfy intertemporal budget balance in the long-run and identifies as the cause of this failure a deterministic policy regime shift taking place in 1979.

SO EKOLOGIA-BRATISLAVA

AB The Don basin occupies the central part within the territories of forest-steppe and steppe zones of Russian Plain. Seversky Donets is the largest Don's tributary which undergone considerable anthropogenic regulation. In Seversky Donets valley the intensive use of numerous water intake constructions for the needs of the densely populated and industrial region of Donbass on the territory of Russia and Ukraine resulted in the formation of the cones of depression in floodplain terraces.
   Further to the south, the share of floodplain forests in the total area is increasing, and in steppe zone they prevail. Their protective and environment creating functions are highly valued on the scale of the categories of importance in the biological frame of the national agoforest landscapes. The dynamic levels decrease in the water intakes caused the flood-plain lakes and swamps drying up as well as the soil ground drainage, the decrease of flood-plain biogeocoenoses sustainability and productivity, and dramatic floodplain forests drying up.
   Numerous observations of the reformations of floodplain forest ecosystems under anthropogenically changed conditions enabled us to reveal basic laws and regularities of the interactions between hydrogeological and alluvial processes and dynamic changes of the forest growth conditions as well as the state and productivity of forest ecosystems.

TI Private farmer's attitudes to land, work and landscape: Interpretation
   of a case study in landscape ecological framework
SO EKOLOGIA-BRATISLAVA
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper looks at the private farmer's attitudes to their land, their own work and surrounding landscape. We employed a data coming from the socio-ecological research of family farmers in the South Bohemian landscape of the Czech Republic. Using farmer's attitudes to land, work and to landscape, the paper charts the ecological consequences of our cases in context with sustainable agriculture as so as in more theoretical context of landscape ecology. Farmer's attitudes mentioned above contains the potential to be a positive (from an ecological point of view) driving force for landscape preservation and land use. However, the application of these ecological positive attitudes is not a task only the farmer's internal factors. There are playing also great role external factors like agriculture policy, subsidies and last, but not least understanding of co-existence of natural and social patterns in rural landscape.

AB The cost-benefit study of Nordhaus (1994) is representative for the neoclassical approach towards global warming. Nordhaus found that no substantial emission cuts are warranted. Most of his critics have concentrated on the issue of discounting and demanded that a lower discount rate should be applied. These criticisms first miss the point and second lead to ethically dubious, inconsistent conclusions and inefficient policy choices. They miss the point because the real problem of Nordhaus's methodology is his implicit underlying assumption of perfect substitutability between natural and other forms of capital. Given the validity of this assumption, lowering the rate of discount is inconsistent with current savings behaviour, is ethically dubious because future generations will be much richer than the current one anyway, and is inefficient because scarce financial resources are channelled into emissions abatement that exhibits rates of return far inferior to alternative public investments. Any call for aggressive emission abatement must therefore directly attack the perfect substitutability assumption of neoclassical economics. The real disagreement is about whether consumption growth can compensate for environmental degradation caused by global warming. Discounting is not the issue, but substitutability is.

AB An integrated geological, geoelectrical and hydrochemical investigation of shallow groundwater occurrence in the Ibadan area, southwestern Nigeria, is presented. The primary objective was to characterise the groundwater in a typical low-latitude environment underlain by Precambrian crystalline basement complex rocks. The dominant rocks comprise suites of gneisses and quartzites. Chemical analyses of the groundwater show that the mean concentration of the cations is in the order Na>Ca>Mg>K while that for the anions is Cl>HCO3>NO3>SO4. Statistical analyses, using the product-moment coefficient of correlation, indicate positive correlations between the following pairs of parameters: TDS and conductivity (r = 0.96); Na+ + Mg2+ and Cl- (r=0.95); Na+ + K+ and Ca2+ (r=0.43); Na+ +K+ and HCO3- (r=0.17); Ca2+ and Mg2+ (r=0.74); Ca2+ and HCO, (r=0.33); Ca2+ + Mg2+ and HCO3- (r=0.31) and pH and HCO3- (r=0.54). A very weak negative correlation was recorded between pH and Cl-, with r=-0.003. Five groundwater groups have been identified, namely, (I) the Na-Cl, Na-Ca-Cl, Na-Ca(Mg)-Cl; (2) the Ca-(Mg)-Na-HCO3-Cl, Na-CaHCO3-Cl, and Ca-HCO3-Cl; (3) the Ca-(Mg)-NaHCO3, Ca-Na-HCO3, (4) Ca-Na-Cl-(SO4)-HCO3 and (5) the Ca-(Mg)-Na-SO4-HCO3. The different groups reflect the diversity of bedrock types and consequently also of the products of weathering. Most of the water sampled is unfit for drinking on account of the high NO3- content. It can, however, be used for irrigation purposes as the sodium hazard is low while the salinity hazard ranges from low to medium. Resistivity soundings indicate the presence of a thick weathering profile, which could be up to 60 m. Such sites should be the target for any long-term and sustainable groundwater development in the area.

AB South African water law as well as the country's water resource management policies are currently under review. The Water Law Principles, which were established as part of this review process, indicate a commitment to sustainable development of water resources and the protection of an ecological "reserve." Such policy goals highlight the limitations of traditional and current water-quality management strategies, which rely on stressor monitoring and associated regulation of pollution. The concept of an assimilative capacity is central to the implementation of the current water-quality management approach. Weaknesses inherent in basing water management on the concept of assimilative capacity are discussed. Response monitoring is proposed as a way of addressing some of the weaknesses.
   Following a global trend, the new policy goals emphasize the need to protect rather than to use the ability of ecosystems to recover from disturbances. This necessitates the adoption of response measurements to quantify ecological condition and monitor ecological change. Response monitoring focuses on properties that are essential to the sustainability of the ecosystem. These monitoring tools can be used to establish natural ranges of ecological change within ecosystems, as well as to quantify conceptually acceptable and unacceptable ranges of change. Through a framework of biological criteria and biological impairment standards, the results of response monitoring can become an integral part of future water resource management strategies in South Africa.

   SHE; Wakool; soil salinisation
AB The Wakool Irrigation District consists of 74,000 ha of agricultural land, a large part of which is affected by a rising watertable. Irrigation in the district started in 1936 when the watertable depth was about 9 m. Over the past 30 years, the watertable has risen as a consequence of irrigation, wet winters and inadequate drainage. In addition, the Wakool Irrigation District is underlain by the Calivil and Renmark aquifers of the Murray Basin. Rising groundwater pressures in these deeper aquifers are also contributing to the rising shallow watertable. Since 1981, a sub-surface drainage scheme with 48 bores pumping shallow saline groundwater into a 2000 ha evaporation basin has been developed in two stages to control the watertable in the Wakool Irrigation District. This paper describes the development and application of an integrated hydrogeological model for the Wakool Irrigation District, where management of rising watertable levels and land salinisation is a continuing problem. The model development is considered to be an important part in the establishment of sustainable water management policies for the Wakool Irrigation District. The Wakool model was developed by using the MIKE SHE integrated catchment-modelling package. The developed model enables analysis of the complex hydrogeological regime in the region, and prediction of the environmental impacts of various management options. It is able to describe temporal and spatial variations in the exchange of water between the land surface, drainage and supply systems, and the aquifers within the area. Management options proposed in the Wakool Land and Water Management Plan have been analysed for the period between 1975 and 2020. Various scenarios such as the implementation of on-farm recycling ponds in conjunction with laser levelling, deep-rooted perennials, tree planting, installation of deep groundwater pumps and the effect of shallow groundwater pumping, were investigated. The results from these simulations indicate that the best option is the implementation of shallow pumping. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Home Island is one of the two main inhabited islands of the Cocos (Keeling) Islands, situated about 2800 km north-west of Perth. The island has an average elevation of approximately 2 m above MSL and supports a population of about 450. The geology of the island consists of coral sediments overlying a volcanic seamount. The upper sediments are of primary importance from a hydrogeological viewpoint. These sediments consist of unconsolidated coral sands and other fragments and coral limestone. An unconformity between the younger (Holocene) unconsolidated sediments and older (Pleistocene) coral limestone was found at depths between 10 m to more than 17 m, The island has a long term average annual rainfall of 1950 mm. Water supply is based primarily on groundwater extraction from a local freshwater lens and supplementary rainwater is collected from roofs. Groundwater is currently extracted via seven galleries. A recent study based on a two dimensional model (using the SUTRA package), simulating impacts of various level of pumping up to 200 m(3) day(-1) determined the sustainable yield as 140 m(3) day(-1). This paper describes progress regarding the development of a three-dimensional model of the freshwater lens using the SALTFLOW package, by discretising the aquifer to about 90 000 nodes and 83 000 elements. This is followed by the steady-state calibration of the model, estimation of the parameters affecting the system and assessing the sustainable yield of the lens. Preliminary results of the three dimensional modelling suggest that the sustainable extraction rate is less than 200 m(3) day(-1), which is consistent with the results of the two dimensional modelling. This research project is continuing towards simulation of tidal forces, transient calibration of the model over a 10 year period from January 1988 to December 1997, estimation of sustainable yield of freshwater lens and simulation of various management options.

AB Case-based reasoning (CBR) provides an adequate framework to cope with continuous domains, where a great amount of new valuable experiences are generated in a non-stop way. CBR systems become more competent in their evolution over time by means of learning new relevant experiences. There are two central problems derived from the continuous nature of some domains: the fast growing size of the case library and the overhead in the case library organisation. Our proposal to overcome these two problems is to learn only relevant cases, and to establish a lazy learning algorithm for storing cases in the case library. A relevance measure based on L'Eixample distance, and a related ontology of cases are defined, and the lazy learning algorithm is described. Finally, experimental tests on real data are presented and discussed. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Every environmental activity to a large extent is dependent on climate as natural processes are intrinsically linked with the waxing and waning of the seasons. The goal is to integrate global seasonal climate forecasts with local environmental decision support systems within an operational framework to deliver community benefits. This framework is designed to support the downscaling of coarse resolution seasonal forecasts to drive biological or hydrological applications at the regional level. Some of the challenges and complexities in coupling spatial simulations operating at varying spatial and temporal resolutions will be discussed from several viewpoints, illustrating the value of multidisciplinary collaboration in a virtual team and benefits from the globalisation of research, This project demonstrates how a state Government is evolving an existing service to enhance the use of seasonal climate forecasts for sustainable environmental and natural resource management.

ID GASOLINE CONSUMPTION; CITIES
AB The importance of urban form in the quest for sustainable development has been recognised in a number of countries in recent years. However, there has been limited progress in bringing environmental planning into the sphere of urban systems planning. This situation can be largely attributed to the absence of advanced integrated land use- transport-environment modelling tools capable of analysing the behaviour of complex, dynamic systems. This paper describes an initial attempt to develop a framework for integrating land use, transport and airshed models for evaluating the effect of city form on air quality. The framework identifies the relationship between various components such as the GIS database, the land use-transport-environment module and the airshed model. Issues concerning the structure and robustness of the framework are discussed and results from a recent air quality inquiry are presented. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. Ail rights reserved.

AB In January 1998, a project studying the Unification of Indicator Quality for Assessment of Impact of Multidisciplinary Systems (UNIQUAIMS) began at IACR-Rothamsted. This three year European Union-funded project will examine the choice of indicators for the assessment of the sustainability and impact of multidisciplinary systems. The project links 27 developing country and European partners to clarify methods and rationalize indicators for assessing impact and sustainability in three priority areas: farming systems, ecosystems converted to agricultural use and degraded ecosystems. The results will be disseminated to national and regional agricultural research institutes, extension agents, research planners and policymakers to promote improved interdisciplinary, multidisciplinary and cross-sectoral management of natural resources. A strong socioeconomic component is involved. This paper describes the scientific and policy issues which led to the project and focuses upon the need to: clarify current methods of impact and sustainability assessment; identify key qualitative and quantitative indicators for both baseline and on-going studies and their relevance at different scales, allowing for the balance between standardization and responsiveness to local conditions; and establish sound guidelines for indicator collection procedures at all stages of research, from project conception through to impact and sustainability assessment.

AB A complex, information-rich world requires frameworks that organize data to reveal succinct views and interrelationships. The goal of sustainable development requires a particularly large range of data covering many disciplines-economic, environmental, social and institutional. This paper introduces the Distribution of Resources (DOR) framework. DOR explicitly quantifies the changes in our natural and produced resources and traces the use of resources through production and consumption efficiency to distribution as welfare. The DOR framework accommodates many of the recognized concepts and principles of sustainable development resulting in a comprehensive policy-focused framework with a more extensive range of desirable features than other frameworks developed to date.

AB The feasibility of anaerobic digestion of poultry slaughterhouse wastes combined with wastes from a food packing plant was studied using semi-continuously fed, laboratory-scale, continuously-stirred digesters at 35 degrees C and 55 degrees C. Furthermore, factors affecting anaerobic digestion were studied using batch assays with digested material from the digesters. In the mesophilic digester, inoculated with mesophilic digester sewage sludge, and with a loading of up to 4.6 g volatile solids (VS) 1(-1) d(-1) (a hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 18 days), the specific methane yield was 330 ml g(-1)VS(added). Nitrogen in the feed was organic nitrogen with a slight amount of ammonium present, while ammonium nitrogen in the digested material accounted for 50 to 70 % (up to 3.9 g 1(-1)) of total nitrogen. The total solids and VS removals were 58 and 68 %, respectively With the highest loading, however, methane production was apparently curtailed at the end of the study period, and sustainability of a long-term operation of the process remains to be proven. In contrast, under similar conditions the digesters inoculated with mesophilic and thermophilic granular sludge both failed after 40 to 50 days of operation, their failure being due apparently to inhibition (unadapted inocula or overloading). The results show that up to 100 m(3) of methane can be produced from ton (wet weight) of the waste mixture studied. The process may be inhibited by ammonium nitrogen and some other inhibitory compounds, most likely long-chain fatty acids.

AB Soybean cultivation in the acid soils of low latitude Brazilian Savannahs (Cerrados) has become a reality since the 1970's. Soil fertility management and crop breeding have made major contributions to high standard performance of this crop. There are, however, factors that limit the prospect to sustainable production, such as levels of calcium in the soil, below the ploughed zone. This may prevent root elongation and exposes the crop to drought stress. Genetic variability for tolerance has been identified in locally selected cultivars, although it has indirectly been acquired. Experimental data have shown variability for low-Ca tolerance among and within cultivar. Progeny tests with selected individuals were carried out to assess whether these differences were inheritable. The results indicated the method shah be efficiently used to select superior individuals from a recurrent crossing scheme to breed soybeans for more stable yields.

TI Response of wheat-rice and maize/millet systems to fertilizer and manure
   applications in the mid-hills of Nepal
SO EXPERIMENTAL AGRICULTURE
LA English
DT Article
AB Farmers in the mid-hills of Nepal have a mix of rainfed land on which millet is grown in relay after maize (maize/millet), and irrigated land on which wheat is grown sequentially after rice (wheat-rice). Double cropping is the norm but the diminishing quantities of organic materials, coupled with the trend towards increased use of inorganic fertilizers, have raised questions about the long-term productivity and sustainability of the cropping systems. The aim of this work was to examine the long-term effects (eight years) on grain yield of additions of manure and fertilizer either singly or in combination. Maize/millet and wheat-rice rotations were established on a Dystochrept at Pakhribas Agricultural Centre at about 1450 m altitude. Manure and fertilizer applications were applied to the maize (eight combinations in May) and the wheat (different rates in seven combinations in November) every year with the succeeding crops (millet and rice) utilizing residual nutrients. Yields of maize, millet and rice were greater when manure rather than fertilizer was applied but yields of wheal were less. The combined application of manure and fertilizer significantly increased yields of maize and wheat compared with applications of either manure or fertilizer alone. However, for the subsequent crops (millet and rice) there was either a small residual benefit of the combined application when compared with fertilizer alone, or no benefit when compared with manure alone. Overall, the combined application increased total grain yields by about 35% in the maize/millet rotation and by 16% in the wheat-rice rotation. There was no trend in yields in response to treatment with time.

AB Micronutrient malnutrition ('Hidden Hunger') now afflicts over two billion people worldwide, resulting in poor health, low worker productivity, high rates of mortality and morbidity, increased rates of chronic diseases (coronary heart disease, cancer, stroke, and diabetes), and permanent impairment of cognitive abilities of infants born to micronutrient-deficient mothers. The consequences of food system failures include lethargic national development efforts, continued high population growth rates, and a vicious cycle of poverty for massive numbers of underprivileged people in all nations, Our food systems are failing us globally by not providing enough balanced nutrient output to meet all the nutritional needs of every person, especially resource-poor women, infants and children in developing countries, Agriculture is partly responsible because it has never held nutrient output as an explicit goal of its production systems. Indeed, many agricultural policies have fostered a decline in nutrition and diet diversity for the poor in many countries, Nutrition and health communities are also partly responsible because they have never considered using agriculture as a primary tool in their programs directed at alleviating poor nutrition and ill health globally. Now is the time for a new paradigm for agriculture and nutrition, We must consider ways in which agriculture can contribute to finding sustainable solutions to food system failures through holistic food-based system approaches, thereby closely linking agricultural production to improving human health, livelihood and well being. Such action will stimulate support for agricultural research in many developed countries because it addresses consumer issues as well as agricultural production issues and is, therefore, politically supportable.

AB The combining of benefits for human nutrition and agricultural productivity, resulting from breeding staple food crops which are more efficient in the micronutrient metal uptake from the soil, and which accumulate more micronutrients into their seeds, results in extremely high ex ante estimates of benefit/costs ratios for investments in agricultural research in this area. This finding derives from the confluence of several complementary factors:
   Rates of micronutrient malnutrition are high in developing countries, as are the consequent costs to human welfare and economic productivity.
   Because staple foods are eaten in large quantities every day by the malnourished poor, delivery of enriched staple feuds (fortified by the plants themselves during growth) can rely on existing consumer behavior.
   A significant percentage of the soils in which these staple foods are grown are 'deficient' in these micronutrient metals, which has kept crop yields low. In general, these soils in fact contain relatively high total amounts of micronutrient metals. However, because of binding to soil constituents, these nutrients have poor soil availability to staple crop varieties that are currently available to farmers.
   Adoption and spread of nutritionally-improved varieties by farmers can rely on profit incentives, either because of agronomic advantages on trace mineral-deficient soils or incorporation of nutritional improvements in the most productive varieties being released by agricultural research stations.
   Benefits to relatively small investments in agricultural research may be disseminated widely, potentially accruing to hundreds of millions of people and millions of hectares of cropland.
   Benefits from breeding advances, derived from initial, fixed costs, typically do not involve high recurring costs, and thus tend to be highly sustainable as long as an effective domestic agricultural research infrastructure is maintained. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The paper examines the theoretical basis of the environmental ethics and tries to find out, why some of its problem still remain unresolved. The author considers the limits of ethical thinking, as well as the possibility of a new sort of ethics, which would preserve the characteristics of teleological and deontological ethics. She outlines the way of making the humane and the environmental values equal and discusses the presuppositions of the practical acceptance of the environmental values. She takes into account also the possibility of an applied ethics offered by the concept of the sustainable development.

AB Previous modelling of areas closed to fishing (marine reserves) has generally employed non-dynamic models and has not included biological factors such as stock-recruitment and weight-fecundity relations. These models predicted that a marine reserve would result in a decrease in fishery yield, an increase in spawning biomass and that movements of fish across the reserve boundaries could reduce its benefits. We utilised an age-structured model based on an Atlantic cod population that included more realistic reproductive factors. We compared a Reserve regime that contained a reserve with a No-reserve regime in which the usual fishery management tools were used. As exploitation rate increased, the relative recruitment and spawners biomass decreased in the No-reserve regime. Larger reserves resulted in more robust recruitment and biomass of spawners. At low exploitation rates, marine reserves resulted in smaller yields. However, when the exploitation rate was larger than the rate which gives the maximum sustainable yield, the biomass of female spawners was maintained at a higher level in the Reserve regime and hence the yield did not collapse. Faster rate of movement of fish decreased these advantages, but the higher spawners biomass and level of recruitment still provided advantages for the Reserve regime. Moreover, even for highly mobile fish, our model suggests that a fish stock protected with a marine reserve would be more resilient to exploitation than when managed without. However, a model realistic spatially and temporally would be necessary to assess the usefulness of marine reserves to prevent overexploitation of migrating fish. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Ecological management is gaining acceptance as an encompassing philosophy in forest resource management. In keeping with this new paradigm, the Canadian Standards Association is creating a forest certification process to ensure that forest products are generated through sustainable forestry. However, a great deal of research is needed to develop and assess soil indicators of ecological sustainability. This paper discusses the role and usefulness of microbial indicators of soil quality in the ecological management of forests and the forest certification process. Suitable microbial indicators of soil conservation should be closely linked to critical ecological processes, should be documented properly across various ecosystem types, should be easy to use, and must evolve with new scientific knowledge.

AB This article assesses the economic performance of Canadian forest reliant census subdivisions (referred to as FRCs for the purposes of this paper) over the period 1981 to 1991. FRCs performed reasonably well over the 10 year period. The average annual rate of growth in base income was 1.7% per year. However, the performance of FRCs is quite varied. Growth of non-forest sectors was the major contributor to growth in FRCs indicating a general tendency for these CSDs to diversify and become less forest reliant over time. Generally, the FRCs that performed well over the period were the ones that initially had one or more of the following characteristics: larger FRCs, FRCs that were initially less forest reliant, FRCs with a higher paper and allied component in the forest sector and FRCs with lower initial wage rates.

AB Improved and updated human genetics education, including Alzheimer disease (AD) awareness and education, is urgently needed. National, state, and local standards for science education agree that human genetics, biotechnology applications, and the social and ethical issues raised by modern technology need to be taught in high school science using hands-on and inquiry methods of teaching. High school science courses are the last opportunity for most individuals to learn human genetics. There are an increasing number of new and successful human genetics curriculum materials and inservice teacher education programs at the secondary school level aligned with national and state science education standards. These curricula and teacher education programs can be enhanced by collaborative partnerships of geneticists, genetics professionals, biotechnology scientists and technical personnel, and science educators, several of which are in successful operation. Because human genetics involves families and generations, genetics education tied to AD may provide a unique opportunity to educate two generations, both students and parents, to the many medical, personal, family, community, and cultural issues of human genetics and genetic conditions. Implementing human genetics and AD education provides a recipe for accurate, relevant, sustainable and exciting teaching and learning for all involved.

TI Tourism and cultural change in Bali
SO GEOGRAPHISCHE ZEITSCHRIFT
LA German
DT Article
AB One of the main negative effects of tourism, especially in developing countries is the possible destruction of the culture of the host societies. A cultural (and ecological) sustainable development for Ball based on tourism is endangered by the quantity of tourists visiting the country. Complete commercialisation, it is feared, will lead to the destruction of Balinese culture - one of the major assets making Ball attractive to tourists. Many aspects of Balinese culture are being rapidly changed by the effects of tourism, such as the increasingly tourist oriented arts and crafts sector. This study shows, however, that this has not led to the destruction but rather to a vitalisation of important cultural goods. The Balinses were able to maintain their ccultural identity, in part due to the fact that they were able to protect their type of Hinduism from commercialisation and profanation. To a large degree, the cultural change which has been brought on by tourism only affects the superficial structure whereas it is hard to detect a negative impact of tourism on the cultural basis, i.e. the religion.

DT Article
ID RENEWABLE ENERGY
AB During the last 25 years there have been major changes in energy production in the UK, including the drastic decline of deep-mining for coal, and the development of a large-scale oil and gas industry in the North Sea, while the last decade has seen radical changes in the energy market leading to a 'dash for gas' in electrically generation and a proliferation of small-scale renewable energy plants. Key features of the emerging new geography of energy supply are identified, and factors shaping the new pattern discussed. Societal perception of the energy problem has changed, and energy debates are conducted increasingly with reference to the concept of sustainability.

SO GOVERNMENT INFORMATION QUARTERLY
LA English
DT Article
ID GOVERNMENT INFORMATION; DIGITAL INFORMATION; UNITED-STATES; LIBRARIES;
   INTERNET; POLICY; ISSUES; FUTURE
AB The Coalition for Networked information (CNI) has had a longstanding interest in U.S. government information and the potential that the network offers to scholars, researchers, students, and citizens, This article is based on a CNI paper whose goal is to guide institutional leaders (e.g., library directors, chief information officers, and chief academic officers) in higher education in the development of strategies for providing access to and services for U.S. federal information using the rapidly expanding global information infrastructure. The paper is not a policy paper nor does it propose a new Federal Depository Library Program (FDLP) model. Its aim is to identify issues for the higher education community and to raise questions regarding sustainable access and services in order that federal information remains a viable resource in the evolving technological environment. Institutions of higher education that have provided access to, and services for, these materials are finding that they need to rethink their policies and practices to keep pace with the changes in electronic production and dissemination of federal information. Likewise, there is a concurrent need to focus people and investments on re-engineering their service programs so as to continue making federal information widely available.

AB The intensive development of industry and urban structures along the seashores of the world, as well as the immense increase in marine transportation and other activities, has resulted in the deposition of thousands of new chemicals and organic compounds, endangering the existence of organisms and ecosystems. The conventional single biomarker methods used in ecological assessment studies cannot provide an adequate base for environmental health assessment, management and sustainability planning. The present study uses a set of novel biochemical, physiological, cytogenetic and morphological methods to characterize the state of health of selected molluscs and fish along the shores of the German North Sea, as well as the Israeli Mediterranean and Red Sea. The methods include measurement of activity of multixenobiotic resistance-mediated transporter (MXRtr) and the system of active transport of organic anions (SATOA) as indicators of antixenobiotic defence; glutathione S-transferase (GST) activity as an indicator of biotransformation of xenobiotics; DNA unwinding as a marker of genotoxicity; micronucleus test for clastogenicity; levels of phagocytosis for immunotoxicity; cholinesterase (ChE) activity and level of catecholamines as indicators of neurotoxicity; permeability of external epithelia to anionic hydrophilic probe, intralysosomal accumulation of cationic amphiphilic probe and activity of non-specific esterases as indicators of cell/tissue viability. Complete histopathological examination was used for diagnostics of environmental pathology. The obtained data show that the activity of the defensive pumps, MXRtr and SATOA in the studied organisms was significantly higher in the surface epithelia of molluscs from a polluted site than that of the same species from control, unpolluted stations, providing clear evidence of response to stress. Enhanced frequency of DNA lesions (alkaline and acidic DNA unwinding) and micronucleus-containing cells was significantly higher in samples from polluted sites in comparison to those from the clean sites that exhibited genotoxic and clastogenic activity of the pollutants. In all the studied molluscs a negative correlation was found between the MXRtr levels of activity and the frequency of micronucleus-containing hemocytes. The expression of this was in accordance with the level of pollution. The complete histopathological examination demonstrates significantly higher frequencies of pathological alterations in organs of animals from polluted sites. A strong negative correlation was found between the frequency of these alterations and MXRtr activity in the same specimens. In addition to these parameters, a decrease in the viability was noted in molluscs from the polluted sites, but ChE activities remained similar at most sites. The methods applied in our study unmasked numerous early cryptic responses and negative alterations of health in populations of marine biota sampled from the polluted sites. This demonstrates that genotoxic, clastogenic and pathogenic xenobiotics are present and act in the studied sites and this knowledge can provide a reliable base for consideration for sustainable development.

AB This paper briefly highlights some of the principal issues related to the organisation and management of water in the UK following the privatisation of the water services industry and the establishment of a new regulatory regime. Many lessons have been learn since the re-organisation and the system is now becoming increasingly more efficient as experience is gained. The need to respond to new and predicted future pressures is stimulating new thinking on how the water environment can be managed in a more sustainable manner and what additional measures are needed. The paper describes the basic organisation of the water industry and how it is regulated; the investment planning process and the results have been achieved; the arrangements for river basin management; the state of the water environment and the principal issues to be tackled; and some of the challenges in managing the water environment in the context of sustainable development.

AB The concept of mangrove ecosystem rehabilitation is considered. Four main reasons for rehabilitating mangroves are identified: conservation, landscaping, sustainable production and coastal protection. Practical aspects of mangrove rehabilitation, such as the causes of site degradation, site selection, source of seedlings and planting, monitoring and maintenance are then briefly mentioned. Future developments that may impact on mangrove ecosystem restoration such as the importance of biodiversity, biotechnology, ecological modelling, mapping, human ecology and data bases, are then briefly reviewed. Finally, the matter of choice and necessity is addressed.

AB Restoration of severely eutrophic, shallow lakes often involves a step by step treatment, starting with control of catchment nutrient inputs and internal nutrient loading, followed by biomanipulation and finally the stabilisation of a macrophyte dominated lake. In this paper, the restoration strategy of Barton Broad is presented. As this is the largest and most complex of the lakes in Broadland to restore, the nature of the restoration strategy is derived from the combined experience of research, monitoring and small scale restoration projects elsewhere. Some practical difficulties and uncertainties are identified within each of the restoration 'steps'. The need for careful assessment of restoration targets, a catchment approach and collaboration with local people are emphasised.

AB African tropical rainforests, and especially their freshwater biodiversity, are seriously threatened by ongoing industrial deforestation. Sound ecological management is needed to ensure the sustainability of these resources. For this purpose, an index of biotic integrity (IBI), based on fish assemblage characteristics, is developed in this paper. It is used to quantify the impact of industrial deforestation on freshwater biodiversity. Data from 30 non-impacted sites were used to develop a series of compositional, structural and functional metrics that reflect sites with a high biotic integrity, i.e. what a stream-fish community should look like in the absence of human perturbation. These data were compared to data collected from sites subjected to substantial forest watershed loss, in order to identify those IBI metrics that best distinguish streams with high and low biotic integrity. The overall IBI scores reflected the quality of the watershed conditions. In addition, there was a close agreement between an index of environmental quality, based on water and habitat quality and the IBI scores, suggesting that the different biological responses of the fish assemblages (observed differences in the IBI scores) were indicative of differences in physico-chemical quality of the streams. The ability of the proposed IBI to index water resource degradation, due to deforestation, suggests that it can be used as a tool for biological monitoring. However, more consistent and comprehensive data are needed to further refine the IBI, especially the assignment of integrity classes and metric threshold values.

AB Reisen stresses that domestic causes of currency crises can be endogenous to the international financial system. Net capital transfers imply current account deficits on the recipient side. Sustained capital inflows produce a real appreciation which diverts investment away from export-oriented sectors. There were common structural weaknesses. Fixed exchange rates understated the investment risk. Liberalised, under-regulated financial sectors made misdirected international investment possible, The ratio of foreign denominated liabilities to reserves is the best vulnerability indicator, yet the crisis was unanticipated: information was deficient bur nor all available information had been used. For capital inflows to be sustainable they must be stable and must be invested efficiently in tradeable sectors. These conditions were not mel in Southeast Asia.

TI The "human carrying capacity". Is it a viable concept when assessing the
   land use sustainability?
SO INTERCIENCIA

ID MANAGEMENT; POPULATION; SYSTEMS; AREAS
AB In the wide process of Environmental Planning and Management, particularly in the context of Land Use Planning, it has become increasingly necessary to define and value in a clear manner the complex nature of Land Use Sustainability. To tackle such an issue, a number of theoretical and methodological proposals have emerged, e.g. "Human Carrying Capacity" -H.C.C.-, as a concept integrating the different dimensions involved in Sustainable Land Use.
   The above proposal has and will continue to stir a number of controversies, both in the scientific areas (natural and social), and in the applied-theoretical fields associated with Environmental Planning. This has given rise to the need for assessing, in a very careful and methodical manner, the concept of "Human Carrying Capacity" a subject discussed in detail in the present paper.
   Such insight implies, firstly, a synthesis of the evolution of the concept, followed by developing a critical comparison of a set of fairly new models to estimate "Human Carrying Capacity".
   Likewise, an outline is given of the theoretical elements that make up the structural basis of the proposed Classification Scheme. The idea is to break down into groups the approaches discussed and organize our knowledge of "Human Carrying Capacity" concept in a more refined fashion.
   After arranging the different approaches assessed, five studies of particular cases are discussed. These were selected according to criteria considered to be significant for assessing the "Human Carrying Capacity" concept:
   The Fearnside Stochastic Model The Brazilian Amazonas Case (1985).
   The Moore ct al., Geographical Model.
   The Senegal Case. (1994).
   The Cao, Shijun and Nan Model. The China Case (1995)
   The Kessler Model, for the Sahel Region (1994).
   The Cohen Model, for the Earth's Human Carrying Capacity 1995).
   Starting from the comparative analysis of the different theoretical models land in line with the equivocalness in the underlying concept), It is possible to begin to identify the fundamental elements needed to assess "Human Carrying Capacity", as well as the scope of application of this concept, within the context of Environmental Planning and Sustainable Land Use.

ID FORESTS
AB Scientific research and rescue of traditional knowledge represent an important component of Biosphere Reserves of UNESCO's MAB Programme. The World Network of Biosphere Reserves functions as support and experimental field to both, basic and applied research to sustainable management of natural resources, and to themes of local, regional, national and international interest. Biosphere Reserves hold important scientific information that is currently used in their implementation and management, and exchanged with other reserves of the World Network or with similarly-managed protected ar eas. The role that scientific research plays in Biosphere Reserves has been presented in this work taking Peru and its three Biosphere Reserves: Huascaran, Noroeste and Manu, as a practical example. The former stands out for its long and qualified scientific production, which may be one of the most important among Biosphere Reserves in tropical rainforests. Regarding Biosphere Reserves in Peru, the need of higher dissemination of produced knowledge and its use in its own reserves management, has been identified. It is recommended to follow-up basic studies, to carry out a higher number of applied investigations and monitoring studies, and to associate research to young scientist training, taking advantage of the diversify of landscapes revered by Peruvian Biosphere Reserves.

TI Globalisation and capital flows: Some policy lessons for small countries
SO INTERNASJONAL POLITIKK
LA Norwegian
DT Article
AB The recent financial and economic crises in Asia and Latin America suggest that the combination of a fixed exchange rate policy and free capital mobility could be dangerous for small countries. There are many recent examples of speculative attacks on fixed exchange rates, even in Europe. Such attacks are hard to resist due to self-fulfilling expectations. The lesson to be learned is that some capital controls are necessary to support a fixed exchange rate. Countries outside the European Monetary Union (like Norway) appear to have no other choice than a flexible exchange rate. In the policy debate, globalisation is sometimes used as an excuse for not reducing structural unemployment, dampening business cycles and promoting sustainable economic growth. It is often taken for granted that national economic policies do not work anymore, but this is not consistent with recent macroeconomic research. On the contrary, appropriate national economic policies are essential for reducing excessive structural unemployment, generating low inflation and financial stability, and stimulating long-run growth.

AB The last decade has seen a great increase in innovative improvements of lactic acid bacteria used in industrial food fermentations. In order to allow the genetically modified lactic acid bacteria to reach the market place, their novel genetic combinations should be selected, stably maintained, and expressed using food-grade systems that are safe, stable, and sustainable. This paper aims to review the food-grade systems that have been constructed with specific attention for self cloning approaches, and focuses on recent developments on food-grade selection markers, chromosome inactivation, stabilization, and amplification strategies, as well as approaches for controlled gene expression.

DE sustainable agriculture; integrated production systems; grazing systems
AB During the past 10-15 years, sustainable agriculture has progressed from a focus primarily on a low-input, organic farming approach with a major emphasis on small fruit or vegetable production farms, often described as Low Input Sustainable Agriculture, to the current situation where sustainability is an important part of mainstream animal and plant production units. The US Department of Agriculture programmes cover a broad range of activities, including conserving the natural resource base, enhancing environmental duality, and sustaining productivity of the nation's farms. The use of Geographic Information Systems technology to direct application of fertilisers, pesticides, and herbicides is one example of a rapidly emerging technology that can reduce use of external inputs, protect the agricultural environment, and improve economic returns. This Geographic Information Systems technology also is being used to localise animal pest and disease problems, assist in regulatory or control measures, and identify high risk areas that might need different management systems or should be avoided as sites for animal production. Use of intensive grazing systems also has increased markedly over the past 5-6 years. These systems will allow longer grazing seasons in southern parts of the USA, provide more efficient use of the forages being produced and reduce labour costs in the typical dairy operation. Major animal and plant production agriculture-oriented programmes at the US Department of Agriculture focus on integrated production systems, use of Integrated Pest Management techniques, and development of alternative methods to manage pests and diseases that reduce or avoid the use of drugs and chemicals. The US Department of Agriculture has a programme for sustainable agriculture, the Sustainable Agriculture Research and Education programme, which emphasises alternative approaches for animal and plant production systems. 1998 Australian Society for Parasitology, Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB Future agricultural and rural development is, to a large extent, influenced by the projected food needs of 2.5 billion people expected to swell the world population by 2020. This increase will require more food in general and, in view of recent experience in East Asia, more animal products. To achieve this increase will require judicious use of resources, and trade, especially in those countries where natural resources are insufficient to support food production. Achieving food sufficiency in a sustainable manner is a major challenge for farmers, agro-industries, researchers and governments. The latter play an important role as many of the farmers' choices are, to a large extent, directed by government or supra-government, often through macro- and micro-economic policy. In many countries the economic, environmental, trade and agricultural policies have not been conducive to an agricultural development that is risk-free with respect to the environment, animal welfare or public health. The recent decline of government support in agriculture forced farmers in Western countries to think about more risk adverse agricultural practices and more efficient production systems. On the other hand, many countries in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, as well as other developing countries, are still going through a painful process of adjustment to new market conditions. International banks and development agencies have a mandate to help developing countries; but are somewhat restricted both by needing to work directly with governments and by their perceived dogmatic approach to development. Changing policies do, now and in the future, also affect the development of animal disease control programmes, including the control of parasitic diseases. On the one hand there is an increasing interest in risk-free control practices, and on the other hand a demand for greater regulatory control over the production process. As parasitic diseases of animals are closely linked to the environment (i.e. grazing and waste management) and public health (i.e, parasitic zoonoses),the new interest in sustainable agriculture provides a challenge for those concerned with the control and prevention of animal parasitism.

AB The control of arthropod ectoparasites of livestock by systemically delivered chemicals was introduced in the 1950s. Their low cost, ease of use, and high level of efficacy ensured dependence upon them for ectoparasite control. However, current societal anti scientific concerns regarding dependency upon chemicals have emphasised the need for the evaluation of environmentally safe alternatives for ectoparasite control. Immunological intervention for the control of ectoparasite populations, either through the selection of animals with resistant genotypes or vaccination, is consistent with principles of sustainable agriculture. Unlike the activity of chemicals, currently available ectoparasite vaccines do not induce a rapid knockdown of the parasite population and they do not protect the individual from parasitism. However, if these vaccines are used in an integrated pest-management programme, they have the potential to reduce parasite populations over successive generations and reduce or eliminate the need for chemical application. 1998 Australian Society for Parasitology.

AB There is no single requirement more crucial to the rational and sustainable control of helminth parasites in grazing animals than a comprehensive knowledge of the epidemiology of the parasite as it interacts with the host in a specific climatic, management and production environment. In its absence, anthelmintic treatment is either given suppressively, which provokes resistance, or therapeutically, which risks clinical disease and production losses. Sustainable parasite-control programmes require knowledge of seasonal larval availability, origin of larvae contributing to any peaks and climatic requirements for worm egg hatching, larval development and survival. Control measures based on this knowledge include strategic anthelmintic treatments and various forms of grazing management. While these measures can reduce the frequency of anthelmintic treatment required, their effect on selection for drench resistance is more problematical, unless they can be combined with other forms of control to reduce our current dependence on anthelmintics.

AB Livestock production systems throughout the world are under severe and sustained pressures. These are diverse and multi-factorial, ranging from the need to redress the oversupply of livestock commodities from the protected industries of the industrialised world, meeting animal welfare expectations, attempts to ease animal-induced land degradation and pollution, and competition with alternative products. As a consequence. funding for research to the ruminant livestock industries has been contracting universally. This applies particularly to research on those diseases of grazing livestock that are not zoonotic, threats to trade, or major "killer" diseases. Gastrointestinal helminths fall outside these priorities. The last decade has witnessed a major contraction throughout the world in the number of research centres and staff involved in applied veterinary parasitology research. This coincides with a time when these livestock industries need the most help. Resistance to anthelmintic drugs amongst the major nematode parasites of sheep and goats has now reached alarming proportions throughout the world and threatens the future viability of continued small ruminant production in many countries. Anthelmintic resistance is also increasing in the important nematode parasites of cattle. Also, this time coincides with the apparent reduction in the discovery and development of entirely new anthelmintic products by the pharmaceutical industry. As a consequence, those remaining researchers and extension personnel who have the responsibility of providing support to the ruminant livestock industry, are showing innovation and lateral thinking in ways to combat the perennial problem of internal parasites in grazing livestock. There are a number of excellent examples of parasite-control schemes, which do not rely entirely on anthelmintic treatment. These are now being supplemented with some exciting novel approaches to dealing with particularly pressing parasite problems. Also there is a move towards the development of true integrated approaches in the control of nematode parasites of livestock, which employ several of these methods when appropriate. This proves that as Ear as worm control in livestock is concerned, the old adage "necessity is the mother of invention", holds true. (C) 1998 Australian Society for Parasitology.

DE energy planning; multiobjective programming; rural areas
AB Rural energy planning is characterized by matching, as far as possible, the available local energy supply with various energy end-uses. For this matching, decision-makers have to consider several issues, such as cost, technology, sustainability and equity. These objectives are conflicting and, therefore, it is difficult to find an optimized solution. Therefore, such problems should be analysed by an alternative method, such as multiobjective programming, by which more than one objective can be analysed simultaneously. This paper reviews rural energy planning and illustrates the use of a multiobjective method in rural energy analysis. The method is applied to study energy problem of a rural area in Nepal. The preliminary results, which can be taken as a guideline in the formulation of energy policy, are also presented.

AB This paper addresses two related conceptual and practical challenges in assessing sustainability. The first involves the social context, specifically the criteria and procedures to be used. The second involves the spatial context, specifically the problem of assessing sustainability when there are multiple and overlapping 'communities' with multiple economic and ecological scales. With respect to the first issue, we build on previous contributions in discussing how multicriteria assessment strategies and stakeholder processes might be used. We also illustrate the use of various non-monetary measures of ecological capacity and performance to supplement economic information. The second issue remains less well understood, though our analysis highlights how economic and ecological capacity and performance measures can be applied at various scales.

AB Long-term preservation of forest ecosystems and resources is a major stake for sustainable development. An accurate assessment of these ecosystems and resources is necessary for defining, implementing and monitoring sustainable forestry management policies. The question of designing forestry indicators is situated in this context. This paper does not aim to give a thorough description of the question: its purposes are to present some questions and difficulties that arise when constructing such indicators and to discuss some points about environmental appraisal on the basis of the forestry example.

AB This paper calls the reader's attention to the extent to which the advancement of sustainable development depends on industry's technology development ability and on the important role assigned to governments by environmental law and policy as brokers of industrial information. It argues that the provision of indiscriminate, unrestricted access to information may hinder industry's ability to contribute to the future of sustainable development. Rather than advocating restriction of the public's right to access, the paper proposes the need to review the manner in which the government's role is carried out in the light of its potential negative impact on environmentally oriented technology development.

ID EXPLORING ENVIRONMENTAL VALUES
AB Integrated assessment (IA) is emerging as an approach that is suitable for accommodating the uncertainties and complexities of issues such as climate change, sustainability and lifestyles. With the aim of exploring participatory methodologies within the context of IA, a number of in-depth groups have been conducted in Venice, as part of an EC-funded project called ULYSSES (Urban Lifestyles, Sustainability and Integrated Environmental Assessment). This paper focuses on how technical issues were conveyed to a lay audience through the use of information and communication technology (ICT), namely integrated assessment models. The issues of urban lifestyles and sustainability, particularly in relation to climate change, formed the focus of discussion, the use of ICT being explored during the sessions. We illustrate our major findings with quotations from the participants of the in-depth groups, concluding with specifications for new interactive modelling tools to be used in the context of participatory processes.

DE citizen participation; governance; integrated assessment; sustainable
   development
AB Citizen or community participation is a guiding principle for environmental decision-making, but in practice it is often compromised and contradictory. Two themes in participation can be defined. One is in the 'product' or outcome of decision-making, and aims for more effective and appropriate evaluations and decisions. The other is participation in the 'process', where devolved decision-making itself can serve wider social and economic goals. Although both strands are crucial for the practice of 'integrated assessment' in environmental governance, a clearer view is needed of the scope and limits of such participation. This paper explores such scope and limits by applying a conceptual 'integrated assessment' framework. This is drawn from a major case study on sustainable development for a city-region in the north of the UK. Such a framework helps to identify the many roles of citizen participation from a complex systems perspective. Selected examples of current practice highlight the problems and opportunities for citizen participation in environmental governance.

AB Integrated assessment (IA) is a maturing research approach aiming at providing decision support on complex. environment-related problems. Although interdisciplinary research is a pre-condition for IA, in order to reach the goals that IA has set it is necessary to go beyond interdisciplinary research efforts alone. There are two major reasons for this: (i) the nature of democratic decision-making, and (ii) the nature of complex issues.
   The views held by stakeholders and the public at large are an integral part of democratic decision-making processes. Integrated assessments, which aim to support decision-making in an appropriate and relevant way, should therefore synthesize interdisciplinary scientific insights with a wide variety of societal views. Furthermore, this paper argues that the sustainability issues with which IA is concerned are complex problems, in the sense that they cannot be fully described or solved in any unique way. One of the reasons for this is the essentially contested character of the concept 'sustainable development'. Against this background the search for techniques of articulation and interaction of multiple perspectives is a major challenge for the IA community.
   Where the nature of democratic processes asks for taking into account views of a diversity of actors, the nature of the issues considered demands that multiple perspectives are included in integrated assessments. Decision support building on a single scientific description is therefore not at all sufficient for addressing complex problems in a democratic decision-making context. To this end, this paper argues that it seems promising to develop techniques that combine scientific assessment tools with public participation methods. In order to contribute to the search for such new IA techniques, this paper discusses some new avenues in IA modelling, and the application of a well-established social scientific tool, namely focus groups, in integrated assessment.

AB The aim of this paper is to assess the adaptation costs associated with the transition to a sustainable development path, taking the example of carbon dioxide emissions in the French economy. The model used is based on systems dynamics modelling and energy input-output analysis. This type of approach has the interesting property of precisely defining the nature of interactions between the different economic sectors, and between the economic sectors and the environment. This provides a framework within which to test different types of economic, technology and environment policy. In effect, according to our interests, it is necessary to measure problems of resources allocation or sequential choices between different alternatives: why and how a particular solution comes to be selected from a multiplicity of alternatives. First, we characterize the methodological and conceptual specification of the model. Secondly, we locate specific properties of the model linked with both ecological sustainability and economic feasability constraints. Thirdly, a sensitivity test is applied concerning different control policy scenarios for the case of carbon dioxide emissions in the French economy.

ID COMPRESSIVE FAILURE; NOTCHED COMPOSITES; GEOMETRY; CRACK
AB The paper is concerned with the formulation of size effect relations associated with the effect of a blunt stress concentration on the failure of a quasi-brittle material, where the failure can be modelled in terms of a two-dimensional embedded blunt flaw within an infinite solid, or a blunt flaw in the surface of a semi-infinite solid. In order to obtain analytical results so that the role of material and geometrical parameters in the size effect relations can be clearly seen, the paper is primarily based on an idealised cohesive zone description of material failure, and on Mode III analyses, though some consideration is given to the practically more appropriate Mode I situation. The size effect relations are expressed in terms of relations between the maximum sustainable effective peak stress at the flaw root or an effective stress intensity, and material and geometrical parameters of the flaw. If the flaw is sufficiently large, the geometry effect simplifies to the effect of the flaw root radius.

DT Article
DE Hong Kong; health care financing; tax-based health care system
AB With the new government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region currently conducting a review of Hong Kong's health care financing system, this article argues that the existing tax-based system not only works well at present, but is also sustainable in the future. The performance of the system is analysed in terms of cost, health outcomes and access. The arguments for change are discussed, and the case for maintaining the status quo is presented. The author concludes that the way forward would be to fine tune the existing system rather than to replace it with other systems which are known to have higher transaction costs and more serious supply-side moral hazards.

ID MANUFACTURING-INDUSTRY
AB Continuous improvement (CI) programmes have been recognised as one way of contributing to the productivity and efficiency within the manufacturing setting. However, the development of a sustainable Cf programme has proved more problematic and in some cases fails to proceed any further than one-off improvement activities. The research presented here illustrates the utility of Bessant and Caffyn's framework for the development of CI capability, by assessing the structure of CI within one case study organisation. The structure of the Cf Programme and examples of Cf activities provide evidence of the link to top down strategic business targets. The discussion suggests that the organisation has moved to a "goal oriented CI" where there is formal deployment of strategic goals through the structure of the CI activities and the relationship with business activities. Practical and theoretical implications of using this framework are considered.

AB Aquatic sediments in industrial regions are often polluted by heavy metals. When removed by dredging, the sediments become an environmental risk. Because of the high costs and the deficient sustainability of landfill disposal, we intend to develop a remediation process for cleaning heavy metal-contaminated sediments by solid-bed bioleaching. Unfortunately, freshly dredged sediments are often impermeable to water. Therefore, they have to be conditioned to improve their hydrodynamic properties and make them suitable for solid-bed leaching. The treatment basin of 5.9 m x 7.5 m of a pilot-scale plant for sediment conditioning was filled with 0.5 m freshly dredged sediment, which originated from a trap in the Weisse Elster River near Leipzig, Germany, and was contaminated with Zn, Cr, Pb, Cu, Ni, and Cd. The sediment was planted with the helophytes Phragmites australis, Phalaris arundinacea, and Agrostis stolonifera. The vegetation evaporated large amounts of water and transported oxygen into the sediment. During conditioning the anoxic, black, muddy-pasty sediment changed to the oxic state and turned into a grayish brown, crumbly, soil-like material. Furthermore, the sediment turned acidic, its buffer capacity decreased, and, because of pore and particle enlargements, it became easily permeable to water. The plants on the sediment incorporated heavy metals in their biomass, especially Zn, Ni, Cd, and Co, but not enough for sediment remediation by phytoextraction.

AB Technological innovation is now widely acknowledged as a key element in a firm's success, but in the competitive global marketplace of the late twentieth century, the circumstances for technological innovation have changed, In this paper we consider the combined impact of two trends that have changed the character of innovative activities: globalization and sustainability. We note a shift from introspective and proprietary solutions to externally focused, 'open' collaborations, frequently with firms of much different culture. This paper uses a case study of Canadian and Korean firms to highlight some of the behavioural factors that affect technological collaboration between firms in such circumstances. The paper concludes with examples of measures organizations can take to prepare themselves for collaboration.

ID SUSTAINED COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE; RESOURCES; CULTURE
AB Building on the resource-based view of the firm, an intellectual capital framework is suggested to identify and measure important resources that may provide the firm sustainable competitive advantage. The difficulty of measuring and managing the elements of intellectual capital is a result of management's inherent tendency towards over-dependence on financial measures of performance. Typically, however, the intellectual capital assets of the firm are intangible and not easily amenable to financial measures as benchmarks. In attempting to operationalize the concept, the paper begins by developing an integrative taxonomy of intellectual capital based on recent literature. Each element of intellectual capital is then further developed by examining the various types of intangible assets that embody it. Using a software firm as an example, potential quantitative and qualitative indicators of the stock of intellectual capital within the firm are given. Direction towards measuring flows as indicators of intellectual capital strength is discussed.

AB Business is experiencing an ongoing fundamental shift in the competitive environment, which highlights the need for knowledge development and the interdependence between users and producers including universities, government, and society. This interdependence is specifically accentuated by the transfer of intellectual property from universities to corporations that are intent on developing sustainable competitive strategies. This paper presents a conceptual framework and research questions and the results of an exploratory study, which focused upon the interaction between pivotal universities and business in a society-government context. Among other findings, the paper concludes that the economic and contractual imperatives of business may not conform to the traditional research, instructional, and service roles of universities. The implications of the study findings for business and university interactions are discussed.

AB Traditional competitiveness factors cannot provide a sustainable advantage in a highly dynamic, knowledge-driven global marketplace. This paper presents two models that describe evolving competition in technology-intensive industries and offer insight into the sources of long-term market leadership. The first model represents the value of technology-based products and services in terms of three orthogonal dimensions: their commodity content, and their embodiment of tacit and explicit knowledge. The second model identifies three sources of sustainable advantage over time: increasing rates of innovation, maximizing the appropriability of returns from R&D, and the absorption and accumulation of valuable knowledge assets. These three elements form a self-reinforcing "competitiveness cycle" that is driven by increasing returns from knowledge-based products. The two models are subsequently merged into an integrated framework that identifies tacit knowledge as an essential source of sustainable competitive advantage, and provides guidance to firms in the formation of tacit-knowledge-enhancing strategies. A survey of the current knowledge-management literature and several case examples are mapped into the framework to demonstrate its effectiveness.

AB Modern technologies have a profound impact on society in the current age of global competition. Yet, we do not understand the long-term impact of proliferation of technology on society's long-term sustainability. This paper presents one perspective of how the evolution of technology has (1) brought about mixed results, some of which need to be reconsidered given that the environmental well is not bottomless and (2) outdistanced the economic and political systems, putting in question who is in the driver's seat in key decision-making processes. We argue that the locus of control in the New World order needs to ensure long-term 'sustainability' as opposed to short-term 'economization'.

AB To achieve sustainable development there is a need for policies to make the economic-ecological relationship a more positive coupling. This paper concentrates on the part that innovation may play in helping to achieve sustainability. The paper examines the sources of variability in firm innovation and size, regulation and sector are identified as key variables. Using survey data the stimuli and the type of environmental improvements that companies have made are explored. The results indicate that large, permit-based regulation and leading sector companies are nearly twice as likely as other companies to have made environmental improvements.

AB Many lakeside Phragmites australis reeds are frequently harvested or burnt in winter for several purposes like extraction of raw material, natural preservation or facilitation of professional fishing or fish breeding. The question is, whether these practices support a sustainable development of the reeds. Data from a long term monitoring program at Lake Constance (Germany) demonstrate that culm morphology, stand structure and aboveground peak biomass are strongly influenced by the treatment. Winter harvested and burnt reeds exhibited higher culm densities (+76% of the untreated controls), and a higher peak biomass (+13%). The mean culm height was reduced by -13%. The percentage of insect infested shoots was 8.8% of the total shoot population compared with 20.1% of the untreated controls. Consecutive harvesting treatments intensified these effects. In the first two years after the treatment had stopped the reed stands showed an 'overshoot' biomass production, and a strong trend towards the features of the untreated controls. The possible mechanisms (mechanical damage, frost kill of the growth tips and breaking of the apical dominance) are discussed. It is concluded that winter harvesting and burning treatments make the reeds more susceptible against some environmental hazards, and should therefore applied with precaution on the basis of a close examination of risks and benefits.

AB The demand for low residual iron sources to feed electric are furnaces producing high end carbon steels can be met by DRI and pig iron quite straightforwardly. The need for steel recycling, energy savings, and lower greenhouse gas emissions requires, however, that the scrap resource be tapped even more effectively than is done today. The quantity of obsolete scrap should continue to increase, due to past economic activity and to an increased collecting rate, and the tools have been developed to ensure that the various materials and steels grades mixed in manufactured goods can be unmixed and segregated in such a way that a sustainable recycling can be maintained in the longterm;this involves responsible management of the scrap resource, through compliance with quality standards, scrap pretreatment, scrap property measurement and control in steel shops, and the proper expression of the true needs of the steel industry in terms of tramp element purity.

AB In savanna and tropical monsoon areas where the dry and rainy seasons can be clearly distinguished, it is important for farmers to secure as much irrigation water as possible in the dry season in order to produce fruits and vegetables. Though the Department of Land Development, Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives, Thailand recommends that farmers excavate small farm ponds for the purpose mentioned above, the irrigation water stored in the farm ponds in the rainy season is not effectively used in the dry season because of evaporation from the surface of water and percolation from the bottom and lateral parts of the ponds. Therefore, the authors developed methods to control the evaporation and percolation in small farm ponds. They selected 4 methods mentioned below, based on the results of experiments carried out in the eastern region of Thailand by Kobayashi. They developed low cost and sustainable methods which farmers can apply themselves as follows: (1) Covering the surface of water with floating materials. (2) Management of irrigation water using several ponds. (3) Changes in the pond shape. (4) Compaction of the bottom of the pond after crushing. The authors confirmed the effectiveness of the 4 methods through field experiments and model calculations.

AB The mechanism of infection by Vibrio sp. P11 promoting the ice-ice disease in Kappaphycus alvarezii was investigated in vitro. Its intensity of infection differs from that of another ice-ice promoter (Cytophaga sp. P25) by promoting the disease much faster. However, when secondary infection by other bacteria starts, its ability to compete with these bacteria gradually diminishes, whereas, infection by P25, although not displaying such drastic effects as P11, shows consistent competitive ability against other bacteria. Time-series infection experiments with application of polyclonal antibodies to specifically detect Vibrio sp. P11 revealed that this bacterium has a high affinity for the seaweed especially when the latter is stressed. It promotes the disease after a rapid increase in cell density of up to 10(7) g(-1) (wet wt.) in the first 24 h. This bacterial cell build-up may take only 1-2 h on stressed thalli, but takes about 24 h on non-stressed thalli. Build-up is not sustainable in non-stressed thalli as high density is usually followed by a sudden decline in cell number believed to result from an algal defence against potential pathogens. Inoculation of the bacterium on thalli incubated in continuous culture system extends the time of bacterial attachment due to laminar flow and, possibly, competition by existing bacteria on the seaweed surface and in ambient seawater medium. Motility-driven cell attachment by this bacterium is suggested as an important factor for infection.

AB A linear model that couples an ocean mixed layer with a simple dynamic atmosphere is used to study the mechanism for decadal variability over the tropical Atlantic. An unstable mode with a dipole sea surface temperature (SST) pattern similar to observed decadal variability in the tropical Atlantic emerges in the time integration of the model. A wind-evaporation-SST feedback is responsible For the growth and oscillation of the unstable mode whereas the mean state of the Atlantic climate is essential For maintaining the spatially quasi-standing dipole structure. The oscillation period ranges from several to a few tens of years and is sensitive to coupling strength.
   The oscillation is not self-sustainable as the realistic damping rate exceeds the growth rate. In response to white noise forcing, the model produces a red SST spectrum without a peak at finite frequencies. Therefore it is suggested that the tropical dipole's preferred timescales, if any, arise from the forcing by or interaction with the extratropics. In a model run where the forcing is confined to the extratropics, a dipole SST pattern still dominates the forcing-free Tropics, in support of the proposed linkage between the Tropics and extratropics.

AB 1 Shade-tolerant angiosperm trees are reported to require relatively fertile soils in temperate forests. We explored the possibility that high foliage allocation in shade-tolerant species could result in higher whole-plant nitrogen demands than in light-demanding trees of comparable diameters. We measured foliage mass and area, leaf life span, and nitrogen (N) content of fresh foliage and leaf litter for juveniles of 11 evergreen angiosperms in a Chilean temperate rain forest. This permitted estimation of annual nitrogen losses in leaf litter fall by individuals of a given diameter.
   2 Leaf life spans were longest in shade-tolerant species. The highest leaf N levels were found in small short-lived early successional trees, whereas among longer-lived species there was no general relationship of leaf N with shade tolerance level. Shade-tolerant species had lower N resorption efficiencies, and therefore higher leaf litter N concentrations on an area basis, than light-demanding associates.
   3 Foliage mass, foliage area and total crown N pool were strongly positively related to shade tolerance level.
   4 Interspecific variation in annual N losses in leaf litter fall was more closely related to foliage area (R(2) = 0.52) than to N concentration of leaf litter (R(2) = 0.31) or leaf lifetimes (R(2) = 0.01). Although the short-lived early successional species Embothrium coccineum had the highest annual crown N losses of the 11 species, shade-tolerant species had higher annual losses than light-demanding overstorey dominants of comparable longevities.
   5 The results are consistent with the proposal that the costs of obtaining enough N for crown maintenance and expansion may constrain the fitness of shade-tolerant angiosperm trees in late successional stages on infertile sites, when soil nutrient availability is reduced by increased uptake and sequestration in biomass and litter. On the other hand, high N loss rates may be more sustainable for short-lived early colonists that complete their life cycles in the initial stages of secondary succession, when nutrient availabilities are often relatively high.

AB We focus on the effects of deforestation for agricultural purposes on biodiversity. This topic has been dealt with in the recent literature where "forested land" and "biodiversity" are treated as synonyms. In contrast to that, this paper distinguishes between "forested land" and "forest" itself, the latter being interpreted as a measure of biodiversity. The regenerative capacity of forests is modeled as a function of the own stock and of the habitat size. In particular, the threat of a given minimum viable population to be achieved in the course of the reduction of habitats is taken into account. The corresponding structure of a sustainability indicator is elaborated.

SO JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN PUBLIC POLICY

DE development; environment; growth; social model; unemployment; wages
AB The European Union is pursuing a competitive and sustainable development model that combines insights from environmental as well as economic analysis. The rhetoric of this model is attractive: European development should be 'sustainable' both in terms of its use of labour and environmental resources, and in terms of the location of economic activity. European policy, therefore, should encourage industries to use more labour and fewer resources, as well as to create jobs at the local level in order to internalize market externalities. Despite the appeal of such rhetoric, the implementation of this new development model poses both analytical and distributional concerns: the assumptions of environmental and economic analysis come into theoretical contradiction and the economic effects of the policy are socially undesirable. The solution is to abandon the competitive and sustainable development model, and to pursue competitive growth and sustainable resource use as separate policy objectives.

TI Dilemmas in managing the expanding EU: the EU and applicant states'
   points of view
SO JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN PUBLIC POLICY
LA English
DT Article
DE CEEC; enlargement; European Union (EU); managing supranational states
AB In this article, certain problems and dilemmas in the search for a system of managing the European Union (EU) are presented with respect to the problems and dilemmas in identifying one model of regulation(1) that would fit a variety of entities creating a common supranational economic and political system. Based on certain historical lessons from multinational states, it is argued that there are many important factors involved in the creation of a viable and sustainable supranational model of regulation. They include a comparable level of wealth of the socio-political units involved, the democratic principles used in that model, the creation of supranational social integration, the democratic political culture of the political elites in the socio-political units involved and the preconditions for viable elements of consociate democracy. Whereas within the EU a rational approach to the question of managing the deepening and expanding EU has only started to gain in importance as an internal, domestic issue (especially focusing on the homogeneity of the socio-political units involved with regard to their economies and levels of welfare, the fulfilment of political criteria and the acceptance of acquis), the applicant states seem to be focusing mainly on integration as an international relations issue in becoming part of the EU, which is itself growing as an economic and political world power.

AB Extinction of four deepwater ciscoe species (Coregonus spp.) in the Great Lakes occurred during a period of heavy exploitation, but during the same period there were several introduced and invading species and there also was widespread deterioration in the quality of the environment. The cause of the extinctions is uncertain, but extinction is a threat in multiple species fisheries harvested with a common gear. The possibility that the ciscoe extinctions resulted from harvesting was investigated using a general form of the surplus production model and computer simulation. In the simulations extinctions occurred even with a moderate fishing effort when a large number of different species were caught with the same gear. In the Great Lakes 4 out of 8 ciscoe species caught with the same gear apparently went extinct. In the simulations 4 extinctions out of 8 species was a common event, and the fishery alone was all that was necessary to cause the extinctions.

AB Sustainable management of economically important squid requires monitoring of changes in their abundance, which are related inter alia, to their success in the food chain. The highest mortality is expected in the paralarval stages, which are prone to starvation. Causes of starvation may be linked to the lack of suitable prey. A multiple detection system was developed for the simultaneous identification of five putative zooplankton prey in the guts of paralarval Chokka squid, Loligo vulgaris reynaudii, by employing polyclonal rabbit antisera in conjunction with solid phase immunoassays. Specificities of antisera were validated by ELISA screening against different zooplankton taxa. Cross-reactions observed with ELISA were minimized through manipulation of antibody and antigen concentrations resulting in more specific detection of target prey antigens when used in an immunodot assay. Application of this optimised immunoassay detected multiple predation in paralarval squid samples collected from diverse areas in the Agulhas Bank ecosystem on the south coast of South Africa.

AB This study seeks to ascertain the use in Ethiopia in 1997 of CD-ROM databases. Analysis of data recorded in 15 questionnaires (responses were obtained from 89% of libraries believed to use CD-ROMs) on the use of CD-ROM products indicated that academic libraries in Ethiopia use CD-ROM databases to a greater degree than other types of library responding to the survey (47% academic, 27% research and development, 27% non-government). Medline was the main CD-ROM product used. It was available in 40% of the libraries. Funding for CD-ROM services has been haphazard and is often based on projects and donations. Now, the issue of sustainability is crucial. In addition to input from the Government, long-lasting project preparation, integration of CD-ROMs into existing library budgets, cooperative subscriptions to databases and the sharing of CD-ROM data in a networked environment are recommended.

AB This study examines the spatial distribution of outdoor recreation sites and their proximity to census block groups (CBGs), in order to determine potential socioeconomic inequities. It is framed within the context of environmental justice. Information from the Southern Appalachian Assessment database was applied to a case study of the Chattahoochee National Forest in North Georgia. Outdoor recreation sites (campgrounds, wilderness areas, good/poor fisheries habitat, and overcrowded recreation sites) were mapped using geographic information systems. All CBGs (n = 200) contained by, and within 1500 meters (approximately one mile), of the Chattahoochee National Forest were identified and characterized by four socioeconomic variables (race, household income, heritage, and occupation). Logit analysis was conducted to determine the spatial relationships between outdoor recreation sites and CBG variables. Results show that household income was the only significant predictor (p < .05) of proximity to outdoor recreation sites. CBGs with a higher proportion of lower income households were significantly more likely to be situated within 1500 meters of a wilderness area, campground, and/or good fisheries habitat than CBGs with higher incomes. Implications for identifying recreation as a locally desirable or undesirable land-use, applying benefits-based management, and considering sustainable community development in national forest management are addressed.

SO JOURNAL OF NETWORK AND COMPUTER APPLICATIONS

DT Article
AB On-line media and self-directed learning environments are among the most effective training solutions in terms of cost, time and logistics. In the last few years, the percentage of employees participating in training courses has increased. At the same time, there has been a decline of training budgets. Therefore, careful educational controlling must guard direct and indirect costs listed by amount, mode and source. Additionally, the success of on-line courses must be measured in terms of training and functional sectors. Most educational departments generally use controlling processes which consist of consecutive phases. Modern economic controlling, however, focuses on the permanent improvement of process outcomes. Recent examples of Web-based training courses and on-line tools illustrate how continuous feed forward and feed backward loops may be implemented in on-line learning. Controlling the transition from learning to working and checking the sustainability of learning outcomes improves the quality and success of training and makes it possible to calculate the success of training applications. Thus, modem educational controlling approaches should be introduced which comprise exact calculation of financial investments and gains, optimal planning of organisational processes and goal-oriented definitions of strategical and operational learning objectives. Web-based training will then allow the educational and IT staff to take over a strategical role to establish an innovative learning and working culture. (C) 1999 Academic Press.

The new interest is measured by the growing number of professional presentations, journal articles boob and conferences devoted to the subject. A consensus is emerging on the principal elements of a spirituality for working people. It includes acknowledging God, fire importance of prayer, other people and a sustainable world Some managers and firms encourage spirituality in the workplace. Many religiously-orientated universities are integrating mission, spirituality and service in their education.

   socio-economic explanation
SO JOURNAL OF ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGE MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
DE belief; self-development; society; sell-esteem; values; organizational
   change
AB Interest in spirituality in business has been growing recently. This paper tries to explain such growth of interest through the application of Maslow's hierarchy of needs to the social level. As the industrial revolution evolved, economic prosperity and stability spread to a majority of people in developed countries. These societies as a whole were then able to shift from concerns primarily about survival and security to concerns of higher order needs, such as social, esteem, and self-actualization needs. As people throughout a society are increasingly able to trust that their lower needs will be met, they increasingly and naturally begin to explore their higher order needs. This can explain many recent phenomena in business, such as workers seeking more than money from work increasing empowerment and participation, and the many recent books, conferences, and practices about spirituality, sustainability, and other such issues as they relate to business.

AB Sustainable cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) production will require systems that maintain or augment yields without degrading the soil. Our study was undertaken to determine profitability and fertilizer N rate optimization associated with winter cover management in no-tillage cotton. This study was conducted beginning the fall of 1988 and continued through the 1992 growing season in a producer's field on a Caledonia loam (fine, loamy, siliceous, thermic, Typic Paleudalfs) soil with 0 to 2% slope. Winter cover treatments were fallow, rye (Secale cereale L.), and hairy vetch (Vicia villosa Roth), each combined with 0, 45, 90, and 135 lb N/acre. Profit maximizing N rates as influenced by varying fertilizer N and Lint prices ranged from 81 to 94 lb/acre for winter fallow, 105 to 117 lb/acre for rye, and 54 to 68 lb/acre for hairy vetch. Lint yield at the profit-maximizing N rate varied only slightly in response to changes in fertilizer N and lint prices for each winter cover treatment. Both cover crop systems were found to be more profitable at all fertilizer N and lint prices, with rye averaging $24 to $44/acre and hairy vetch $33 to $51/acre greater returns than for winter fallow. Marginal profitability of rye compared with winter fallow was greatest at a fertilizer N-to-lint price ratio of 0.125, while for vetch it was at 0.375. Inclusion of cover crops in no-tillage cotton production systems can result in greater profitability as a result of increased lint yield and in the case of the legume lower fertilizer N inputs, but yearly variability in yield as well as profit may increase.

AB Despite large efforts to generate and extend management innovations for rangeland operators, little is known about the degree to which practices are used. We determined what influenced use of 26 management practices among 340 permittees using data from a mailed survey. Five, co-dominant socioeconomic groups of permittees were identified by cluster analysis: "Large-Scale Operators," 2 types of traditional URanchers," and 2 types of "Hobbyists." The main concern across groups was losing access to public land, and coping strategies overall included passivity (64%), intensification of private-land use (27%), and enterprise diversification (5%). Across all groups the 4 highest use rates uniformly occurred for livestock cross-breeding (92%), livestock supplementation (80%), planting improved forages on private land (76 %), and interaction with extension personnel (73%). The 4 lowest rates (3 to 12%) occurred for use of futures markets, range-trend monitoring on private land, estrus synchronization, and short-duration grazing (SDG). Groups varied in use of feed and financial consultants, prescribed fire on private land, forward contracting, and controlled grazing systems other than SDG, with Large-Scale Operators tending to use these the most. Larger operation size and higher levels of formal education and income for managers were positively associated with using more practices. Hobbyists tended to use practices the least. Practices which were less complex, clearly linked to animal production, potentially more cost-effective, and had greater compatibility with operational goals were favored. Socioeconomic groups and coping strategies have utility for better targeting research and extension. Understanding why some seemingly beneficial practices are rarely used requires improved communication with rangeland operators.

AB The domestic buffalo occupies an important niche in many ecologically disadvantaged agricultural systems, providing milk, meat and draught power. Although buffalo can adapt to harsh environments and live on low quality forage, their reproductive efficiency is often compromised by such conditions. Climatic stress depresses ovarian cyclicity, oestrous expression and conception rates. Poor nutrition, usually related to seasonal fluctuations in availability and quality of feed, delays puberty and increases the duration of postpartum anoestrus. Management factors such as the system of grazing (free, tethered or none) and sucking by calves (restricted or ad libitum) also modulate reproductive functions. Finally, the skills and capabilities of farmers as well as the quality of support services such as artificial insemination and disease control also influence fertility. The relative importance of these factors vary greatly depending on ecological conditions and production systems. Improvement of reproductive efficiency therefore requires the identification of specific limiting factors under a given situation and the development and field testing of strategies for improvements and interventions that are sustainable with available local resources. The application of modern reproductive technologies in buffaloes requires an appreciation of their biology and reproductive physiology as well as the potentials and limitations under each specific production system.

AB For effective planning and execution of conservation programs that sustain productivity, an attempt has been made to delineate India into 17 Sail Conservation Regions (SCRs). To demarcate the SCRs attributes of-roil (depth, texture, slope and erosion hazards) have been integrated on it land capability classification map, over which were superimposed the maps of annual rainfall daily rainfall Erosion Index, and land we. SCR boundaries were further refined by superimposing a map of agroecological regions, which has a bias for maximizing plant production. The area for each SCR was finalized by wing ii catchment region map of the country to ensure that SCR boundaries align with the boundaries of the nearest natural watershed, sub-catchment, catchment basin, or water resource region. Further delineation of SCRs into Soil Conservation Areas (SCAs) as the principal management unit, and micro-watershed areas called Soil Conservation Units (SCUs) also is discussed Each SCU is about 1,500 to 2,000 ha (3,750 to 5,000 ac) in size an a scale of 1:50,000. Delineation of SCRs into SCRs and SCUs is based an predominant land use, production potential crop evapotranspiration (ET) requirements, scope for development of water resources, prevailing erosion rates and conservation problems, population-supporting capacities, and technological innovations in a given area. Planning at the SCU level ultimately will pave the way for the creation of a nationwide Soil Conservation Service that can help maximize sustainable production.

SO JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION

DT Article
DE conservation tillage; glyphosate; potato rotation; residue management;
   soil erosion
AB The cost of soil erosion to producers in Prince Edward Island is more than $5 million annually. These costs do not account for the loss of long-term sustainability of the land. Major soil associations in Prince Edward Island have potential rooting depths of only 25 to 40 cm (10 to 16 in). The impact of soil erosion is critical on such shallow soils. Methods to reduce soil erosion are required. This study investigated the benefits of residue management and the retention of surface dead plant material in a 2-yr grain/potato rotation and a 3-yr grain/forage/potato rotation. Residue management in the 2-yr rotation reduced soil erosion as estimated by rainfall simulation by as much as 50% and tuber yields were not affected. Residue management reduced soil erosion up to 90% in the 3-yr rotation and tuber yields were improved by 7%. Tillage costs were reduced by $60 to $160 per ha ($25 to $64 per ac) using residue management with an average savings of $100 per ha (40 per ac). Residue management uses new tillage practices and may require modifications to planters and harvesters to accommodate the increased plant residue.

ID YIELD; MODEL
AB Changes in climate associated with changes in atmospheric concentrations of CO2 and other greenhouse gases might affect soil erosion by wind and water. Changes in erosion could in turn cause changes in productivity and sustainability of agricultural systems, and changes in air quality (PM10) and water quality (sediment transport). Substantial effects on productivity may however, only occur several decades after climate changes. This paper presents a procedure for assessing the potential effects of climate change on erosion and productivity. A preliminary screening process is used to identify and prioritize regions and management systems. Subsequent simulation of selected sites with the EPIC model is used to investigate potential practices to adapt agricultural systems to climate change. In some cases, proposed adaptation strategies might reduce sustainability if they due not matched to environmental conditions found at specific sites. As an example, the assessment procedure is applied to evaluate vulnerability and adaptation practices for a 20% increase in mean monthly wind speeds in the U.S. corn belt.

AB Nutrient management has become a major focus for watershed-scale planning to sustain or improve groundwater quality in certain areas. The USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) Watershed Science Institute (WSSI), in cooperation with a number Of partners, is developing a process for creating unique, watershed-scale models to examine dynamic phosphorus (P) flows into, out of; and within watersheds using a mass balance approach. The Watershed Ecosystem Nutrient Dynamics (WEND) model tracks watershed P balances over time within each of the several land-use sectors. Long-term impacts of various strategic policy decisions on P cycling both within and export from watersheds can be modeled The Winooski River Watershed in Vermont is a case watershed in which WEND has been used to evaluate the impacts of long-term strategies an nutrient use efficiency. The objective of this study was to describe the effects of three scenarios (status quo, increased rate of development, and increased conservation policies) an P cycling. The model showed increased water quality impairment over 80 years under the status quo and development scenarios. Under the conservation scenario, P movement into the drainage network was significantly reduced. This suggests that the WEND model could be adopted as an NRCS tool for improved watershed-scale P management.

AB Long-term field-scale watershed studies are needed to quantify productivity and environmental imparts of various farming practices. The objective for this study was to summarize geologic, topographic, and agronomic data for four deep-loess, field-scale watersheds in western Iowa. Average corn grain yield for 1972 through 1995 on Monona (fine-silty, mixed mesic Typic Hapludolls), Ida-Dow (fine-silty, mixed mesic Typic Udorthents), and Napier-Kennebec (fine-silty, mixed mesic Cumulic Hapludolls) soils was 7.2, 6.7, and 7.9 Mg ha(-1) (115, 107, and 126 bu/ac), respectively. After more than 20 yr of continuous corn production, the weed community had reached a high density and was dominated by foxtail (Setaria) species. It is recommended that fixture soil and crop management practices on these watershed should focus on increasing crop diversity to control weeds and reduce the apparent yield penalty associated with continuous corn. The management practices dire should strive to develop a soil rendition that is resilient and able to buffer periodic, but anticipated plant water and heat stress.

AB Water is often the most limiting crop production factor but it also can cause nutrient runoff and leaching losses. The objectives of this report were to (1) compare water we efficiency for the production of continuous corn (Zea mays L.) on long-term conventional-till and ridge-till watersheds in western Iowa, and (2) relate water use to fertilizer N use efficiency. Information on crop yield, rainfall baseflow, runoff; and soil water content was collected over a period of 23 yr. Potential evaporation was calculated from microclimate data. Using these data, water we efficiency was computed. Nitrogen use efficiency was estimated using crop removal and fertilizer application data. There were no significant differences in seasonal rainfall or estimated water loss between the two watersheds, but water use efficiency for ridge-tillage (22.8 kg ha(-1) mm(-1) yr(-1) or 517 lb ac(-1) in(-1) yr(-1)) was significantly greater than for conventional tillage (20.3 kg ha(-1) mm(-1) yr(-1) or 460 lb ac(-1) in(-1) yr(-1)). The estimated N removal by crop harvest accounted for 48 and 59% of the applied N. Ridge-till reduced runoff, increased infiltration, and reduced water loss due to greater residue; therefore, greater water use efficiency was observed. The ridge-till field had less residual NO3-N in the root zone for subsequent leaching, but higher N concentrations in the baseflow since average N fertilization rates exceeded average crop removal by 68 kg ha(-1) yr(-1). This interaction demonstrates the importance of balancing both N and water we efficiencies to achieve a sustainable production system.

ID MANAGEMENT
AB The use of winter cover crops to improve the productivity and sustainability of agroecosystems in California has increased during the last decade. Little information exists however, on water use by winter cover crops. This 3-year study was conducted in the Central Valley of California to quantify changes in water storage in winter fallowed and cover cropped soils. Soil water depletions in the surface 210 cm were determined by neutron hydroprobe during the 1991-92, 1992-93 and 1993-94 winter seasons under barley (Hordeum vulgare), vetch (Vicia dasycarpa), and barley/vetch cover crops as well as in fallowed soils. With an average input of 50 mm of supplemental irrigation water for germination and establishment each fall, cover crop growth under typical winter conditions for this region was quite vigorous: the barley and barley/vetch mixes averaged about 9,000-11,000 kg of dry matter ha(-1) and the vetch crops yielded an average of 5,600 kg ha(-1). Soil water storage at the time of cover crop incorporation in mid-March was reduced by 7.4 +/- 1.0, 7.8 +/- 1.4 and 6.5 +/- 1.1 cm by the barley, barley/vetch and vetch cover crops respectively, relative to the storage in fallowed soils over the three seasons of this work. Soil water tension gradients indicated that drainage beyond 210 cm did not occur. Although depletions in stored water under barley and vetch that are grown during the winter as cover crops were relatively small, they may impact preirrigation needs and the growth and productivity of subsequent crops. Thus, long-term water budgeting at a cropping systems level is essential to successfully integrate cover crops into crop rotations in arid and semi-arid areas.

AB The main objective of this study was to analyze and compare the socio-economic characteristics, attitude and beliefs of sustainable and conventional farmers. The results show that there was a significant difference in the use of Sustainable Agriculture System (SAS) practices by conventional and sustainable farmers. The response on two agriculture paradigms was significantly different among the two groups of farmers. The probit coefficient showed that there was positive relationship between farmers' education, number of new farming practices adopted, and SAS. The results suggest that sustainable farmers were younger and have more off-farm income compared to conventional farmers. It was also concluded that affiliations with different farmer groups/organizations does affect the farmer's perception toward SAS. The results of this study would be helpful to policy makers in developing strategies and policies to enhance SAS in order to improve the environment and rural communities.

DE dryland agriculture; farming system; sustainability
AB Agriculture in Lebanon is mainly rainfed and severely constrained by limited natural resources. Through centuries, local farmers have developed time-tested strategies to mitigate the impacts of drought and save natural resources. There are now indications that the once sustainable dryland farming systems are undergoing drastic changes. The study was undertaken to understand these recent drastic changes and their repercussions on the natural resource base in a Lebanese highland village in transition from a traditional agropastoral system to rainfed stone fruit production. Marginal lands are increasingly used in crop production and becoming less available to livestock grazing. As a result, traditional agropastoral systems are developing into more sedentary systems constrained by shrinking rangelands and limited feed availability.

TI The ideal soil: I. An edaphic paradigm for sustainable agriculture

LA English
DT Article
DE edaphic indicators and attributes; ideal soil; sustainable agriculture
ID BIOMASS; QUALITY
AB There is a real necessity for finding edaphic indicators to assess how sustainable an adopted management practice is for a given agroecosystem. By comparing such indicators for virgin soils to those for cultivated soils in the North of the Pampean Region (Argentina), you can get an idea of the degree of degradation (or aggradation) achieved by the use of such a practice. However, this does not always make it possible for us to assess if the technology in use leads to a sustainable system (i.e., to a system that is profitable, productive and, at the same time, conservationist of the natural resource); mainly because this is related to the quality of the original soil.
   In order to construct a paradigm aiming at Sustainable Agriculture (SA), the new concept of Ideal Soil (IS) is introduced here, grouping soil attributes around four functions that soils carry out for crops. The proximity of the critical variables of cultivated soil to those from the IS will indicate good aptitude of a management modality for establishing an SA system in this soil. If these properties move away from the IS, the agricultural practices used will not tend to an SA.
   In this article some edaphic indicators have been selected and proposed as indicators of the physical state, the chemical composition and the biological activity of the soils.

AB The improvement in field texture accuracy of 100 soil samples from contrasting parent materials-Coastal Plain Sands (33), Basement Complex (27), and Flood Plain (40)-were studied for sustainable agriculture. The results of improvement in field texture accuracy of the soil scientists used in the study were similar in both years. Absolute accuracy in the subsequent year (A(2)) increased over the previous year (A(1)) in descending order: Flood Plain (23%) > Coastal Plain (20%) > Basement Complex (8%). Relative accuracy was highly significant (r = 0.68-0.86, P < 0.001) irrespective of the period of determination (A(1) or A(2)) and the parent material used. Time of determining field texture also reduced considerably in the subsequent year (A(2)) and for each successive rounds of determination. Reduction in time of soil texture determination per sample (seconds) follows descending order: Basement Complex (4.2) > Flood Plain (2.4) > Coastal Plain (1.2). It was noticed that medium texture soil require ess time of determination by feel than heavy or light soils. Wherever heavy and light soils are more accurately determined by feel than medium textured soil. For sustainable agriculture in the global South, Relative Accuracy (cv(%) 4-9) is more reliable and pragmatic for most soil management practices than Absolute Accuracy (cv(%) 7-38).

AB This paper evaluates the profitability and economic risks associated with four cropping systems for the Sustainable Agriculture Demonstration site at Beltsville, Maryland, for the 1994-97 period. Each system follows a 2-year rotation of corn in the first year and winter wheat and soybean in the second year. The four systems are (1) a no-tillage system with recommended fertilizer and herbicide inputs, (2) a no-tillage system with crownvetch living mulch, (3) a no-tillage system with winter annual cover crop, and (4) a reduced tillage manure-based system without chemical inputs. cover crop system is the most profitable ($238 in gross margin), closely followed by the no-tillage ($233) and the manure-based system ($217). Even though farmers desire a cropping system that maximizes profits, the variability of profits, or risks, can influence the desirability of the cropping system. In terms of risks, no-tillage is the most preferred rotation with the smallest coefficient of variation (1.14) followed by the cover crop system (1.24), the manure-based system (1.58), and the crownvetch system The same ranking can be obtained using a "safety-first" criterion risk-averse farmers, in which the gross margin of the no-tillage system would exceed $53 ha(-1) in three out of four years, while the gross margin of the cover crop system would exceed $39 ha(-1) in three out of four years. The manure-based system is an organic system and it was not profitable in 1996 and 1997 because of weed infestations. However, the manure-based system shows potential to be the most profitable if some methods can be found to control weeds without resorting to herbicides and its crops can be certified as organic and sold at premium prices.

DE farm income; food security; Nigeria and women
AB Women produce between 60 to 80 percent of the food in Nigeria. They are also responsible for managing household resources, yet their key role as producers and providers and their critical contribution to household food security has not been fully recognized. Therefore, this research identified the vital roles of women as the major pillars for achieving sustainable household food security. The result showed that women play significant roles in food availability and food security. Also, a positively significant relationship was shown between income generating activities and women's roles in ensuring food security. Due to the fact that women face a lot of social, cultural and economic constraints in performing their roles, there is therefore the need for capacity building to enhance income generating activities through provision of credit facilities, education and other resources for sustainable national and household food security.

AB This paper examines ways in which rural landscapes and communities in the Northeast have been, and continue to be, impacted by global and local food marketing systems. We provide a historical overview of globalization in agriculture and the food system and the relationship of these changes to other economic, technological and social changes. We present two food system models-"global" and "local"-representing contrasting socioeconomic paradigms, or understandings of the true and proper relationship between economy and society. Finally we explore some of the theoretical and real-life impacts of global and local food systems on landscapes in the Northeast, and discuss implications for achieving long-term agricultural sustainability.

AB Crop pests are a major constraint of farmers in southwestern Nigeria. Farmers cannot sustain the use of often recommended agrochemicals. However, some of the rural farmers have been able to develop indigenous technologies aimed at controlling the pests. The aim of the study was to identify and ascertain the efficacy of some of the forest plant products used for crop pest control. Results indicated that many of the products are effective. It is recommended that further studies be conducted by Farming Systems Research Teams to study the efficacy of these and other forest plant products in other agro-ecological zones, with the long term aim of developing extension packages for pest control from the products.

   (Metroxylon sagu Rottboll); sustainable agriculture; small-holdings
AB Sage (Metroxylon sagu Rottboll) is a remarkably hardy plant that is indigenous to South East Asia. This palm thrives in waterlogged, acidic soils where few other plants survive. Sage is an important source of carbohydrates for the local inhabitants and is the crop par excellence for sustainable agriculture. However, owing to the introduction of more profitable crops like rice and oil palm, the areas under sage in Malaysia have declined dramatically over the years. The only large areas remaining under sage now are in the state of Sarawak. In this paper, the present status of sage palm in Malaysia is reviewed and the prospects and possibilities of its emergence as a major crop are discussed. The future prospects for sage are bright if the appropriate policy measures are undertaken.

AB An analysis was made of the problem caused by white grubs in cornfields at El Cielo Biosphere Reserve. Two species are mainly responsible for corn damage: Phyllophaga trichodes and P. misteca. The life cycle of both species is described. During an outbreak of P. trichodes, plant height reduction correlated positively with root damage and root damage white grub numbers. A list of ten natural enemies of white grubs is provided. Soil degradation may have promoted the white grub problem in the last 20 years. Addition of chicken manure to the soil may help cope with the white grub problem and increase soil fertility.

AB This study mainly discusses the attitude of farmers towards environment and sustainability issues of agricultural development. Field work was conducted in Nakano block of Iwami town, Shimane prefecture and data were collected from the farmers through personal interviews. Findings revealed that most of the farmers confronted low levels of environmental problems. The issues mostly confronted were the reduction of necessary aquatic life and beneficial insects in nature due to the use of agro-chemicals. Cultivation of high yielding varieties of crops with proper management practices, use of low toxicity pesticides and care in handling were the matters mostly suggested by farmers to combat environmental degradation. Most of the farmers possessed a highly favorable attitude towards the above issues. Significant positive correlation was found only between the farmers' attitude and their formal education and newspaper exposure.

SO JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE

DT Article
DE cereals; forage legumes; inter-crop; profitability; Africa; Ethiopia
AB Poverty, low crop and animal productivity and large-scale resource degradation are major problems in the agriculture sector in the East African highlands. Among others, integration of forage legumes in cereal based cropping systems has been proposed as a promising strategy to improve the sustainability of smallholder farming systems through increased crop and livestock productivity and better soil management. Using experimental data from Ethiopia and elsewhere in the region, linear programming models have been used to determine the economic impacts of cereal-forage legume inter-cropping with and without crossbred cows for a typical highland mixed farm. An important feature of the model was that the benefits of inter-cropping in terms of nitrogen fixation and the better nutrition of animals were accounted for. Model results demonstrate that the introduction of forage legumes with cereals changes cropping pattern significantly, but does not significantly change the use pattern of principal farm resources, labor and ox power. Introduction of cereal-forage legume inter-cropping significantly increases gross margin and cash income, and the introduction of crossbred cows enhances these returns even further. Inter-cropping also significantly increases the share of livestock in farm and cash income when crossbred cows are included. Sensitivity analyses show that the improved technologies remain more profitable than current practices even when there is a substantial decrease in price of outputs. The results indicate that the improved production technologies should be widely tested under actual farm conditions under farmer management through on-farm research and extension. Benefits of intercropping in terms of weed control and control of soil erosion should be quantified in future research.

AB In the course of their development processes, societies have apparently never been faced in the past by the necessity of developing stable regulating mechanisms (institutions) to secure their natural resource basis or the sustainable utilization of such. As a result, little historical experience has been gathered by societies in how to deal with sustainability. In the current situation in which societies are confronted by resource degradation, it is necessary to establish such institutions by means of political measures. The discussions in the past decades show how difficult this process is.

ID SOUTHERN NIGERIA
AB Published information on nutrient dynamics in relation to soil fertility management for oil palm-based cropping systems is still scarce in Nigeria. An intercropping experiment with oil palm (Elaeis guineensis Jacq), soybean (Glycine max), maize (Zea mays) and cocoyam (Xanthosoma sagittifolium) was therefore conducted from 1992-1994 to evaluate changes in soil nutrient levels. The experimental design was a randomised complete block with three replicates. Treatments consisted of: (A) sole oil palm; (B) sole soybean; (C) sole maize; (D) sole cocoyam; (E) oil palm + soybean; (F) oil palm + maize; (G) oil palm + cocoyam; (H) oil palm + soybean + maize; (I) oil palm + soybean + cocoyam; (J) oil plam + soybean + maize + cocoyam. A pre-cropping composite soil sample was taken at a depth of 0-30 cm in 1992. Soil sampling for analysis was conducted on plot basis after harvesting for soil pH, organic matter, total nitrogen, available P and exchangeable K, Mg and Ca.
   There was no significant change in pH after 3 cropping years, but soil organic matter declined from 10-51% in treatments G and I. The decline in total N ranged from 50-70% in treatments A and J. At the end of the experiment the P level increased up to 71% in treatment E. Exchangeable K declined from 32 to 62% in treatment F and H, respectively. The observed decline in N and K could be due to crop removal and leaching. No significant changes were observed for Ca and Mg. Intercropping depressed the sex ratio in oil palm by between 6 and 17%. Soybean seed yield was highest (1.5 t ha(-1)) in the sole plot and lowest (0.7 t ha(-1)) in soybean + oil palm t maize t cocoyam. Grain yields from sole maize and maize intercropped with oil palm were superior to yields from the other intercropping treatments.
   A similar trend was observed for cocoyam corm yield. The significance of this finding for sustainable agriculture is that intercropping encourages the maximization of land use, stability in yield and profit. Furthermore, intercropping of cereal with grains provides balanced energy and protein diets for farm families.

AB This study describes the traditional land classification and management strategies employed by farmers and their role in the sustainability of the land use system in the semi-arid zone of Nigeria. One hundred and seventy farmers were selected through a combination of simple and systematic random sampling techniques. Discussions were held with them using a structured interview guide. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics.
   The study shows that farmers classify their farmlands on the basis of distance from the village and in terms of water supply. The karakara (homestead farm land) surrounds the village, usually more manured, under permanent cultivation and more frequently used for mixed cropping. The gona daji (bush land) is far from the village, not farmed permanently, and less frequently used for mixed cropping. The fadama (wet is a low-lying seasonally inundated farm land. It is usually cultivated all year round, sometimes with supplementary irrigation during the dry season. The gona tudu (rainfed land) is upland farm cultivable only during the rainy season. In terms of management there is considerable overlap between the gona tudu gona daji and the karakara and this is often affected by farmers perceived soil fertility status, type of crops grown on the land, and available resources.
   The study concludes with recommendations including in-depth study and analysis of farmers' practices which would lead to better targeting of research and extension activities.

AB Soil compaction affects crop yields through alterations of soil physical properties and processes. Effects of 3 tillage methods and 3 compaction treatments on the physical properties of a clayey soil were investigated in the lakebed region of northwestern Ohio. Tillage treatments included no-till (NT), chisel plowing (CP), and moldboard plowing (MP). Compaction treatments were imposed for 3 consecutive years followed by 4 years without compaction. Compaction treatments involved control, 10 Mg, and 20 Mg axle load on single axis. Effects of tillage las main plots) and axle load (as sub-plots) treatments were evaluated for 2 crop rotations: a 3-year rotation involving corn (Zea mays)-soybean (Glycine max)-oats (Avena sativa) and a 2-year rotation involving corn-soybean. These experiments were initiated in fall 1987, and measurements of soil physical properties were made in 1992 and 1993. Neither tillage nor compaction treatments had a significant effect on soil bulk density (rho(b)), and mean rho(b) measured in 1993 was 1.34 Mg m(-3) for 0 to 10 cm depth and 1.39 Mg m(-3) for 10 to 20 cm depth. Although not significantly different, trends in rho(b) were NT > MP > CP for 0 to 10 cm depth and NT > CP > MP for 10 to 20 cm depth. The data on saturated hydraulic conductivity (K-S) were highly variable and treatments had no effect. Moisture retention characteristics differed significantly among depths but not among treatments. The data highlight the need for development of suitable indices for or to assess management-induced differences in physical properties of clayey soils characterized by high swell-shrink capacity.

   the environment and sustainable agriculture
SO JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE

DT Article
DE extension; New Zealand; privatization; sustainable agriculture
AB Government intervention has been an integral part of agricultural policy in most industrialized countries throughout the last half of the twentieth century. Unfortunately, many of the agricultural problems (e.g., market instability, low returns on capital, falling farm incomes, farm failures) that government interventions were intended to correct are still problems today. The combined effects of these policy failures of the past and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) are stimulating countries around the world to begin dismantling their agricultural intervention programs. Movement toward more market economies also frequently includes eliminating or reducing governmental educational and incentive programs including those designed to encourage the adoption of sustainable environmental practices by farmers. Our objectives, therefore, are to explore the potential environmental consequences of dismantling governmental agricultural intervention in extension by taking a close look at New Zealand's experiences. At the time New Zealand began restructuring its agricultural assistance programs, education and extension programs concerned with environmental management on farms, were few and in their infancy. Consequently, it is difficult to assess the effect, if any, that commercialization of New Zealand's extension service had on environmental programming, or for that matter the environment. More recently, environmental-educational programs are being conducted via new and alternative vehicles. These have included government contracts with private farm consultants. In addition, early indications were that environmentally unsustainable activities, e.g., development of environmentally sensitive land for pastoral farming, has declined due largely to the removal of subsidies which encouraged these practices. However, in some other cases, on-farm activities that have the potential to adversely affect the environment have begun to increase again. This time, however, it is in response to market rather than subsidies signals. Not all experiences from the New Zealand situation are applicable to other countries contemplating or initiating reductions in government intervention into agriculture. However, several experiences from the current privatization initiatives provide insight into making the transition with less threat to the environment.

ID HUMAN APPROPRIATION; SUSTAINABILITY; INDICATORS; ISSUES
AB Agriculture of today may be defined as goal oriented manipulation of ecosystems for human gains. Future agricultural systems should be aimed at goal oriented, sustainable management of ecosystems for both human and ecosystem gains. Consequently, people take over the responsibility not only of regulating the system according to their needs, but also of supporting the system that serves them and of which they are a part. This agricultural human-regulated system is included in the larger natural ecosystems which are self-regulating through subsystem feedback and larger scale control mechanisms. The products of a system must be useful for that system, either directly within the system, or by feedback through other surrounding systems, otherwise the system will be degraded.

AB In order to evaluate the economic and environmental consequences of soil nitrogen tests, this paper combines a dynamic fertilizer use decision model with a crop production model. The preside-dress soil N-test is evaluated for a hypothetical farmer growing corn at the ARS Sustainable Agriculture Demonstration Farm site in southern Maryland. For a farmer not currently using a soil N-test, adoption of this technology can lead to the enhancement of net farm income and the reduction in nitrogen loss to the environment. This will transpire only if the farmer is currently underestimating nitrogen carry-over by more than 25 percent or applying nitrogen fertilizer based solely on an expected plateau-yield goal.

DE Loess Plateau; market economy; conservation
AB A new agricultural system, "garden-plantation," has emerged in northern Shaanxi Province (Shaanbei), China. Shaanbei has been one of the most impoverished rural regions in China due to resource depletion and lack of developmental opportunities. Past efforts of economic development and conservation did not succeed due to their failure to coalesce conservation and economic interests. The garden-plantation system has shown sustainable production potentials because it links improvement of living standards to resource conservation. This research shows that China's rudimentary market economy, local authorities and traditional social networks in rural communities have all played important roles in the adoption and diffusion of the garden-plantation system. The findings of this study have both theoretical and policy implications.

AB This study examines the sociodemographic, farm-related, attitudinal and communication behavior differences between organic and conventional farmers in Canada. While organic farmers have fewer years of farming experience, operate smaller farms and are less dependent on hired farm labor, the most significant differences concern farmers' attitudes towards organic farming and the use of synthetic agrichemicals. A close attitudinal alignment between government extension agents and conventional farmers was also found. In addition, organic and conventional farmers proved to have significantly different patterns of information behavior and preferences. Implications for organic farming advocates and extension services are discussed.

AB Sustainability is the paradigm of our time, yet its use as a guide to planning or decision making is clouded by its ambiguity and the multiplicity of definitions in use. In this paper we address the issue of how best to deal with the multi-faceted nature of sustainability. We outline each of the facets of sustainability that have been discussed in the literature, but suggest that most of them boil down to three basic concepts: environmental stability, intergenerational equity and economic efficiency. Nevertheless, it remains difficult to link the concept to practical actions and decisions. We argue that a multiple criteria decision making approach is the best solution to this problem. This is consistent with the use of "sustainability indicators," but such indicators need to be selected carefully to be relevant to the essential elements of sustainability.

   Republic of Korea; sustainable farming
AB The Republic of Korea will be required to alter many of its agriculture policies to meet the requirements of new world trading rules. These adjustments will have a significant impact on the agriculture industry. One farm structure that is being encouraged is sustainable farms, farms that utilize less inorganic fertilizers and less pesticides. At present, the main goal of agricultural policy is to reduce pesticide and chemical fertilizer use on farms by 50%. A main reason for reducing pesticide and chemical fertilizers in vegetable and fruit farms is to improve the quality of drinking water for larger cities, including Seoul. This study estimated the household production impact of adopting sustainable farming techniques and the impact that changes in input use will have on production.
   A Cobb-Douglas production function was applied to derive elasticities of production of farm input materials. The data used were from a Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry farm household economy survey of 3,085 farms during 1980-96. The level of farm income was deflated by consumer price index and the level of input materials were deflated by farm input materials index.
   The coefficient estimate for pesticides was - 1.16, and the marginal value of production was -1.99 at the means. There is no economic advantage to applying more pesticide for the average farm management unit, there was a benefit to reducing pesticide use. A 1% decrease in pesticide use would increase income 1.16%. The coefficient far chemical fertilizers was 0.16, but was not significant at the 5% level. A 1% increase of chemical fertilizers will increase level of farm income by 0.16%. The coefficient for farm machinery was 1.38. A 1% increase in machinery use would increase farm income by 1.38%.

AB The National Integrated Pest Management Training Program in Indonesia has provided opportunities for vegetable farmers to learn about farming practices that reduce reliance on chemical pesticides while maintaining high yield potential. This study compares samples of trained and untrained cabbage and potato farmers with the objective of comparing adoption levels of sustainable practices. A Farmer Sustainability Index was computed for each farmer surveyed to judge the relative sustainability of farm operations. Results indicate that farmers with IPM training follow more sustainable practices than their untrained counterparts. A regression model was constructed to explain the index values. The model revealed that IPM training and farmer knowledge of the ecology of his farm are positive factors that significantly affect the index value.

TI Genotypic variation for root penetration of a soil pan
SO JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE

DE cotton roots; genotypic variation; soil pan
ID UPLAND COTTON; TILLAGE
AB Cotton production has increased dramatically on the Coastal Plain of the southeastern USA since eradication of the boil weevil (Anthonomus grandis [Boh.]) in the late 1980s. Most of the cotton production in this area occurs on soils possessing subsoil pans. Soil pans limit root growth, requiring mechanical disruption to increase the root zone and facilitate cotton growth. Mechanical amelioration of a soil pan has several disadvantages including expenses for equipment and energy, equipment to break up the pan may not be available, and the effects of mechanical disruption are temporary and contribute to soil erosion. The need for soil pan disruption might be eliminated or reduced with cotton germplasm capable of rooting through high strength soil. Our objective was to identify germplasm with superior rooting ability and thereby initiate breeding efforts incorporating this trait into cultivars. Cultivars and Pee Dee germplasm lines were evaluated at Florence, SC for 2-yr without irrigation for root penetration of a naturally occurring soil pan. Roots were excavated at maturity and rated on a 1-5 scale based on magnitude of the root penetration of the pan. Combined analysis of variance over years revealed significant genotypic variation and a genotype x yr interaction for root penetration of the pan. Despite the genotype x yr interaction, we identified germplasm that could partially root through the pan. Additionally, we were able to eliminate those genotypes with poor rooting characteristics from further consideration as parents in the breeding program. Cultivars with ability to penetrate a soil pan would make a valuable contribution to sustainable cotton production systems for the USA and developing countries.

TI The sustainability of telemedicine projects
SO JOURNAL OF TELEMEDICINE AND TELECARE
LA English
DT Article
AB Although there are instances where the provision of health care is successfully driven by the profit motive, in most countries it is considered a public service. The provision of telemedicine services assuredly meets an important social need to extend health care to remote and rural areas in developing countries. While there are potential advantages and benefits from telemedicine, the evidence of its cost-effectiveness and sustainability is meagre. Telemedicine undoubtedly yields cost savings in certain circumstances, but few service providers have found a way to recover their costs (and make a profit) from those to whom they provide their service. With their low expenditures per person, developing countries face a daunting challenge in making such public services sustainable. Pilot projects should be a first step in demonstrating the cost-effectiveness and benefits of telemedicine, but such projects should also be sustainable. Sponsors of such pilot projects must have a clear plan from the start about how the project can continue after the sponsorship comes to an end. This paper examines ways in which telemedicine services can be made sustainable.

AB Experience with Information Systems (IS) staff, interactions with healthcare senior management, and discussions with faculty and students have led us to the conclusions that few healthcare organizations have conceptualized and articulated an optimal organizational role for IS (particularly for IS leadership).
   In this paper we will describe the multi-polar, often conflicting "expectations" faced by many of today's healthcare IS departments, and define a set of useful and sustainable institutional model roles for IS. Then, we will formulate the set of challenges which IS professionals in these roles must be prepared to address. We will use this to propose a challenge-oriented, skills-based, methodology-focussed curriculum in Applied Healthcare Informatics, and delivery mechanisms that suit potential candidates.

ID 2,3,7,8-TETRACHLORODIBENZO-PARA-DIOXIN; RATS
AB The two contamination events during the last 18 months have revived the discussion about polychlorinated dibenzodioxins and furans (PCDD/Fs) in food and feedstuffs and resulted in numerous state regulations for protecting the consumer against an increased uptake from foodstuffs. Starting from contaminated citrus pulp (approx. 7 ng iTE/kg in dry matter) from Brazil, an individual regulation for this single feed was made during summer 98 by fixing a maximum limit of 0.5 ng iTE/kg in dry matter (18th amendment of the feedstuff ordinance).
   The national and supranational interventions at the occasion of the dioxin/furan/PCB contamination taking its origin in Belgium during summer 99 were of an obviously larger dimension. Accompanied by transport and import bans stipulated by urgent decrees according to 38 LMBG (Federal Law on Food) maximum quantities for PCDD/Fs in food from animal origin were fixed for limited periods of time. For milk, a limit of 3 pg WHO-TEq (PCDD/PCDF) g fat was fixed. Further modifications in the frame of the feedstuff legislation, particularly as regards feed fats, should be converted into national law until 31 July 1999.
   Actual investigations made by the Institute for Hygiene and Food Safety of the Federal Dairy Research Centre during the first semester of 1999 have revealed a mean value of 0.35 pg iTE/g fat for the PCDD/Fs in tanker bulk milk and butter (n = 57). The consumption of 40 g milkfat/day corresponds to an intake of 14 pgiTE/g fat per day or to 20 % of the tolerable daily intake (TDI) according to the WHO recommendation or 1998 (based only on PCDD/Fs and the lower benchmark figure of 1 pg WHO-TEq (PCDD/PCDF)/kg body weight and day.
   All in all, the exposition of the consumer in Germany by the two contamination events of the food chain has not sustainably increased, so that the prospective limit of less than I pg toxic equivalents (international or WHO, the latter for only PCDD/Fs) kg body weight and day is far from being reached.

The use Of scientific advice should preserve as much as possible the principles of participation and democracy. This implies a modified view of the status of expert statements, as well as the necessity of certain checks and balances. The latter leads to interesting and relevant questions for cybernetics. Two mechanisms are identified that can make the role of research distorting rather than enlightening the problems at hand Environmental issues constitute a prominent field where the limitations of classical approaches as well as the opportunities for second order cybernetics can be demonstrated Improving on overall sustainability depends on democracy and participation Checks and balances guarding the role of expertise are essential.

AB Pastoral land use in New Zealand's North Island hill terrain has led to high rates of rainstorm-induced landslide erosion higher than existed under the indigenous forest regime, with consequent soil productivity declines in the long term. To assist extrapolation of research results to other areas, and to shed light on long-term erosion risks, a simple model was developed that simulates the evolution of hillslope soil productivity, taking into account the effect of slope, rainstorm magnitude-frequency relations and soil recovery rates. Risks are evaluated by Monte Carlo simulation, and reflect parameter uncertainty as well as the natural randomness associated with climatic events. A sensitivity analysis showed that landslide risk was most affected by the rainfall threshold for landsliding,the mean of the extreme value distribution for annual maximum storm rainfall, and the maximum degree of recovery of pasture productivity following landsliding. Simulations suggest productivity stabilizes at a reduced level well before all steep terrain is affected by landsliding, and that subsequent expected landslide-induced productivity declines are too slow to provide sufficient economic motivation for measures to prevent landslide damage. A refined model showed that long-term average rates of productivity decline are sensitive to changes in recovery rates resulting from progressive removal of the soil resource. Charts summarizing simulation results can be used to estimate long-term productivity declines. Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Although soil is a component of terrestrial ecosystems, it is comprised of a complex web of interacting organisms, and therefore can be considered itself as an ecosystem. Soil microflora and fauna derive energy from plants and plant residues and serve important functions in maintaining soil physical and chemical properties, thereby affecting net primary productivity (NPP), and in the case of contained environments, the quality of the life support system. We have been using 3 controlled-environment facilities (CEF's) that incorporate different levels of soil biological complexity and environmental control, and differ in their resemblance to natural ecosystems, to study relationships among plant physiology, soil ecology, fluxes of minerals and nutrients, and overall ecosystem function. The simplest system utilizes growth chambers and specialized root chambers with organic-less media to study the physiology of plant-mycorrhizal associations. A second system incorporates natural soil in open-top chambers to study soil bacterial and fungal population response to stress. The most complex CEF incorporates reconstructed soil profiles in a "constructed" ecosystem, enabling close examination of the soil foodweb. Our results show that closed ecosystem research is important for understanding mechanisms of response to ecosystem stresses. In addition, responses observed at one level of biological complexity may not allow prediction of response at a different level of biological complexity. In closed life support systems, incorporating soil foodwebs will require less artificial manipulation to maintain system stability and sustainability. (C) 1999 COSPAR.

AB A hermetically materially-closed aquatic microcosm containing bacteria, algae, and invertebrates was developed as a tool for determining the changes of ecological systems in space. The species composition was maintained for more than 365 days. The microcosm could be readily replicated. The results obtained from the simulation models indicated that there is a self-regulation homeostasis in coupling of production and consumption, which make the microcosm remarkably stable, and that the transfer of metabolites by diffusion is one of the important factors determining the behavior of the system. The microcosms were continuously irradiated using a Co-60 source. After 80 days, no elimination of organisms was found at any of the three irradiation levels (0.015, 0.55 and 3.0 mGy/day). The number of radio-resistance bacteria mutants was not increased in the microcosm at three irradiation levels. We proposed to research whether this microcosm is self-sustainable in space.
   When an aquatic ecosystem comes under stress due to the micro-gravity and enhanced radiation environment in space, whether the ecosystem is self-sustainable is not known. An aquatic ecosystem shows what happens as a result of the self-organizational processes of selection and adaptation. A microcosm is a useful tool for understanding such processes (Beyers and Odum, 1993). We have proposed researching whether a microcosm is self-sustainable in space. The benefits of this project will be: (1) To acquire data for design of a Controlled Ecological Life Support System, (2) Possibility of microbial mutation in a space station.
   We report that a hermetically materially-closed microcosm, which could be a useful tool for determining changes of ecological processes in space, was developed, and that the effects of microgravity and enhanced radiation on the hermetically materially-closed microcosm were estimated through measurements on the Earth and simulation models.

AB The Indian Central Himalaya has been receiving large amounts of development assistance, largely as a response to create infrastructural facilities for enhancing its production and better living. This paper suggests to understand how the present developmental initiatives have marginalised the Himalayan diversities, and has encouraged a narrowing of the economic, cultural and ecological characteristics of the region. Thus, has brought the society at the cross roads of unsustainability.

TI Circulation and mixing characteristics of a seasonally open tidal inlet:
   a field study
SO MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID GRAVITY CURRENTS; STRATIFICATION
AB Tidal inlets in microtidal, wave-dominated coastal environments tend to close to the ocean seasonally. This obstructs navigation and could cause degradation of water quality in the estuary/lagoon connected to the inlet. Hence, engineering solutions are often implemented to prevent inlet closure. However, a prior knowledge of circulation and mixing processes within the estuary is crucial for the sustainability of any engineering solution. This paper attempts to provide insight into circulation and mixing characteristics of seasonally open estuaries based on the results of a field study undertaken at Wilson Inlet, a typical seasonally open estuary, in south-western Australia. Results of the study indicate that this type of estuary may have two distinct behavioural patterns, in winter and in summer. During winter, solar heating causes density stratification during daytime, and convective cooling causes overnight de-stratification; a horizontal cyclonic gyre is established during winter by the combined action of the Coriolis force and streamflow. During summer, strong sea breezes (similar to 10 m s(-1)) cause vertical mixing during daytime, and convective cooling vertically mixes the water column at night. When the inlet is open, sea water propagates into the estuary during flooding tides unless streamflows are very high.

TI Australia's marine science and technology plan: an action plan for
   Australia's Oceans Policy
SO MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
AB Australia's Oceans Policy (AOP) is a new Commonwealth (Federal) government policy with sweeping implications for the management of the growing and diverse marine sectors dependent on the nation's vast marine territory. Its theme of responsible use and protection in the context of ecologically sustainable development provides an overarching and common framework with interfaces between federal and State governments at all levels while accommodating a host of pre-existing governmental regimes and jurisdictions and international treaty obligations. Primary vehicles for the implementation of the Policy will be 'Regional Marine Plans'. The accompanying Marine Science and Technology Plan is intended as the basis for federal actions, such as priority setting for the government's scientific and technical capacities, to help implement the AOP. Three programmes and 28 separate objectives are defined which detail specific needs in various sectoral or scientific areas.
   Science and technology will play a critical role in the implementation of the AOP. Rather than being seen as a service resource for the execution of user-driven AOP requirements, Australian scientific and technological knowledge, expertise and infrastructure and their strategic enhancement should be recognized collectively as a key component of the AOP itself and supported for their cumulative benefit in fulfilling the objectives of the Policy.

AB The dugong (Dugong dugon) is listed as vulnerable to extinction at a global scale. It has a large range that spans some forty countries and includes tropical and subtropical coastal and island waters from east Africa to Vanuatu. A significant proportion of the world's dugongs is found in northern Australian waters where most modern dugong research has been conducted. Dugongs are long-lived animals with a low reproductive rate, long generation time, and a high investment in each offspring. Population simulations indicate that even with the most optimistic combinations of life-history parameters (e.g. low natural mortality and no human-induced mortality) a dugong population is unlikely to increase by more than 5% per year. Dugongs are vulnerable to anthropogenic impacts because of their life history and their dependence on seagrasses that are restricted to coastal habitats. Even a slight reduction in adult survivorship as a result of habitat loss, disease, hunting or incidental drowning in nets can cause a chronic decline in a dugong population. The optimum management strategy is to identify areas that consistently support large numbers of dugongs and to set these aside as dugong sanctuaries in which dugong mortality is minimized and their habitat protected.

AB A toxic axenic strain of Alexandrium fundyense is shown to be capable of removing dissolved free amino acids (DFAAs) until concentrations are similar (low nM) to those found in natural waters. Uptake is greatest during exponential growth, rather than during C and/or N-stress as is usual in diatoms and other flagellates. A wide range of amino acids can be taken up, their concentration being decreased within a few hours to the levels observed prior to DFAA addition. The maximum rate of DFAA-N uptake, during early exponential phase, was 0.8 pmol-N cell(-1) h(-1), equivalent to similar or equal to 20% of the total N requirement. More typically, the contribution of DFAA-N was only similar or equal to 5%. However, these uptake rates are not sustainable. It is apparent that this organism cannot use amino-N to support significant growth, even though it can take up DFAAs. This, and the fact that the composition of the internal amino acid pool differed from that externally, is further evidence that the N-physiology of this genus is abnormal (differences to other dinoflagellates include an abnormally high concentration of glutamine and arginine, an effective absence of amine X, and release of nitrite during the concurrent assimilation of nitrate and ammonium in darkness). There is no evidence that the use of DFAAs enhance toxin content, except when cells are supplied with very high (unnatural) concentrations of arginine.

AB Sandy beach ecologists concur that natural populations living in these harsh environments are controlled almost exclusively by physical factors, biotic factors being largely irrelevant. This paper provides evidence that human-induced perturbations as well as biotic, density-dependent processes also influence sandy beach populations. Results were obtained from a long-term study (8 yr) of the artisanally harvested yellow clam Mesodesma mactroides on a Uruguayan exposed sandy beach. The study included an experimental manipulation of fishing effort based on the closure of the clam fishery for 32 consecutive months. Fine-scale demographic parameters, such as age-specific survival probability and fertility, as well as coarse-scale demographic parameters, such as age composition, elasticity to demographic parameters, adult clam density, and population growth rate, were significantly affected by fishing effort and/or adult density. These results yield useful information from the management and conservation points of view, such as the threshold range of parent stock densities and fishing mortality levels capable of supporting a sustainable yield over time. Critical demographic parameters for population growth rate are also highlighted.

TI STCW '95: Implementation issues - What is the pass mark?
SO MARINE POLICY
LA English
DT Article
DE IMO; STCW '95
AB By 1 August 1998 Regulation I/7 of the 1995 amendments to the International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watch keeping for Seafarers (1978) requires a comprehensive submission of information to the International Maritime Organization supporting an Administration's claim that it complies fully with, or is in the process of implementing, STCW '95 via policy and legislative processes. Once the complete information is received by the International Maritime Organization, the Secretary-General must submit a report to this effect to the Maritime Safety Committee. Three questions emerging from this controversial provision in STCW '95 are:
   When, if ever, is the information from an Administration complete?
   What is the time frame allocated for confirmation by the IMO Secretariat?
   How does IMO assess whether the claim by an Administration is valid?
   The absolute nature of the phraseology within Regulation I/7, in the author's view, handcuffs the certification verification process by 'competent persons'. Equally unfortunately for Administrations, STCW is mute on establishing time frames for the processing of their submissions within IMO. Conceivably, a submission by a proponent aspiring for 'white listing' may be delayed sufficiently long for the Secretary-General's report to miss the MSC regular meetings. What would be the impact of such a delay?
   Perhaps of greater importance though are two key issues linked to the third question. These issues lie at the heart of the amendments to STCW. Firstly, there is not an appeal or challenge mechanism to IMO's decision; whether it is favourable or not. It is difficult to gauge at this time either the international shipping community's reaction to an unfavourable report by IMO or an Administration's position/ policy to recognize a chastised Party's submission. Secondly, the notion of 'black- listing' an Administration for sub-standard marine certification and training may not be sustainable under international jurisprudence. Advocates for IMO's new role as a 'watchdog' of global marine certification and standardization organ far the United Nations would, no doubt, take a contraposition.
   This article attempts to illuminate the complexity of issues nested within Regulation I/7 of STCW '95. Emerging controversy could strain international relations to such an extent that the high aspirations of the Convention's drafters for marine certification transparency may not be realized.

AB Approximately 2 million people in Argentina are infected with Trypanosoma cruzi,the etiologic agent of Chagas disease, thereby constituting the major tropical disease in the country. As in other six Southern Cone countries, Triatoma infestans is the only or major vector of T. cruzi among human and domestic animals. In Argentina, a vertically structured National Chagas Control Program was established in 1962. Such a program pursued the elimination of domestic and peridomestic populations of T. infestans through insecticidal spraying, and the serological control of blood donors to prevent transfusion-related infections. This program strongly reduced the nation-wide serological prevalence of T. cruzi in the population. For example, in 18 or 20 year-old men drafted into military service, the seroprevalence decreased from 10.1% in 1964 for those who had been born in 1944 to 1.9% in 1993 for those born in 1975. However, the vertical strategy failed to reach and sustain the surveillance phase in widespread rural areas with disperse populations due to its intrinsic limitations and the reduced priority level assigned to rural health programs. An alternative, horizontally-structured control strategy of T. infestans was developed and assayed in the Province of Santiago del Estero between 1985-1989, and 1991-1992. The projects demonstrated that insecticidal spraying carried out with community participation combined effectiveness and commitment in such a way as to produce a strong impact on house reinfestation and the extension of the area under entomological surveillance. This experience has been transferred in a chain of responsibilities to the personnel of the National Chagas Control Program, using participating workshops, procedural guidelines, and practical training. This personnel transferred the strategy using similar methods to the field health care agents and volunteers chosen by their own communities (community leaders). After the workshops, the leaders received all the materials needed to install and develop the ongoing surveillance activities: third generation pyrethroid insecticides, manuals, hand-operated sprayers, and sensor boxes to detect domiciliary infestations. From 1993 to 1998, a total of 15,000 health care agents or community leaders were trained. A total of 675,000 houses were sprayed with residual insecticides in the attack phase, and 850,000 houses entered the surveillance phase. This is the first time that such large coverage has been accomplished in Argentina. The network of laboratories installed a quality assurance program to current serological procedures applied to blood donors, organ transplant, and the detection and treatment of new-borns to women seroreactive for T. cruzi in Argentina. We expect to interrupt the vector-mediated transmission of T. cruzi in the next 18 months, but the sustainability of such a program depends on, at least, additional work with the community to achieve a change of attitudes and practices related to house infestation for the next 10 years. A social effort will be needed to cover those expenses, but the expected economic returns exceed largely the cost of any such program, as suggested by cost-benefit studies. To illustrate, the annual treatment costs of one Chagas patient can help maintain 25 households free from triatomine bugs in Argentina.

AB Contemporary Russian theoretical debates on civil society can be divided between two major trends in Russian political thought, Westernism and Eurasianism, i.e., between the Russian versions of a universalist, linear modernisation theory, and a culture-centred, nationalist-oriented relativist communitarism. There are good arguments for going beyond the simplistic juxtaposition between the Westernisers, or zapadniki, and the Eurasianists in Russia. The zapadniki are mistaken in thinking they represent the only possible way of seeing Western values and progress in terms of modernisation, while the Eurasianists wrongly think that many of their particularist concerns cannot be addressed in terms of Western discourses of pluralism and democratisation. The authors argue that participatory,models of democracy offer a more plausible and sustainable view of civil society for both zapadniki and Eurasianists. Moreover, the authors suggest that the Eurasianist call for global pluralism can be better addressed by a theory of cosmopolitan democracy than a gloomy vision of a clash of civilisations.

AB An understanding of the patterns of variation within and among populations of tropical trees is essential for devising optimum genetic management strategies for their conservation and sustainable utilization. Here, random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis was used to partition variation within and among 10 populations of the endangered Afromontane medicinal tree, Prunus africana, sampled from five countries across the geographical range of the species (Cameroon, Ethiopia, Kenya, Madagascar and Uganda). Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) employed 48 RAPD markers and revealed most variation among countries (66%, P < 0.001). However, variation among individuals within populations and among populations within Cameroon and Madagascar was also highly significant. Analysis of population product frequency data indicated Ugandan material to be more similar to populations from Cameroon than populations from Kenya and Ethiopia, while Malagash populations were most distinct. The implications of these findings for determining appropriate approaches for conservation of the species, particularly in Cameroon and Madagascar, are discussed.

AB Society must make a fundamental shift in the way it views and uses natural resources if it is to ensure an ecologically supportable future. Workable solutions to the sustainable use of natural resources are constrained by many institutional barriers, narrowly focused scientific research, and compartmentalized systems of natural resource management. Novel and radical approaches are needed if humanity is to find realistic solutions to social and environmental sustainability issues that the citizenry can adopt and then adapt with matching civic skills and knowledge. Consequently, future sustainability will depend on a system of resource governance that mediates the relationship between the citizenry and the economy, on the one hand, and continuance of ecosystem functional processes, on the other. In this first in a series of two papers, we discuss the conceptual and theoretical framework behind a transdisciplinary paradigm shift that is necessary to realistically work toward future sustainability of nature and society.

AB Future sustainability of nature and society will depend on a system of resource governance that mediates the relationship between society and the economy, on the one hand, and continuance of ecosystem functional processes, on the other. By mapping the spatial extent of landscape ecological functions with social and institutional functions it may be possible to demonstrate how ecosystem functional capacity could dictate resource governance. The first paper of: this series discussed the conceptual and theoretical basis for a new research direction. Research and development of real applications are now required. New methods are needed that recognize and account for the scales of influence that interconnected social and ecosystem functional elements have on one another. Spatial information systems are a key tool in the analysis and synthesis of results and provide visualization tools to guide understanding of the results. In this second paper we further develop the methodological background of this research and demonstrate its potential application of this research through a simplified hypothetical example.

AB Jari Celulose S. A. is a Brazilian-owned industrial enterprise located along the Jari River (the first major south-flowing tributary of the Amazon). The company produces bleached kraft pulp for international and domestic sales. The raw material of this pulp production comes from the 75,000 ha of intensively managed plantations of Pinus caribaea (Morelet) and Eucalyptus spp. harvested on 10- and 6-year rotations, respectively. All currently active Jari plantations were converted from primary forest between 1968 and 1982. Silvicultural practices have been modified over successive rotations, including plantation species changes, increased intensity of site preparation, fertilization, and chemical weed control. A review of data from the early 1970s to present indicates an increase in productivity over successive rotations and several plantation locations and soil types. The reasons for this improvement are primarily related to the higher levels of silvicultural inputs and dramatic genetic gains.

AB The emphasis of plantation management changes as the resource and the market develop. This is especially the case when a plantation program is developing a new timber resource, is not the case with many of the Pinus radiata (D. Don) plantings in the southern hemisphere. Australia establishes and manages plantations of both exotic conifer and native hardwood (Eucalyptus spp.) plantations, and these vary in their stage of development. The tenure and objectives in establishment have varied, but some key aspects of the resources may be analyzed. Optimization of production per unit area was not a prime objective during the developmental stages of many exotic pine plantations. Currently, with increased commercial emphasis, this has changed to a greater focus on increased value through Site Specific Management and tree improvement through which gains of at least 20 percent are expected during the first stages. With a key objective of sustainability, questions regarding impacts of soils, water, and biological changes need consideration and are being addressed.
   The eucalypt plantation resource in Australia is smaller in extent than is the pine resource, but of increasing importance, especially as the plantations are perceived to be more environmentally and ecologically acceptable than exotic conifers. In the past, questions of productivity, especially in relation to impacts of natural pests and diseases, have been raised. Sustainability of all plantations is a critical aspect, however, for specific issues there are different emphases with different species. For example, the relatively, high removal of calcium in smooth barked Eucalyptus plantations is seen as important in long term forest management.

TI Radiata pine plantations in Chile
SO NEW FORESTS
LA English

   sustainability
AB The landscape of the southcentral part of Chile is dominated by fast-growing plantations of radiata pine (Pinus radiata D. Don), and in lesser extent bluegum eucalyptus (Eucalyptus globulus Labill.), Italian poplar, and willows. Radiata pine was first introduced in 1885 as an ornamental species. During 1940--1960 it was used to control erosion in the Coastal Range. Finally, since the 1960s it has been used for commercial plantations. The present extent of the plantation resource is 1,694,104 ha, of which 80.9 percent is radiata pine. During 1991, 1992, and 1993, this species was planted at rates of 75,416 ha, 81,868 ha, and 71,411 ha, respectively. Even though the soils are eroded to different degrees, exhibit a variety of nutritional disorders, and contain some physical restrictions, the productivity of radiata pine ranges from 18 m(3)/ha/yr to 35 m(3)/ha/yr. Additional stress comes from some potentially serious pests; for example, the European pine shoot moth, Rhyacionia buoliana, has presented a real threat to radiata pine. The main products obtained from radiata pine are exported to Japan, Korea, Middle and Far East countries, and Europe. Sawlogs, sawntimber, pulpwood, clearwood, and wood chips are some of the products comprising sales in 1994 of U.S.$1,564 billion.
   The purpose of this paper is to show how radiata pine silviculture has changed since the last part of the 1980s in Chile. Also we want to show how forestry activities have produced a profound and positive change in the social and economic environment that surrounds the areas where the industry's main production areas exist.

TI Small-scale planted forests in Zululand, South Africa: an opportunity
   for appropriate development
SO NEW FORESTS

DE contract forestry; Eucalyptus; extension; sustainability; woodlot model
ID CONTRACT
AB Forestry in South Africa is sharply divided between commercially driven private enterprise which controls 1.3 million ha of plantation forests, and government and nongovernment organizations which promote a variety of social forestry programs.
   One area of crossover is that of small-scale (1-2 ha) commercial woodlots being promoted by private timber companies as an additional source of fiber for their pulpmills, but grown and managed by individual farmers. Inputs, such as plants and fertilizers, as well as expertise in the form of extension foresters, are provided by the company, whereas the farmers supply the land and the labor. The company guarantees to buy the timber at the time of harvest. Under such arrangements, the risk is spread between the farmers and the company; the farmers assume most of the risks of production, and the company takes on the marketing risks.
   The possibilities for appropriate and sustainable development do exist under such a program, but issues involving both ecological and social sustainability must be addressed. This paper suggests that four key characteristics are needed to achieve appropriate development in Zululand. These characteristics are participation, flexibility, empowerment, and commitment. When compared to the current arrangement, the company would have to make a fundamental paradigm shift to achieve these goals. However, the long-term support of the farmers, and ultimately more fiber in the mills, would be the reward.

TI Sustainability issues in Switzerland's forests
SO NEW FORESTS
LA English
DT Article
DE age structure; consumption; forest functions; forest history;
   regeneration
AB Basically there are three methods of regenerating a forest: sowing, planting, and natural regeneration. In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, large forested areas of Switzerland were devastated by exploitation and grazing within the forest borders. A significant percentage of these areas was regenerated by planting seedlings. Thus, the Swiss landscape is the result of both land use and cultural history. Today practically no old virgin forests remain.
   Forests in Switzerland are required to meet diverse expectations. They function as a means of protection against avalanches, rock falls, and landslides; a source of wood; a natural habitat for animals and plants; and areas for recreation and tourism. Forest management aims to ensure all of these functions on a long-term, sustainable basis. Several problems exist with regard to sustainability in Swiss forests. Data from the Swiss National Forest Inventory reveal that the age structure is off balance, i.e., that there are too many old and not enough young forests. In addition, only two-thirds of the potential Swiss timber yield is harvested, whereas wood is imported from foreign regions where no control over the type of forest management is possible. Without a reduction in the demand for and consumption of wood, this practice, over the long term, is not a sustainable management option. The matter also raises ethical questions, e.g., is it correct to practice nature conservation in your own country while at the same time using wood produced under unsustainable conditions elsewhere?

AB Insect communities from a range of successional vegetation stages on the central North Island volcanic plateau were characterised and compared using Malaise trapped beetle samples. Results were derived from sampling series conducted in a total of ten sites over three separate summers. Divisive classification successfully grouped samples according to four main habitat types despite temporal and spatial separation of samples within these groups. A four-week period in early summer was found to be optimum for sample discrimination according to the main vegetation types. Component species and the functional (trophic) structure of samples showed a relationship with generic habitat types as well as reflecting attributes of the individual sites sampled. The most useful information was derived from the identity of the biological entities rather than simply from numerical relationships. Use of this pragmatic methodology has potential to improve our ecosystem understanding and the sustainable management of the dominant area of terrestrial biodiversity provided sufficient attention is given to standardisation, particularly of taxonomy.

AB Recycling has become an integral pan of everyday life as we become sensitized to the finite nature of our natural resources. A conscious effort is being made to move away from the "throw away" society of the past and progress towards a more sustainable and environmentally friendly use of these valuable resources.
   Recycling can be justified in different ways but the environmental impact takes priority. In the nuclear industry, different types of material are produced which have to be disposed of in one way or another.
   Why does the recycling of nuclear fuel provoke a reaction which is so illogical in light of the facts, and so different to the reaction towards other forms of recycling? Utilities, governments and the general public all have their own reasons and the challenge for the nuclear industry over the next ten years will be to show that their apprehensions are misguided and that recycling is the most environmentally sound option. It may prove to be the most important factor contributing to the future success of the nuclear industry as a whole.

AB The subsistence rice fanning of the prechemical era efficiently sustained the N status of soils by maintaining a balance between N loss and N gain from biological N2 fixation. Intensive monocropping with excessive use of chemical N fertilizers has raised many concerns about N sustainability in lowland rice soils. Long-term fertilizer experiments in India and the Philippines recorded declining N availability to lowland rice over the years, regardless of the changes in total N content of the soils. While total N content was maintained in soils continuously flooded or saturated, there are indications showing its decline in soils subjected to drying and flooding cycles. Obviously, N supply in the lowlands is dependent not only on total soil N content but also on N transformations, root access, accumulation of reducing substances, and associated factors that govern N availability to plants. Recent research has identified several factors responsible for the declining N content in lowland soils: nitrate accumulation in soils during the dry phase followed by its loss on reflooding, small amounts of crop residues returned to the soils, little use of organic manures and symbiotic N2 fixing systems, and heavy loss of applied fertilizer N. Continuous flooding and intense puddling greatly reduce permeability, allow accumulation of reducing substances in the rhizosphere, and retard mineralization and N uptake in some soils. Further, shallow tillage practiced in intensively cropped lowlands often reduces plow layer thickness (to <15 cm) and nutrient availability from subsoil layers. This paper discusses these issues and suggests various options to help sustain the N fertility and productivity of lowland rice soils.

TI Integrated Coastal Zone Management: commitments and developments from an
   International, European, and United Kingdom perspective
SO OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB The paper looks at recent developments in Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM). It considers the influence of global and international instruments on national policies and it takes the United Kingdom as an illustration of contemporary commitments of a European country to ICZM. It further reflects on how recent initiatives may change the perception of the role of coastal sciences and management in decision making. It looks at the entanglement of legal frameworks at various levels, including the role of government departments and agencies and non-governmental organisations (NGOs). NGOs are considered, here, as important agents on the international stage. The availability and the reliability of scientific information are recognised to be the critical factor, which can influence public opinion. In particular, it is shown that there is a great need for ecological interdisciplinary studies, which would provide material for rational action. Despite new policies, it is made clear that concrete actions are still to be taken in order to achieve sustainable development and avoid natural resources destruction or degradation. The need for a holistic approach to ICZM, including education and the dissemination of scientific information, is emphasised. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

SO OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB Successful coastal zone management (CZM) requires the participation of five sectors: local people, government authorities, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), scientists and investors. NGOs must play an important role in providing the opportunities for all sectors to meet and talk with each other. All the parties involved should have the chance to express and exchange their opinions. They should be able to discuss the problems they are facing and how they would like them to be solved. When all needs and problems have been discussed scientists or academics could then provide their expertise in formulating the CZM plan. The plan should reflect all the needs each sector has expressed as well as mitigation measures for implementation. Such- a co-management process should result in a satisfactory and sustainable CZM plan. This plan should be monitored and revised whenever it is seen fit. This is the pattern that Thailand is experiencing. (C) 1999 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

DT Article
ID STATES
AB This paper is the introduction to a Special Issue Progress on Ocean and Coastal Management in Latin America: Experiences Towards Sustainable Development. This volume presents a variety of perspectives on the meaning, forms, methods, international cooperation, and experiences in integrated coastal management in 14 countries through 13 papers authored by experts in Latin American experiences. At present, the new international forums and the economic and environmental globalization induce different strategies for evaluating the real problems and advance towards planning the integrated coastal management, both from a national or regional perspective. At the opening of the new millenium Latin America has new scenarios under NAFTA, MERCOSUR, APEC, CARICOM, moreover a number of bi- or trilateral international agreements. The purpose of this Special Issue is to expose various definitions and points of view on integrated coastal management, providing an up-to-date assessment of key issues and country experiences, but not necessarily to resolving or reconciling divergent perspectives. Latin America is a "new world mosaic". A mosaic of authors' training and experiences; of roots and cultural/heritage resources; of social development; of ecosystems and ecological approaches; of biogeographical regions and biodiversity; of climatic zones; of pristine areas as well as highly degraded zones. This Special Issue has four key word/concepts in its title: (a) coastal zone; (b) integrated coastal zone management; (c) sustainable development, and (d) Latin America. In this introductory paper I offer what are the terms of reference meaning of each of this concern, as a framework for the invited papers/countries included in this volume. In the last section each contribution is summarized and a classification inside "coastal management techniques" is presented, concluding that the papers incise on: Coastal management plans, Land-use zoning and setbacks, Marine protected areas, Management and restoration of coastal habitats, Coastal pollution control, Shoreline stabilization, Close access regimes, Capacity building, inter-agency coordination, Conflict resolutions, Environmental assessment, and international cooperation. The variations in scope and the amount of progress made by different Latin American countries show the difficulty of creating a single integrating management approach. Nevertheless, at the opening of the new millenium Latin America will arrive at a competitive maturity stage concerning ICZM. (C) 1999 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd, All rights reserved.

TI Fundacion Chile and the integrated management of the coastal zone
SO OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB Chile has a very diverse and variable coastal zone, with a series of phenomena that occur unexpectedly and which demand great flexibility from the management models that are implemented. The oceanographic characteristics have provided Chile's coastal zone with important pelagic fisheries in the country's north and center and benthonic fisheries in the south. They have also led to the explosive growth of aquaculture in the last ten years, mostly in the canals zone. In the northern and central regions, megaprojects have dominated coastal zone investments and are about to go into the far north. Also a sustained population increase in central and southern coastal areas is expected as a consequence of the saturation of big cities and development in road, transport and communications.
   The incorporation of Chile into trade blocks such as APEC, NAFTA, and MERCOSUR together with some recently signed bilateral trade treaties will undoubtedly give a push to the port activity. The construction of different corridors throughout the country that will provide access to the Pacific for some regions in Brazil, Paraguay, Bolivia and Argentina will have a similar effect.
   Alterations in the quality of the environment (Pollution), threats to the coastal zone's diversity (exhausted resources) and conflicts among users are mentioned among the principal problems affecting coastal zone urging for an integrated management approach for this critical and sensitive area.
   A coastal zone management plan for Chile, more than creating new regulations, many of which already exist, should be able to set up effective mechanisms among the different sectors involved in the use of the coastal zone, generate mechanisms to resolve differences, provide adequate scientific and technical information for decision making and establish simple and realistic mechanisms for education and citizen participation. The National Management Plan should be essentially FOCUSED, REGIONALIZED, INTEGRATED AND INFORMED. In fact, the basic idea promoted by Fundacion Chile and the Navy's Maritime Territory National Board would be to generate a system supported by one or two central coordinating institutions articulated with regional institutions, which would carry out the above-mentioned objectives. The greatest benefit of a Plan like this one is that Chile's coastal zone and its resources can be used sustainably with the appropriate mechanisms, but in an informed and integrated way and respect regional and local peculiarities. Some of the major features of this approach are presented and discussed here. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Situation of integrated coastal zone management in Central America:
   Experiences of the IUCN wetlands and coastal zone conservation program
SO OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB Central American coastal zones possess extensive scenic and geographical wealth as well as great biological diversity. These coasts maintain 21.6% of the region's population and produce at least US$ 750 million alone in fishing activities that provide work and sustenance for more than 450000 persons in the region. Eight percent of the world's mangroves are located in Central America, as well as the second largest corral reef barrier on the planet. A good representation of the region's natural heritage is conserved in approximately 110 protected areas. Due to these special conditions, at least 50% of Central America's coastal zones is devoted to tourism, one of the three primary economic activities in four of the region's countries. Integrated coastal zone management (ICZM) in this region has been limited by information gaps, restricted technical and financial capacity, and strong sectoralism. Some recent projects, both governmental and supported by:NGOs, offer new experience and lessons on regional ICZM. These initiatives have been backed at the ministerial and presidential level by a large number of political agreements within the framework of the 'alliance for sustainable development' (ALIDES).

TI Integrating science and management on coastal marine protected areas in
   the Southern Gulf of Mexico
SO OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB The coastal zone of the State of Campeche have some of the Gulf of Mexico's richest ecosystems characterized by extensive seagrasses, mangrove forests, low-land tidal wetlands, a broad deltaic environment, including the Usumacinta/Laguna de Terminos estuarine ecosystem, and extensive low salinities and brackish wetlands in the Petenes region, Commercial and artisanal fishing, maritime transport, agriculture and cattle grazing in low-land areas, urban expansion, building of highways, and tourism, are important economics activities that are increasing in the State of Campeche. However, the growth needs to occur in a sustainable manner with adequate protection of the coastal ecosystems. The theoretical approach and conceptual basis of the integrated coastal management plan are based on 20 years of scientific research in the region; and from 1990 to the present, a number of projects have been completed which serve as case studies of coastal management coupling science, technology, public participation, and policymaking in the southern Gulf of Mexico. After developing seven "study case" integrating science into policymaking, a management approach was developed considering four main actions: promotion of institutional arrangements, so that the multi-sectorial planning approach be considered in coastal resources development; strengthening of public awareness related to coastal resources management policies and capabilities; gathering, analysis and dissemination of information related to coastal resources development; and provision of technical solutions to coastal resources uses in conflict. Finally this is a case study where science played a significant role in the politics of the policy process, both in protecting key estuarine ecosystem and the planning process defining the ICZM plans.

TI Towards sustainable fisheries: a strategy for FAO and the World Bank
SO OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB The state of many fisheries and fishery resources requires a major change in development and management policies and strategies, at national and regional levels. The international Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries, adopted in FAO in 1995, provides the operational framework for such change, in all fisheries, in the oceans, inland waters, EEZs, international waters, as well as in aquaculture. In their respective areas of competence and in close collaboration, FAO and the World Bank are committed to facilitate the implementation of the Code by fishing and coastal nations. This paper presents the strategy they have developed for the purpose. The paper elaborates on: (1) the main policy-related issues faced by fisheries worldwide (bioecological, technological, economic, socio-cultural, institutional and legal, as well as scientific); (2) the Code of Conduct, its background, structure and scope; (3) the basis of the implementation strategy by FAO and the Bank; and the main types of activities involved at global, regional and national levels. In conclusion it describes briefly the main elements of changes imbedded in the strategy and shows that the implementation by FAO and the Bank as well as by the countries has already actively started.

TI Coastal hazards and associated management issues on South Pacific
   Islands
SO OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
ID EL-NINO; GROWTH
AB An understanding of natural coastal hazards is essential for the safe and sustainable development of the small island states in the South Pacific. This paper describes the roles of coastal geology and oceanography in the analysis of impacts due to fluctuating water levels and wave damage from cyclones. The examples include coastal erosion, flooding and wave damage in a range of island settings. As seen in Tarawa, rapid erosion and accretion can result from both short-lived storms as well as transient sub-decadal water-level changes related to El Nino and the Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Cyclone waves are responsible for extensive damage in low-lying atolls and on the coastal fringes of high islands. Observed cyclone wave impacts in Niue demonstrate that even infrastructure perched on 20 m cliffs may not be immune during severe storms. These examples demonstrate that integrated coastal management (ICM) plans, to be successful, must explicitly incorporate a realistic range of coastal processes and responses based on an understanding of the physical environment. It should be noted that much ICM begins with institutional and policy issues and incorporates science as a secondary component. When science is introduced, much emphasis is placed on biological issues and on infrastructure development, while non-living resources and physical shore processes are sometimes overlook. As we hope the examples in this paper demonstrate, the geological oceanographic context may be absolutely fundamental to the recognition of hazards, delineation of risk, and prediction of changes that may occur from any manipulation in the coastal system.

TI Sustainable use of renewable resources and conservation in the Red Sea
   and Gulf of Aden: issues, needs and strategic actions
SO OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
ID CORAL-REEFS; BALTIC-SEA; BLACK-SEA; AGRICULTURE
AB The coastal and marine environments and resources of the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden are globally significant and generally in a healthy state. Current regional issues include localized destruction of coral reefs, seagrass and mangroves; declines in some fisheries; exploitation of some endangered species; pollution from the development and transport of petroleum; and disposal of industrial and municipal wastes. The underlying causes of these issues are the natural vulnerability of the Red Sea due to its semi-enclosed nature; economic reliance on the petroleum industry; significant navigation risks; a rapidly increasing coastal population and associated developments; lack of fisheries information, surveillance and management; poor coastal zone planning; and limited technical expertise. Strategic actions addressing these issues will need to be implemented regionally and focus on coastal zone management that integrates environmental planning, environmental assessment and review; training and institutional development; public awareness and participation; information gathering especially fisheries statistics: reducing navigation risks; and the development of resource management and conservation strategies.

SO OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT
LA English

ID PACIFIC ISLANDS; LESSONS
AB Community-level coastal management programs are being introduced in some countries as a practical strategy to respond to conditions of poverty and unsustainable resource use practices. Two recently developed Special Area Management (SAM) programs developed in Sri Lanka are part of this international trend. These two SAM programs were assessed to identify planning and early management issues that may be relevant to future projects. This paper examines general issues in assessing community-level projects. The particular focus is on a few issues of general relevance: community participation in the planning process; the adequacy of the boundary; quality of the technical analysis; adequacy of resource management activities; transparency of management decisions; community acceptance of the program; and sustainability of resource management activities.

TI Sub-Saharan African multilateral programmes for coastal management: how
   well have they performed?
SO OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
ID EASTERN AFRICA
AB Regional multilateral arrangements potentially have a strong role to play in supporting coastal management, particularly in developing countries. This article examines how well such multilateral arrangements have performed in sub-Saharan Africa. It, firstly, develops a conceptual framework which identifies key elements of regional multilateral arrangements and the functions they could potentially fulfil. Secondly, the article describes and evaluates the performance of five multilateral arrangements currently operating in sub-Saharan Africa. It finds that these arrangements have resulted in the development of a constituency of skilled and committed people and the building up of considerable practical experience in coastal management. In addition, the region appears to have a somewhat out-dated but adequate legal framework for joint action on coastal management. A key issue to be addressed is the establishment of a financially viable and effective regional institutional base, as well as an effective programme, to support the implementation of the Nairobi and Abidjan Conventions and Protocols. In addition, substantial external resources need to be mobilised to support regional coastal management efforts in the short-to-medium term. Long-term sustainability will require building further capacity in coastal management as well as developing a much closer involvement of the private sector than has occurred to date.

SO OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT
LA English

ID BAHAMAS
AB The history, methods, problems and regulation of fishing of the last remaining large queen conch resource in the world, located on a Jamaican fishing bank, are examined. The fishery activities for the queen conch, Strombus gigas Linnaeus are briefly described,with the main activities in the industrial sector which produce the bulk of the harvest, which is exported. There are a few:large producers harvesting the single major fishing ground of Pedro Bank, southwest of Kingston. These fishers harvested at least 1500 t annually between 1992 and 1998. Management is by licensing, individual quotas and a close season from July to:October. Regulations related to CITES are thought to greatly assist in making licensed harvesters provide catch data to the Fisheries Division. The industrial operators have provided funding to undertake stock assessment studies in 1994 and again in 1997. We highlight the focus oh management on a participatory consensual approach with meetings with all players in the industry. The conch fishery is thought to be one of the few areas of the Jamaica fishery where there is close and successful collaboration between fishers and the Fisheries Division. It provides an example of how: rapid, precautionary, participatory action can provide an adequate basis for management until more definitive scientific information becomes available. The status of the conch fishery is thought to be sustainable at present, once reductions are made to the annual quota. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

   RICHNESS; DISTRIBUTIONS; COLONIZATION; VERTEBRATES; STATISTICS
AB The presence or absence of 75 forest-core plant species in 156 forest fragments in Western Belgium was surveyed. We performed a nestedness analysis both at the total species pool level and at the individual species level. Community composition of these plant species seemed to exhibit a highly significant nested subset pattern. We tested the classic hypotheses concerning the ecological mechanisms generating nestedness, i.e. stochastic species extinction and differential colonization. Neither patch area nor patch isolation, however, adequately explained the species nestedness pattern, hence our conclusion that these variables are of little use in predicting the ultimate plant species composition of a forest fragment. We then derived a complex synthetic habitat diversity measure for each forest fragment and ranked the patches accordingly. The resulting plant species occurrence patterns approximated the nestedness pattern very closely. Hence we suggest that nested plant species assemblages result in the first place from nested habitats, and that species diversity in forest fragments is determined primarily by habitat diversity and is predictable on the basis thereof. Nested species subsets are not generated by differences in minimal sustainable population sizes between species but by differences in habitat specialization. We conclude that forest plant species extinctions in Western Belgium mere probably not caused by patch-area-dependent stochastic extinction processes resulting from shrinking forest size (i.e. species relaxation), but in contrast must have their origin in deterministic processes caused by overall habitat deterioration. We also learned from our dataset that a significantly positive species-area relationship and significant species nestedness do not necessary imply that one large forest fragment supports more species than several small patches of the same total size. This result is also associated with habitat diversity and the intrinsic high sensitiveness of forest-core plant species.

   Reflexive heterogeneity as a possible answer
SO OSTERREICHISCHE ZEITSCHRIFT FUR POLITIKWISSENSCHAFT

DT Article
ID IDENTITY
AB Politics, which are to secure a sustainable development of democracy and to find answers to the enduring pluralism of ethnic groups, cultures and lifestyles, should be oriented towards basic democratic values such as equality and justice. This plays an important role in granting stability for democracies. Different ideologies including a wide range from liberalism to Marxism and various democratic models still are inherently hostile to ethnic and cultural pluralism today. New answers need new terms. Basic terms of socializing, particularly the term "ethnicity", have to be scrutinised. It is argued that a relational concept of ethnicity can be a part of understanding collective and individual positioning in intersecting systems of differences, such as culture, gender and class. The aim is to formulate a new concept of handling cultural pluralism in democratic states, called reflexive heterogeneity. This concept should open up a space, in which different understandings of identity are not treated;ls deviations from a monistic norm but as variants that can be held in balance.

AB The Southeast Asian economies, more particularly the ASEAN-5 of Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore and Thailand, have been pursuing an increasingly outward-oriented, export-led and foreign direct investment-led development strategy. This has contributed to high growth performance and structural transformation in recent decades, as trade and FDI enable these economies to overcome the constraints of small domestic markets and narrow resource bases; exploit comparative advantage and scale economies; access foreign capital, technology and managerial and marketing expertise. However, there has been some questioning of the sustainability of the Southeast Asian model, particularly in the light of the regional currency and financial crisis that has engulfed the region since July 1997. The crisis has not negated the role of trade and has strengthened the role of FDI. Opening capital accounts and domestic financial systems without putting in place measures to strengthen the latter, including prudential regulations and monitoring and surveillance mechanisms, have exposed these economies to the downside of volatile short-term capital flows. Measures are being undertaken to remove the weaknesses in the economies revealed by the crisis, resulting in more efficient, transparent and equitable economic systems. Together with some of the fundamentals which contributed to past high growth, these economies will recover their economic dynamism and the economic miracle can resume.

TI Re-empowering the empowered - the ultimate challenge?
SO PERSONNEL REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
DE corporate culture; empowerment; hotels; human resource management;
   organizational change
AB Evidence to date shows a divergence in the methods and approaches used by companies to introduce empowerment and indeed a wide debate as to the meaning and appropriateness of the term itself. The popularity of the concept has led many organisations to "dive in at the deep end", wanting to experience the benefits of empowerment without perhaps stopping to consider the wider implications and consequences. This paper reports on the approach that one hotel company adopted to re-introduce empowerment, a previous attempt having failed. It provides an insight into differing perceptions of the meaning of empowerment between employees and managers; the positive and negative experiences of those working in an empowerment culture and the changes required for a renewed attempt at introducing empowerment to be successful. The authors conclude that "quick fix" strategies will rarely be successful and urge the development of a longer-term, more sustainable, approach.

DE fertilization; semi-arid; stocking rate; weight gain
AB The experiment was carried out in Sobral, Ceara, Brazil, from January 1992 to July 1994, with the objective of determining the productive performance of lambs, forage production, and frequency of the species of the herbaceous layer of a thinned caatinga, under organic fertilization and short duration grazing, with two stocking rates. The stocking rates were 3.3 (light) and 10.0 heads/ha (heavy), with (5.0 ton/ha of goat manure) and without fertilization. A complete randomized design was followed, with a factorial distribution of 2 x 2 x 3 (stocking rate x fertilization x year), with two repetitions. Sheep grazing resulted in total disapearing of the grass species and an increasing of the forbs, along the period of study. The organic fertilization did not show significant effects (P>0.05) on the animal and pasture performances. The best animal performance (P<0.01) was observed on the padocks under light stocking rate (3.3 head/ha), with 108.0 g/head/day, and the best performance (P<0.01) of the pasture was obtained on the areas under heavy stocking rate (10 head/ha), with 71.2 kg/ha/year. Although, the short duration grazing with sheep presented high performance by the animals and by the pasture, it should not be recommended for the thinned caatinga, because it unbalances the herbaceous layer composition, the principal source of the diet of those ruminants. Possibly, the alternate grazing with other herbivorous of different grazing habit and diet composition may result on a beter sustainability of the exploration.

AB Indigenous peoples traditionally use a wide range of plants to maintain their health. Western medicine has benefited substantially from anecdotal results of their empirical methodology by selecting candidates for a currently inadequate pharmacopeia to treat large numbers of illnesses. As a result of collaborative agreements established between the Aguaruna people of northern Peru, three research universities, and the G.D. Searle corporate partnership, the ICBG project in Pent initiated research to examine ethnomedicinally-targeted plants based on the Aguaruna pharmacopeia involving a wide ranges of diseases and syndromes. Results of biodirected screening against malaria and allied protozoans, leishmania, and diarrhea, for example, showed significant inhibition of these organisms in vitro based on targeted medicinal plants used by the Aguarunas. Tuberculosis inhibition in vitro was also marked among certain plants that are medicinal, although not specifically targeted to treat tuberculosis. All extracts are being tested in toxicity assays leading to selections for antitumor screening and in cardiovascular, antidiabetic, and antiinflammatory screenings. Those found active are undergoing fractionation and chemical characterization to identify the efficacious compounds. Biodiversity inventories, conservation and sustainable management programs, and training and educational initiatives forming part of the ICBG-Peru project ave summarized.

AB The main focus of the African ICBG project is the establishment of an integrated program for the discovery of biologically active plants for drug development and biodiversity conservation, and at the same time ensure that local communities and source countries derive maximum benefits for their biological resources and their intellectual contribution. Although the project has three main sub-themes (biodiversity conservation, sustainable development and drug discovery), integration was emphasized from the conception of the program and has remained a fundamental point in the execution of various projects under this program. As a result. the African ICBG program differs in many ways from similar projects elsewhere. The African ICBG is a collaboration of the Waiter Reed Army Institute of Research, Washington, DC (WRAIR), Bioresources Development and Conservation programme (BDCP), the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute. and nine other institutions in Cameroon. Nigeria and the United States of America. Scientists front the participating developing countries are involved in all aspects of the program so that information, principles and procedures developed during this work will be internalized in Africa and extended beyond the duration of the proposed project. The drug discovery component has yielded many lead compounds with potential for the treatment of malaria, leishmaniasis, trypanosomiasis, trichomonas, opportunistic infections, AIDS and other viral infections. Activity of some of the compounds is being optimized through chemical modifications.

AB This ICBG program links the discovery of drugs and genes for agriculture with biodiversity conservation. We employ a combination of approaches including technology transfer to panama, the development of Panama's scientific infrastructure for drug and gene discovery, the training of Panamanian scientists, the involvement of seven Panamanian laboratories in research, and the equitable sharing of revenues among a diversity Of Panamanian institutions. In Panama, we will conduct assays to detect activity against cancer HIV, malaria, Trypanosoma cruzi (the causative agent of Chagas' disease), leishmaniasis and agricultural pests. Monsanto Company Mill also test samples in their pharmaceutical and agricultural screens. provide NMR spectra, as well as provide training for Panamanian scientists. Any royalties or milestones received from commercialization will be shared among (i) a find of the Panamanian government that supports the national park system, (ii) a Panamanian foundation funding conservation and sustainable development projects, and (iii) the three collaborating scientific institutions. In collaboration with Conservation International, we will help indigenous communities record their ethnobotanical traditions and provide educational and internship programs for indigenous participants. For collecting biological materials, we employ the use of novel ecological criteria to increase the probability of discovering active compounds. Our data suggest that the application of Ecological principles to the collecting of plants, insects and fungi will provide samples with greater activity in biological assays than samples collected at random. Using Ecological insight for collection, promoting infrastructure development, and returning benefits to a broad range of institutions will have maximal impact on conservation both in the short- and long-term.

AB One of the most recently funded groups, known as the Maya ICBG, is being carried out in the Highland region of Chiapas Mexico. The area of study is based on cultural and linguistic factors as well as topographical and environmental characteristics. Although the Maya ICBG is primarily driven by ethnoscientific principles, a concurrent regional botanical survey is being undertaken as part of the biodiversity conservation commitment of the program. This survey will also yield opportunities for random collection of botanical species that will be subjected to phytochemical and pharmacological analysis to test the relative efficiency of ethnomedically driven vs. random screening. This ICBG also differs from sister groups in that one Associate Program is dedicated to community development, natural resource and cultural conservation. It is our goal to develop natural products for rite alternative therapy market and agroecological programs, as well as to discover and develop patentable pharmaceuticals. A major emphasis of the group is to return cultural as well as economic benefits in the form of books, videos, and community gardens, to name a few. Lack of well-defined laws governing biotechnological research and development in Mexico has contributed to a prolonged delay in initiation of the screening programs of Associate Program 1. However, we currently report progress to date in Associate Programs 2 and 3 including technology transfer capacity building, community development, and botanical surveys.

AB Foliar gas exchange characteristics, understorey microclimate, and crown irradiation were assessed for saplings of eight canopy tree species in two plots of neotropical rain forest with different degrees of canopy opening. Species studied belonged to different putative guilds: shade intolerants (both short-lived-pioneers-and long-lived), intermediates, and shade-tolerants. A considerable overlap was recorded between species in values of the photosynthetic rate per unit leaf area (P-N) The highest median P-N (1.26 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) was recorded in the pioneer Croton killipianus, while slightly lower median values were recorded in Simarouba amara and Pentaclethra macroloba, and markedly lower values in two species of Vochysiaccae (Qualea paraense and Vochysia ferruginea), both putative intolerants. Highest median stomatal conductance (g(s)) was also shown by C. killipianus, while S. amara, P. macroloba, and L. procera exhibited intermediate values, and the lowest Rs was shown by V. ferruginea and Q. paraense. Overall irradiance and crown irradiation, P-N, and g(s) of saplings were higher in the plot which had previously received a silvicultural treatment. Most values of photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) were <100 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) in both plots, with shortlived peaks of up to 2000 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) in the treated plot. When the relationship between P-N and irradiance (I) was examined by fitting P-N/I curves, the degree of fit varied markedly between species, values of the regression coefficient r(2) were between 0.09 and 0.51. No significant differences between species were recorded in P-max and species also demonstrated little variation in the predicted values of dark respiration (R-D), values varying between -0.51 and -1.46 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) in Q. paraense and Minquartia guianensis, respectively. Fitted values of apparent quantum efficiency were also fairly uniform, generally falling within the range 0.02-0.03 mol(CO2) mol(-1)(photon).

AB Effective river basin management (RBM) is the key to sustainable development. Within river basins, land and water, surface water and groundwater, and water quantity and water quality interact in many different ways. To prevent overuse and degradation, prudent management is necessary that pays due attention to these interrelations. Especially in international river basins this poses big problems as the interests of upstream and downstream countries often conflict.
   This paper discusses six perspectives on international RBM, caned 'natural science', 'engineering', 'social optimisation', 'law', 'decision making' and 'ethics'. Each perspective highlights some aspects of RBM while disregarding others. To promote sustainable development, actual RBM and applied research supporting RBM should incorporate all the different perspectives. In more fundamental research it may be advisable to use just one perspective. Yet, also in fundamental research it is crucial to recognise not only the possibilities, but also the limitations of the perspective applied. Moreover, the different (monodisciplinary) perspectives can be enriched by borrowing elements from other perspectives (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

DT Article
AB Water is a finite resource which is unevenly distributed in time and space and which becomes progressively scarce as demand increases for its various competing uses.
   Where the water resources are shared by more than one slate, the sharing of this finite resource can become complex and problematic bearing in mind the different social, environmental and economic needs of each riparian state, the differing state priorities, water pricing policies and economic development levels among other differences. This paper attempts to analyse how the riparian states of the Zambezi River Basin may arrive best at equitably and sustainably sharing the water resources of the Zambezi River Basin by proposing adoption of various principles and policies which should build on and support the project outputs of the Zambezi River Basin Action Plan which is currently being undertaken for the Zambezi River Basin.

AB The Dutch history of water policy shows different phases, in which every new historical stage adds new policy objects to the existing ones. This century a sectoral interpretation of water management emerged, it was followed by the nowadays generally accepted ideas of "integrated water management". A study of new developments in water management however, leads to the conclusion that yet another concept appears. Referring to the principle that the water policy agencies are in an interactive dialogue with watersystem and society system, it can be called "interactive water management". The basic elements, such as interaction, water system approach, integration and sustainability are in line with several global trends and are generally supported by publications with global impact on issues of environment and water. Some of the elements are already put into practice, for example in the international river basin commissions for the river Rhine or in the USA-Canadian and USA-Mexican water commissions. Questions to be answered concern the advantages and disadvantages of these new developments and what can be said about suitable institutional arrangements. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB Lignite and pyrite contents in the dump materials of the Lusatian opencast mining district in East Germany result in high acidification and salinization potentials. These extreme conditions require considerable amounts of alkaline materials like ash or lime to enable recultivation and revegetation. Investigations at chronosequence sites on different mining substrates show characteristic developments of the soil solution chemistry. Processes like weathering of primary and formation of secondary mineral phases, acid production and buffering, and their impacts on both the solid and the liquid soil phase result in high temporal and spatial dynamics especially in the initial phase of soil and ecosystem development. To study these processes we continuously collected soil solutions from different soil depths at seven sites with two representative soil substrates. All sites were afforested with pine and cover stand ages from 1 to 60 yr. The results show that actual pyrite oxidation occurs at the youngest sites on lignite and pyrite containing substrates leading to extremely low pH values and high Fen+ and SO42- concentrations. The considerable acid production causes weathering of aluminium silicates resulting in high Aln+ concentrations. Ca2+ concentrations are unexpectedly high even at low pH showing no correlation to amelioration amounts or depths. Therefore it seems most probable that these mining substrates contain geogenic Ca sources. The transport of dissolved weathering products is limited due to low leaching rates enabling formation of secondary phases which control the actual composition of the soil solution. Depth gradients of the soil solution composition at the chronosequence sites point to a gradual transport and leaching of these secondary phases from the soil profiles. Soil solution composition and dynamics at lignite and pyrite free sites show completely different patterns and have a high er potential for successful sustainable recultivation.

AB The physical and chemical responses of a degraded sandy clay loam Ultisol to two leguminous and four grass cover crops in southern Nigeria were studied after five years to assess the rejuvenative effects of the covers. There were relative increases of 26% and 112% in soil organic carbon and phosphorus levels and also appreciable improvements in the CEC and Ca levels under vegetative covers compared with the initial conditions. The improvements were more pronounced with legume covers than with grass covers. Furthermore, the vegetative covers improved mean organic carbon level by 28% and appreciably improved mean CEC, Ca, and Mg levels over the values for the bare soils. The percentage of water-stable aggregates >1.0 mm was significantly reduced under bare fallow ((x) over bar = 27.7%) compared with soils under vegetative cover N (x) over bar = 79.3%). The correlation between water-stable aggregates > 1.0 mm and exchangeable aluminum was negative and significant (r = 0.705 degrees) at p = 0.05. There were highly significant treatment effects (P = 0.01) for penetrometer resistance, pore size distribution, water infiltration, water retention and saturated hydraulic conductivity. Grass and legume fallows which protect the soil and guarantee regular additions of organic materials are ecologically sound and socially acceptable components of sustainable agricultural production. Indications, however, are that this degraded tropical Ultisol would require a period exceeding five years under vegetative covers for restoration of its fertility to acceptable productive status.

AB Declines in soil organic mailer (SOM) have occurred in most rainfed rice cropping systems in the world. Such declines threaten the sustainability of these systems and steps need to be taken to reverse the decline. Paired soil samples collected from forest and cropped areas in Northeast Thailand revealed an approximately 70% decline in both labile carbon (C-L) and total carbon (C-T) in the surface 10 cm as a result of cropping. C-L was found to be higher in the 20-40 cm soil layer in the cropped than the forest soil indicating C leaching or soil mixing.
   In a field experiment it was found that C-L, and a calculated Carbon Management Index (CMI), increased with annual applications of low rates (1500 kg/ha dry matter) of leaf litter from Cajanus cajan, Phyllanthus taxodifolius, Acacia auriculiformis and Samanae saman. Five seasons of leaf litter application increased the C-T pool by 24-37% and more than doubled C-L and soil C lability. The retention of rice straw improved C-T in the first year of the trial but led to no significant increases in subsequent years. Higher rates of fertilisers did not result in increased soil C, despite increased yields.
   Crop residues, leaf litters and green manures with slow breakdown rates are needed to rehabilitate soil C. C-L and the CMI can be used effectively to monitor the rate of change in soil C.

AB The maintenance of soil organic matter (SOM) and the balancing of nutrient flows into and out of the rainfed rice cropping systems in Northeast Thailand is of paramount importance to arresting the decline in soil fertility and crop yields. A system where small applications of leaf litters from locally grown trees are applied annually to rice paddy soils prior to transplanting is described. The annual application of 1500 kg/ha of Cajanus cajan, Acacia auriculiformis, Phyllanthus taxodifolius and Samanea saman for five seasons resulted in increases in rice grain yield of 48, 35, 32 and 23% above the no-leaf litter control, respectively. Average annual nutrient inputs from the leaf litters, in kg/ha, ranged from 62.7 N, 3.9 P, 17.9 K, and 3.5 S for Cajanus cajan to 24.5 N, 1.5 P, 8.1 K and 2.0 S for Acacia auriculiformis. Nutrient balances, determined by the difference between the inputs (fertiliser and added leaf litters) and outputs (grain and straw) indicated net positive N and P balances of up to 457 and 60 kg/ha. respectively, after five seasons of leaf litter applications. Sulfur and potassium balances resulted in net deficits of up to -3 and -52 kg S and K/ha, respectively, where no leaf litter was applied and rice straw was removed following harvest. Calculated apparent nutrient recoveries reflected the decomposition rate of the added residues and were highest for P and K, reflecting their higher soil residual value than mobile nutrients such as N and S. Sustainable farming systems will require that crop yields are stable through the maintenance of soil fertility and the balance of nutrients in the system.

AB The magnetic island width during long-pulse, high-BN discharges was evaluated by measuring oscillations of electron cyclotron emission using a heterodyne radiometer. Because of its high spatial resolution of about 2 cm, evolution of the magnetic island structure can be measured in detail. The island width increases with the amplitude of the magnetic fluctuations. The saturated island width was about 7 cm when the min = 3/2 mode appeared. The resistive modes which limit the sustainable BN have typical mode numbers of min = 3/2 and 2/1. The relationship between the observed magnetic island and the neoclassical tearing mode is discussed.

TI Jobs, equity, and the mayoral administration of Harold Washington in
   Chicago (1983-87)
SO POLICY STUDIES JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
AB Scholars have applauded and critiqued the "equity" dimensions of the four-year mayoral administration of Harold Washington in Chicago (1983-1987). Much of the debate has centered on how to assess the progress of equity planning and implementation in specific contexts, whether it has produced concrete outcomes for poor communities, become institutionalized, or changed civic decisionmaking structures. This article attempts to capture the contested and emergent quality of equity planning in the Washington administration by examining its focus on jobs in some detail. The jobs goal-derived from neighborhood experience of economic change-became a central element of Washington's 1983 mayoral campaign and one of the key development goals of the administration. The administration pursued an array of jobs policies and programs, attempting to link economic development with employment services, hold accountable those firms receiving public incentives, retain manufacturing, and provide equitable access to city resources. By the end of Washington's first term, many economic development accomplishments had been achieved but the administration also experienced dilemmas that challenged the jobs goal and its equity potential-for example, the connection between local investment and regional and national economic policies. Consideration of the early experiences of the Washington administration in Chicago in formulating and implementing job policies and programs clarifies the difficulties of a broad-based and sustainable equity program. These lessons are particularly useful today as many low-income advocates, municipalities, and states struggle to reform workforce and economic development systems.

TI Balancing preservation and logging: Public lands policy in British
   Columbia and the wester United States
SO POLICY STUDIES JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
AB Both the United States and Canada have made fundamental changes in their policies regarding natural resources. The province of British Columbia made major revisions to its forest policy in the early-to-mid-1990s; in the western United States, policy efforts have been stymied by conflicts between state and federal officials and between conservationists and resource developers. The different structures of federalism in the two countries result in two different approaches to policymaking that are discussed here. However, the ultimate test of natural resource policy, I argue, should be their consistency with the goal of sustainable ecosystems and preservation of biodiversity. From the perspective of ecological science, neither country has been particularly successful in policymaking for public lands and for logging in particular. Both nations have failed to give priority to protecting old-growth forests and largely have rejected the idea that ancient forests are much more valuable than simply sources of timber.

SO POLITICKA EKONOMIE

DT Article
DE reserve requirements; monetary policy instruments set; rationales and
   reforms of reserve requirements
AB Main purpose of this paper is to analyse reserve requirements as one of the most controversial monetary policy tool at all. The first pair of the paper focuses on reserve requirements in a broader context of the monetary policy of the SBCS, the CNB respectively, during the period 1989 - 1998. The first part of the article deals with issues like the side effects of reserve requirements, rationales justifying their existence in the monetary policy; instrument set or the trade-off between the: monetary stability and banking industry stability goals of the central bank. This critical analyse of the role of reserve requirements in monetary policy schemes during recent years creates a useful framework for the second part. In this part potential reforms of reserve requirements are discussed and possible effects of reserve requirements on the monetary system of the Czech Republic are specified in more detail.
   It is clear reserve requirement are redundant instrument within the new inflation targeting regime adopted by the CNB almost a year ago. But more important question coming to a mind is how to abolish reserve requirements without causing destructive side effects on the whole monetary and banking system. By discussing these issues the paper leads to a crucial conclusion: Czech monetary policy-makers should prefer continuous and gradual way of lowering the rate of reserve requirements to the very quick and unanticipated one even though the existence of reserve is not sustainable any more.

DT Article
DE fiscal multiplier; output; savings; external balance; interest rates
   level; interest rates structure; demand for money
AB This paper discusses theoretical aspects of the fiscal policy in the special economic system of the small open economy under fixed exchange rates. The author lays stress on the size of the fiscal multiplier as an analytical expression of the structure of this economy. The first part describes fiscal multiplier in the close economy, the second defines with more precision the open-economy fiscal multiplier and precis the final effects of national savings and their functions in the economy with context of the external balance and problems of the interest rates level, interest rates structure and demand for money in the context of high capital mobility on domestic output.
   The results of the study suggest that size of the open-economy fiscal multiplier depends on fiscal policy effects upon current account solvency and sustainability. In monetary economy the fiscal policy is also complicated by demand for and supply of money functions elasticities.

AB Particularly in terms of regional analysis, the concept of "development" ranks among the most frequent and essential components of economic reasoning. Yet, the way how it has been generally understood seems to be rather vague, the range and variety of its possible content too wide and its pattern unstable.
   The above contribution means an attempt to specify the position of this concept in spatial economics, mostly through explanation and comparison of three prevailing approaches to address the area of issues associated with the term development: the process in question can be looked at as local economic development, multidimensional or sustainable developments.
   Most attention has been paid to the idea of sustainable development, as the belief has been expressed that the assimilation of its principles and aims by economic theory and practice poses major challenge that can not be avoided even in the very near future. A selection of indicators for the development to be evaluated in terms of sustainability has been presented and discussed.

AB Background. A sustainable pattern of participation in physical activity is important in the maintenance of health and prevention of disease, College students are in transition from an active youth to a more sedentary adult behavior pattern.
   Methods. We assessed self-reported physical activity and other characteristics in a sample of 2,729 male and female students (median age was 20 years) recruited from representative courses and year levels at four Australian College campuses. They were categorized as sufficiently or insufficiently active, using estimates of energy expenditure (kcal/week) derived from self-reported physical activity, Personal factors (self-efficacy, job status, enjoyment), social factors (social support from family/friends), and environmental factors (awareness of facilities, gym membership) were also assessed.
   Results. Forty-seven percent of females and 32% of males were insufficiently active. For females, the significant independent predictors of being insufficiently active were lower social support from family and friends, lower enjoyment of activity, and not working. For males, predictors were lower social support from family and friends, lower enjoyment of activity, and being older.
   Conclusions. Factors associated with physical activity participation (particularly social support from family and friends) can inform physical activity strategies directed at young adults in the college setting. (C) 1999 American Health Foundation and Academic Press.

TI Carrying-capacity as a basis for sustainable development - A case study

SO PROGRESS IN PLANNING
LA English
DT Article
ID NEURAL NETWORKS; IDENTIFICATION; SYSTEM
AB The concept and premises of carrying-capacity are employed as tools for the operationalization of sustainable development, Carrying-capacity of a region, comprising its supportive and assimilative capacities, is defined as the ability to produce desired outputs from a constrained resource base to achieve a higher and more equitable duality of life, while maintaining desired environmental quality, and ecological health. The proposed planning process explicitly includes interaction between the community, experts and decision-makers to arrive at trade-offs between the desired production-consumption levels through the exploitation of supportive capacity within its regenerative potential, and environmental quality within the assimilative capacity of the regional ecosystem, These trade-offs result in structural shifts necessary for reconciling competing demands in the overall process of socio-economic development through appropriate technological, managerial and organizational interventions.
   A GIS-RDBMS-Neural Network-based system has been used for on-line consequence analysis of regional developmental proposals. The model outputs are used as the indicators of sustainable development. The neural networks have been trained to identify linkages in regional systems and the cartographic inputs have been processed through GIS to obtain spatial data, and through RDBMS to obtain non-spatial data.
   The exploratory search to identify a preferred scenario considers settlement forms; locations of developmental activities; technological options; and consumption patterns. The preferred scenario maximizes the equitable quality of life levels, and minimizes ecological loading and environmental degradation index. The case of carrying-capacity-based developmental planning in National Capital Region (NCR) in India is presented. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The monograph addresses the factors affecting the degree of sustainability exhibited by population growth in peripheral urban settlements. :Development differentials between core and peripheral regions in countries of different size and various level of economic development are discussed and specifically, the following issues are considered: I, core versus periphery: inequalities and development needs; 2, development peculiarities of peripheral urban settlements; 3, criteria for sustainable urban growth; 4, factors influencing urban growth in peripheral areas; and 5, planning strategies for regional development. Two major theoretical considerations are posited for discussion. First, that 'sustainable population growth' of an urban settlement is defined according to the settlement's ability to attract newcomers and retain current residents (migration attractiveness). Second, that the preconditions which are essential for sustainable population growth in peripheral areas are not identical to those in the core. A set of analytical models designed to explain development peculiarities of peripheral settlements are suggested and several planning strategies are also proposed, aimed at enhancing the socio-economic sustainability of existing settlements in peripheral areas. These include: I, the formation of compact development clusters; 2, the concentration of state and local financial resources on selected development settlements; 3, the adoption of a system of progressive economic incentives to promote private investment in peripheral areas; and 4, stricter regulation of land use in core regions.

AB Publication of the UK Government's White Paper on. Transport, in July 1998, has raised public awareness of the problems associated with widespread car use. The authors argue that these problems, which largely result from the aggregated choices and behaviour of many individual car users, could be mitigated if the main determinants of car use and the underlying behavioural mechanisms were better understood. This article examines six strategies for changing social behaviour, and some important conditions for reducing car use. Examples are presented of how the insights gained can be applied in practice.

AB This paper develops a hierarchical landscape approach for investigating how landscape structure influences the abundance of eastern grey kangaroos, red kangaroos and common wallaroos on properties in a partially cleared semi-arid woodland of Queensland. This approach is applied to examine the extent to which a mosaic of spatial factors at a hierarchy of scales influences kangaroo abundance at the property level, the level of management interest. The analysis concludes that the structure of the property habitat mosaic, coupled with pasture productivity, is the most important influence for each species. Access to water was not a limiting factor, although it may be important locally. Grey kangaroos prefer an even mosaic of all habitat types on properties with productive grass-dominated pastures. Red kangaroos are positively associated with run-on areas and large-shrub regrowth patches, reflecting their foraging preferences for forbs and short grasses and their ability to use more open habitats. Wallaroos have a clumped density distribution associated with a heterogeneous mosaic of open habitats interspersed with fragmented forest patches and small to medium-grained shrub-regrowth patches.
   The research, while not replicated, identifies linkages between tree clearing practices at the property level and increased large kangaroo abundance in the region. These linkages have been previously overlooked in the kangaroo management debate. Therefore, any tree clearing guidelines developed at the property level need to be sensitive to key ecological processes influencing kangaroo populations at both the landscape and property levels. If not, the sustainable management of total grazing pressure (livestock plus kangaroos) biodiversity conservation will never become a reality.

AB Streamflow in the Hawkesbury-Nepean River system has been progressively regulated and diverted since 1888 by the construction of 29 dams 7 m or more in height and another 52 smaller structures to supply water for the populations of Sydney, Wollongong and the Blue Mountains. This study identifies differences in fish assemblages between reaches of the river system affected by dams, flow diversion and regulation, and rivers unmodified for water supply. Fish were sampled in the upper-reach tributaries above five major dams, in slopes reaches within 1 km downstream of the dams, and in the lowland reaches of the Nepean and Hawkesbury rivers. Corresponding upper, slopes and lowland reaches were sampled in two unregulated tributaries. Fish were also sampled within the impoundments. Seven fish assemblages were identified by multivariate analyses, which revealed a separation of assemblages in habitats affected by dams or flow alteration. Fish within the lowland reaches of all three rivers formed a single assemblage, which became progressively fragmented with increasing distance upstream, and with increasing differences between regulated and unregulated rivers. Gambusia holbrooki and Anguilla reinhardtii were more abundant in the upper reaches of unregulated rivers, whereas Galaxias brevipinnis and Retropinna semoni were abundant in upper reaches above dams, but not recorded in upper reaches of unregulated rivers. In slopes reaches, Gambusia holbrooki and Gobiomorphus corn were more abundant in unregulated reaches while Retropinna semoni, Philypnodon grandiceps and Anguilla reinhardtii were more abundant in regulated reaches. Characteristic species in lowland reaches included Macquaria novemaculeata, Mugil cephalus, Philypnodon grandiceps, Cyprinus carpio and Potamalosa richmondia. However, the true effects of flow alteration in the system are confounded by geomorphic and climatic variation and other disturbances within the catchment. Sustainable development of water resources in the catchment requires a more detailed analysis of biotic responses to river flows, accounting for confounding factors.

AB Restoration concepts for large river systems are currently in an early stage of development. Possibilities for, and constraints of, rehabilitation-both from a process-oriented view as well as from the nature conservation perspective-differ strongly according to the degree of anthropogenic changes. This requires precisely formulated amelioration goals. Well-conceived and thoroughly analysed case studies are necessary to better understand reversibility, direction and time scale of changes, and the sustainability of various scenarios. It is important to plan controllable set-ups with long-term monitoring in the pre- and post-implementation phases of restoration programmes. In order to achieve these goals, monitoring instruments have to be developed and calibrated that allow the definition and analysis of improvements. Finally, controlled restoration programmes offer the opportunity for large-scale experiments to test overall concepts and hypotheses and have an important heuristic value to improve the understanding of river ecology in general.

   technology transfer
AB This paper investigates the difficulties that have been encountered when non indigenous renewable energy technologies have been transferred to rural areas of industrialising countries. Specifically, it focuses on the cultural and organisational aspects of these technologies. Another dimension analysed is that of the interactions between the various stakeholders in the technology transfer process. There has been a lack of attention to these interactions. specifically a neglect to consult with the end users of the systems by the project implementers. The importance of addressing this fundamental deficiency cannot be over emphasised in the need to redress the performance of the transfer process. The lack of appropriate institutional support mechanisms and financial resources can work in synergism with this former factor. In conclusion, an assessment is made of the most appropriate technology transfer mechanisms for these systems, which are likely to expedite sustainable rates of dissemination to the intended benefactors. This assessment incorporates the earlier findings on the social and institutional barriers to successful transfers, and the mechanisms used by the various agents to perform the transfer, as these have a significant impact on the viability of the renewable energy systems.

TI Renewable energy policy options for mountain communities: Experiences
   from China, India, Nepal and Pakistan
SO RENEWABLE ENERGY
LA English
DT Article
AB The paper reviews and discusses various policies which have hampered the sustainable growth of RETs in the mountain communities of the Hindu Kush Himalayan (HKH) Region in one hand, hut on the other RETs interventions have not only significantly improved the energy situation at household level but also helped to support the economic productivity of the mountain area. This paper identifies that compatibility of technology design to suit the local conditions, private sector participation in the development of RETs and affordability of mountain communities for acquiring RET devices are critical for enhancing financial viability of RETs.
   The identification of various issues have been instrumental in order to recognize the need for programme coordination adopting holistic approach with long-term vision for technology promotion; need for adoption of integrated approach for the development of RETs; need for increasing opportunity for women's to participate in the programme; need for strong research, development and demonstration, need for skill upgradation through training, need for technical backup and monitoring service; need for capacity building at local level for repair, maintenance and production of small-scale renewable energy technologies; need for awareness generation not only among users but also among planners, developers and promoters; need for strong quality control and standardization; need for warranty and insurance to safeguard the entrepreneurs and users from losses and the need for the consideration of social equity for poor and marginalized mountain population.
   The study proposes framework for policy recommendations to promote the development of renewable energy resources and technologies to provide broad policy guidelines not only for Nepal but also in the context of HKH Region, which has six components: a) Recognize and measure the benefits of renewable energy technologies (RETs) with particular emphasis on drudgery reduction; b) Reform energy-price signals so as to provide leveled play-field for each energy source; c) Revamp the energy decision making process so as to promote decentralized renewable energy technologies and involvement of local level institutions; d) Change energy users' investment incentives by attracting the private sector and NGOs participation in manufacturing and promoting RETs; e) Accelerate investments in commercialization of RETs by supporting RD & D, capacity building, information and awareness generation through public sector or donor funding and by providing attractive incentives to manufacturers; and f) Develop commercialization plan for each RET to suit location specific needs.

AB An account is given in this paper of soft technology options which are non-polluting. less energy-intensive anti inexpensive to establish. Our endeavor in what follows. has also been to spell out some guidelines and strategies which can easily be adopted for sustaining growth with equity using soft energy options. The soft technologies tend to be employment-generating economically sensible and environmentally-benign.
   Our evaluation indicates that human survival and development will depend upon (i) whether or not we can harness soli technology options for human welfare. (ii) whether we can or not forestall the serious natural resource and environmental damages perpetuated by the high-tech culture and (iii) whether or not we can develop the appropriate adjustments and/or institutions id share the fruits of technological developments equitably.

SO RENEWABLE ENERGY
LA English
DT Article
DE renewable; local energy
AB Today renewable resources are recognised by the International Community as fundamental elements of an energy policy whose purpose is to pursue a sustainable development. The accomplishment of such policies has a particular effectiveness at regional scale because of the "local" character of these resources and their positive impact on socio-economic development and local employment. The minimisation of environmental impact is a further important aspect of the use of renewables compared to fossil fuels.
   This paper presents the scenario of renewable resources in Tuscany in regard of hydroelectric, geotermic, solar, eolian and biomass resources, with particular focus on the actual exploitation and further potentialities. There are remarkable potentialities in the development of renewable sources in Tuscany, particularly for what concerns the multipurpose use of geothermal fuels, solar heating and biomass fuel utilisation. The localisation of wind energy favourable places needs necessary more detailed "in situ" measurements. Use of this source will allow recovery of unused lands and enhancement of rural electrification (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A study of the economic, social-political, and environmental consequences of using renewable energy technologies (RETs, e.g., photovoltaics, wind, solar thermal, biofuels) as compared to those of conventional energy technologies (CETs, e.g.. oil, coal, gas) would show that RETs are singularly consistent with a whole ethic that is implicit in the concept of sustainability. This paper argues for sustainability as an ethical, as well as a pragmatic, imperative and for RETs as an integral pan of this imperative. It brings to the fore some of the specific current economic, political, and environmental assumptions and practices that are inconsistent with both sustainability and with a rapid deployment of RETs. Reflecting an emerging planetary awareness and a pressing need to come to terms with intra- and intergenerational equity, the concept of sustainability explicitly entails the right of future generations to the same opportunity of access to a healthy ecological future and the finite endowment of the Earth's resources as that of the present generation.

AB The present high energy paradigm of consumerism and armament is almost entirely structured on nonrenewable fossil fuels. This commitment is now being further extended through massive new infrastructures and life styles to the emerging new nations. Arising out of the energy concentration and constraints of the economic parameters, movement towards low density sun-based sources of energy will be slow and halting.
   In the final analysis the factors, which will determine the time scale and speed of shift to renewable sources of energy, would include:
   the declining economic availability and increasing conflicts in the acquisition of non newable resources.
   Crossing of he threshold of environmental sustainability of parameters such as doubling of Carbon dioxide., ozone layer depletion and health endangering pollution, and nuclear wastes etc.

AB We consider here a management policy for a sika deer (Cervus nippon) population in the eastern part of Hokkaido. Deer populations are characterized by a large intrinsic rate of population increase, no significant density effects on population growth before population crash, and a relatively simple life history. Our goals of management for the deer population are (1) to avoid irruption with severe damage to agriculture and forestry, (2) to avoid the risk of extinction of the deer population, and (3) to maintain a sustainable yield of deer. To make a robust program on the basis of uncertain information about the deer population, we consider three levers of relative population size and four levels of hunting pressures. We also take into consideration a critical level for extinction, an optimal level, and an irruption level. The hunting pressure for females is set to increase with the population size. We also recommend catching males if the population size is between the critical and optimal levels and catching females and males if the population size is larger than the optimal level. We must avoid cases of irruption or threatened population under various sets of uncertain parameter values. The simulation results suggest that management based on sex-specific hunting is effective to diminish the annual variation in hunting yield.

AB The present study examines the optimal use of renewable resources and how optimality is linked to the accumulation of waste stock. Production technology choices are based on a maximization of a discounted stream of net utility over time with respect to constancy of environmental services. When adopting a socially optimal tax-subsidy scheme to price produced goods, the ultimate utility level is determined by how tax revenues and subsidies compensate each other in monetary terms. Therefore, the constraints imposed on the optimal use of economic instruments in promoting recycling when a government budget is balanced are also studied. The materials balance structure of the model yields steady-state comparative statics and dynamic envelope results with interesting policy implications. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

LA English
DT Article
DE surfactants; material flow analysis; CO2 emissions; emission reduction;
   life-cycle
AB Surfactants (surface-active agents) can be derived from both petrochemical feedstocks and renewable resources (e.g. oleochemicals). Renewable resources have the advantage that they contribute less to the greenhouse effect if harvested and grown sustainably. When comparing the contribution to the greenhouse effect, the life-cycle of the product should be analysed, covering the CO2 emissions from production, use and degradation after disposal. In this paper, the use phase is only included for washing and cleaning agents since it is practically impossible to cover all the utilization processes for surfactants. At present, biomass-derived raw materials account for about one third of the material feedstocks for surfactant production in Germany. Within this partial life-cycle inventory, it was calculated that fossil CO2 emissions of the commercially most important surfactants produced in Germany amounted to 1.5 Mt in 1996 (versus total chemical industry emissions of 125 Mt, including the equivalents of feedstock energy). Already today, the production of oleochemical feedstocks avoids the emission of 0.35 Mt of fossil CO2 p.a. (1996). Total substitution of oleochemical surfactants for petrochemical surfactants would enable a further reduction of 34%, reducing absolute emissions to 0.99 Mt. This is an overestimation of today's technical potential, but it might be attainable in the longer term. For surfactant applications in laundry detergents, lowering wash temperatures is also an interesting strategy to reduce CO2 emissions. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

ID DEMOCRACY
AB Has the global informational economy and new division of labour left us unconcerned with unemployment resulting from technological displacement, negative trade impacts, and other economic policies? I propose to discuss, from a philosophical and analytical human rights framework, the Canadian and American situation to determine whether information technology (IT) is a "job killer." There are empirical and ethical problems with Jeremy Rifkin's "end of work" and a failure of development strategies. While there is a positive role for information and communication technologies (ICTs) in sustainable development, the problem of pervasive poverty, especially in least developed countries, requires an international response to fulfill the basic human rights of persons and raises anew the ethical challenge of social solidarity and the mutuality of human rights and responsibilities in the informational economy.

AB The main criticisms of trade from a sustainability viewpoint are that it accelerates resource depletion and pollution, harms income distribution both locally and internationally, and undermines democratic institutions. After considering the relationship between trade and ''sustainability," this paper discusses a number of feedback mechanisms which promote the kind of trade that is more sustainable-for the south as well as the North. The role of technological change, a model of the relationship between production and "sustaining services," data needs and research priorities are also discussed.

AB This paper is a theoretical and policy-oriented study that explores globalization and the world youth unemployment challenge in relation to "sustainable livelihoods." On examining Canada's international internship initiative in the context of new federal Sustainable Development Strategies, it concedes that the federal internship initiative has begun to address some broader unemployment problems while stimulating new youth employment opportunities. However, it has not proactively supported sustainable development, and not adequately responded to the forces, challenges and complexities of globalization to ensure socio-economic and ecological sustainability in Canada and abroad. The paper also raises theoretical and policy issues for future research.

AB Environmentalism is giving way to sustainability in a process that is aided by complementary shifts in economic, social and political arenas. Environmentalism was always a necessary first step. The shift towards sustainability is beginning to take place because the mood of the times is now ready to promote its early stages. However, as we contemplate more fully the fuller significance of sustainability, the very ethos of livelihood and lifestyle enters the frame of enquiry. Livelihood and lifestyle are part of the same set of phenomena defining personal and social identity, and economic well-being. But we can still ask two complementary questions. Are we seriously prepared to metamorphose into a sustainable life style? Can we devise ways to cope by drawing on multiple livelihoods? This will be one of the key issues for human geographers to examine in the coming decade.

DE Malta; diversification; tourism; culture; sustainability
AB During the 1960s and 1970s, Malta's mass tourism industry developed in a relatively unplanned fashion and was characterised by a mixed assortment of benefits and dis-benefits, as well as dependence on a narrowly defined market. This paper examines the international trends and government policies that have resulted in the diversification of the tourist industry in Malta since the mid-1980s. Focusing on one particular type of niche-marketing, that of cultural tourism, the paper explores some of the possible impacts following from the changing patterns of tourism. The paper questions whether cultural tourists are a blessing or blight, and considers the I:merging implications for the sustainability of tourism in Malta, examining Malta as a sensitive test case for tourism development strategies.

AB The European Alps are being transformed from regions of flight to regions of development, with consequent threats of environmental degredation and reduced biodiversity. One response is the creation of National and Regional Parks coupled with the search for sustainable forms of rural development. The example of the National Park of the Vanoise, France, is examined and by reference to case studies it is argued that sustainability is achieved via a trajectory rather than by finite legislation and, further, that pluriactivity plays a crucial role.

AB Experience in promoting suitable technologies and improving operational performance is drawn on to enable developing countries to make more effective use of local resources in the construction and maintenance of low-volume roads. Training and technology transfer projects require multidisciplinary consulting and advisory support, which may include courses and on-the-job training but may also require "twinning" and other linkages between institutions for a more substantial transfer of skills over a longer period. The process is illustrated by case studies from a range of national and international technical cooperation projects, including the global Management of Appropriate Road Technology research initiative and the World Road Association's World interchange Network. The cases are set within a framework of basic models of ways in which training and technology transfer can contribute to international construction industry development, which suggests an inverse relationship between project predictability and recipient autonomy. The analysis offers several general lessons for engineers involved in international technology transfer, including (a) the importance of assessing local administrative, social, cultural, and regulatory environments at the project design stage; (b) the need for an open-minded approach to the choice of technology; (c) the scope for working with and through the local private sector; (d) deciding on an appropriate mix of technical and management training; and (e) applying the principle of sustainability through recognition of recipient autonomy and maintained contact between provider and recipient institutions to build confidence through collaboration.

AB In vitro shoot bud regeneration via callogenesis was achieved from hypocotyl explants of Leucaena leucocephalla (K8) collected from both contaminated (chromium, nickel and zinc) and uncontaminated sites. The proliferated calli raised from hypocotyl were tested in vitro for their relative tolerance to chromium, nickel and zinc. The calluses derived from contaminated sources were tolerant to metal and showed better growth on MS basal medium supplemented with 1.0 mg 1(-1) kinetin, 4.0 mg 1(-1) NAA and either 0.015 mM chromium, 0.13 mM nickel or 0.053 mM zinc than those derived from uncontaminated seeds. The specificity of metal tolerance noted in the parent materials was observed in the calluses. The calli derived L. leucocephalla growing on contaminated soil exhibited higher catalase and peroxidase activities than those from the uncontaminated soil. Biochemical studies provided evidences that plant material from the contaminated sources were physiologically distinct from the uncontaminated ones. This study indicated that seeds of Leucaena leucocephalla collected from contaminated sites were tolerant to chromium, nickel and zinc and may have the advantage of being used in sustainable revegetation programmes on metalliferous minewastes.

DE community-based; forest local communities; jurisdiction; power;

AB This article provides new insights on community involvement in natural forest management. The examples used are two woodlands reserves in Tanzania, both of which were visibly not being conserved under government management. In 1994/1995 communities living on the edge of these forests secured the "return" of these woodlands to their own control. The article briefly describes the mechanisms they have since used to manage the forests, and their success. The author has acted as the facilitator in these developments. Her argument is that modern strategies of joint forest management that shale the use of forests with communities, or that involve communities as partners in the work Of management but retain ultimate control, cannot hope to obtain the level of local responsibility needed for self-reliant, cost-effective, and sustainable conservation management. Rather, it is when authority is vested in the community, and when the state acts as adviser only, that a meaningful transformation in forest protection and management occurs.

AB The paper deals with environmental problems and public participation in the environmental decision-making. The beginnings of the crisis of both the environment and the public life in the seventies started many reforms in the society, which were guided by the reevaluation of the knowledge about the interaction of man and nature.
   A recent trend has been to ignore the social risks and to concentrate on accumulating the material wealth. Resisting this trend implies changes to the underlying values of society as well as to the founding principles of economic system. Shifts in the behavior and lifestyles of citizens are required for the sake of a sustainable welfare of future generations. This, in turn may require a change in individual values in relation to communities, ownership, responsibility and individual involvement. In a democratic society the citizens are involved in the process of public participation and can influence the decision-making process by exercising their rights. However, in Slovakia, there is a little experience with efficient methods of public participation and mediation, which play an important role in the processes of environmental decision-making all over the Western Europe. Three case studies (hydro-electric power station in Zilina, motorway in Povazska Bystrica and quarry Klubina) are introduced to illustrate possible achievements of active public participation in the process of environmental assessment and decision-making.

TI Values about nature in organic farming practice and knowledge
SO SOCIOLOGIA RURALIS
LA English
DT Article
AB The paper presents and discusses the empirical results of an investigation into views of nature, practices and knowledge in Danish organic farming. The study is primarily conducted as a case study of six Danish organic farms examining the explicit as well as the implicit views of nature, ethical stands, learning processes, knowledge sources and identity of the farmers expressed. These findings are related to actual manuring strategies, crops and product diversity and ways of treating cattle. The empirical study provides evidence for the thesis that views of nature influence practice, and that organic farming comprises a variety of practices and views of nature. Four paradigms of knowledge related to organic farming have furthermore been identified and analysed with regard to concepts of nature and philosophy of science. The paradigms are shared by farmers, agronomists in extension and advisory services and agro-scientific researchers. The findings are related to the broader discussion about the ongoing institutionalization of the organic farming. Institutionalization prioritizes certain practices and views of nature. Organic farming as a source for the development of different kinds of sustainable agriculture is thereby reduced.

AB It has been suggested that an important factor relating the dynamics of microbial communities and nutrient flux in grassland soils is a change in nondetrital inputs, such as root exudates, associated with below-ground herbivory. Our objective was to quantify the effects of different amounts of root infestation, and hence herbivory, by clover cyst nematodes (Heterodera trifolii) on the biomass and structure of rhizosphere microbial communities of white clover (Trifolium repens) plants grown in a grassland soil of low nutrient status. An additional aim was to test the hypothesis that these biotic interactions are influenced by soil texture, in particular a prevalence of soil pores of less than 30 mu m dia. We found that at day 89, low amounts of root herbivory by H. trifolii, below the damage threshold for white clover, resulted in significant increases in total microbial biomass, measured by phospholipid fatty acid analysis (PLFA) and the abundance of gram-positive and gram-negative specific PLFAs in the rhizosphere soil. At this time there were also significant increases in the abundance of fatty acids synthesized by fungi and actinomycetes in the rhizosphere of infested clover plants. However, an increase of root herbivory above the damage threshold for clover, had no, or a negative effect on soil microbial biomass and individual PLFAs. The positive effects of root herbivory on rhizosphere microorganisms at day 89 were thought to correspond with an infestation by a second generation of nematodes. The results suggest that changes in the biomass of microorganisms in the rhizosphere of lightly-infested plants were not accompanied by changes in the structure of the microbial community as the fungal-to-bacterial biomass ratio was unaffected by the herbivory treatment. Soil texture had no effect on the ability of clover cyst nematodes to infest clover roots. There was also no soil type x nematode interaction, suggesting that the effects of root herbivory on the rhizosphere microbial community were similar in both soils. However, microbial biomass and the abundance of several individual PLFAs were higher in the clay loam than the sandy loam soil. The significance of these results in terms of nutrient flows in sustainable grassland systems is discussed. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The boat-based linefishery is the most important marine fishery along the coast of KwaZulu-Natal, producing 40% of the total annual mass of fish landed there. Since 1900, the fishery has supported commercial and recreational sectors that compete for more than 120 species, using similar methods in the same fishing areas. Catch-and-effort data have been collected sporadically from the commercial linefishery since 1910 and the recreational linefishery since 1970. The number of commercial vessels increased from 10 in 1910 to 140 in 1995, and effective commercial effort continues to increase, despite a limit placed on the number of vessels in 1985. Recreational participation escalated from 20 skiboats in 1948 to 2 000 in 1995 and entry to this sector remains unlimited. Introduction of the beach-launched, trailable skiboat in 1945 resulted in a rapid expansion of effort to coastal areas that previously functioned as harvest refugia for resident reef fish. Total catch has declined, despite increased effort, as has catch per unit effort (cpue). There have also been substantial changes in catch composition and catches have been sustained by sequential target switching from large endemic reef fish such as seventyfour Polysteganus undulosus, red steenbras Petrus rupestris and rockcods Epinephelus spp., to smaller sparids, such as slinger Chrysoblephus puniceus, santer Cheimerius nufar and blueskin Polysteganus coeruleopunctatus, and shoaling migrants, such as king mackerel Scomberomorus commerson, geelbek Atractoscion aequidens and kobs Argyrosomus spp. The linefish resources off KwaZulu-Natal have long been incapable of sustaining the fishing effort in the region and most resident species are now overexploited. Existing linefish management measures have not been successful in limiting fishing mortality to sustainable levels and existing limits on commercial permits and recreational launches will have to be substantially reduced if this is to be achieved. Bag limits may also have to be substantially reduced, particularly for endemic reef fish, to rebuild stocks to sustainable levels. Given the difficulty of implementing such controls, the maintenance of a number of large, suitably sited marine reserves appears to offer one of the few practicable chances of conserving the endemic reef fish stocks of KwaZulu-Natal.

The lack of comprehensive data on annual recruitment and adult survival hampers our ability to manage sandgrouse in an informed manner. The relatively low reproductive potential of sandgrouse, their susceptibility to over-exploitation and the possibility that population regulation in some species may be largely density independent suggests that a cautious approach to management is warranted. Managers should note that most sandgrouse species breed through the winter months, the traditional hunting season. The implications of a perceived decline in South African Namaqua sandgrouse (Pterocles namaqua) populations, due to high levels of nest predation on core breeding grounds, are discussed. The movement patterns of sandgrouse (some species are largely sedentary whereas others are highly nomadic and partially migratory) will influence the effectiveness of different management frameworks. it is argued that the present state-controlled system, based on the concept of res nullius, is not entirely appropriate for the management of sedentary species. Successful management of particularly the highly mobile Namaqua sandgrouse will likely depend on the extent to which resource users and conservation agencies can collaborate and share responsibilities for management.

AB This is an evaluation study of a community-based intervention model used in a project designed to reduce the demand for and use of opium, heroin, and other drugs among 85 tribal villages located in Northern Thailand. The Integrated Drug Abuse Prevention (IDAP) Project was conducted from 1995 to 1997 and used a community-based approach which included innovative methods such as multimedia awareness raising campaigns, networking between villages and local government agencies, and village-based drug detoxification and treatment to assist villages in solving their drug problems. The intervention model was successfully implemented in most villages and demonstrated very good results in improving awareness, decreasing the number of active drug users living in the villages, and preventing new cases of addiction. However, a follow-up study at 6 months after project termination indicated problems with sustainability of demand reduction activities and outcomes. These problems were attributed in part to a lack of empowerment among village leaders to continue activities without assistance from project staff. Also, village leaders expressed problems in resisting drug dealers who returned to the area, which suggested that support from law enforcement is critical to the viability of drug demand reduction programs.

DE underground transport; the Netherlands; transport policy; underground
   logistic system; sustainable transport
AB Underground freight transport is investigated in the Netherlands as a systems innovation for freight transport. The objective is to achieve a sustainable and efficient transport system for the next century. Two types of underground freight transport are under investigation.
   First is an expansion of the traditional pipeline transport for gases and liquids, with more substances and new organisational concepts: common carrier and multi-core. Pilot-projects have started: a multi-core pipeline project in the Rijnmond and feasibility studies to the extension of the ethylene- and propylene-pipeline systems.
   Second are underground logistic systems (ULSs) for industrial goods and goods in urban areas (pallets and rolling stock), A ULS is planned between the flower auction in Aalsmeer, Schiphol airport, and a rail terminal for high-speed trains. In 1999 the investment decision has to be taken. In Utrecht, Leiden, Amhem/Nijmegen, Zuid-limburg and Tilburg feasibility studies are in operation.
   At the end of the year a decision must be made on whether underground freight transport will become a new transport modality with general application in the Netherlands and perhaps beyond.

AB Little research has been conducted on the changing geographical distribution of organic farming in England and Wales in the 1990s, Using officially published secondary data, this paper examines the changing patterns of organic farming between 1993 and 1997, based on the number of organic farms, the area devoted to organic farming, the number of exits from and conversions to organic farming, and specific organic enterprises. The analysis indicates a process of spatial rationalisation, in which organic farming is becoming increasingly concentrated in a core area in Central-Southern England, Further, more detailed work is required, of both an empirical and conceptual nature, before a full explanation of such patterns can be given.

AB This paper critically reviews the way land-cover stock and change data are used for 'state of the environment' reporting. The paper considers the relative merits of the indicator approach as opposed to one based on natural resource accounting. It is shown that indicators have a number of shortcomings as measures of the sustainability of land-cover change, and that land-cover accounts offer a more rigorous framework in which to develop and test policy. The argument draws upon the experience gained in the preparation of land-cover accounts for Great Britain using data from Countryside Survey 1990.

TI Singers on the trail of 'authentic' Early Modern English: The puzzling
   case of vertical bar ae.vertical bar and vertical bar e.vertical bar
   (BBC, phonemes, pronunciation)
SO TRANSACTIONS OF THE PHILOLOGICAL SOCIETY
LA English
DT Article
AB data was collected from the BBC Signers during rehearsals and recording sessions leading to a broadcast and CD of a musical setting of an Early Modern English (EModE) text. Three patterns emerged in the singers' pronunciation of the EModE phonemes /ae:/ and /e:. One, [ae] and [e] respectively, reflected the targets but was not sustainable. The second, [e] and [e], destroyed the phonemic contrast. The third [a] and [ae] or [e] maintained the contrast using patterns similar to those in modern English. Reasons for this are sought in the nature of singing and the 'non-native speaker' status of modern users of EModE. Tentative parallels are drawn with recent claims about the fundamental stability of /ae/ and /e:/ as a phoneme pair.

   multi-criteria evaluation; rail
AB Innovative freight bundling networks have emerged in the European freight transport system during the past decade and a half. This paper aims to evaluate these networks with respect to a given set of evaluating attributes (criteria). The objective is to identify the network with 'promising' or 'preferable' configuration and performance, which will be competitive to road haulage under given circumstances.
   A set of different cases of rail-based innovative bundling networks represents the evaluation alternatives. The main indicators of the network demand, supply, time and cost performances have been used as the attributes (evaluation criteria). The Simple Additive Weighting (SAW) multi-criteria method has been applied to select the 'promising' or 'preferable' bundling network under given circumstances. The outcomes indicate that, generally, a 'preferable' configuration of the rail-based bundling networks should consist of a great number of nodes (inter-modal terminals) and routes covering a wide spectrum of delivery distances. In addition, both a high frequency of regular services and standardised delivery time of loading units should be provided.

DE waste management; public acceptance; public participation;

AB It is becoming increasingly evident that a waste management program, and especially a waste treatment technique, which ignores social aspects, is doomed to failure. Aspects concerning the problems of public acceptance, public participation in planning and implementation, consumer behaviour and changing value systems are no less important than the technical or economic aspects in waste management research and decision-making. As part of the Integrated Research Project "Waste", Swiss Priority Program Environment (SPPE) 1996-1999 (funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation), this sub-project focuses on the results from two main areas. 1. Results of the three-round written Delphi-Expertquestioning "Contributions to the development of waste management in Switzerland" show that decision transparency, interregional cooperation, information policy and public participation are important factors with regard to the public acceptance of waste management in Switzerland. 2. The much discussed problem area of public acceptance of waste policies is directly linked to the concept of Social Compatibility, which is identified as an essential component of sustainable and successful waste management. As an additional aspect, the significance of mediation as a participatory process for public acceptance will be investigated. Public dialogues on concrete waste management projects not accepted by parts of the population, will therefore be initiated, monitored and evaluated. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

ID MASS-BALANCE
AB To assess the impact of acid deposition on the long-term sustainability of nine oak, pine and spruce stands on sandy to loamy sandy parent material in Sweden, Denmark and The Netherlands, a dynamic soil acidification model (ReSAM) was applied. Two deposition scenarios For the period 1990-2090 were used: a business as usual scenario (BAU) and a restrictive critical load scenario (CL). The BAU scenario leads to a strong decrease in both Al concentrations and pH in the topsoil of the Dutch and the Danish sites due to a decrease in the amount of amorphous Al compounds. The decline in pH leads to an enhanced release of base cations by silicate weathering. Despite the ongoing acidification: base saturation increases during the simulation period, due to both the increase in base cation weathering and an increased input from mineralization with the ageing of the tree stands. No change in Al concentration is predicted for northern Sweden as deposition levels are below critical loads. Soil chemistry at the recently replanted Swedish sites is dominated by changes in N cycling instead of by deposition. The CL scenario leads, especially after 2010, to a stronger decline in Al concentration compared with the BAU scenario, which is mainly caused by a reduction of the acid input. Up to 2010, a considerable acid input to the soil system is maintained as N supply is larger than the consumption of N by the trees. Despite the reduction of the deposition of S and N to critical loads, the readily available cation pools are still declining on the Danish and Dutch sites in 2090. It is concluded that deposition levels above critical loads lead to exhaustion of the pool of amorphous Al compounds and a decline in pH. Base saturation does not decline due to an increase in mineralization with stand age and an increase in weathering rate due to the decline in pH.

AB Large quantities of dissolved organic carbon in prairie surface: water reservoirs make sustainable treatment quite challenging. Organic material is a precursor for the formation of disinfection by-products. Here, ozonation and biological activated carbon filtration were used as methods for removing dissolved organic carbon from the water of a small prairie reservoir used as a drinking water source. Biofiltration alone yielded significant reductions in dissolved organic carbon, colour, total trihalomethanes and chlorine demand. When ozonation preceded biofiltration, the increased proportion of biodegradable dissolved organic carbon allowed for significantly greater (p<0.05) effectiveness of biofiltration in removing dissolved organic carbon. We concluded that for the water supply under investigation, biofiltration alone was sufficient to provide water of a quality that complied with the Guidelines for Canadian Drinking Water Quality (1996), with respect to trihalomethanes formed after chlorination. The addition of conventional coagulation and/or preozonation further aided in the removal of organics and disinfection by-products, and, when combined with biofiltration, provided effective treatment in terms of dissolved organic removal. These treatment techniques may be effective techniques to treat prairie waters high in dissolved organic carbon.

AB An Internationally funded Programme, involving the European Commission the Global Environment Facility managed by UN Development Programme, the World Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, is addressing river basin problems in a unique situation. The solution of these should lead to the prevention of pollution and better water quality, protected ecosystems, sustainable water resources and more efficient sewerage and waste water treatment facilities for the 90 million population living in the region and the reduction of pollution impact on the Black Sea into which the Danube River flows. The paper introduces current Programme activities, the challenges being met and progress. Work is described for implementing a monitoring strategy, an accident emergency warning system and implementation of the 1994 Strategic Action Plan. The applied research activity is explained. The Programme is a major activity with many elements addressing a wide range of environmental problems in the catchment of a major international waterway.

AB The forest industry uses renewable raw materials to produce means necessary for the material and nonmaterial well-being of mankind. Societies set different priorities within the framework of their overall structures. Future scenarios have brought up two major alternatives, namely agreement/political control and technology/enlightened consumer, the latter approach probably having better prospects for global success, but also stronger opposition of traditional structures. Mass production obviously remains dominant in fiber production while other parts of processing approach consumption. For improved productivity, the target of availability should replace 'bottleneck thinking'. Principles of lean resources and simplicity should be emphasized.

DE pulp manufacture; economics; environment; bleaching
AB In the manufacture of bleached kraft pulp, evolving restrictions for effluent discharges and evolving technology are taking us towards lower and lower discharges of effluent and dissolved pollutants. Conflicting interest between economy and the environment often arise. For successful pulp manufacturing enterprises, we must look to processes which are low cost: low capital cost, low chemical cost, high capacity and high yield; and which produce high quality pulp: high strength, clean, bright, stable and uniform. Economic pressure is currently exceedingly great, as chronic overcapacity has led to low prices, low return on investment and the flight of capital from the free markets in which investors operate. Certainly we must work to achieve minimum impact of pulp mills, but developments in processes and process equipment for pulp manufacture must be economically as well as environmentally sustainable.

AB Intensive rural industry is developing rapidly in parts of inland Australia. The usually nutrient and salt rich effluent from these sources has traditionally been disposed to both land and water bodies. Since direct water discharge is no longer permitted, a challenge now exists when applying effluent to land especially where the rate of application exceeds crop requirements. Effluent of high volume and concentration of nutrients and/or salts can easily contaminate land and water resources. Predicting the optimum rate of land application of effluent is complicated by the physical, chemical and biological properties of soils.
   This paper addresses the characteristics of effluents from various intensive rural industries and their potential environmental impacts when irrigated to agricultural land in New South Wales, Australia. To assess the environmental sustainability of effluent reuse in land application, a mathematical model (ERIM) has been developed based on a monthly water balance. ERIM includes historical rainfall and evaporation; the amount of nitrogen and phosphorus introduced; their yearly removal by plants to be grown; amount of applied organic matter; and water holding capacity of soil.

AB The term 'green' is nowadays widely used (and misused) in connection with many types of technologies. If a technology is 'green' it usually means that the technology requires less non-renewable energy sources than other alternatives. However, other parameters need to be considered as well, such as sustainability, recycling potential, treatment capacity and potential, conservation of ecosystems, etc. In this paper the energy requirements and nutrient recycling potential of constructed wetlands and wastewater aquaculture facilities are compared with that of conventional wastewater treatment technologies. The energy requirements of constructed wetlands are very low, but if significant reuse of nutrients is included (aquaculture), the energy requirements increase significantly and usually beyond the energy equivalent of the biomass produced. This is especially true in cold temperate climates where the aquaculture systems need to be housed in heated greenhouses and artificial light must be provided to secure operation throughout the year. In countries where fresh water itself is a limiting resource and where the economic capability may limit the use of artificial fertilisers, the reuse potential of wastewater may be more important. The potential for sustainable cropping of the plant biomass is excellent in tropical wetlands as the plants have a high productivity and a continuous growing season. In order to evaluate in more detail the 'greenness' of the different wastewater treatment technologies, the life-cycle approach might be applied. However, because constructed wetlands, besides the water quality improvement function, perform a multitude of other functions such as biodiversity, habitat, climatic, hydrological and public use functions, methodologies need to be developed to evaluate these functions and to weigh them in relation to the water quality issues.

AB South Bay Water Recycling, a nonpotable water recycling project in the San Jose, California (USA) area, was commissioned in 1998 to supply up to 60,000 m(3)/day (15 mgd) of high-quality treated effluent to nearly 200 customers for irrigation and industrial use. The project was selected, along with water conservation, as the most effective approach to protecting salt marsh habitat at the south end of San Francisco Bay from degradation due to low-salinity discharge from the San Jose/Santa Clara Water Pollution Control Plant. The project was selected over an outfall discharge based in part on its ability to offset demand for potable water by municipal and industrial customers, including computer-related industries in northern California's "Silicon Valley". Project development began in 1991 with feasibility and conceptual design studies. Preliminary project design and surveying began in 1994, and construction commenced in 1996. The project was completed in July 1998 at a cost of approximately $140 million (US), and consists of a 90 km (60 mile) pipeline with three pump stations and one reservoir. In addition transmission and distribution facilities, construction included customer retrofits to segregate the nonpotable system from each site's potable supply.

AB Should mega-cities of the developing world follow the development model of using municipal wastewater treatment technology of Western Europe and North America or is there an alternative "sustainable sanitation" approach? This paper tries to define the most efficient and cost-effective, minimum level of treatment needed to address one of the foremost problems of mega-cities, which is public health, putting forward the specific technological proposal of applying chemically enhanced primary treatment (CEPT). During the past ten years, the combination of low dosages of metal salts, such as ferric chloride, with very small dosages of anionic polymers, have resulted in an efficient single-stage treatment process known as CEPT. Some CEPT applications focus on increased suspended solids and/or BOD removal, increased flow capacity due to more rapid settling, while others are concerned with effluent disinfection by chlorine or ultraviolet light or with high levels of phosphorus removal through precipitation. A number of case studies with which the authors have been associated are used to illustrate a wide range of CEPT options that are particularly suitable for rapidly growing mega-cities. Examples are provided from Mexico City, Southern California, Hong Kong, Sao Paulo, and Rio de Janeiro. (C) 1999 IAWQ Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Over-exploitation of groundwaters to meet the water requirements for rice-wheat systems is causing both a fall in groundwater levels and their quality deterioration in semi-arid parts of India. Adoption of rice-wheat cropping systems by the farmers using poor quality (sodic) waters for irrigation may adversely affect soil health and thereby reduce crop yield. Adoption of an irrigation schedule coupled with optimum nitrogen doses can be advantageous for sustaining yields of rice in these areas. Strategies for optimum use of these inputs has to be based on the knowledge of soil-water-nutrient-plant interactions evolved through field studies. In order to develop such relations, studies involving several combinations of irrigation levels and nitrogen doses were conducted on rice crops at Kaithal (India), and their effect on biomass, yield water and nitrogen use efficiency (NUB) were studied during 1993 and 1994. Irrigation schedules were based on the period of submergence ranging from 0 to 6 days. The nitrogen doses varied from 0 to 180 kg ha(-1). Both irrigation and nitrogen had a positive effect on yield, which increased from 1729 kg ha(-1) (continuous submergence without fertilizer) to 4522 kg ha(-1) (irrigation at 3 days disappearance of water with 180 kg N ha(-1). At 60 kg N ha(-1), NUE varied from 35.4 to 40.9 kg ha(-1) grain per kg of N. Further increase in the dose of N upto 180 kg ha(-1) however resulted in a decline in NUE. Nitrogen and irrigation had a positive influence on applied water efficiency (AWE). Under continuous submerged conditions, the beneficial effect of N on AWE was observed only up to 120 kg ha(-1). But at lower levels of irrigation (3 and 6 days disappearance of water), these effects continued even up to 180 kg ha(-1). The results of this study indicated that there is a possibility of using the sodic water (up to residual sodium carbonate [RSC] of 8 meq/l) for growing rice provided the crop is irrigated with an appropriate irrigation scheduling with the higher dose of N under conditions of > 50 cm monsoon rainfall.

AB Constructed wetland systems are used to treat domestic and industrial wastewater and agricultural runoff. In this field study the influence of hydraulic loading, retention time, water column depth and phosphorus (P) concentrations of influent wastewater on P and nitrogen (N) removal was examined in experimental constructed wetland systems. Five constructed wetlands with a surface area of 150 m(2), were developed in the field. Results showed that P concentrations of water from outlets of all five systems decreased (from as low as 11% decrease for the system which received wastewater with average P concentration of 8.2 mg P L(-1) to as high as 48.9% decrease for the system which received wastewater with average P concentration of 3.58 mg P L(-1)) compared to the influent water. The N concentrations in the outlet water were also decreased in all five systems (from as low as 26.3% decrease to as high as 77.5% decrease) compared to the influent water. The total P and N in the wetland sediment increased in the first year in all five systems but were unchanged at the end of the second year. The study showed that low hydraulic loading and greater retention times positively enhanced removal of P and N from wastewater in constructed wetland systems.

DE citizen participation; consultation; involvement; management;

AB If rivers are to be managed sustainably, and the potential to resolve conflicts of use realised, the general public must be more involved in their management. Participation in water management in England and Wales occurs at three levels: formal consultation; public involvement; or actual direct participation by the public. Formal consultations often leave the public in the role of the "objector" and ignore the "silent majority" focusing on the more vociferous minority of the population. Public involvement is less formal and can take a variety of forms. Although not allowing the public to be directly involved in the decision making processes, it provides the public with the opportunity to comment upon plans for river works or the redevelopment of a river location, or to indicate what they want from the rivers that now through their own local area and which they use for recreation and amenity. True participation is where the public are actively involved in the decision making processes. Citizen participation at all three levels provides environmental education, however, personal experience promotes a greater environmental awareness and understanding by the public.
   This paper reflects upon approaches to citizen participation in the UK and provides examples of specific projects involving both formal organisations and the general public. (C) 1999 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd on behalf of the IAWQ. All rights reserved.

AB Waste water treatment in activated sludge plants results in the production of large amounts of surplus sludge. After composting the sludge can be reused as fertiliser and soil conditioner in agriculture. Compared to landfilling and incineration, utilisation of sludge-compost is a more sustainable treatment because it recycles both nutrients and organic matter. However the high levels of heavy metals in sludge frequently prevent the reuse of sludge compost in agriculture. The extraction of heavy metals from the sludge before composting is therefore a necessary step to achieve a more sustainable sludge treatment. Extraction of heavy metals by inorganic acids and complexing agents has severe drawbacks. Organic acids could be an attractive extracting agent because the extraction can be performed at mildly acidic conditions (pH 3-5) and they are biologically degradable. The extraction was studied for heavy metals Cu and Zn and for competing metals Ca and Fe. The rate of extraction increases for increasing temperature and citric acid concentration. Cu can be extracted for 60-70% and Zn for 90-100% by citric acid at pH 3-4. A first economic valuation of the extraction and subsequent composting process showed that the total costs of the treatment process are below the costs of incineration.

AB Accumulation of phosphorus was investigated in the substrata and surface deposits of pilot-scale gravel-bed constructed wetlands after 2 (planted and unplanted) and 5 (planted only) years operation. Four different hydraulic loading rates of farm dairy wastewaters provided mean cumulative total P (TP) loadings ranging from similar to 520 to 2000 g m(-2) after 5 years operation. Mean substratum TP accumulations after 2 years operation ranged from 52 to 100 g m(-2) in the planted wetlands and from 40 to 51 g m(-2) in the unplanted wetlands, both showing a general increase with wastewater loading. After 5 years operation, associated with declining wetland TP removal performance, substratum TP accumulations in all the planted wetlands converged at similar values of 115 to 128 g m(-2). This represented 6 to 23% of their cumulative loadings. (C) 1999 IAWQ Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB One possible solution for sustainable utilisation and treatment of diluted manure streams is preliminary separation of the solid and liquid fractions followed by separate biological treatment of both fractions. This approach was the starting point of a joint Russian-Dutch project: "The Development of Biotechnological Methods for Utilisation and Treatment of Diluted Manure Streams" (1996-1998). This paper describes the most important results of the project. The UASB process was found to be suitable for the pre-treatment of the liquid fraction of various types of manure using a lab-scale experimental set-up, The maximum organic loading rate (OLR) applied was approximately 12 g COD/1/day for hen or pig manure and 6 g COD/1/day for cattle manure using a hydraulic retention time (HRT) of about 1 day. The total CPD reduction under these conditions was about 75% for the hen or pig manure and 42% for the cattle manure. The effluents obtained in this step can be used as liquid fertilisers (if possible) or should be post-treated to meet standards for discharge or reuse. Intensive composting can efficiently treat the solid manure fraction. Experiments at a pilot scale level with the solid fraction of hen manure showed that various amendments (peat, straw, sawdust) could be used for the production of composts having an elevated NPK content, reduced levels of Clostridia and faecal coliforms, vital weed seeds and the absence of Salmonella and helminth eggs.

AB Constructed ponds and wetlands are widely used in urban design to serve a number of functions including stormwater management. The design of constructed wetlands for stormwater management involves a number of multi-disciplinary inputs. Fundamental to their sustainable operation are the proper control of the hydrologic regime of the wetland and optimal flow hydrodynamics within the wetland. Many of the problems encountered in constructed wetlands can be minimised or avoided by good engineering design principles. Poor wetland hydrodynamics are often identified as a major contributor to wetland management problems. Ponds and wetlands with a high hydraulic efficiency are expected to promote full utilisation of the available detention storage and near plug flow conditions. The shape and layout of urban ponds and wetlands are often varied to suit the landscape and to satisfy aesthetic requirements as an urban water feature. These can be achieved while maintaining an effective stormwater treatment outcome if steps are taken to ensure that the hydrodynamic behaviour of the system is not severely compromised. A consistent measure is required to allow the effects of design features to be evaluated against this criterion. This paper introduces a new measure for hydraulic efficiency that combines existing measures of flow uniformity and effective volume. Case studies are presented on the use of this measure to assess the effects of different pond and wetland shapes, locations of inlet and outlet, botanical layouts and basin morphology on the flow hydrodynamics.

DE constructed reed beds; loading rates; removal rates; small works;
   stormwater treatment
AB The performance of constructed reed beds is illustrated by examination of results of surveys from a sewage treatment works with storm treatment reed beds and another sire with a combined storm and tertiary treatment reed bed. During surveys of the first system the average hydraulic loads were between 25 and 40 cm d(-1) and removals of between 6.7 to 15.4 g m(-2) d BOD5, 17.7 to 38.6 g m(-2) d TSS, 0.43 to 0.99 g m(-2) d NH4N and 0.63 to 0.76 g m(-2) d TON were observed. A survey during a storm at the combined storm and tertiary treatment reed bed showed a hydraulic loading of 98 cm d(-1) in the first 24 hr and removals of 12.6 g m(-2) d BOD5, 29.9 g m(-2) d TSS, 0.49 g m(-1) d NH4N and a small increase in TON. The sustainability of the high rate of removal during storm events is ascribed to the longer intervals in which loadings are much lower. Samples taken by the regulator from the time of commissioning of 20 sites with combined; storm and tertiary treatment reed beds, up to the end of May 1998 are examined. Three of these had operational problems not associated with storm treatment. The aggregate data for the remaining 17 sites (n = 906 to 911) illustrate a level of performance matching that of sites with tertiary treatment systems, with averages of 2.2 mg l(-1) BOD5, 3.0 mg l(-1) TSS, 1.25 mg l(-1) NH4N and 12.2 mg 1-' TON.

AB Until the 1950s most farming was carried out on smaller family farms that used organic fertilizers and essentially their waste production was easily assimilated by soils and receiving water bodies. The period post 1950 has seen a worldwide shift to larger monocultural, intensively operated farm units. The farm yields have increased dramatically, however, to sustain the increasing yields and productivity farms are using large quantities of chemical fertilizers and pesticides. At the same time, deforestation has occurred on a large scale since the 1950s and the deforested land has been converted to agricultural (mostly in developing countries) and urban (both developed and undeveloped countries) land uses. Also, a massive shift of population from rural areas to the cities has occurred in developing countries since the 1950s. Surface and groundwater quality degradation due to agricultural practices and conversion of land to agriculture can be categorized as follows: a) degradation due to land use conversion from native lands to agriculture; b) increased erosion and soil loss due to agricultural practices; c) chemical pollution by fertilizers and pesticides;and d)pollution from animal operations. Abatement of agricultural diffuse sources of pollution can and must be conducted in the context of moving toward sustainable agriculture. Some trends toward sustainable agriculture are already emerging in the US and Europe. (C) 1999 IAWQ Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The Seine Saint-Denis County Council carried out a study involving 200 water storage installations within its jurisdiction. The results showed that many of the basins were inadequate in such a dense urban area. The main problems were the following: difficulty of access, insufficient maintenance and poor integration into the urban landscape. To remedy the situation, the DEA launched research and information projects aiming to foster the development of techniques which would be better suited to dense urban areas, looking especially at catchments in parking lots, squares and other urban spaces. Three examples follow, illustrating the high potential of these techniques as well as the concrete or theoretical obstacles they may encounter. On a broader level, the examples demonstrate that these techniques are part and parcel of a "sustainable development" approach. (C) 1999 IAWQ Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB An intensive review of existing Water Law has just been conducted by the Department of Water Affairs and Forestry. The review was motivated by the need for preparation for new legislation to support water resource management with a goal of "some for all, forever." The development of a water resource protection policy was begun in that review. This paper describes the major aspects of the policy at one point in a process of rapid development. Initial proposals are to use the concept of ecological integrity as an indicator of sustainable use of the resource. While management's goal is to ensure all water users will benefit from access to the water resource, ecological integrity provides a good indication of sustainability in the use of the resource. More discussion in this paper is, therefore, centred on ecological integrity than on individual water users under the assumption that the resource will only be able to provide for long term water uses if ecological integrity is assured. A water Reserve has been defined that is intended to protect water resources, so basic human needs can be met and ecological functions and processes can be sustained. Components of ecological integrity, that is, the chemical and physical characteristics of water, the quantity and assurance of water, the habitat (instream and riparian); and the structure and function of the associated biotic communities would be assessed through the use of a resource classification system. The approach integrates resource-directed measures for protection (such as resource quality objectives) with source-directed measures (such as effluent standards).

CL TEOLO, ITALY
AB Concern over agricultural diffuse pollution sources in integrated water quality management has been growing recently. Such sources are likely to be even more critical in developing countries, including India; where agriculture and rural habitats are still dominant, unlike the G7 or other affluent industrialised nations. A number of special features of the Indian scene need to be considered. These include: (i) extremely varying rainfall and stream-flow patterns; (ii) still largely traditional agricultural practices with average application of fertilizers and pesticides and significant areas under dry farming or only marginal irrigation; (iii) a very large cattle population, with agriculture almost always linked with animal husbandry; (iv) a culture of living close to the river (if not in the river) with dominating instream uses of bathing, washing, cattle wading, waste disposal, etc. and large-scale floodplain farming; and (v) scant respect for rules, regulations and laws alongside an extremely weak law-enforcement machinery.
   The paper shows that in the non-monsoon (non-flood) periods, which may account for all but 2 months of a year, agricultural diffuse pollution sources seem to have no impact on stream water quality. During these periods flows are low to minimal and pollution is dominated by the in-stream uses, sullage waters of rural communities and point discharges from urban/industrial sources, if any. Pollution due to agricultural return waters, either as wash-off or as seepage, appears to be rare during the 8-10 fair weather months. However, surface wash-off of pollutants from agricultural sources becomes the dominant factor during flood flows, and seepage/drainage from agricultural fields/soils continues to pollute streams far a month or two after the monsoons are over.
   Application of chemical fertilizers and pesticides (or any other agricultural chemicals) in India is still low compared to developed countries, and while eutrophication due to high levels of washed-off nutrients is observed in rural ponds and other stagnant bodies of water receiving agricultural drainage, and excessive pesticide residuals are often reported for vegetables, fodder, milk, etc., monitoring of streams and rivers does not show any significant pollution due to nutrients or pesticides from agricultural diffuse pollution during fair weather months. High nitrate concentrations have been reported in groundwater and in many areas, such as Punjab and Haryana, these can often be linked directly to diffuse agricultural sources. The major problem of agricultural diffuse pollution appears to be the heavy silt loads, along with large quantities of dissolved salts, nutrients, organics and even heavy metals and bacterial contaminants washed off during floods. The silt tends to clog up the flow channel to further encourage seasonal floodplain agriculture. This results in a vicious circle, which degrades the channel. increases flood-damage and is undesirable from ecological and sustainability points of view. High concentrations of salts and nutrients encourage growth of weeds and macrophytes after the floods have passed. The presence of organics, heavy metals and bacterial contamination renders the streamwater unfit for in-stream use or abstraction.
   With the introduction of intensive agriculture and adoption of modern farming techniques involving the application of much irrigation water and agricultural chemicals, the problems caused by diffuse agricultural pollution are bound to grow. Routine pollution control methods of discharge permits (or consent letters), EIAs or environmental audits, and normal enforcement measures by regulatory agencies are not likely to work for control of such pollution. Using the example of a small river in central India, Paisuni (Mandakini), the paper brings out the nature of the problems, and suggests a possible management approach.

AB There is a growing pressure, both internationally and particularly in South Africa, to include people in a more democratic form of environmental management necessitating a more holistic and interdisciplinary approach. Within this context, the paper documents a case study of public participation in the regulation of marine waste disposal. This involves examining the social input, via a Social Impact Assessment, into the decision-making procedure for the issuing of permits for marine waste disposal via three marine pipelines along the south coast of KwaZulu-Natal in South Africa. The SIA was designed to elicit the substantive social issues and facilitate a process aimed at consensus-building among stakeholders. The SIA revealed that such processes, while lengthy and costly, can provide the basis for sustainable environmental management ii institutionalised mechanisms are set up through which the partnerships can be fostered and informed contributions made towards the environmental decision-making process.

AB Over the past two decades there have been a number of changes in Thailand, changes in the environment and quality of life for its people, changes in its communities and in the foundations of its economy. Before 1970, Thailand was a rural society in which local communities depended on the natural resources which surrounded them, and the national economy relied on the export of native crops. The sustainable use of resources was a fundamental aspect of rural life, people understood the interrelationships between the different components of their local environment and their activities which were defined by the need to protect their surrounding resources.
   Agriculture is the major profession and source of income for the rural poor. Land degradation and soil depletion result in low crop yields and pollution of the environment; soil erosion and landslides are found in Thailand. Nutrient uptake by crops and loss by leaching is much greater than the nutrients applied. Hence soils become less productive and it results in more land requirement far food production. Forest land declines rapidly in hilly watershed areas.
   Thailand is located in a tropical region and European countries are located in a temperate region. The climate is completely different, the temperature during summer in some European countries is probably almost the same as winter in Thailand. Not only is the climate in the two regions different, but land use and soil type are different also. These parameters have to be considered when studying the impact of agricultural diffuse pollution on the environment.
   Research studies on agricultural diffuse pollution in water resources in Thailand show that nutrient loads and pesticide residues still do not exceed the standard level. However, there was a trend showing the increase of N-NO3 in water resources, in short-term monitoring of nutrients in the east of Thailand between 1988-1990 and 1993-1995. The result showed the increase of N-NO3 from 1.60 ppm to 2.54 ppm in the same watershed and landuse areas. If the use of fertilizers and pesticides in agriculture is increased without due consideration, Thailand will face the same problem as European countries.

AB Best Management Practices (BMPs) in urban drainage have been promoted in Scotland for a number of years in response to the need to combat pollution arising from diffuse sources in urban areas. This has led to the construction of around one hundred BMP installations using both source and end of pipe control. These are principally in the East of Scotland, and the number is growing rapidly as education and knowledge increases.
   A programme of investigations into the factors which influence the performance of the systems commenced in 1997. A range of types of BMP are under study including both source control and end of pipe systems. The sites have been divided into groups for which different depths of investigation are being undertaken. The programme involves a number of parallel investigations requiring field studies, data reviews and enquiries to confirm applicability and performance in situ. Many of the factors which influence the selection, installation and operation of a particular system are social, legal and administrative in addition to those which relate to its design and construction. The different strands of the study have been developed to ensure that all influences are identified and evaluated. (C) 1999 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd on behalf of the IAWQ.

AB Brisbane Water has undertaken an investigation into low cost options to improve the removal of nitrogen and phosphorus for two of its wastewater treatment plants. Luggage Point Stage 2 (300,000 e.p.) is a conventional activated sludge plant designed for nitrification. Gibson Island (150,000 e.p.) is an extended aeration activated sludge plant designed for nitrogen removal to less than 10 mgTN/l. Extensive modelling and plant simulation were carried out to evaluate the potential of various modified operational modes before the most promising modes were trialed on the full scale plants. Operational trials are proceeding well and improved nitrogen removal to less than 3 mgTN/l for Gibson Island and to less than 10 mgTN/l for Luggage Point have been achieved. Improved phosphorus removal has also been achieved for periods at both plants (less than 4 mgTP/L for Luggage Point and less than 2.5 mgTP/l at Gibson Island). However, phosphorus removal has not been consistent and trials are ongoing to determine the sustainable level of phosphorus removal for these plants. The conclusion of the trials to date is that operational strategies can be implemented for these plants to effect the removal of substantial quantities of nitrogen and phosphorus for a minimum of capital cost. This paper presents the results of the various operational strategies that have been trialed and implemented for both plants. When considering the upgrading of a plant for improved nutrient removal, the principle of "Optimise What You Have First" can sometimes produce surprisingly high nutrient removal levels for a very modest capital expenditure.

AB Located near the Black Sea coast of Turkey, Lake Terkos is one of the six main drinking water reservoirs of Metropolitan Istanbul, providing 25% of the water demand. With very limited industrial activities and only 1% of its catchment area being devoted to settlements, it is a relatively less populated and comparatively less destroyed catchment of the metropolis, in contrast to other drinking water reservoirs of Istanbul, the water quality of Lake Terkos is still of overall second class, implying that it can be used as a safe drinking water resource following a conventional water treatment scheme. The most critical group of pollutants was determined to be nutrients, which somewhat exceed Class 2. Presently, phosphorous load is found to originate from point sources of domestic origin, whereas approximately half of the nitrogen load arises from forests and meadows. An appropriate management strategy, concentrating especially on the future population densities, land use and an effective protection practice is needed to maintain the sustainability of the lake as a drinking water resource.

A market focussed biosolids reuse/disposal strategy is a key element of the sustainable management of BNR biosolids. A methodology for preparing a biosolids management strategy is presented. BNR biosolids has a number of characteristics which affect biosolids management. These include: potential for nutrient release, dewaterability, and the need for biosolids stabilisation. Current practices for sludge handling and stabilisation in Australian BNR plants are also discussed. (C) 1999 IAWQ Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study uses an aquatic plant, Najas graminea Del., to treat man-made wastewater containing single and/or binary components of copper, lead, cadmium and nickel. Adsorption experiments demonstrate that the adsorption process correspond to the Lagergren kinetic model with the rare constant close to 0.01 min(-1); meanwhile, the equilibrium results corresponds to the Langmuir adsorption isotherm. Notably, the rate constants of metals are not significantly different between each other. Competitive effect on the adsorption kinetics of cadmium is insignificant with the background solute (lead) concentration up to 10 mg/l; while significant deviation observed with concentration of lead reached 100 mg/l. In addition the maximum adsorption density of cadmium is reduced by around 50% in the presence of 100 mg/l of lead. A simulated copper plating wastewater is also treated by Najas graminea Del, to demonstrate its efficiency in removing metals from wastewater with multi-cations/anions.

AB Although considerable effort is being expended to quantify the phenomena involved in source control and to produce guidelines for its application, there is still a lack of reliable, site-specific implementation methodologies. This study, using the multi-parameter handling capabilities of a geographical information system (IDRISI - GIS), aims to provide a methodological approach to source control implementation, taking into account both theoretical concepts and spatial characteristics of the implementation site. This is achieved by the creation of suitability maps for source control implementation using IDRISI-GIS and semi-hypothetical data from a case study catchment (Klisa in Novi-Sad, Yugoslavia). The existing drainage system and the receiving canals were introduced in the GIS, together with a digital terrain model, land use information and information on soil characteristics, connectivity to the system, and groundwater levels. Suitability maps were produced based on a theoretical criteria set created for the purposes of this research. The results indicate that GIS has a significant potential as a tool for site specific source control implementation, analysis and quantification, not only due to its inherent spatial information handling capabilities, but also due to its "human readability".

ID QUALITY; WATER
AB Eutrophication of environmental waters is a complex process characterised by nutrient enrichment leading to increased production of algae and higher plants. This can result in undesirable effects on the quality, biodiversity and sustainable uses of our waters, in conflict with the objectives of the Agency's Environmental Strategy. Assessment and control of eutrophication in the UK have proceeded in a somewhat piecemeal fashion to date, focusing mainly on certain localised problems, or on the implementation of EC Directives, notably those relating to the control of urban waste water and agricultural nitrate, which provide only partial solutions to problems. The Environment Agency of England and Wales is developing a strategy on eutrophication, aimed at delivering a more coordinated and integrated approach. Key components of the strategy will be those relating to management, communication and R&D. Making best use of the regulatory framework is an important feature of the initiative, but equally so is the need to promote a partnership approach to the management of eutrophication. The Agency's work will also contribute to the development of broader UK nutrient strategies. (C) 1999 IAWQ Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The Atlantis Water Resource Management Scheme uses artificial recharge of urban stormwater and treated wastewater to augment the natural groundwater resource. The key to the success of the scheme is the fractionation of the stormwater into components of distinctly different quality, and the separate treatment of domestic and industrial wastewater for different end-uses. The groundwater exploitation strategy is largely controlled by water quality requirements. Reuse of domestic and industrial wastewater depends on quality parameters. Tertiary treated domestic effluent is destined for indirect reuse via the aquifer, while treated industrial wastewater is used together with spent regenerant brine and stormwater from the noxious trade area for preventing seawater intrusion. Both residential and industrial stormwater is separated into the base flow and storm flow components and utilised for various purposes. The sustainable operation of the water resource scheme serves as a prototype for the optimal use of water and protection of the environment.

ID COMMUNICATION
AB This article uses a feminist poststructuralist framework to analyse and critique the way in which gendered power relations are produced and enacted in community participation processes through the discourses and ideologies in texts about these processes. I argue that these discourses and ideologies work to limit women's participation and marginalise or delegitimise the contribution of feminist theories. A preliminary framework for participation is developed, which draws on feminist methodologies, feminist poststructuralism and other feminisms, and emancipatory and action-oriented models of education, planning, and community development. This article aims to inform strategies to address the complex and contradictory issue of gendered power relations in participatory planning processes for sustainable development.

DT Article
AB This article explores the relationships between cattle ranching, landuse, deforestation, rural employment and biodiversity. If outlines a series of principles to initiate the transformation of the present system of cattle ranching into something more sustainable, less incompatible with biological diversity and more appropriate for human welfare. Although the analyses and the numbers are based on the Colombian case, they are typical of the situation in the Latin American tropics. The case of Colombia is perhaps extreme in all aspects and therefore particularly instructive. The enormous biological diversity, at risk from production systems, which are blamed for causing a concentration of landownership, inequalities, migration from the countryside to the cities, rural poverty and environmental degradation, demands imaginative and viable technological answers at all levels of production. But, in addition, in a country devastated by violence, the strategy for the environmental rehabilitation of cattle ranching must coincide with social reform. The article demonstrates, with examples, the application of each one of the principles for the transformation of the current cattle ranching system: abundant biomass and energy, diversity of plant species, intercropping, hedges, living fences and biological corridors, efficient use of manure, diversity of habitats, reduction in the use of pesticides and other toxic compounds and appropriate prairie management.
   These principles, and the examples outlined in the article, are applicable on any scale and in any environmental, social and cultural context, as long as the methodology is identified to incorporate the biological variables and economic parameters in an appropriate technological model.

TI Intensive pig farming and the environment in Mexico
SO WORLD ANIMAL REVIEW
LA Spanish
DT Article
AB Mexican pig farming has developed significantly in the last 25 years, although its basic characteristics have remained the same: a diversity of products, dependence on imports for foundation stock and feed, and the failure to internalize environmental costs. Environmental problems arise from the segregation of pig farming and agricultural activity, the existence of large pig concentrations at the regional and farm levels, the type of feeding systems used, the free supply and inefficient use of water and a shortage of trained personnel. Mexico has limited water resources and the heaviest pig concentrations are in regions where water is most scarce and polluted. A large number of farms have no waste treatment or recycling facilities and the country's environmental policy is based on prescriptive measures rather than economic incentives. In conclusion, any attempt to render pig production sustainable will be a medium-term undertaking at least, entailing changes in feeding systems, farm facilities and management techniques, together with human resource training and the establishment of interinstitutional and intersectoral environmental programmes tailored to the sector.

AB There is a growing acknowledgement that micro-credit programs have potential for equitable and sustainable development. However, my anthropological research on the micro-credit program of the Grameen Bank shows that bank workers are expected to increase disbursement of loans among their members and press for high recovery rates to earn profit necessary for economic viability of the institution. To ensure timely repayment in the loan centers bank workers and borrowing peers inflict an intense pressure on women clients. In the study community many borrowers maintain their regular repayment schedules through a process of loan recycling that considerably increases the debt-liability on the individual households, increases tension and frustration among household members, produces new forms of dominance over women and increases violence in society.

AB The assessment of environmental effects of livestock production systems assume a methodical strategy to analyze qualitative and quantitative effects of biological processes to the several media and the used resources. Important starting-points in reducing and minimizing environmental impact can be found by a process-integrated analysis and increasing efficiency of used materials and energy. Several methods (input/output-flows, analysing of material and energy streams, balances) are to be used and need a pool of specified data. Strategies for a sustainable discharge of the nitrogen cycle are:
   need-based nutrients supply of the animals
   conditioning of animal wastes
   fertilizer input strictly adapted to production level of plants
   recycling of sludge nutrients in land using systems
   Waste conditioning by litter ventilation in broiler houses for example is a simple method to reduce ammonia emission by 70%. Concerning the nitrogen efficiency of the whole production cycle for example in dairy cow livestock the influence of farm type and process engineering on the ammonia emission level per hectare is made clear.

ID AMMONIA EMISSION; DAIRY-COWS
AB For the system concept to be sustainable and successful, the requirements of animal welfare and environmental compatibility shall be integrated into it.
   In dairy farming, a major factor in ammonia emission is the flooring system. Solid floors can reduce ammonia emissions by approx. 50%. The surface should have a certain structure, however, as slipperiness of solid concrete surfaces can deteriorate the walking comfort of cows.
   Full automation of the milking process may give rise to questions as regards animal welfare, but the advantages of it are substantial. In case of temporarily keeping the animals inside, combined with grazing, the total emission of ammonia will increase.
   In pig farming, at the time, the point of action to bring the ammonia emission down is reducing the emitting floor area. Therefore, the main tendency is towards partially slatted floors with adequate inside climate control measures to prevent the floors from being fouled in the hotter seasons. Integrated solutions for the ammonia and odour emissions as well as the slurry product marketing problem are being developed.
   Animal welfare requirements in poultry farming have resulted in several littered housing systems. By means of aeration of litter and adequate litter management, the ammonia emission can be strongly reduced.
   It has to be concluded that there are adequate perspectives for sustainable animal husbandry systems for the future.

AB Scientific advances and the present methods of technology for food production, preservation, processing, transport and marketing are forcing rapid change, throughout the developing and marginal regions of the world. Only time will show whether the present pace of change will, on balance, have an overall positive or negative effect on the future state of affairs. This change should be managed to prevent devastating effects not only on traditional animal production but also on the environment as a whole allowing for a planned evolutionary process so that humans and the livestock and domestic animals they care for can adopt the new socio-economic conditions, they both must face. Livestock-related development projects are required to be efficient and economically sustainable, but also diversified, clean, of high biological added value, and integrated in a healthy, dynamic and renewed agricultural and environmental context. The need for a more multidisciplinary systemic research and wider choice of subjects is strongly recommended. On the topic of sustainable growth, without promoting less progressive approaches and uneconomical environmental policies, we run the risk today of overhastily accepting and applying new alternatives that might neglect the fundamental factors of adaptability and time; this could be a destructive experience for livestock production especially in marginal areas.

ID LAND MANAGEMENT; RAINFALL; RANGELANDS
AB In Australia, desertification tends to be associated with land degradation in the rangelands. It results from unsustainable land use and the impact of European settlement, rather than changing climate. Desertification can, however, be exacerbated or triggered by climate variability. Some of the degradation occurred in the early stages of pastoral development but the problem has continued. The extent of degradation has proved difficult to assess but survey results show it varies in severity across the country. Grazed rangelands have been most severely affected but the problem extends outside the pastoral zone due to the impact of feral animals and changed fire regimes, Biodiversity has also been affected with extinctions occurring among small and medium-sized mammals. Climate change scenarios suggest shifts in rainfall patterns but the major impact will come through increased variability. Substantial shifts in rainfall have occurred over the last 100 yr with wetter periods generating unrealistic expectations about land use and drier periods triggering land degradation. However, pastoral management is focused on short term climatic variability since this is what dominates both production and income. Policy responses require that the whole issue of sustainable land use be addressed rather than climate issues alone.

AB The Highly Migratory Species Management Division of the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) is responsible for managing 39 species of Atlantic sharks throughout their range in the US exclusive economic zones of the Atlantic Ocean, Gulf of Mexico, and Caribbean Sea. Through the implementation of a Fishery Management Plan, the US harvest of Atlantic shacks is regulated by commercial quotas and trip limits, recreational bag limits, fishery closures, prohibited species, prohibition of finning, and mandatory reporting requirements. While problems still exist in the US shark fishery, NMFS is conducting proactive management designed to help prevent overexploitation and ensure long-term sustainability of Atlantic shark resources.

AB Social network and genetic resources: the 'Thones et Marthod' sheep husbandry in Savoia. The management of local genetic resources implies the development of the possibilities. This requires that the producers be involved. However, they are not a homogeneous group and their goals vary greatly. The Thones and Marthod sheep husbandry, in Savoia (a French alpine area), is a good example. This hairy breed of sheep is very useful for range management, but its carcass has no value. Its survival can be explained by the local economy, as two-thirds of the Savoian peasants are part-time farmers. Such a pluriactivity allows these smallholders to keep a few ewes as currency. As well, some breeders rear flocks for commercial crossing and others have started dairy farming. This diversity has led the local association of sheep owners to consider the best way to organise and exchange. Thus, an adaptive, participatory research was launched to provide them with useful data. The demographic study of this endangered breed was completed by a sociological survey, as it is essential to understand the criteria and practices of the various producers. Although acting in distinctive ways, these farmers form a network that could be developed. Provided they would not be compelled to integrate a pyramidal system, they would be interested in improving ram exchanges through a kind of stud. It would be a very open system, each stock farmer will get the opportunity to become a breeder. It does not aim at a selection scheme but rather a social, organisational process which would allow the breeders to adapt the management of the breed in a sustainable way. Thus, the fact that these breeders reject integration does not necessarily mean they do not approve of partnership. (C) Inra/Elsevier, Paris

AB The development of interfacial reaction between matrix and reinforcement during the remelt recycling is critical to the commercialization and sustainable-development of metal matrix composite, but it is very difficult to characterize the interfacial reaction between the reinforcement and matrix melt above the liquids using a conventional experimental method. In this paper, the interfacial reaction characteristics in SiCp/Al composite above liquids were investigated using liquid metal X-ray diffraction and differential scanning calorimeter (DSC). A solute-rich region with much more Si content above liquids was observed in the composite melt, and the experimental results also showed that the interfacial reaction feature is associated with the solute-rich region with much more Si content. Mechanism for the observed phenomena was discussed in detail. (C) 1998 Published by Elsevier Science S.A. All rights reserved.

AB The annual production of deadwood available for harvesting by hand was determined from 28 permanent plots over three years for three protected areas along a rainfall gradient. Annual production varied considerably for individual plots, but the mean production per woody standing biomass was relatively constant from year to year at approximately 17 kg/ha/year per ton live biomass, or 1.7% per annum. Annual production of harvestable deadwood was related more to stand biomass than rainfall zone. The relative consistency of production rates has positive implications for sustainable use and harvesting strategies. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Increasingly, scientists are being called upon to assist in the development of indicators for monitoring ecosystem health. For human health indicators, they may draw on environmental exposure, human morbidity/mortality or well-being and sustainability approaches. To improve the rigour of indicators, we propose six scientific criteria for indicator selection: (1) data availability, suitability and representativeness (of populations), (2) indicator validity (face, construct, predictive and convergent) and reliability; (3) indicator responsiveness to change; (4) indicator desegregation capability (across personal and community characteristics); (5) indicator comparability (across populations and jurisdictions); and (6) indicator representativeness (across important dimensions of concern). We comment on our current capacity to adhere to such criteria with examples of measures of environmental exposure, human health and sustainability. We recognize the considerable work still required on documenting environment-human health relationships and on monitoring potential indicators in similar ways over time. Yet we argue that such work is essential in order for science to inform policy decisions which affect the health of ecosystems and human health. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This project investigates the concepts of industrial ecology and eco-industrial parks and applies those concepts to the redesign of an existing industrial park in Choctaw, OK. The opportunity for developing an eco-industrial park on this site comes from the availability of waste water for non-potable water needs, and the abundance of waste tires as raw materials for products to drive a new set of industrial partnerships. These industrial partnerships include the City of Choctaw Waste Water Treatment Plant, a tire shredding company, a tire pyrolysis company, a hydroponics industry, a hard rubber tire manufacturer, a screen printer, a plastics manufacturer, a toner manufacturer, and a toner cartridge manufacturer. The nature of this relationship and the design of the eco-industrial park is contained within this report. The result of this investigation is a new, common sense, approach to industrial land use that combines economic growth and environmental protection. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

TI Restoring nature in the city: Puget Sound experiences
SO LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING
LA English
DT Article
AB Restoring nature within American urban areas seems basic to sustainability both in theory (Hough, 1995) and in practice (Sustainable Seattle, 1993). In addition to applicable science, restoration of urban green areas requires two complementary efforts, (1) a plan or process to locate and to rank potential restoration sites and (2) an understanding of how restoration designs will be accepted, and therefore, maintained by nearby residents. The urban Puget Sound region of Washington state has a 10 year history of stream restoration to improve salmonid habitats. This discussion reports on two regional research studies, one dealing with planning (Liberty Bay), the other with restoration design (Urban Streams). The first project, Liberty Bay, studied the feasibility of combining existing physical and political/social data to locate and rank potential restoration sites using a geographic information system. The study area was a small (<4000 ha) urbanizing watershed surrounding a polluted shellfish bay. The Liberty Bay study demonstrate the feasibility and identified the limits of combining physical data with social and political information. The second study, Urban Streams, is an ongoing, multidisciplinary effort to evaluate the efficacy of regional urban stream restoration as to stream dynamics, biotic conditions and human responses. The human response past of the Urban Streams study has two components. One is to analyze visual preferences for stream restoration engineering techniques. Salisbury (1997) used photo-simulated images of a proposed design to survey preferences. Her results demonstrated that respondents could differentiate various restoration designs based on their visual texture trough to refined) and had clear preferences for the 'refined' scenes in this urban regional context. The other study direction is to identify and evaluate human behavior toward urban streams. Initial results of this effort show that the majority of observed behaviors toward urban streams is negative. This result is disconcerting given the fact that the Puget Sound region has a reputation for a high degree of environmental sensitivity. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Soil aggregation is one of the main factors controlling the chemical, physical, and biological processes that contribute to soil productivity and agricultural sustainability. Little is known about the relationship between dry-sieved aggregate size and aggregate stability. Temporal changes in the size and stability of dry-sieved aggregates were studied in a Thorp silt loam(US Taxonomy: fine-silty, mixed, mesic Argiaquic Argialboll; FAO Classification: Orthic Greyzems) in a long-term (1986-present) tillage experiment established in Urbana, IL, US. Tillage treatments included no-tillage (NT), disk/field cultivation (DT), and moldboard/chisel plow (MP) in which corn (Zea mays L.) and soybeans (Glycine max L.) were rotated annually. Soil samples were collected in 1995 before and after fall field operations and again before planting in 1996. The dry mean weight diameter (DMWD), wet mean weight diameter (WMWD), and wet aggregate stability (WAS) of surface soil (0-5 cm), and the WAS of dry-aggregate size classes were analyzed. Aggregate DMWD was greater in NT (8.8 mm) than in DT (7.1 mm) or MP (7.2 mm) soils. The DMWD increased regardless of tillage or crop from October (7.3 mm) to December (9.4 mm), and had decreased sharply by April (6.3 mm). Soil water content at the time of sampling did not significantly influence DMWD and WAS. Crop alone had no significant influence on soil aggregation but interacted with sampling time and tillage. Dry aggregate size, WMWD, and WAS were positively correlated. Aggregate size increased with soil organic carbon (SOC) and the large (8-25 mm) dry aggregates, which were most affected by tillage, were the most water stable. These findings suggest that large dry-sieved structural units function like true aggregates and should be studied further. (C) 1998 Published by Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.
